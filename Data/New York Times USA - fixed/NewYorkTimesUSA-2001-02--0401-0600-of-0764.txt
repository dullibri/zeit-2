HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Dell Computer to Cut Work Force by 4%

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
The softening market for personal computers finally struck home with Dell Computer's work force yesterday. The company said it would eliminate 1,700 jobs, or about 4 percent of its employees, in the first large-scale layoff in its 16-year history.
 Dell, based in Austin, Tex., attributed the cutbacks to a general deterioration of economic conditions and faltering demand for its mainstay, the desktop personal computer. Each of those was underlined yesterday in quarterly earnings from Dell and from Hewlett-Packard. 
 Despite selling 43 percent more computers than in the period a year earlier, Dell fell short of Wall Street's already lowered earnings expectations by a penny a share. The company also warned securities analysts to lower their expectations for the current quarter to 17 cents a share from 19 cents.
Hewlett-Packard met analysts' reduced profit forecasts in its fiscal first quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, but reported that revenue increased only 2 percent, to $11.9 billion. It said it did not "count on" seeing double-digit revenue growth any time this year.
"This was clearly a tough quarter for us," Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, told analysts in a conference call, "one that saw a rapid slowdown in the U.S. economy and increasingly cautious spending among consumers and enterprise customers."
Over the last several years, Dell has rapidly increased the size of its work force to keep up with booming demand for its personal computers. The company, which sells directly to customers, is the No. 2 producer of PC's in the world, and many analysts expect it to overtake the market leader, Compaq Computer, during the first half of this year.
Until yesterday, Dell had managed to weather the changing conditions without cutting jobs, as Hewlett-Packard and Gateway did last month. But rumors of impending layoffs had swirled for weeks, although estimates varied widely.
Dell, which had 40,200 employees at the end of January, said that most of the jobs to be eliminated would come from administration, marketing and product support functions in offices in central Texas. The company said many of those jobs became unnecessary after corporate reorganizations, and other cuts resulted from lower growth expectations.
"We don't plan for any other across-the-board layoffs into next year," said Kevin Rollins, a Dell vice chairman.
Robert Cihra, an analyst with ING Barings in New York, said Dell is one of the most efficient high-technology companies. If Dell needs to cut its work force, he said, then the entire sector is suffering.
"I think it's reflective of overall technology demands," he said, "that virtually every company, no matter who they are, is tightening their belts."
Dell shares rose nearly 9 percent after the announcement of the layoffs, closing at $25, a gain of $2.06. In after-hours trading, the shares dropped as low as $23.23.
After the markets closed, Dell announced its earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Feb. 2. Excluding one-time charges, income came to $508 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with 16 cents a share in the corresponding period a year before. Wall Street had expected 19 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
Revenue reached $8.7 billion, up 28 percent, year on year.
Taking note of slowing demand, Dell had sharply reduced prices on its machines, enabling it to quadruple the industry average for the number of personal computers shipped last quarter. The company said that it gained market share, but that gross profit margins suffered. Dell's margins fell to 18 percent from 21 percent, which Mr. Cihra said was the company's lowest in five years. Dell, saying it would not have gained market share without the price cuts, announced its intention to continue the aggressive pricing. 
Hewlett-Packard, which sells a much wider range of products than Dell, was hurt twice by the decline in the PC market. Robert P. Wayman, the company's chief financial officer, said it sees little growth in PC sales in the United States, though it expects better performance in international markets.
In addition, the company's printer and imaging business is closely tied to PC sales. Revenue there was basically flat, Hewlett-Packard said. 
"We have obviously been through a giant change in the economic environment, which we're obviously a part of," Mr. Wayman said in an interview. "Who knows what the second half will bring?"
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported quarterly earnings, excluding special charges, of $727 million, or 37 cents a share, down 12 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Revenue grew to $11.9 billion from $11.6 billion, a gain of more than 2 percent.
Hewlett-Packard also announced its earnings after the markets closed. In the regular session, its shares gained $1.96, or 5.7 percent, to $36.35. After hours, they traded as low as $34.
Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the earnings left little encouragement for a short-term rise in the stock price.
"There really wasn't any pop, or anything encouraging for investors to hang their hat on," Mr. Sacconaghi said.
Hewlett-Packard took $537 million in charges in the quarter, the largest in years as it changed its accounting method. Hewlett-Packard excluded $365 million for investments in young companies, $102 million for layoff costs, $44 million for costs related to the acquisition of Bluestone Software, and $26 million for amortization of good will. Including these charges, earnings were 17 cents a share.
The company pointed to a bright spot. Mr. Wayman, the chief financial officer, said revenue in Europe and the United States improved moderately in January after a very weak December.
"They are seeing a sequential uptake in January," said Andrew J. Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. "This is the first time we've heard anything like that. That may have broader positive implications."

HEADLINE: A Mill Closes, and a Hamlet Fades to Black 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: NEWTON FALLS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
An aching stillness has settled over this company town. All that can be heard now are the whispers of the Adirondack winds spinning whirls of snow in empty streets.
 The sprawling Newton Falls paper mill has gone quiet, like some comatose Gulliver, and so has Lilliput. There are no more shift changes, which means no more cars rumbling down County Road 60 to the mill, which means no more paper trimmers and millwrights seeking fortifying rounds of pizza and beer at the Newton Falls Hotel, the only other business in this remote hamlet. 
 Newton Falls, where 125 people were working at the mill as recently as October, is neither the first nor the last community in New York's North Country to be rocked by rising energy costs, growing foreign competition and the other cold calculations of the pulp-and-paper market. In January alone, 192 people lost their jobs when the Lyons Falls Pulp and Paper mill, the second largest employer in adjacent Lewis County, shut down, while in nearby Jefferson County, the Deferiet Paper Company laid off 115 people. 
But since October -- after a last-ditch effort to save the mill fell through -- Newton Falls has edged closer to becoming a case study of doleful rural sociology: a dying town, where the few people left give mournful testament to having their community wind down like an untended clock, ticking inexorably toward a final tock.
Newton Falls has 100 residents, maybe. It is sending fewer and fewer children to the local schools. It is in a distant corner of St. Lawrence County, a three-hour drive northwest from Albany and a solid hour's drive from the nearest major highway. Many of its company-built, nearly identical houses are worth next to nothing; a few are abandoned.
Even its history -- a century of baptisms and wakes, of seeing soldiers off to war and mourning those who did not return -- merits only a paragraph or two in the slim volume of area history.
The institutional memory of what happened here is generally left to the old-timers, who followed their parents down toward the 200-foot smokestack looming over the town, and whose sons and daughters did the same. They alone seem to remember that the firehouse used to be a bowling alley that sponsored co-ed leagues, or that a movie theater used to operate next to the post office, just behind the bulletin board now decorated with a notice for employment opportunities in the Army.
It is also left to Jean Burrows, the owner of the century-old Newton Falls Hotel, who collects local lore as partial payment for the beer she places on her uneven bar counter. She is in the Newton Falls predicament as thick as anybody. Five years ago she sold the hotel in preparation for retirement, only to take it over again in 1999 because she could not bear to see it falling to ruin. 
Two weeks after Ms. Burrows returned, and with her life savings now sunk in a creaking edifice of odd charm, the mill's owner announced the first round of layoffs.
"I kind of lost my breath for a while," Ms. Burrows said.
One of her steady customers is Donald Pomerville, a Newton Falls native who worked 40 of his 69 years in the mill. After a quick morning game of euchre with Ms. Burrows and a couple of other regulars in the bar, he swirled the contents of the amber beer bottle in his beefy right hand -- the one with all the fingers intact -- while collecting his thoughts about his hometown.
"If that mill shuts down, this is going to be a ghost town," he said finally.
The story of Newton Falls is sorrowfully familiar. In 1894, James Newton built a sawmill that later became a paper mill. People looking for work traveled across the western foothills of the Adirondack Mountains and, somewhere around Cranberry Lake and Star Lake, turned onto a dirt path that became County Road 60.
By 1925, a county census shows, there were more than 800 residents in Newton Falls: immigrants from Canada and Poland; sons and daughters from surrounding farms; laborers, carpenters, river drivers, housewives, hotel waitresses. 
One of those listed as a calenderman, tending the rollers that gave gloss to paper, was John Reil, who had come from a nearby farm to work at the mill. A couple of years after that census was taken, he and his Canadian-born wife, Blanche, had a son named Amos, who went on to attend the Newton Falls schools, serve in the Army at the end of World War II and put in 46 years at the mill.
"You knew everybody and everybody knew you," said Amos Reil, white-haired now and retired, but nevertheless wearing a blue work shirt and blue work pants. "And everyone got along fairly decently."
There is not much recorded about Newton Falls in its heyday. All that the St. Lawrence County Historical Society has are a handful of old, self-congratulatory company brochures and a few photographs of shirtless, men toiling around rolls of paper.
In the 1950's, the mill sold many of the homes it had built to its workers, and renovated the hotel. In the new Pine Room the executives sat around a long table and ruminated over the state of Newton Falls, while in the wood-paneled dining room and bar, the workers alternately questioned and celebrated life.
With each change of ownership of the mill over the last 30 years, there came the sense that some small, indefinable part of Newton Falls had been lost. The A.&P. burned down, never to be rebuilt. The barbershop closed, and so did the bowling alley. 
The mill ground on, through the eras of McGraw-Hill, Stora Kopparberg and Appleton Coated L.L.C. of Kimberly, Wis., which spent millions of dollars upgrading the plant so that it could produce the glossy paper used in magazines and annual reports.
But in October 1999, Appleton announced that it was laying off about half its work force, and would either be selling or shutting down the mill in the near future."They made it clear," recalled Edmund J. Russell, the county director of economic development. "Given a certain amount of time, they weren't going to be around anymore."
The adjoining towns of Fine (population 1,837) and Clifton (population 948), which includes Newton Falls, chose to fight rather than quit, and to do more than simply tie yellow ribbons around trees. There were meetings held, consultants hired, plans developed, committees formed. One concentrated on fostering cultural art; another painted houses and buildings, including the front of the Newton Falls Hotel.
Then, last August, Empire Paper Group L.L.C. announced that it would buy the plant; it vowed to retain the 125 employees and to hire 100 more. Suddenly, the woeful story of another mill shutdown seemed to take a surprising and uplifting turn.
Behind the scenes, though, the potential buyers were struggling to raise the money, even with the generous incentive package offered by the Empire State Development Corporation and the St. Lawrence County Industrial Development Agency. 
On Oct. 23, Appleton issued a statement thanking employees for their patience and announcing that it had closed the mill as of 6 that morning. As for the post office and volunteer fire department that were housed in Appleton-owned buildings, a company spokesman, David Oskin, said, "We're continuing to allow those to be operated."
The announcement took the community's breath away. Without the mill, the largest employers were in Star Lake: the school district, with its shrinking student body, and the struggling local hospital -- the smallest in the state, with 20 beds and an average of two patients a day.
"That tells you a lot," said Raymond Meier, the state senator for the area.
Amy Tulip, a nurse at the hospital who lives in a cozy yellow house along County Road 60, said the deal's collapse devastated her more than her own husband's layoff from the mill a year earlier. Dread was enveloping the hamlet she had grown up in, she said. "It was just changing, and it wouldn't go back."
Her exhausted husband, John Tulip, sat slumped in a chair beside her. He is studying to be a radiological technician now, but that means a 124-mile round-trip commute every day. He is also a town councilman, but he had no inside information to ease her mind. "There's nothing," he said. "No rumors, no nothing."
Now, on these snowy nights, about the only light at the mill emanates from a small booth at the gate, where a young sentry eats potato chips while standing guard over a deserted hulk. Every now and then word spreads that an unfamiliar car has barreled down to the mill, and that some out-of-towner has signed the visitor's book. But state and county officials say that so far nothing has come of occasional discussions with the curious.
People here know that soon Appleton will either remove or sell off the equipment inside. When that happens, the mill will be just another collection of empty, haunting buildings, like those eerie remnants of the old Jones & Laughlin ironworks down the road.
As if to stay one step ahead of such ghosts, some former millworkers are learning new trades at schools in Canton and Saranac Lake. More than a few will probably move away. Others already have; one of Amos Reil's sons has taken a job in Wisconsin.
They leave behind a 200-foot smokestack, the Newton Falls Hotel, a few other buildings, and the likes of Donald Pomerville. Before reluctantly agreeing to have his photograph taken at the hotel, the old mill hand let this be known: "I ain't going to smile."

HEADLINE: Judge's Ruling Is Victory For Law Firm's Reputation 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
A federal judge has rejected charges that Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, the nation's most prominent law firm representing plaintiffs in securities class-action cases, made misrepresentations to lay claim to control of litigation against Oxford Health Plans Inc.
 The case has highlighted friction among plaintiff firms over the role of lead counsel in securities cases -- an assignment that includes the power to decide how legal fees are distributed in successful litigation. It also has focused attention on claims by defense lawyers that plaintiff firms sometimes exaggerate the damage done to their clients. 
 The ruling last week by Judge Charles L. Brieant of the Federal District Court in White Plains was an important victory for Milberg Weiss, based in New York, which has been the subject of unflattering reports in the legal and business press about its tactics. 
Last fall, Fortune reported that one partner quit after complaining about the business dealings of William Lerach, who pioneered the firm's securities class-action practice. Legal publications reported last month that Milberg Weiss was turning its attention to patent litigation, in part because of growing competition for shareholder suits.
Melvyn I. Weiss, senior partner, said the firm had been subjected to "a hatchet job" by the media and that supposed worries about competition were "nonsense."
"The number of cases out there, the size of the cases is just exploding, and that means you need more and more lawyers to handle the cases," he said. "It's not necessarily that competition is making inroads."
Mr. Weiss said that the firm had hired 25 new lawyers in the last 18 months and made 17 new partners in the last two years. With a total of 170 lawyers, other firms' lawyers said, Milberg Weiss is almost certainly the biggest plaintiff firm in the securities class-action arena.
In the Oxford case, Sullivan & Cromwell, Oxford's lawyers, argued that two individual plaintiffs selected by Milberg Weiss were unfit to represent a class of shareholders claiming to have been defrauded by the company. The defense firm said the plaintiffs concealed the fact that one of the proposed class representatives had turned a profit from trading Oxford securities and that the other lost only $315,000, not the $2.3 million originally claimed.
The plaintiffs "submitted to this court calculations of their purported 'losses' that bore no relationship to 'economic reality,' " Oxford's lawyers said. The plaintiffs' lawsuit contends that officers and directors of Oxford concealed material information about the company's revenue, earnings and performance, ultimately causing its shares to plummet in late 1997 when accurate financial information became public.
Judge Brieant rejected the defense lawyers' objections, ruling that the two Milberg Weiss clients had suffered losses.
Making similar objections, a rival New York plaintiff firm, Abbey Gardy, sought to be named as lead counsel, but Judge Brieant denied that request. A lawyer for Abbey Gardy did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
Whatever the state of competition among the plaintiff bar, Milberg Weiss is certainly busy. The firm filed 149, or 73 percent, of the 204 shareholder class-action suits brought last year, according to Woodruff-Sawyer & Company, an insurance broker specializing in liability policies for corporate directors and officers. For the last five years, Milberg Weiss has filed more than half of all shareholder class-action cases, according to Woodruff-Sawyer, even as the number of cases filed has increased. 
Statistics like that do not disclose anything about how much money the firm is taking in, but they do explain why Milberg Weiss has been a lightning rod for politicians' criticisms of plaintiff lawyers and the object of its rivals' jealousy.
But class-action securities litigation has changed in recent years, largely because of a 1995 law making the size of a plaintiff's purported loss -- not just being first to the courthouse -- the key to determining who would be the lead plaintiff, and hence which firm would be lead counsel.
This has meant new competition from law firms with big institutional clients that can easily show substantial losses from securities trading because of their large holdings.
Before 1995, Milberg Weiss focused on filing suits for individual plaintiffs. With the new law, defense lawyers say it sought to aggregate claims from a number of plaintiffs, in an effort to show larger losses. 
But courts have frowned on that approach, and now Milberg Weiss says that it is seeking institutional clients, too. 
Indeed, to the surprise of defense lawyers who figured big investors would not want to be associated with the firm, it recently has picked up a few such clients, Mr. Weiss said, including the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers. 
In addition, Mr. Weiss said, to woo potential clients the firm has "set up a team to educate the institutional investors as to who we are and what we really do." 
The firm is also taking on highly visible cases that do not involve suspected securities fraud. In additionto the move into patent law, the firm earlier this week said, for example, that it was representing the Connecticut State Medical Society in litigation against six large health maintenance organization, charging that patients were harmed by denial of care.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Again Lower; A Fed Bank Is Less Gloomy 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Import prices fell for a second consecutive month in January as the cost of oil and industrial supplies continued to decline, the government said yesterday.
 Separate reports showed that industrial activity in the mid-Atlantic region shrank for a third month in February, while initial jobless claims in the last week dropped more than expected. 
 The Labor Department said import prices fell 0.4 percent in January after declining 0.8 percent in December. Analysts had expected a 0.1 percent gain. 
In the same period, the cost of imported oil declined 5 percent after a 10.8 percent drop in December. Excluding energy, import prices rose 0.3 percent, compared with 0.9 percent in December.
Economists said any inflationary pressures remained solidly under control and in any case were not the focus of the Federal Reserve, which is bent on staving off recession with rate cuts.
"The Fed's really reacting to growth," said Brian Jones of Salomon Smith Barney. "If you want to look at inflation numbers, the game's not on that channel. You're on the wrong station."
Export prices rose by an unremarkable 0.2 percent in January after falling 0.1 percent in December.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's business outlook survey underscored weakness in manufacturing, which, along with tame prices, left the door open for more interest rate cuts.
Yet the Philadelphia Fed said the outlook for the months ahead had improved. Its index improved to minus 30.5 from minus 36.8 in January. But that still suggested contraction, and the reading was lower than the minus 24.0 many Wall Street economists had expected.
The bank cautioned that the improvement, which followed a nearly 33-point drop the month before, was still at a level that "strongly suggests overall declines in the manufacturing sector."
Employment declines were less severe than the previous month, but the average workweek shortened.
In a third report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits fell to 352,000 in the week that ended Saturday from a revised 363,000 the previous week.
But analysts noted that the four-week moving average, considered a more reliable barometer of labor trends, rose to 345,000 from 333,000 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Waco Pins Its Hopes for Image on Bush Ranch 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: WACO, Tex., Feb. 9 

 BODY:
Several hours into Day 1 of the 51-day standoff between federal law enforcement officers and the Branch Davidians, Sammy Citrano decided the officers must be hungry. He loaded his truck with hot coffee and beef fajitas, drove outside town to the siege site, and soon he was feeding guys carrying machine guns. He admits now that he was terrified.
 That was on Feb. 28, 1993. Flash forward eight years. Mr. Citrano, owner of George's restaurant, is again delivering food outside town, this time about 30 miles away, in Crawford, at the ranch owned by President Bush. He fed Sam Donaldson breakfast. Barbara Walters complimented his coconut cream pie. This time, the guys with guns are Secret Service agents. 
 "I'd much rather do what I'm doing now than what I was doing back then," Mr. Citrano said. 
Around here, he is not the only one. Mention Waco and most people think of a national psychodrama instead of a city. This public relations image, of course, comes from the standoff that ended with the deaths of David Koresh and about 80 Branch Davidians, an episode that came to be known by a single word: Waco. (It is not pronounced Wacko, despite the jokes.)
Now, Wacoans believe they have a perfect chance to show the world that their city is actually, yes, a normal place. President Bush has said he may regularly visit his Texas ranch, meaning that the White House press corps will bunk in Waco, the nearest city. This captive audience of so many pens and cameras already has Waco image makers plotting their city's rehabilitation.
"We have learned from 1993," said Steve Smith, a vice president with the Waco Chamber of Commerce. "We were thrust into a situation we weren't prepared for. Now we have a chance to be prepared. There are parts of Waco the media never saw. They went straight from their hotel rooms to the siege site."
 Mr. Bush is making his first visit to the ranch as president this weekend. 
In Waco, a countywide task force is preparing for the media juggernaut, not to mention the Secret Service and the rest of the presidential entourage. There are potential perils. Waco may feel misunderstood and misrepresented, but the White House press corps are not known for their sensitivity. A wag once described Waco as "one tall building surrounded by Baptists." The White House press corps could be described as pit bulls surrounding the president. 
Mr. Smith, a member of the task force, realizes that trust and affection take time in any courtship. He eventually envisions barge parties on the Brazos River in which media types can mingle with locals. Or maybe trips to sporting events at Baylor University or tours of any of the 14 local museums. 
But for now, he is worried about the basics. The city is preparing a media kit listing restaurants, local attractions and other services. A "concierge" is being posted at the local airport for anyone in need of directions. And, importantly, Mr. Smith knows the way to any journalistic heart is with late-night room service, all-night pharmacies and same-day dry cleaners, and he is trying to make arrangements. 
"These people coming to Waco may already have a preconceived perception," he said. "It may take a few trips before we can make inroads."
The scars to the civic psyche are still fresh from 1993. Like nearly everyone else, Mr. Citrano watched the initial gunfight on television, stunned at the violence and bewildered by the Branch Davidians. He had never heard of them. His impromptu food run to the scene turned into a daily ritual as he became the designated caterer to the siege. He still has a letter of appreciation from the Department of Treasury. 
"They say it put Waco on the map, but it was for a bad reason," Mr. Citrano said. "It was Waco, wacko. There were jokes on David Letterman." 
What they painfully discovered was that their city had become synonymous with violent religious extremism and karmic weirdness. People here felt unfairly stigmatized and about as blindsided as when a 1953 tornado ripped through downtown, leaving little except the 22-story Alico Building.
Their frustrations were compounded because the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel compound was outside the city limits, about 10 miles east in Elk, and few locals had ever heard of them. 
"I've been to conferences and when I've gone up and said I'm from Waco, I get this kind of snickering," said Dr. Mairi C. Rennie, director of the Armstrong Browning Library at Baylor, a leading research archive dedicated to the English poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. "It's kind of a laughingstock." 
Nearly everyone in town can tell a similar story. Elizabeth A. Taylor, who began her job as the city's director of tourism the day after the standoff began, said Waco has not suffered economically or lost any conventions because of the stigma. But as someone in the business of persuading tourists and conventioneers to spend time here, Ms. Taylor concedes the episode has prompted some "challenging conversations."
"We've coached the staff to take the confrontational stuff," she said, noting that Waco enjoyed 1.6 million "person trips" last year for conventions, for sports at Baylor and for tourist spots, such as the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame & Museum and the Dr Pepper Museum (the soft drink was created here).
The inevitable question is, of course, what kind of a place is Waco. The dominant presence here is Baylor University, a Baptist institution. For years, Baylor was known for prohibiting dancing on campus, a policy that has been rescinded. Children who grow up here are often told that the city of 110,000 people has the most churches per capita of anywhere in the country, an arguable point but a reminder of the area's religious passion. 
Don Howard, a filmmaker who lectures at the University of Texas in Austin, grew up here, attended college at Baylor and then fled to Austin where he remains as a Waco expatriate. Mr. Howard says the Davidian episode struck such a nerve because it exposed Waco's small-town insecurity over how it is perceived and "gives lie to their pretensions of culture." He considers the four "guiding principles" of Waco culture to be race, religion, death and football. 
But Mr. Howard admitted that his hometown surprised him when he returned to film "Letter from Waco," his 1997 memoir that aired on PBS. He said he discovered the city's wild history -- that it once had legalized prostitution, that Elvis Presley spent his 21st birthday here. He said he found people whose lives gave lie to his perceptions of Waco. One woman he filmed was the only white person to attend a black Baptist church. He also featured the quiet, modest driver of a high school football team bus who, once prodded to talk, turned out to be a football hero in his own right.
"You have all of these very rigid patterns set up, and yet with all that, you have people crossing lines," Mr. Howard said. "It was almost through the back door that I learned what a great place it was." 
It seems unlikely that the White House press corps will make time to ride the bus with the high school football team. But city officials are already planning to showcase other attractions, like Waco's symphony, its opera and fishing lakes. Reporters may not have enough time to cover the president. 
"They all know that this is a time to show our best wares, to do whatever we've got to do to show the good side of Waco," said Mr. Citrano, who added of the press, "If they're happy, they are going to be nicer to the president." 
One footnote: Patricia Ward Wallace, a professor of history at Baylor, noted that the media caused a stir in Waco in the 1890's. A muckraking journalist, William Cowper Brand, started a newspaper, The Iconoclast, whose principle target was Baylor University. He was kidnapped by angry Baylor students and saved from hanging only by the intervention of faculty members. Finally, one Baylor supporter had had too much of the free will of the press and shot Mr. Brand dead on the city's main street, Austin Avenue, though Mr. Brand was able to kill his attacker as well.
"We look to history for lessons," said Professor Wallace, telling the story with a smile. White House correspondents beware.

An article yesterday about efforts to improve the image of Waco, Tex., misspelled the surname of a journalist in the 1890's who criticized the city's major university, Baylor. He was William Cowper Brann, not Brand.

HEADLINE: Critics Seek To Overturn Abortion Rule 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of lawmakers mounted a drive in the House and Senate today to overturn the new Bush administration policy on international family planning assistance, which they argue is counterproductive and cruel.
 At issue is an order President Bush signed on his third day in office, reimposing the "Mexico City policy" of the administrations of the elder President Bush and Ronald Reagan. That policy bans federal aid to organizations that use their own money to perform or "actively promote" abortions, whether through counseling, public information campaigns or lobbying to legalize abortions. 
 An array of legislators argued today that the policy would hamstring many clinics that are critical to women's health services abroad, potentially resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and more unsafe abortions. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said the rule presented family planning groups "with a dangerous choice."
"If you want to participate in U.S. programs," Ms. Lowey said, "you have to withhold vital information from patients. You have to sacrifice your right to free speech. And you have to stop providing legal health services with your own, non-U.S. funds."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, argued that the rule was particularly harsh because the clinics affected were often the only source of medical care for women in a large area. There is, she said, nowhere else to go if the one local clinic must abide by the Mexico City policy (named for the 1984 population conference where the Reagan administration announced it).
"It is ethically wrong and it is morally wrong," Ms. Johnson said.
The legislation introduced today has 50 sponsors in the House, including 6 Republicans, Ms. Lowey said. It has 15 sponsors in the Senate, including Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and 4 other Republicans. Senator Snowe, in a statement, described the Bush policy as "confounding to me," arguing that strong family planning programs reduced the number of abortions.
Sponsors said they were more optimistic about their chances in the Senate than in the House, but acknowledged it would be a struggle. Abortion opponents said they were confident they could hold the line. They said there was not enough support in the House and even if there were, President Bush would veto it.
The United States Agency for International Development issued a bulletin today on the requirements for groups seeking aid; $425 million in family planning money became available under the new rules.
A spokeswoman for the agency said the bulletin essentially restated the previous policy. But, she added, it tries to clarify that clinics are not prohibited from treating women who are ill from legal or illegal abortions obtained elsewhere.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and a sponsor of the bill, said today, "Well, isn't that compassionate?"
The development agency has said it expects most groups to abide by the rules.
A group of anti-abortion members of Congress hailed the policy today, saying that it was wrong to use "taxpayer money to push abortion in third world countries," in the words of Representative Joseph R. Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania.
Advocates of family planning said today that the policy bans what groups can do with their own money, constituting a significant restriction in political freedoms that would not be allowed in the United States.

HEADLINE: Nortel Plans to Cut 10,000 Jobs as It Lowers Earnings Outlook 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Sharply cutting its projections for both sales and profits, Nortel Networks, the Canadian maker of communications equipment, said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 10,000 jobs, adding to the toll that a slowing economy in the United States is taking on the communications industry. 
 The announcement, which came after the stock market closed, stunned investors, who pushed shares in Nortel down as much as 29 percent, to $21, in after-hours trading. The stock rose 20 cents, to $29.75, in the regular trading session. 
 "This is a significant warning from a company that was a highflier until recently," said John Waterman, managing director of Rittenhouse Financial Services, an investment firm in Philadelphia. "If Nortel isn't immune to a gloomier situation, then that's a bad indicator." 
Nortel said it expected sales to grow only 15 percent this year, down from an already lowered estimate of 30 percent. The company also forecast that earnings per share from operations would rise 10 percent for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 30 percent. 
The company cited slower-than-expected sales in the United States as the main reason for its reduced expectations. And indeed, the communications industry in the United States, appears to be worse than most analysts suspected. Financing for small companies has become scarce and revenue from relatively new business lines, like Internet traffic, has not climbed as fast as hoped. 
It is the first few months of 2001 that look particularly grim for Nortel. Instead of earning 16 cents a share from operations in the first quarter, as analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated, Nortel expects to lose 4 cents a share. Instead of $8.1 billion of revenue in the quarter, Nortel expects $6.3 billion. 
"Our customers are being very judicious with every penny they spend," said John Roth, chief executive of Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario.
Yesterday's announcement was a reversal from the projections Nortel was making a month ago, when revenue growth of 34 percent in the fourth quarter made it seem like it was exempt from the troubles facing competitors like Lucent Technologies. 
Now, with its plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs, Nortel is catching up to Lucent, which announced an equal number of reductions last month. 
It was unclear yesterday exactly where and in what divisions Nortel's ax would fall. The company expects most of the cuts to be in its slower-growing businesses, like circuit switching, said Nortel's chief operating officer, Clarence J. Chandran. Nortel has 94,500 employees around the world.
Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., notified 1,700 employees yesterday that their jobs would be eliminated and said that it planned to cut 2,500 more positions by the end of March. Lucent expects to reduce its staff by another 3,000 through normal attrition over the next two months. 
Outside the United States, Lucent is eliminating an additional 1,000 jobs by April. It is also cutting 1,000 contract positions in the United States, said Kathleen M. Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for the company.
Because Nortel is considered something of a bellwether in the communications industry, the optimism seen in the market before yesterday's announcement could be short-lived. 
In the regular trading session yesterday, shares in makers of communications equipment had climbed after the Ciena Corporation, a maker of fiber optic equipment, raised sales estimates for the second time in three months.
"This is seriously bad news," said Tom Lauria, an analyst at ING Barings. "Just like Ciena's news lifted competitors, a shocker like this could reverberate throughout the sector."
In after-hours trading yesterday, the fallout from Nortel's announcement hurt shares in other companies. Shares in Cisco Systems, the largest maker of Internet equipment, fell $2.44, to $28.38, Juniper Networks, a rival of Cisco's, declined $5.19, to $46.50. And Ciena, the second-largest maker of fiber optic cable after Nortel, shed $3.75 to $85.25.

HEADLINE: Redeploy the Dollars 

BYLINE:  By Cindy Williams; Cindy Williams, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is editor of "Holding the Line: U.S. Defense Alternatives for the Early 21st Century."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
One of President Bush's campaign promises was a top-to-bottom review of American military strategy, missions, forces and weapons. His will not be the first sweeping review of the Pentagon's post-cold-war plans. Similar reviews in 1991, 1993 and 1997 all set out to restructure the military -- and all failed. They did result in smaller forces and reductions in major weapons purchases. Yet the forces and weapons themselves changed surprisingly little. Across the services and within them, the structure of our military is virtually the same as during the cold war.
 Mr. Bush's review could be different. Donald Rumsfeld, the new secretary of defense, has named Andrew W. Marshall to lead it. Mr. Marshall, who started his career at the Rand Corporation in 1949, was one of the fathers of American nuclear strategy. 
 One of the nation's first cold warriors, Mr. Marshall was also one of the last. As late as 1988, a commission he headed concluded that the Soviet Union would remain America's principal military competitor for at least another 20 years. But once the Soviet Union's demise was no longer in doubt, Mr. Marshall became a tenacious advocate of fundamental change, deeply critical of cold war forces and systems that he found no longer solved the nation's military problems -- for example, Army units too large and too heavy to deploy quickly to hot spots. His strategic viewpoint, his independence and his commitment to change will make it possible for him to establish a blueprint for our armed forces that finally comes to terms with the end of the cold war.
Neither the first Bush administration nor the Clinton administration dared break with the tradition of slicing the defense budget into unchanging shares for each of the military departments. From the end of the Vietnam War until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Army claimed 29 percent of spending, the Department of the Navy (including the Navy and the Marine Corps) 37 percent, and the Air Force 34 percent. Those shares remain essentially unchanged today; at most, 1 percent of the defense budget has migrated from one service to another since 1990. Indeed, much of what passed for military strategy in the reviews of the last decade looks more like a rationale, invented after the fact, for equal defense reductions across the services -- reductions that failed to reshape the forces in any fundamental way.
Adhering to the same budget pattern year after year makes it easier to avoid open warfare within the Pentagon. But it ignores the enormous political and military shifts around the globe, and the technologies that should have sparked a change in the relative utility of ground, air, naval and amphibious forces. By clinging to the cold war budget agreement, two administrations have perpetuated a business-as-usual attitude that, to put it mildly, discourages innovation.
In a major defense policy speech before his election, President Bush called for matching the military's budget priorities to a strategic vision, not the other way around. He proposed allocating the military's weapons budgets to "the services that prove most effective in developing new programs." The president's proposal means making the services compete for defense dollars -- letting one service win some ground and another lose it in the battle for the budget. This idea should extend to choices about military missions and force structure as well as weapons.
Competition to create incentives for military innovation is consistent with a fundamental tenet of the Bush administration: that competition is good for America. It's time for the administration to view our tax dollars as "strategic vouchers" that will go to the service that comes up with the most creative and cost-effective solutions to the problems our military will face in the future.
Mr. Marshall's strategic review can make the difference between a military that was shaped by the cold war and one that can handle the needs of the future. Of course, changing the way dollars flow across the services will not be easy. Pentagon insiders say the service chiefs hope to continue to divide the pie as in the past. To counter this budgetary nonaggression pact, President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld will have to build a coalition of their own with members of Congress who favor a modern military or have other priorities for projected surpluses. They may even have to fire a few people who disagree.
Mr. Bush must be willing to use up real political capital to push his ideas through. But the result will reward the effort. The nation deserves a fundamental break from military spending practices that for decades have allocated money across the services only for the sake of peace inside the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: Democrats See a Party Adrift As Presidential Loss Sinks In 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Democrats didn't think it could get any worse than Florida. They were wrong.
 Now they are even more distressed, discouraged and depressed than they were on that fateful day in December when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of George W. Bush. 
 Many prominent Democrats are furious at Bill Clinton, who they hoped would lead the Democrats out of the debris of the 2000 election, for how he left the White House. His pardon of Marc Rich, the fugitive commodities trader, and his departure with tens of thousands of dollars worth of household gifts from wealthy donors have even inflamed stalwart allies. (The Clintons later returned some gifts and agreed to reimburse the donors for others.) 
"It's terrible, devastating, and it's rather appalling," William M. Daley, who was Mr. Clinton's commerce secretary before he became chairman of the Gore campaign, said of the former president. "Bush ran on bringing dignity back," Mr. Daley said, "and I think the actions by Clinton of the last couple of weeks are giving him a pretty good platform."
The despair among dozens of leading Democrats interviewed over the past 10 days extends well beyond the latest Clinton imbroglios. Many are angry at Al Gore for not winning the White House.
Even the top Democrat in the House, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, sounded dismayed at the way Mr. Gore ran his campaign, saying it contributed to the party's failure to recapture the House last year -- a source of great consternation among Congressional Democrats.
"In retrospect, if we had a little wind at the top of the ticket, it would have helped some of those close races," said Mr. Gephardt, who steadfastly backed Mr. Gore in the campaign.
"I'm not blaming it on the Gore campaign, but that is a fact of life," Mr. Gephardt said. He cited Congressional races in which "our candidate lost by a little but ran ahead of Gore -- just needed a little wind and didn't get it."
Democrats said they felt all the more leaderless because of the lingering strains between Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, which have been heightened by the controversies over gifts and pardons.
"We haven't emerged with a strong, singular voice, but that's coming," Michael D. McCurry, a former Clinton press secretary, said.
"I get asked by audiences, 'Why didn't the Gore campaign use Clinton more?' " Mr. McCurry said. "And you hear the flip side: 'Why didn't Clinton go under the radar?' "
Explaining the intensified disenchantment, he said: "Because of the long count, there was this self-delusional sense that maybe we were still around. Now that Bush has taken office and settled in, you see the reality of the shift of power -- and the self-flagellation."
Representative Mark Udall of Colorado said of the tensions between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore: "If you can't resolve them, and those feelings are intensified because people don't let them die away, that's not healthy. They're both strong-willed men, but they care deeply about the party."
Democrats are also stewing over the fact that, despite all the promises, their party did not win back the House.
"Nobody's blaming anybody," Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York said, "but we want to know why. People just want to know what happened."
The election last year, Representative Slaughter said, "was our best shot" at taking back the House. "We had all that money, and extraordinarily good candidates."
Democrats are also frustrated because they no longer have the platform of the White House from which to press their agenda.
"We are only beginning to fully appreciate the magnitude of the loss in terms of our ability to articulate a message throughout the country," said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader. "It is the biggest megaphone there is, and President Clinton used it very ably.
"Not having the Oval Office. Not having the Rose Garden. Not having the O.M.B. Not having Cabinet officials. They are all considerable losses," Senator Daschle, of South Dakota, said. "We're trying to do the best we can."
Democrats are bitter that the man they do not think belongs in the White House, President Bush, has had an unusually smooth debut. They worry that the party has not figured out how to position itself against him, and they fear that partywide ennui will cause contributors to sit on their wallets.
"People in the fund-raising community who are ideologically driven are very disappointed," said Carter Eskew, Mr. Gore's chief strategist last year. "They think the Democrats have essentially rolled over and are letting Bush have his way. They don't believe Democrats have a real strategy for taking the guy on."
Such concerns surfaced in dozens of interviews. Democrats around the country said the loss of the White House was finally sinking in and that the adjustment had been harder -- and more dispiriting -- than they had expected. At every level, they said, they were adrift. And many said they were at a loss to figure how to recover.
Yet for all their worries, many Democrats argued that the politicians and the public were adjusting to the post-election world and that it was far too early for Democrats to panic. There is plenty of time, many said, for Republicans to stumble -- and for Democrats to right themselves.
Many Democrats on Capitol Hill pointed to the unusually close relationship between Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt as a vital asset that would help the party define itself.
Terry McAuliffe, the new national party chairman, gave a pep talk to Senate Democrats today and said later in an interview that he believed the party could "use the energy out of Florida in a positive way to keep our base energized."
And, Mr. McAuliffe said, if the past was any indication, the glum talk would eventually dissipate.
"In 1995, Newt Gingrich and his buddies came in, and everybody said that the Democratic Party was dead," he said. "We came back and won seats in '96. We won seats in '98. And we won seats -- as well as the presidency -- in 2000," Mr. McAuliffe said, refusing to concede that Mr. Gore lost.
Some Democrats suggested that Mr. McAuliffe himself was part of the problem. They said that one reason Mr. Clinton and his woes were not about to fade was that Mr. McAuliffe was Mr. Clinton's hand-picked choice to head the Democratic Party. Mr. McAuliffe himself might well become embroiled in the investigation of the Rich pardon because of his role as fund-raiser for the Clinton Library. Mr. Rich's former wife, Denise, pledged $450,000 to the library and federal prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into whether her contributions affected Mr. Clinton's decision to pardon Mr. Rich. Mr. Clinton has denied any wrongdoing.
In the interview today, Mr. McAuliffe declined to discuss Mr. Clinton, whom he has called his best friend. 
"I'm talking about the future," Mr. McAuliffe said.
Norman Brownstein, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser in Denver, said there was a perception that Mr. McAuliffe's service as chairman "complicated" things for the party. "But," Mr. Brownstein said, "I'm not sure that's the case. Once this dies down, Terry's probably going to be very, very capable."
Mr. Brownstein seemed more worried about Mr. Clinton, saying, "Any time there's controversy like this it's going to adversely affect somebody's ability to help with fund-raising."
But some Democrats even argued that the fallout from Mr. Clinton's messy exit could be the party's best hope. They said Republicans would so overplay their investigations that it would trigger a backlash and energize rank-and-file Democrats.
Others were not so hopeful, or forgiving. Paul Goldman, a former chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party, called on Congressional Democrats today to censure Mr. Clinton for pardoning Mr. Rich.
While the harsh publicity could cool demand for Mr. Clinton on the lecture circuit and did mar Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's debut as a Democratic star on Capitol Hill, some Democrats argued that the controversy made the former president an even more compelling figure.
"If they're doing a fund-raiser and the guest of honor is some senator or the guest of honor is Bill Clinton, I've got to believe you want to hear Bill Clinton," said Alan J. Blinken, a longtime party fund-raiser. "The guy is just fascinating and interesting to hear. There's a lot of show biz in the process, obviously."
Many lawmakers were less concerned about Mr. Clinton's capacity to raise money than about the prospect that the Republicans' control of Congress would give the party a colossal financial advantage.
"This is a very difficult time for Democrats," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who was first elected in 1974. "We felt we won the election, yet our candidate wasn't allowed to become president. We had hoped to take back the House, and we find ourselves still in the minority. And special-interest money will be attracted to the Republican side in greater magnitude than ever before because they're in power."
Representative Udall said fears about the Republicans' financial advantage were "part of what underlies the anger right now" among House Democrats.
Mr. Gephardt sounded less distressed than many Democrats in his caucus.
"I don't fully share the view that the party is on its back and suffered a horrible defeat," he said. "I'm not saying we had an exhilarating victory. But in essence the election was a tie. And if the economy keeps going, I think we deserve some credit for putting it in the right place. If it doesn't, I think Bush will bear the brunt of the burden."
Yet for all the hand-wringing over Mr. Clinton, some Democrats still seem more bitter about Mr. Gore.
"Look," Mr. Waxman said, "I believe that in this last election if Clinton had been our nominee, we would have won."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico to Open Talks On Freer Migration for Workers 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
After they meet on Friday, President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico are expected to announce the start of high-level discussions aimed at addressing the web of immigration issues that have long bedeviled relations between the neighboring nations.
 American officials said that an "immigration working group" would discuss a range of proposals including Mexican goals to open the border to a freer flow of Mexican guest workers and to grant legal residency to hundreds of thousands of undocumented Mexicans now working in the United States. 
 The formation of the group, to be led by Mexican and American cabinet members, signals the importance of immigration issues to the newly inaugurated administrations on both sides of the border. American officials said it demonstrates that the Bush administration views immigration not only as a domestic issue, but as a concern best addressed by both countries.
"We are compelled to take a deeper look at the whole question of migration," the United States ambassador to Mexico, Jeffrey Davidow, said in an interview. "There's going to be an interesting debate about amnesty" and the guest-worker programs, he said. 
The meeting on Friday will be Mr. Fox's fourth meeting with President Bush, but their first encounter as presidents. The two men met previously, when Mr. Bush was governor of Texas. 
The setting for their latest encounter will be Mr. Fox's ranch in his home state of Guanajuato, which ranks fourth among Mexican states in the number of people who migrate to the United States each year.
The Mexican foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda, said that immigration issues would be the focus of Mr. Fox's agenda during the meeting. Among the Mexican government's goals, Mr. Castaneda said, is an easing of United States law enforcement efforts along the border that have forced Mexican immigrants to try to cross through isolated desert areas where they die by the hundreds each year from exposure to the heat or cold.
He said that the Fox government is "closely monitoring" talks among members of Congress and immigrant advocates over granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants already living in the United States. Some 3 million of the 8.5 million Mexican-born people in the United States are living there without any legal residency status. 
And Mr. Castaneda said that Mexican Foreign Ministry officials have been involved with discussions of proposals to reform United States guest-worker programs so that more Mexicans would be permitted to seek jobs on American farms.
"We think that the broad immigration and labor agenda includes humane, civil and adequate treatment for Mexicans: Mexicans here, going there; Mexicans as they cross the border; Mexicans when they start work and Mexicans who have already been in the United States for a long time," Mr. Castaneda said.
"The best way to ensure this is for them to have papers," he said. "There is no better way for Mexicans to defend themselves than for them to be legal."
Mr. Castaneda acknowledged that carrying out and enforcing many of the proposals would depend almost entirely on the will of the United States government. But he said that Mexico would be more vigilant in monitoring the enforcement of immigrant protections and more involved in efforts to set new policies for the benefit of Mexican immigrants in the United States.
"Every country, by definition has the prerogative to enforce its own laws inside its own territory," Mr. Castaneda said. "But the fact is that a large number, about half perhaps, of the people in the United States without papers are Mexicans. This is something that concerns us, and we think it is something that is legitimately on the negotiating table."
In a briefing on Wednesday, a senior Bush administration official said that the United States government was eager to hear Mr. Fox's ideas on immigration issues. The official stressed that high-ranking officials would be assigned to address both nations' concerns.
President Bush, in an address today at the State Department, reiterated his pledge to work with America's neighbors to build a hemisphere of "freedom and prosperity."
"Some look at the south and see problems," Mr. Bush said, referring to Mexico. "Not me. I look south and see opportunities and potential."
Immigration issues have been a priority for the Mexican government since Mr. Fox won the presidency last summer from the Institutional Revolutionary Party after 70 years in power. The Mexican president has pressed the United States to begin opening the border to more Mexican workers in the same way that it has been opened to goods and services under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
He has walked along border crossings from Ciudad Juarez to Nuevo Laredo, to shake the hands of immigrants and hail them as Mexican heroes. And he has expressed outrage at the violence that Mexican immigrants have endured from United States Border Patrol agents and ranchers in Arizona.
Aides to the Mexican president said that when he talks about the problems and trends of immigration, he rarely refers to government studies. Instead, Mr. Fox draws from the lives of the families around his ranch.
"This is not a guy who has to study about immigration," Mr. Castaneda said, referring to President Fox. "This is a guy who comes from a state that has been sending migrants to the United States for 100 years."
An estimated 150,000 undocumented Mexican immigrants enter the United States each year. Their labor -- in Florida orange groves, Georgia onion fields, Las Vegas hotels and Oregon nurseries -- has fueled growth in many parts of the American economy. And remittances from Mexican immigrants -- between $6 billion and $8 billion a year -- is Mexico's third largest source of foreign revenue, behind oil and tourism.
Aides to President Bush and President Fox said that their meeting was aimed mainly at building a personal rapport and would not produce new agreements. The two are expected to be together for about seven hours, including a half-hour visit by Mr. Bush to President Fox's mother, Mercedes Quesada.
Other than immigration, the presidents are expected to discuss a range of issues including drug trafficking, possible energy agreements and ways to resolve water disputes. Relations with Cuba and Washington's military aid to Colombia are also likely to come up, aides said.
In the last few days, the two leaders have received dozens of letters from advocacy groups urging that the governments consider human rights and family needs when setting immigration policy. And on Wednesday, a panel of immigration experts from both sides called on the two presidents to negotiate new ways to manage the border.
The United States-Mexico Migration Panel was led by Andres Rozental, former deputy foreign minister of Mexico, and by Mack McLarty, who was a special envoy to Latin America for former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Rozental said, "The U.S. and Mexican governments have never wanted to sit down and say, 'Here is the reality of immigration.' Instead they have let it grow into the chaos that it is."
In recent months, there has been increasing support among both Republican and Democrats in Congress for measures that would increase the numbers of Mexicans granted temporary agricultural work visas each year. One proposal, forged by a Democratic Congressman from California and a Republican from Oregon, has won the support of labor leaders and several American grower associations.
Rep. Howard L. Berman, an architect of the proposal, said that it would increase the numbers of guest workers from around 40,000 last year to some 150,000 in five years. The proposal would also allow migrants with a certain number of years of agricultural service to apply for legal residency. And the proposal calls for granting legal residency to undocumented agricultural workers already employed on American farms.
A proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas also seeks to increase the number of guest workers. However, he has said that the proposal does not allow the migrant workers to apply for residency, nor does it call for any amnesty.
In a briefing on Wednesday, a Bush administration official said that the president had expressed interest in the various guest-worker proposals. 
However, the official said, President Bush has said that he did not believe that amnesty agreements were the best way to address abuses against illegal immigrants.
"While the president does not believe that amnesty is the only means by which humane treatment and the status of migrants can be addressed," the official said, "I can assure you that we believe that the issues of migration are going to be an ongoing discussion between the two countries.
"I can assure you that it's going to be addressed at a sufficiently high level that they can make some real progress on this."

HEADLINE: Threat of Vouchers Motivates Schools to Improve, Study Says 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
A new study of Florida's efforts to turn around failing schools has found that the threat that children would receive vouchers to attend private schools spurred the worst performing schools to make significant academic strides. 
 The study, sponsored by the state, was conducted by Jay P. Greene of the Manhattan Institute, a pro-voucher research group based in Manhattan. The study promptly came under fire from opponents of vouchers, with some saying that it was the state's failing grade of the schools rather than the threat of vouchers that motivated the schools to improve. Some independent researchers said it was far too early to tell much from the Florida initiative. 
 While Dr. Greene's methods have been questioned, the stakes nevertheless are high. Gov. Jeb Bush's educational program in Florida has been held up as a model for its combination of aggressive testing of schools' performance, backed by taxpayer-financed vouchers, which his brother President Bush is proposing for the nation as a whole.
The study by Dr. Greene found that 76 public schools that had received failing scores on the state achievement test once, and would have lost children to private schools if they failed a second time, all improved enough to remove themselves from the failing list in the course of the second year.
The gains, Dr. Greene said, were greater for schools receiving an F on the state's ranking scale than for those receiving a D, a grade that also indicated poor performance, but did not carry the threat of vouchers.
"The most obvious explanation for these findings is that an accountability system with vouchers as the sanction for repeated failure really motivates schools to improve," Dr. Greene wrote. "It appears as if Florida schools that foresee the imminent challenge of having to compete for their students take the necessary steps to retain their students and stave off that competition."
Some independent researchers questioned whether it was too early to make a conclusive statement about the impact of vouchers. "The program is still in its infancy, and I fully believe that it takes awhile, several years at least, before you can look back and look at the early effects of the program," said David Figlio, an economist at the University of Florida who is studying vouchers. Professor Figlio and Cecelia Rouse, of Princeton University's School of Public Policy, are collecting base line data for a study of the Florida program over several years.
Professor Rouse said that "the real challenge in all of this is to understand is it really the test scores or is it something else" setting off the improvement.
Three years ago, Governor Bush embarked on an educational overhaul in Florida, which relied upon annual testing of students and the first statewide voucher program based not on income, but school performance.
Under the Florida plan, schools are graded by the share of the student body passing state reading, writing and math exams, with students at schools that fail in two out of four years eligible to receive private school vouchers. In March, the Florida Supreme Court ruled vouchers unconstitutional, but the governor is appealing.
President Bush has insisted that spending on education be driven by research demonstrating the effectiveness of particular policies or programs. He has held up Texas, his home state, as a model of how schools can improve, although there, vouchers are not part of the equation. 
Today, House Republicans embraced the study, and set out for Florida where they will hold hearings Friday on President Bush's educational proposal.
Dr. Greene's methods came under fire from the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, an opponent of vouchers. Michael Pons, a policy analyst at the union, complained that the study "excludes any other potential explanations for the results except for vouchers, cheating and chance."
Mr. Pons said, "Our view is that the school improvements, the efforts that were made in those schools, made the difference, not the vouchers."

HEADLINE: It's Not Just AT&T: How Telecom Became a Black Hole 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THOSE whom the Wall Street gods would destroy, they first make glamorous.
 The continuing descent of AT&T, not to mention its hapless Lucent Technologies spinoff, is only the most obvious example of the telecom malaise. Two years ago it was a "Field of Dreams" industry that believed "if you build it, they will come." Now it is more reminiscent of the old Groucho Marx television show, "You Bet Your Life," in which virtually every contestant lost. 
 In Europe, France Telecom sold a stake in its wireless unit, Orange, for a fraction of the price it hoped to get, only to have the stock plunge in public trading. British Telecommunications is under pressure to cancel a similar offering of its wireless unit, and Deutsche Telekom's stock is falling because of its pending purchase of VoiceStream Wireless, an American company with growing losses.
Nortel Networks says business is so bad it will lose money on operations in the current quarter, and plans layoffs. AT&T changed the terms of its reorganization in a way that will give its shareholders less and itself an extra $3 billion it can use to pay down debt. Lucent's credit rating is so low that it cannot sell commercial paper, leaving it at the mercy of its banks for continued financing. If you bought AT&T stock in September 1996, just before it spun off Lucent, and held on to all the securities, you outperformed the stock market for a couple of years. Now the profits are gone.
What went wrong? It wasn't just bad strategy at AT&T, or accounting irregularities at Lucent. There was just too much capital investment. Whether in wireless systems, new local exchange carriers or fiber optic networks, opportunities seemed limitless, and new entrants multiplied. Growth in the Internet and in wireless traffic would surely justify any capacity increase, and those who hesitated would miss out. Equity and junk bond buyers were eager to invest.
The big existing players needed strategies to compete. Equipment makers found they had to offer financing to customers. Large telephone companies, whether AT&T or France Telecom, went on acquisition binges, pushing up the values of the small companies being bought and creating mountains of debt that now haunt them.
Now there is too much capacity in many areas, and yet there is a continued need for investment to complete already started projects and to build the wireless systems for which companies paid billions in license fees to governments -- who may be the only winners when this is all over.
Capital markets are no longer friendly, as France Telecom found this week. The bond rating agencies are lowering ratings of big companies because they cannot sell assets for the expected prices. Price competition is rampant in many areas, which is good news for customers but not for the providers or their creditors. Demand is growing, but not rapidly enough to keep up with supply.
Weaker companies, meanwhile, are failing. "Piece by piece, they are starting to default up the chain," said Charles Clough of Clough Capital, a money management firm. The big companies that sold equipment have some customers who can't pay and others who are trying to raise cash by selling used equipment they can't afford to keep.
Eventually, there will be growth to absorb the excess capacity. But that will take years, not months. The financial markets have still not fully discounted the pain to come, and neither have the rosy economic forecasts that assume the economic slowdown will be a brief one.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Stall Bankruptcy Bill 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Democrats have blocked a Republican effort to rush through the Senate a bill that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system and make it far more difficult for people to wipe out their debts. The action was an early test of their influence in a Senate split 50-50. 
 The bill is championed by the banking industry but has been criticized by consumer groups as disastrous for low-income workers who will lose their jobs if the economy continues to soften. It is moving toward quick passage in the Republican-controlled House. 
 In the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats rejected a Republican effort to move the bill to the Senate floor this week and make it the first major legislation to reach President Bush's desk. The White House has signaled that the president will probably sign the bill.
The legislation is virtually identical to a bill that President Bill Clinton vetoed last December, arguing that it would hurt struggling debtors.
The move by Democrats to amend the bill and delay its passage has offered evidence of new strains in the parties' power-sharing arrangement in the Senate, and it has angered Republicans, who argue that there is no need to hold up a vote, because the legislation was debated last year.
"We certainly hope that this obstructionism by the Democrats doesn't continue throughout the year," said Jeanne Lopatto, a spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee's Republicans.
The bill would disqualify many debtors from filing for what is known as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which allows them to wipe out credit card debts and other unsecured loans, and force them into Chapter 13, which requires some repayment.
The banking and credit card industries, which boast some of the best-connected lobbyists on Capitol Hill, have argued that bankruptcy laws need to be rewritten to end abuses of the system by people who should be able to repay some of their debts.
"Reforming the bankruptcy system will help usher in a new era of greater personal responsibility," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and an author of the bill.
Opponents, including consumer advocates and some economists and bankruptcy lawyers, say the bill does nothing to end abuses by banks and credit card companies that flood the mail with solicitations for easy, high-interest credit; nor would it close loopholes that have allowed some people to use their homes to shield millions of dollars in assets from their creditors.
The critics also say the bill is poorly timed, because it might take effect in the middle of an economic downturn that may force many people to consider bankruptcy for the first time, even though they have been responsible with their credit. 
"Those who use bankruptcy are the most vulnerable of the American middle class," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who is leading efforts to amend the bill to make it less onerous on debtors. "We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of middle-income Americans."
The number of personal bankruptcies in the United States grew to a peak of 1.40 million in 1998 from 718,000 in 1990, according to court records. But in each of the last two years, the number has dropped; it fell to 1.26 million last year.
"The current numbers show that, to the extent there ever was a bankruptcy crisis, the crisis ended in 1998," said Lawrence M. Ausubel, an economist at the University of Maryland. 
Banks, credit card companies and retailers warn, however, that the downturn may be short-lived, and that the overall growth in bankruptcies is forcing up the cost of credit. 
"The reason we're pushing this bill is because there are higher-income debtors who can afford to pay some of their debts but choose to walk away and declare Chapter 7," said Catherine Pulley of the American Bankers Association. 
In arguing for the need for an overhaul, banking lobbyists and lawmakers have preferred to focus on abuses of the system by high-income debtors, especially those who protect their assets through the purchase of an expensive home that can be withheld from creditors under the law's homesteading exemption.
A bipartisan amendment being offered in the Judiciary Committee would place a $100,000 cap on the value of a home that can be shielded from creditors. But many Republicans, especially in the House, have argued that individual states should decide how much of a home's value should be protected.

HEADLINE: By the Book: Individuality Vs. Franchising; 
Trading Spark of Creativity For the Safety of Numbers

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: BELLINGHAM, Mass. 

 BODY:
Stephen Gurwitz is proud that his Hilltop Farms convenience store has long been a fixture here in this small town on the Rhode Island border.
 His grandfather, Milton Gurwitz, opened the little roadside building in 1955 as a place to sell milk and eggs from his farm. His father, Gary Gurwitz, expanded the store and added a deli counter. Mr. Gurwitz began working there as a boy and took business classes knowing that he would take over the family business someday. 
 Four years ago, he converted half the store to a Subway fast food franchise. 
Mr. Gurwitz, 32, said he felt no shame at trading in the old deli counter for a nationally promoted name and formulaic sandwiches that taste the same as their Subway counterparts around the world.
"For every independent convenience store that goes out of business, three chain stores open up," he explained. "The ones that close down are the ones that don't keep up with the times." 
Franchising should attract even more converts if the economy weakens further. Middle managers looking to strike out on their own often consider buying a franchise, with its tried-and-theoretically-true sales system, a safer bet when outside investors and venture capital are scarce.
But with that streamlined business plan comes the trade-off: a loss of individuality, regionalism and business creativity. In his new book "Fast Food Nation," Eric Schlosser asserts that McDonald's, the nation's largest franchise company, has homogenized not only its own restaurants, but whole swaths of the American economy, including the meat and potato industries.
"What we find with franchises is that the original creator of the franchise actually had a new idea, was actually quite dynamic and risk taking," Mr. Schlosser said. "But in order to expand the franchise he has to impose total conformity on the franchisees."
By the 1970's, when franchises became a widespread and powerful economic phenomenon, names like McDonald's and Dairy Queen were already synonymous with hamburgers and ice cream. But while fast food is still the single largest category, hundreds of lesser-known franchises that sell everything from printing services to baby clothes have emerged as well.
There are now even business-to-business franchises, which sell services like accounting, Web page design and manufacturing to other small businesses, many of them franchises themselves.
"It's a whole new story," said Don DeBolt, the president of the International Franchise Association in Washington, who estimates that the number of franchise locations in the United States has grown about 25 percent in the last decade. There are now about 320,000 franchises representing 1,200 to 1,500 companies in this country. And that growth is a result of franchises delivering what Americans want, he said.
"Today's sophisticated consumers more and more want their expectations realized on a consistent basis," Mr. DeBolt said. "Their expectations include the taste and the flavor but also the quality and price, and a brand name delivers that."
The basic relationship has not changed. Entrepreneurs looking for a "just add money" recipe still put their savings into building, buying or leasing a storefront and paying a start-up fee to the franchise headquarters. (Fees vary among companies; for example, Mr. Gurwitz paid $10,000 for use of the Subway name.)
Franchisees then pay royalties, sometimes as a flat fee but usually as a percentage of sales, to company headquarters. If royalties are tied into sales revenues, and the revenues do not meet company requirements, the franchiser can push the franchisee out of the business. In return for the fees, franchise operators receive training, advice and advertising for the brand name. Franchisees are responsible for employee salaries, taxes and tailoring the business to the needs of the local clientele.
For Mr. Gurwitz, joining Subway was a welcome respite from the myriad decisions he has to make in running the convenience store, which he co-owns with his father.
"They give you the operations manual, which is as thick as the New York City telephone book, and it tells you within a millimeter how thick to slice the onions," said Mr. Gurwitz, who spent two weeks at the Subway training center in Milford, Conn. "If you have a question about anything, you'll find it in the operations manual."
Indeed, Mr. Gurwitz discovered that many issues were no longer his sole responsibility. "Someone stubs his toe in the store, you call the Subway legal department," he said. "How many convenience stores have a legal department?"
Research and development, pricing and menus -- all are handled for him. By contrast, he said, "With the convenience store, I'm everything." 
The Subway brand also brings name recognition. Mr. Gurwitz credits it with increasing the traffic in his store about 1,000 customers a week -- roughly a 10 percent gain -- more than making up for the 11.5 percent of revenues from the sandwich operation he pays to headquarters. 
It seems enticing, but Susan P. Kezios learned to be wary of such a deal. In the 80's, she put all her money into a franchise operation of VR Business Brokers in Chicago Heights, Ill. "Two guys had already lost their money at that same location," she said. 
While she managed to keep the doors open, she struggled with what she calls "the flaws in the system." They began with the contract, which usually imposes an iron-clad form with no exceptions for a franchisee's particular needs.
"These franchise contracts are often legal works of art with franchiser attorneys determining every possible scenario during the entire length of time you'll own the franchise, to the franchiser's benefit -- not yours," she said. 
When the contract comes up for renewal, the terms often change. "If they were taking a 5 percent royalty, they might change it to 8 percent," she said. 
Ms. Kezios, who in 1993 founded the American Franchisee Association, an advocacy group in Chicago, said that franchising is no place for the "ignorant or naive." Some franchisers force their licensees to purchase from certain vendors at inflated prices, for example. They can open franchise units close by, intensifying competition. Franchisees often find it difficult to sell their businesses if they want out, or to open another business in the same industry because of "noncompete" agreements. 
Ms. Kezios counsels prospective franchisees to hire a lawyer experienced in representing franchise owners to look over the contract. She advises them to go with smaller, younger chains that need new business. 
"There is a higher probability that a smaller franchise chain will be willing to negotiate its franchise agreement with you, should you dislike some of the one-sidedness of the provisions," Ms. Kezios said. 
"The 'big boys' won't change a punctuation mark for you." 
While Mr. Gurwitz, who owned the property he needed, had minimal start-up costs, the initial investment for most fast-food franchises is $100,000 to $250,000, not including real estate costs. 
Royalties can be a burden when a franchisee is struggling toward profitability in the first few years. 
Still, many prospective entrepreneurs consider owning a franchise better than being a manager at someone else's company. And when the commodity for sale is an assembly-line product -- like paper shredders, makeup or cars -- much of the uniqueness is already forfeit.
James Marcotte, for example, has made a lot of money for other franchisees in his lifetime. He virtually grew up in the rental car business, working at Budget through high school and college. Starting as a car washer there, he became the director of United States car and truck operations in 1992, before a headhunter lured him to a competitor, Thrifty Car Rental, which hired him to travel around the country evaluating the franchise's businesses. 
But being an executive was not enough. Eventually, he made a bid for Thrifty's franchise at Logan Airport in Boston, which was not turning a profit. "I was tired of making money for other people," he said, "and wanted to make money for myself and reap the rewards of my hard work and experience in the industry."
Thrifty provided the financing under its Bootstrap Program, which lends start-up capital to experienced prospects. "At a decent rate," Mr. Marcotte added. 
As he sat in his office nestled in a vast parking lot of cars, Mr. Marcotte, 37, had the Thrifty Operating Manual II -- another "everything you wanted to know" compendium -- within reach. 
Some things, however, are not in the book. Through his own initiative, he put a Thrifty booth in the airport terminal (the location was off-site), doubled the size of his car fleet, and checked up on competitors' prices four times a day. 
He saw that to make the airport location less dependent on weekday business travelers, he needed some suburban locations to bring in extra rentals. Since taking over the airport location, Mr. Marcotte has opened three other franchises in the Boston area, with two more in the works. This time, he had to borrow the financing, about $50,000 for each location, from a bank. 
He will send more than $1 million to Thrifty this year. But his own salary, about $180,000, is almost twice the amount he was earning as an executive. 
All part of his own plan, not Thrifty's. To get ahead, he said, "You've got to take action for yourself." 
Yet franchising, says Mr. Schlosser, the author, is not about being distinctive. 
"There are certain instances in which individual franchisees come up with ideas that the home office is willing to listen to and to take, like Ronald McDonald and the Filet-O-Fish sandwich," he said. "But if you look at the big disputes between the franchisee and the franchiser, those disputes are invariably over franchisees unhappy with the direction that the main company is taking, whether it's their ad campaigns or their suppliers they have to buy from."
Although Subway allowed Mr. Gurwitz to stray from the standard menu by offering Willow Tree Farms chicken salad, a popular local brand, he has few other opportunities to personalize the business. Still, he said, that is all the sovereignty he needs. 
"If you're a free-spirited person and want to do it your own way," he advised, "you don't buy a franchise."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Dreary Reports On Layoffs And Earnings Afflict Markets

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors were served up another unappetizing plate of earnings and economic news yesterday and left the table in a hurry.
 Nortel Networks and Dell Computer scaled back earnings forecasts after the market closed Thursday. Both companies also announced layoffs, as the economic slowdown of the last eight months shows no immediate sign of ending. Consumer confidence fell, factory production declined and, at the same time, producer prices of finished goods jumped a startling 1.1 percent in January. 
 All this left investors with a bitter taste and less hope that the news on the economy and corporate earnings would be more palatable in the near future.
Some analysts said the surprising surge in producer prices might make the Federal Reserve less eager to cut interest rates. Others disagreed, saying the price jump was an aberration and falling consumer confidence was more worrisome to Fed policy makers.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index plunged 5 percent, and is down 1.8 percent for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.9 percent, and is off 1.4 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8 percent and is up only 0.1 percent in 2001.
Douglas R. Cliggott, the chief investment strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said he did not expect things to get better soon. He said corporate earnings, which are now projected to fall in the first and second quarters of this year, could decline for the rest of 2001.
He also dismissed the hope of a quick economic and earnings recovery in the second half of the year.
"If we get unemployment going up a couple of tenths of a point in the next few months, there is not going to be a second-half recovery," Mr. Cliggott said. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent in January from 4.0 percent.
One positive for the market right now, he said, is the strong flow of money into domestic equity mutual funds. The four-week moving average of new inflows is $3.4 billion, according to AMG Data Services. 
"As long as the money is there its got to be put to work," he said. Buying from mutual funds may have been one reason for the afternoon rebound in stocks that reduced the losses for the day.
Yesterday's key data was the fall in consumer confidence in February. The University of Michigan index fell to 87.8, from 94.7 in January, its lowest level since November 1993.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Wednesday that the economy was not in a recession. But he acknowledged that the economy's growth rate was at or near zero and that a break in consumer confidence could drag the economy lower.
At the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 index was down 25.08 points, to 1,301.53, and was off 1 percent for the week. The Dow fell 91.20 points, to 10,799.82, and was up 0.2 percent for the week. The Nasdaq finished the day down 127.53 points at 2,425.38. For the week, it was off 1.8 percent and is down 12.8 percent in the last three weeks, the ninth-worst three-week decline since the end of 1990. The eight others all came last year.
At its close yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index was just 133 points above where it closed on Jan. 2, the day the index plunged 7.2 percent. That decline was followed the next day by a surprise cut of half of a percentage point by the Fed in its benchmark short-term interest rate. The question now, if the stock market continues to decline, is whether Fed policy makers wait until their next scheduled meeting on March 20 to cut rates again or act sooner.
Among the stocks leading the market lower in addition to Nortel and Dell were Sun Microsystems, Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M.
As investors sold these and others, many moved their money to energy, consumer and drug stocks, including Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Pfizer.
The bond market fell early in the day on the news of the 1.1 percent jump in the Producer Price Index, which was led by a 15.3 percent jump in natural gas prices. Rises in tobacco and car prices also contributed to the increase. But the market rallied after the drop in consumer confidence was reported.
"The P.P.I. was clearly an aberration in a number of areas," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. "It was a very strange rise in the price of cars." But the consumer confidence data, he said, "clearly shows that consumers are becoming distressed," keeping alive the prospect of further rate cuts by the Fed. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross national product.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note first shot up to 5.23 percent, from 5.16 percent Thursday, and then fell to 5.09 percent by early afternoon, when the market closed early for the Presidents' Day weekend. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 19/32, to 99 11/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is an indication of how investors feel about the likelihood of another Fed rate cut, dropped to 4.70 percent, from 4.85 percent Thursday.
After the stock market closed Thursday, Nortel sharply cut its forecasts for both revenue and profits. The company, a Canadian manufacturer of communications equipment, also said it would cut 10,000 jobs. Nortel's stock dropped as much as 29 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, to $21. In trading yesterday it fell $9.75, to $20.00.
Dell announced the layoff of 1,700 workers Thursday. The job cuts equal about 4 percent of its work force and are the first major layoffs in the company's 16-year history. Then, after the market closed, the company said fourth-quarter earnings were up 18 cents a share, a penny short of an already lowered forecast. And Dell said earnings for the first quarter of this year would come in 2 cents below Wall Street's 19-cent forecast. Shares of Dell stock fell $1.50, to $23.50, yesterday.
Schering-Plough also offered investors a dose of bad news. It said a successor to its successful Claritin allergy drug would be delayed while the company made changes in its production process for the new drug, called Clarinex. The changes, ordered by the Food and Drug Administration, will delay production and cut first-quarter profits by 15 percent. The stock fell $7.07, to $41.25.

HEADLINE: Inflation at Wholesale Level Up a Steep 1.1% in January 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Prices paid to manufacturers and other producers for their goods climbed 1.1 percent in January in the steepest monthly gain in more than a decade, the government reported today.
 To some economists, the sharp rise in the Producer Price Index was a harbinger of higher inflation, the one crucial symptom that has mostly been absent from the nation's recent economic ills. If the Federal Reserve agrees with that diagnosis, these economists worried, it may be discouraged from lowering interest rates further. 
 Other economists countered that the spike was an aberration brought about by a confluence of high energy prices and some short-term, unworrisome factors. Those included higher cigarette prices and the removal of car dealers' customer incentive plans.
The 1.1 percent gain, raising the index to 141.6, was the steepest since the index rose 1.3 percent in September 1990, as the economy fell into recession. It followed a 0.2 percent gain in December and an even milder 0.1 percent gain in November. The January increase exceeded the 0.3 percent rise that many economists had expected.
"It could make it a lot more challenging for the Fed to drop rates," said William V. Fries, manager of the Thornburg Value Fund, which controls $1.8 billion in assets. "By dropping rates and stimulating the economy, you're just feeding inflation, which is not something the Federal Reserve wants to do."
The core producer price rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.7 percent in January, the steepest increase since 1.0 percent in December 1998, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Both increases in the core rate were attributed in part to higher cigarette prices, which rose 5.6 percent in January. In contrast, they rose 30.7 percent in December 1998.
Excluding months in which there was a big increase in cigarette prices, the core rate had not registered a monthly gain of 0.7 percent since January 1991, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"You can't dismiss it completely," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But our feeling is that this is a temporary blip."
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter issued a report today forecasting the increase in producer prices would have little effect on consumer prices. The firm cited the 1.2 percent increase in car prices, which added 0.1 percentage point to the core figure, and the 3.3 percent increase in energy prices, in describing overall price increases that topped estimates.
A separate report today provided more evidence of a weak economy. Industrial production fell 0.3 percent in January, its fourth consecutive decline, the Federal Reserve reported. The manufacturing industry, which has been in decline for nearly a year and offered economists other warnings last month, led the decline. Demand for natural gas fell, too.
Companies ran their factories and other operations in January at just 80.2 percent of their full capacity, its lowest level since August 1992.
In another report, the Commerce Department said that new housing construction rose by 5.3 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.65 million units. It was the third consecutive monthly rise for housing construction, and the fastest pace since April 2000.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Is Wild Card in the Nation's Economy 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
American consumers, shaken by a rash of layoff announcements and a weakening stock market, are losing confidence in the economy at the fastest pace since the last recession.
 The closely watched index of consumer sentiment compiled by the University of Michigan plunged in early February for the fourth consecutive month, the university reported yesterday. The February decline of 6.9 points brought the index to 87.8, about where it was at the start of the last recession, in July 1990. 
 "We are likely to find ourselves in a full-blown recession if there is another sharp drop in March," said Richard T. Curtin, director of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. "Right now, there are lots of cross- currents. People have very positive views of mortgage rates and of interest rates in general on loans. But they are apprehensive about the future, and they tell us they plan to hold back on spending." 
Consumer confidence has emerged as the wild card in the current slowdown -- the "X factor" that can save the day or push the economy over the brink into recession. The sharp drop in the Michigan barometer helped to explain the slide in stock prices yesterday. Citing the latest falloff in confidence, some Wall Street forecasters declared that the Federal Reserve would soon cut interest rates again, despite a rise in January in the Producer Price index, a key inflation measure. And the bad news on confidence overshadowed a Commerce Department report yesterday that home construction had risen sharply in January.
"The fact is the consumer confidence index is a leading indicator, and there is no indication yet that it is bottoming out," said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics. "It is telling us that even if manufacturing rebounds and energy prices fall by spring, the economy could be held down by much lower consumer spending."
The chief scorekeepers for consumer confidence are Michigan and the Conference Board, a business organization whose index has tracked Michigan's, but with a lag. Both have noted that the declines in their indexes have come chiefly as a result of pessimism about the future, particularly pessimism about jobs. A majority of those surveyed in early February expect "the unemployment rate to rise during the year ahead," Mr. Curtin said. But worries about what is ahead increasingly affect consumer behavior in the present. "Buying attitudes toward furniture, appliances, home electronics and other large household durables fell in early February to their lowest levels since the early 1990's," Mr. Curtin said.
Taking the public by surprise, the Fed cut rates sharply on Jan. 3, partly because of a big drop in Michigan's consumer confidence index for December, the steepest one-month fall in a decade. Consumer confidence has been a Fed concern since. Focusing on the rapid shift in confidence, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said in Congressional testimony on Tuesday that confidence was driven largely by "nonrational" behavior.
The "rending of confidence is one reason that recessions are so difficult to forecast," he said. "They may not be just changes in degree from a period of economic expansion, but a different process engendered by fear."
After rising or holding steady for most of last year the Michigan index has plunged 19.8 points since November. Not since the last recession, which started in July 1990 and ended the following April, has the index fallen so far in so few months. The fall came on the heels of a slowing economy and numerous downsizing announcements. 
Recent economic data has suggested that the slowdown may be ending. Retail sales were strong in January. And manufacturers cut back production sufficiently to brake the growth of inventories. The hope -- reflected in some of Mr. Greenspan's testimony on Tuesday -- is that production will revive soon as the stockpiled merchandise is sold off.
The sharp drop in consumer confidence in early February told a contradictory story. If the drop in confidence is confirmed in the final February reading and the Conference Board's survey for February matches Michigan's finding, then the odds rise that the economy will contract in the first quarter, instead of grow.
Some economists -- those at Goldman, Sachs, for example -- argue that the economy will contract slightly in the current quarter partly because "confidence appears to be starting to rupture." The economy is deemed to be in recession if the contraction lasts for at least six months, or two quarters. 
The Michigan survey is considered by some economists to be a better measure of consumer confidence than the Conference Board's. Certainly their methods are different.
Mr. Curtin and his staff at Michigan do their own polling, while the Conference Board, based in New York, farms the work out to a market research firm in Ohio. Michigan's survey draws on 500 telephone interviews spread through the month, each interview lasting 30 minutes. The Conference Board relies on questionnaires mailed out the first of each month to 5,000 households. The results are announced the middle of the following month, nearly two weeks after Michigan's final tally.
The Conference Board's questionnaire repeats the same questions month after month, while Michigan's interviewers vary some questions, to capture the changing nuances of consumer sentiment.
Whatever the method, neither survey has resolved a central issue: Whether the plunge in consumer confidence is a reaction to all the downsizing announcements and all the talk about recession, or whether people are reacting to their own experiences -- a hiring or wage freeze in their own workplaces, for example, or the layoff of someone they know, or stock market losses.
Mr. Curtin says that consumers are increasingly seeing evidence of the slowdown in their own lives or in their immediate surroundings. "We have a consumer who thinks economic growth has virtually stopped and job losses are rising," he said. 
Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting and forecasting firm, argues that confidence has fallen more quickly than actual experience warrants. "If people were not listening to the news," he said, "their own experiences would not have encouraged such a sharp drop in confidence."
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, takes a middle road. "There is more fear than reality warrants now," she said, "but if the fear is not resolved quickly, it will become self-fulfilling."

HEADLINE: In Japan, Waiting for the Captain to Appear 

BYLINE:  By Shin'ya Fujiwara; Shin'ya Fujiwara, a Japanese writer and photographer, is a winner of the Mainichi Arts Award.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Before I began writing this piece, I asked a friend of mine in the United States to send me information about how the collision between an American submarine and a training ship chartered by a Japanese high school was being reported. Based on what my friend sent, I have to admit to a strange feeling. I noticed references to the collision as occurring "off Pearl Harbor." In Japan, the news media described the site as "off Hawaii."
 This difference in emphasis may be minor. But it does suggest that in America the injury and loss of life are being placed, by some, in a political, military or historical context that, from a Japanese perspective, is beside the point. The sinking of the Ehime Maru does have great political resonance here, but it is of a different kind. 
 In my country, the public has become more inward-looking after the collapse of the asset-inflated economy and the subsequent years of economic stagnation. As we look inward at our longstanding institutions, what we see is sordid. We see case after case of bribery involving politicians and bureaucrats, the sale of fraudulent products by big companies, medical mishaps and their concealment at hospitals, improper investigations and subsequent coverups by police departments, and so on. This year, government prosecutors have contributed their own corruption scandals. The distrust felt by ordinary citizens toward the state and toward each other has reached a pinnacle.
Recently we read the tragic story of two young men who lost their lives striving to help a drunken passenger who had fallen onto the tracks of a Tokyo railway station. A Japanese public that has become devoid of emotions reacted excessively to this brave act, as if it were seeking salvation.
The collision between the Greeneville, a nuclear attack submarine, and the Ehime Maru occurred as the Japanese public was thirsting for heroes, perhaps -- or for a sense of public honor, of personal, human connection between those in power and those without it. In this respect, the nonappearance of the commander of the Greeneville -- his failure to meet the families of the victims to express his feelings of apology and mourning -- is shocking, even incomprehensible to a people whose culture stresses decorum and form. Such decorum is not merely "formal" in the American sense; it is the shape in which common humanity finds expression.
Two civilians who were in the control room at the time of the accident were interviewed by an American television network to find out what had happened. They demonstrated their own sense of conscience as individual Americans -- a saving grace amid the sense of distrust felt by the Japanese toward the United States. Perhaps there is an American practice of not allowing those directly involved in such military incidents to appear before the public.
As the incident unfolded in Hawaii, the United States Marine Corps in Okinawa refused to turn over a serviceman suspected in several arson attacks last month. (The marine was finally turned over to local authorities yesterday.) These two events may seem unrelated. But from here, they appeared to be intimately linked. The responsible person was unavailable, absent from the public drama.
This is not a question of anti-American feeling, exactly, because the missing persons, so to speak, of greatest concern here are Japanese: the leaders and institutions who seem to have abandoned their ties to the daily lives of our people. In my opinion, the fierce criticism of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's decision to continue playing golf even after hearing about the Ehime Maru collision is a result of immense frustration at this abandonment of both decorum and responsibility. Unlike the commander of the Greeneville, Mr. Mori cannot hide. To a degree, he is a scapegoat, since the commander is not available for public admonition, and Mr. Mori is left to do the American's work. At the same time, both men have shown this capacity to go missing when they are needed, leaving us alone again in our grief and frustration.

HEADLINE: In Self-Storage Units, Art Market Thrives; 
For African Dealers, a Place to Trade

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
The Chelsea Mini-Storage, a grimy, seven-story brick building with a loading dock at 615 West 27th Street, may well be the nation's largest transit point for wholesale African art. 
 More than 600 traders, nearly all Muslims from West Africa, cut deals with handshakes, load or unload recent purchases, chat, snooze or plan trips to Africa, where they buy artwork and send it to the United States on cargo ships. While the men trade, two women from Guinea cook chicken smothered in peanut sauce in a back room on the first floor, and the aroma mingles with the scent of smoldering incense. Men, shoeless, pray in a carpeted space near the entrance. 
 "This is the closest I can come in New York to being in Africa," said H. R. Hamilton, the publisher of African Business News. "There is a different sense of community here, a sense of trust, that is lacking outside these walls. There is something spiritual about it." 
The storage building grew into its role gradually. A few dealers in African art, many of them white, rented stalls some two decades ago to store items brought back from Africa. Over time others, especially immigrant traders from Africa, joined them.
Those who rent space pay about $190 a month for a 10-foot-by-10-foot storage room, a price traders say has doubled over the last year. The owners say the rent brings in several hundred thousand dollars a year.
The 5,000-room self-storage building, which the owners say is the largest of its kind in the United States, has some 60 first-floor "showrooms," in fact stalls with roll-up metal doors.
There, clusters of men trade and haggle in French and dozens of tribal dialects. Hundreds of families in New York, as well as people in countries like Mali, Congo, Liberia and Senegal, live off the business. 
The warehouse is as celebrated among African traders as it is unknown to those on the outside.
"I worked hard to bring Africans here," said Mohamed Dibassy, who over the last eight years has seen the traders in the building jump to 600, from 30. "You want to meet an African, from anywhere in Africa, you come to Chelsea Mini-Storage."
Under a slate-gray sky, dented vans, their back doors open, belched acrid fumes, while grunting workers loaded them with packages covered with bubble wrap. The vans pulled away, with two or three occupants to Chicago, Houston, Atlanta or Los Angeles. The items are peddled to galleries and at antique shows.
"No one knows we are here," said Mr. Dibassy, the head of the association of dealers, "so we do business mostly with dealers and traders."
Many of the works in the warehouse are contemporary copies of tribal pieces, mass produced and inexpensive. And there is no shortage of fakes, pieces smeared with dirt and weathered in an attempt to pass them off as vintage works. But mingled among them are 80- and 100-year-old objects that sell for tens of thousands of dollars. And dedicated collectors, along with gallery owners, prowl the storage building to inspect the arriving goods. 
But the tension between the established, largely white gallery dealers and the African traders is raw and flares into open spats. 
Mike Amitin, a large, bulky white man with a sandy-colored beard and an L. L. Bean vest, complained of the increasing reach of the traders. Mr. Amitan, who trolls the stalls almost daily, once had a gallery of African art that he said folded because of the traders' direct relationship with his clients.
"This place is the worst thing for African art," he said. "This is a wholesale place that sells directly to anyone. This new high-tech generation no longer makes sophisticated buys. It sees a mask for $50 and one for $10,000 and buys the cheaper one. This warehouse destroyed my business."
He turned and surveyed the stalls, many with somnolent attendants.
"There are a heap of small-time guys here," he said. "This place is a magnet for the unemployed."
There is little sympathy for gallery owners among the traders, many of whom live packed into small apartments and send money home to support families. They say that many gallery owners have kept them isolated, ordering them to remove the warehouse address from business cards and invoices, lest the location become more widely known.
Beany and Dick Wezelman, who have a gallery in California, stopped at the warehouse on a trip back from Africa, where they had bought a few hundred pounds of objects. The couple, who have been in the business for three decades, said the sons of traders in Africa had begun arriving in New York over the last few years to coordinate the family business. 
"I was with this man's father in Mali three days ago," said Mrs. Wezelman, pointing toward Ousmane Camara, 30, who stood in a small stall filled with artwork. "We have bought from his father for over 20 years. He is part of the revolution in African art, part of the new generation that is taking over the business from those who were established here." 
Mr. and Mrs. Wezelman said they knew nearly everyone in the warehouse because the traders had, at one time or another, appeared outside their California gallery with vanloads of items for sale.
Mohammed Sillah, 38, from Gambia, is one of the most established traders. His wife and five children live in Gambia and, like many traders, he travels back and forth. He arrived two weeks ago from West Africa, where for two months he made his way through remote parts of Togo, Ghana, Gambia and Senegal, buying up objects, many of them antiques. He said he speaks seven languages, including Bambara and Yoruba, allowing him to work outside urban areas. 
"If you want to make money, you need to get the special collection pieces," Mr. Sillah said, "but many of the best pieces are in villages where people will not part with them for money." 
"I arrive in the village with bags of rice, cola, small radios, blankets, kerosene and torch lamps," he continued. "I give them away as gifts. I ask people what they need. I take my time. I spend days in the right village. It is only when I leave, when they ask me what I want, that I turn my eyes to the old objects they have in their homes. Traders that try to buy these things quickly with cash usually fail. Good trading is built on trust and friendship. This is more important to many Africans than money."
Small-time vendors, including those who sell on street corners, take items from the warehouse on credit and pay the traders when the sales are completed. And for those whose credit is good, vanloads can be driven off with nothing more than a handshake.
"I turn over truckloads on credit," said Sulayman Berete, a Liberian. "It depends on how honest people are. I have watched $5,000 worth of art disappear without even $10 down payment." 
But for many, visits to the warehouse have less to do with sales and more to do with ambience.
Bamba T. Zoumana, from Ivory Coast, a slight man in a black leather jacket and a disarming grin, stood outside his shop in front of a poster that read: "Africa Must Unite." Around the outlines of the continent were pictures of Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, Thomas Sankara, Steve Biko, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Elijah Muhammad, who was the longtime leader of the Nation of Islam.
He spoke softly with Danny Freund, 23, a student at Pennsylvania State University, who moved about on a pair of crutches, one leg lost a few years ago to cancer. Mr. Freund, who plays in an African drum band, comes to buy instruments in the warehouse. 
Mr. Zoumana fetched a variety of drums and percussion instruments from the showroom stalls, patiently allowing Mr. Freund to tap a solitary rhythm on each. He explained the origin and use of the instruments.
"What is this one called?" asked Mr. Freund, holding a hollowed rectangular piece of wood with three open slits.
"A krin," Mr. Zoumana said. "It is made of mango wood. It is used for communication." 
Mr. Freund made no purchase, acknowledging later that he often came simply because he liked the traders.
"There is no other place like this," he said. "You can feel the traditions of Africa, the strength of friendships and relationships, the welcome to all."
By the door to the street and the rows of vans, the hubris of a dying era was playing itself out.
"Who is the coolest white guy you know?" Mr. Amitan asked a group of seated traders.
No one answered.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Fashion Week Fizzles Under the Tents

BYLINE:  By By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Fashion week in New York usually ends with murmurs and cries of "Genius!" But it ended yesterday on a different note, a profound sense of despondency. Those in the industry and on its fringes who typically influence what women will wear next fall found themselves questioning the relevance of the American shows.
 There has been concern for years that the New York shows, America's most important fashion event, were failing to gain in stature -- failing even to approach the stature of the major collections in Paris and Milan -- despite repeated efforts to strengthen them. 
 Two years ago, they were scheduled earlier than the European shows in an effort to gain more of the spotlight. The collections were gathered in impressive tents in one place, Bryant Park, so the presentations would be more of a force. 
But after this week, it was apparent that so far at least, the answer has not been found. 
"We've seen a lot of salable merchandise, but not a lot of interesting trends," said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, on Thursday night before the Daryl K show. "We need excitement in the store, and so far we haven't seen too many exciting new ideas." And he expressed dismay that despite a proliferation of young talent at the New York shows, his buyers found a dearth of creativity. "It's still true that Paris is the creative center of the industry," Mr. Ruttenstein said.
Journalists covering the 10-day run of shows, which had 92 collections on the official schedule, voiced similar complaints. "We're too tired and stressed to be excited, and designers aren't giving us anything to be excited about," said Linda Griffin, the fashion editor of The Houston Chronicle. 
Criticism is common in an industry used to scrutinizing clothes ruthlessly. But there is a growing perception that despite the efforts of the Council of Fashion Designers of America to improve New York's image as an international fashion capital, the American shows are actually diminishing in prestige.
"I'll never disagree that Paris is the think tank, and Milan is the engine," said Stan Herman, the president of the council. Nevertheless, he said he believes that the valuable talent is still here, while acknowledging that "the perfect pedestal" has yet to be found. He is a proponent of allowing as many designers as possible a chance to show their stuff. 
But the result, some say, is a dull show. "They're predictable, and predictable in my book is boring, and that's the word for the shows," Bud Konheim, the president of Nicole Miller, said on Wednesday.
Two years ago, his partner, Ms. Miller, was one of the first designers to join Helmut Lang and Calvin Klein when they defiantly decided to present their collections ahead of Milan and Paris, a move intended to improve deliveries, as well as to demonstrate that American designers were not going to play second fiddle to their European rivals. That move apparently backfired, as many in the industry complain that the shows are now too distant from the fall to be relevant to consumers. The decision to strive for impact by presenting so much of the show in one place has also led to criticism. Now, it seems, shows that are praiseworthy are lost in the crowd, overwhelmed by the mediocrities. 
And even Mr. Konheim, once a proponent of the Bryant Park site, decided to forgo a runway show with all its show business flair, including front-row celebrities. Instead, he put on a small presentation in his Seventh Avenue showroom, where he invited only two journalists and his Japanese licensees. He said his reason had less to do with costs -- he reserved $300,000 for a show -- than with his belief that the shows have become overblown spectacles with "zero impact" on business.
"There are too many shows," he said. "And the second you saturate a subject you instantly denigrate the value of it."
If anything, the shows may become more action-oriented, more entertainment-driven, if a proposed sale of 7th on Sixth, the nonprofit group formed by the designers council to run the shows, to IMG goes through. IMG, the sports management and marketing company, in addition to representing models and athletes, is the largest sports producer on television. IMG sees the fashion shows' greatest value in their ability to generate sponsorships and even more televised events, the very sort of commercial development that has some of the critics most concerned. 
"Fashion is big," said Chuck Bennett, an IMG executive who expressed the company's excitement over the new possibilities. 
Part of the difference between these shows and those in Europe is historical. The French have nurtured creative talent, while America demands fashion that sells. How well even that objective -- the commercial success versus the creative -- has been met will not be clear for months, until the orders are in and counted. In any event, buyers tend more than ever to avoid risk, and they based their orders on last season's top sellers, rather than going for innovations.
And unlike Milan and Paris, where designers are invited to be part of the official show calendar based on merit, the industry in New York has never tried to impose standards. Anybody can show. That has proved to be both a plus and a minus: some unknowns are discovered, but a lot of nonentities show up, only to disappear forever. The Puffy Combs show, which drew so much attention, was a lot of fun, but more about flash and diamonds than about fashion. 
When Marc Jacobs was starting out, in 1984, with little money, the only way he could put on shows was to persuade models and hairdressers to work free. "I mean, we had a million sponsors," said Robert Duffy, his business partner. "Donald Trump let us use the Plaza Hotel. Dick Page did the makeup for free. They just didn't ask us to put their names on things."
Last week, as editors and store executives arrived for the shows, now called Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, it struck many that the creativity was hard to find, that the atmosphere had become primarily commercial. "It feels like a trade show," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys. 
Others acknowledge the benefits of the practical side: "It's business," said Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue. Be that as it may, Mr. Lang and Mr. Jacobs, two of the biggest names, choose to avoid the tents, preferring more personal show sites to distance themselves from the hoopla and conformity in Bryant Park. 
"What I think is worrying is that the shows are becoming completely part of the entertainment business, and the entertainment industry is boring" for those who come to see inspirational design, said Colin McDowell, who covers fashion for The Times of London. "I think we're in danger of boring everybody to death. And this is the industry's fault. Fashion has been completely trivialized."
The decision to make the shows earlier is not working. Store executives say deliveries are not much better. It has created confusion for consumers. "Excuse me, I don't see people rushing out in little spring outfits in February," said Donna Karan, who thinks the shows are missing consumers because they are too early or out of sync with their lives. "We've taught the customer to buy on sale," she said. "Come October, she can buy everything on sale." When Ms. Karan started her business, she showed her first collection on May 4, 1985. Now, the calendar has been moved up by three months. 
She has her own theory about a seeming dearth of creative young talent. "They don't have role models," she said. "When we were starting out, we had role models -- the society lady, whether you believed in her or not. Today, everybody dresses like a slob. Now, young designers think they can pick through the garbage, go to a vintage store, whatever, and they say, 'I'm a designer.' How many kids are paying the price? They want instant gratification."
As for the increased televising of these collections, Mr. Ruttenstein said: "On the one hand, it's great that people can see fashion, but I know a major designer who was sketching everything off the television last week. He was sitting in his apartment sketching like crazy. It just adds to the impression that American fashion is becoming more homogeneous."
The economic impact for New York of fashion shows twice a year is, in fact, sizable. The estimate from 7th on Sixth is that $247 million will be spent this year on goods and services by those attending the shows. For last week's fall 2001 shows, 1,650 members of the news media registered, including 503 foreign journalists, a slight increase over last year.
No figures are kept for retailers attending the shows, though fashion executives say the number has been steadily decreasing -- in part because fewer department stores bother to attend or even to buy the clothes. "The business is totally different today," Mr. Duffy, the president of Marc Jacobs, said before the Jacobs show on Monday. "When we were starting out, the audience for our shows was split equally between press and stores. Now I would say it's 90 percent press and celebrities."
But the perception that the New York shows are slipping in prestige -- so much so that many designers and journalists say that the atmosphere in the tents resembles a trade show -- comes at a critical time in the industry. Retail sales were off sharply in the fourth quarter last year, and while the January sales figures showed a rebound, stores are cutting their costs.
No one seems ready to kill off the New York shows, not yet, but there's a sense that something important still needs to be done. In Mr. Ruttenstein's view, "We need to be more talented than anywhere else."

HEADLINE: To Keep the Estate Tax, or Kill It? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Dozens of Rich Americans Join in Fight to Retain the Estate Tax" (front page, Feb. 14): 
 You report that some 120 wealthy Americans have started a campaign to retain the estate tax. 
This is a bad idea. 
The death tax punishes hard-working, middle-class business owners and farmers, stealing a big chunk of the savings they've spent a lifetime building. Many are forced to curtail operations, sell income-producing assets, lay off workers and even sell their entire businesses to pay this onerous tax. 
The death tax also encourages spending instead of investment, eliminating opportunities to create new jobs and stimulate economic growth.
The long arm of the Internal Revenue Service should not reach beyond the grave. American families that have worked hard to pass something on to the next generation should not be forced to sell their businesses to pay this tax.

HEADLINE: ATTACK ON IRAQ; 
In the President's Words on the Bombing: 'It's a Routine Mission'

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from a news conference with President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Fox spoke in Spanish, and an interpreter translated.

Q I have a question for President Bush. What is the message that you want to send right now? What does the United States want to send to the world as a message, with the new bombing of Iraq? And above all, why, Mr. Bush, at this point, when you are establishing a dialogue with the president of Mexico? . . .

PRESIDENT BUSH In answer to part B of your question, the United States is engaged in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf. We will remain. We will remain so. Since 1991, our country has been enforcing what's called a no-fly zone. A routine mission was conducted to enforce the no-fly zone. And it is a mission about which I was informed and I authorized. But I repeat, it's a routine mission, and we will continue to enforce the no-fly zone until the world is told otherwise.

Q Sir, as you say, this is the first military action you've taken as president of the United States. I'm wondering whether it signals a hardening of the U.S. position toward Iraq and, specifically, is it your goal to drive Saddam Hussein from power? And secondly, are you putting Saddam on notice today that American and military action will be more frequent or more forceful than it was before you became president?

PRESIDENT BUSH Saddam Hussein has got to understand we expect him to conform to the agreement that he signed after Desert Storm. We will enforce the no-fly zone, both South and North. Our intention is to make sure that the world is as peaceful as possible. And we're going to watch very carefully as to whether or not he develops weapons of mass destruction. And if we catch him doing so, we'll take the appropriate action. . . .

Q Another question. Certification in Mexico -- will it continue? Will it disappear forever? Would you trust our friend, Fox?

PRESIDENT BUSH This question is on drug certification, and really about our relations with President Fox. I trust your president. He's the kind of man you can look in the eye and know he's shooting straight with you. I appreciate the fact that he was a one-time governor. I've got kind of a partiality to governors. . . .
We need to work together on the drug issue. One of the reasons why drugs are shipped -- the main reason why drugs are shipped through Mexico to the United States -- is because United States citizens use drugs, and our nation must do a better job of educating our citizenry about the dangers and evils of drug use.
Secondly, I believe there is a movement in the country to review all the certification process. I'm certainly going to take the message back to the members of Congress that I firmly believe that President Fox will do everything in his power to root out the drug lords and to halt drug trafficking as best as he possibly can. . . .

Q Since you two are working together on several actions that you want to undertake together in a short future and also the long-term future, do you support the military actions like the ones like the United States is doing bombing Iraq?

PRESIDENT FOX I do not have a position or a statement on that topic specifically, because this will be done through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the future. . . .

Q A question for President Fox. Do you think that it is not an improper gesture in this visit that the recent bombing of Iraq is what is attracting the attention, and would put a shade -- a different shadow -- on this meeting here in Guanajuato?

PRESIDENT FOX I see no reason why we should connect one event with the other one. Here we are in the process of building up and constructing a strategy to foster the economic and human development of a complete region that is formed by three countries that have been associated under a free-trade agreement, and that the relationship between the United States and Mexico that has proven already that it has made advancements very constructively.
The levels of trade we have had are really fantastic, and they are the envy of many people. Many people have never thought that the year of 2001, with a trade balance of $250 billion -- this has meant development for the United States. It has meant employment in the United States. It has meant development and employment in Mexico, as well. 
This is what has allowed us to reduce, substantively, the level of poverty in Mexico.
In the last four years, more than four million poor people have gone beyond extreme poverty levels. This is what we have invested in, to take these people above these levels, and all the time that we have invested discussing these strategic points allow us to see that there is a possibility of going ahead to get more benefits from the relationships and to be true partners toward prosperity and to be true friends and to be true neighbors. And this purpose is something that has been clearly stated today, and we are very pleased with it and we are full of confidence that we can see the future with a more optimistic approach, as of today's meeting.

Q President Bush, if I may, another question about Iraq. As we understand it, this was in response to violations that have happened over several weeks, perhaps several months. What prompted you to take this decision at this time?

PRESIDENT BUSH The commanders on the ground rightly make the decision as to how to enforce the no-fly zone. I want to assure those who don't understand U.S. policy that this is a routine mission. Some of the missions require the commander in chief to be informed. This was such a mission. It is not the first time it has happened, regrettably so.
We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones. The no-fly zones are enforced on a daily basis. It is -- it is a part of a strategy, and until that strategy is changed, it if is changed at all, we will continue to enforce the no-fly zone.
But anyway, the decision was made on the ground.

HEADLINE: Five Haitian Senators Seek to Put End to Impasse 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Five senators from the governing Lavalas Family party have stopped taking part in Parliament in order to help break a political impasse that resulted from their disputed election last May, party officials said today.
 The move was an attempt to bring closer Lavalas, the party of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and angry opposition leaders. Haiti's major opposition parties boycotted the presidential election in November to protest a tainted election in May. 
 The senators "stopped going to Parliament to support discussions between the Lavalas Family and the opposition," said Jonas Petit, a Lavalas Family spokesman. "These are the senators that should be concerned about that matter."
Haiti's latest internal political dispute arose from legislative elections held last May. International observers said election officials miscalculated the results of 6 to 10 Senate seats, giving Lavalas Family candidates outright victories when they should have been forced into runoffs.
The flawed election, which gave all but one Senate seat to Lavalas Family, angered opposition parties and Haiti's international allies. The United States and other nations asked Haiti's government to review the results and, when it refused, withdrew support for the presidential vote and withheld millions of dollars in aid.
Haiti's 7.8 million people are among the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. Eighty percent are unemployed and two-thirds are malnourished.
President Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest who became Haiti's first democratically elected leader when he won the presidency in 1990, was sworn in for his second term on Feb. 7. He won 92 percent of the vote in the November election.
Mr. Petit said the senators' move was a show of support for Mr. Aristide and his agreement with President Clinton last December to carry out a broad range of governmental and political reforms. One measure was a re-evaluation of the disputed Senate seats.
Mr. Petit said the five senators would not participate in Parliament until they heard further word from a commission soon to be formed to evaluate the contested Senate seats. An independent senator also decided not to take part in Parliament, but his reasons were unclear.
At failed negotiations between Lavalas and the opposition and mediated by diplomats and a civil society group before the inauguration, Mr. Aristide's party proposed that a three-party commission be formed to study the senate seats.
Opposition parties have charged that Mr. Aristide, Haiti's most popular politician, is installing a new dictatorship. An opposition coalition recently formed an "alternative" government headed by a human rights activist.
Mr. Aristide rose to power a decade ago on a wave of grass-roots support but was toppled in a military coup in 1991. He lived in exile for three years before a United States-led invasion force restored him to power in 1994.

 BODY:
Democrats Block Attempt To Rush a Bankruptcy Bill
Democrats have blocked a Republican attempt to rush a bill through the Senate that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system and make it more difficult for people to wipe out their debts.
 The bill is championed by the banking industry but has been criticized by consumer groups as disastrous for low-income workers who will lose their jobs if the economy continues to soften. The bill is moving toward quick passage in the Republican-controlled House. Page A11. 

Steep Gain in Prices Paid Producers
Prices paid to manufacturers and other producers for their goods climbed 1.1 percent in January, marking the steepest monthly gain in more than a decade, the government reported. To some economists, the sharp rise in the Producer Price Index was a harbinger of inflation, the one key symptom that has mostly been absent from recent economic ills. If the Federal Reserve agrees, these economists worried, it may be discouraged from lowering interest rates further. C14.

A Plan for California's Power Crisis
Gov. Gray Davis of California has outlined a plan to stabilize the state's nearly bankrupt electric utilities by buying their transmission lines and letting the utilities set aside part of consumers' monthly bills to finance bonds to pay off the rest of their debts. But the governor did not put a price on the plan or offer many details, which are still subject to negotiation with the utilities. A10.

Morgan Stanley Executive Resigns
Michael L. Rankowitz, the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter executive who selected former President Bill Clinton to give a speech that later sparked a controversy, said he had resigned. Mr. Rankowitz said his decision to quit "had nothing to do" with the Clinton speech and was not demanded by Philip J. Purcell, the firm's chairman and chief executive. C2.

Talks Held on European Steel Merger
Usinor, the French steel maker, said it was in talks to merge with two European rivals, Arbed and Aceralia Corporacion Siderurgica. A deal could be reached as soon as Sunday night, with executives and directors expected to continue talks with advisers and union representatives throughout the weekend, according to people involved in the discussions. C2.

Daewoo Under Fire Over Layoffs
Daewoo Motor sent dismissal notices to 1,750 employees, beginning a long-threatened downsizing. Several hundred workers responded by protesting outside a Daewoo plant in Pupyong, 20 miles west of Seoul, as their families cheered them. The company, which was declared bankrupt and pushed into receivership by lenders in November, is under pressure to restructure and shed workers so that it can be sold to General Motors and Fiat. Creditors want one-third of the company's 16,000 jobs to be eliminated. C2.

Sotheby's Settlement Is Approved
A federal judge gave final approval to a $70 million class-action settlement between Sotheby's and shareholders who sued the auction house contending that antitrust violations still under federal investigation damaged the company and depressed its stock price. The judge approved the lawsuit agreement, which awards shareholders $30 million in cash, paid by A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman and controlling shareholder, and $40 million in company-issued Class A stock. C3.

Cuomo Joins New York Law Firm
Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton, joined the New York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. Mr. Cuomo, who recently announced his intention to run for governor of New York, will become of counsel, allowing him to pursue his political career as well. B2.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomats Turned Aside Israeli Push on Rich's Behalf 

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN with ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Senior diplomats in the Clinton administration initially blocked Israeli lobbying efforts on behalf of the fugitive Marc Rich but were bypassed in the final decision-making when the president granted Mr. Rich a pardon on his last day in office, current and former United States officials said. 
 The Israeli government first approached senior American diplomats in support of Mr. Rich in 1995, the officials said. At the time, the Israeli government was not asking for a pardon for Mr. Rich but rather tacit American acceptance of a proposal to allow him to travel more freely around the globe without fear of being arrested and returned to the United States, officials said. 
 But the Israelis soon dropped the matter when they met with unified resistance from senior State Department officials. 
Israeli leaders never again raised the Rich matter with American diplomats, officials said. It was not until the final days of the Clinton administration that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, in telephone conversations with Bill Clinton, personally asked him to pardon Mr. Rich, officials said. 
Current and former United States officials say they do not believe the matter was raised by Mr. Barak until late December or January, and they believe that was the first time the Rich case was broached in official channels since 1995.
Mr. Rich's lawyer, the former White House counsel Jack Quinn, and other defenders of Mr. Clinton's pardon of Mr. Rich have said that it grew out of Mr. Clinton's desire to help Mr. Barak and foster Middle East peace, not from political donations from Mr. Rich's former wife, Denise Rich. 
In an interview on Thursday with Geraldo Rivera, Mr. Clinton said, "Israel did influence me profoundly." 
But despite the personal requests by Mr. Barak to Mr. Clinton, clemency for Mr. Rich was never an issue in the Middle East peace talks that Mr. Clinton kept alive until he left office. 
"This was not a factor in the Middle East talks," said Dennis Ross, the Clinton administration's longtime Middle East envoy, who said he did not know about the pardon until he read about it in the newspaper after it was announced. Mr. Ross, who remained involved in Mr. Clinton's Middle East peace efforts until the final days of the administration, said that he had not been asked about the Rich pardon by the president. 
Other senior Clinton officials deeply involved in American-Israeli relations said they had not been consulted by the president, either. Through a spokeswoman, the former secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, said that she had not been consulted by the president about the pardon. 
George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, who played a critical role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and was frequently in Israel for meetings on them, was never approached by the Israelis seeking a pardon for Mr. Rich, a spokesman said. Nor was he consulted by the president on whether to pardon Mr. Rich, the spokesman said. Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, has said he was not consulted. 
Some Justice Department officials have also complained that they were not consulted until the last minute about the Rich pardon, which was handled by the White House.
In 1995, Mr. Ross and Martin S. Indyk, the United States ambassador to Israel, both rebuffed efforts by senior Israeli officials, including the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to persuade the United States to agree to allow Mr. Rich greater freedom of movement around the world. The Israeli officials said that Mr. Rich had proposed raising billions of dollars to help Israeli government efforts aimed at economic development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of a Middle East peace agreement, and that he had said he needed to be able to travel more freely to do so. 
But after checking with State Department lawyers and the Justice Department, Mr. Ross rejected the proposal. Mr. Indyk also rebuffed the Israeli approach. 
"I had never heard of him, but I was very uneasy when I found out about Rich's background," said Mr. Ross, who recently left government. He said he turned the matter over to a State Department lawyer and never agreed to any Israeli proposals about Mr. Rich. 
Mr. Ross said he never again heard from the Israelis about Mr. Rich. He was present for conversations between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak at the end of Mr. Clinton's term and was aware that Mr. Clinton had told Mr. Barak he would consider his request for pardons for both Mr. Rich and the convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. 
Although Mr. Rich had the support of Mr. Barak and Mr. Peres, there was far more pressure on the White House to pardon Mr. Pollard than Mr. Rich, according to several government officials. But the White House apparently considered a pardon of Mr. Pollard impossible because of unified opposition within the United States government. In 1998, Mr. Tenet threatened to resign if Mr. Clinton bowed to Israeli pleas for clemency for Mr. Pollard.
Starting last fall, Mr. Rich also benefited from a concerted campaign by influential political figures and others in Israel to win his clemency -- a campaign less public than the one in support of Mr. Pollard. In letters they sent to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Rich's supporters offered information about his clandestine support for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. Among the many prominent Israelis who sent letters on behalf of Mr. Rich was Shabtai Shavit, who was chief of Mossad from 1989 to 1996. Mr. Shavit said that Mr. Rich had helped Mossad in its search for Israelis missing in action, and helped the evacuation of Jews from "enemy countries."
Mr. Rich's secret support for Israel often involved financial aid at sensitive times. According to a document provided to The New York Times by lawyers familiar with the Rich case, Mr. Rich was "instrumental" in the mid-1980's, when the relationship between Israel and Egypt suffered after an Egyptian policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists in the Sinai Desert. 
According to the document, Mr. Rich established a special $400,000 fund that was used by Egypt to compensate those Israeli families. The document also said, "Rich has also been instrumental in assisting the Israeli intelligence community in a variety of activities." The donation, which was made anonymously at the time, was also cited in a letter of support for Mr. Rich by the Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. Mr. Rich was also a generous contributor to charitable efforts in Israel and elsewhere, donating an estimated $100 million over two decades. 
Israeli support from Mr. Rich may seem odd because he did extensive business in Iran and Iraq, two of Israel's enemies. The fugitive financier, who holds Israeli and Spanish citizenship, has lived in Switzerland since 1983, when he fled the United States after being indicted on charges of income tax evasion, fraud and illegal oil deals.
Avner Azulay, a former Mossad agent who runs Mr. Rich's charitable foundation in Israel, collected many of the letters on Mr. Rich's behalf. In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Azulay said: "He was helping evacuate Jews from countries when it was very difficult. I wouldn't be working with this man if he traded with Israel's enemies." 
United States intelligence officials say they have little information about Mr. Rich's reported involvement with Mossad. Because the State Department has not recognized Mr. Rich's efforts to renounce his citizenship, Mr. Rich is still considered a "U.S. person" and so the Central Intelligence Agency cannot legally spy on him. 
But a former C.I.A. official, Vince Cannistraro, said he was aware of Mr. Rich's Mossad connections. He said Mr. Rich's role in oil trading with Iran in the early 1980's made him attractive to Mossad as a conduit between Israel and Iran. Mr. Cannistraro said he did not believe that Mr. Rich was a paid Mossad agent but rather a wealthy international commodities trader who could provide services like carrying messages and transferring money clandestinely for operational purposes. 
"They found his ties useful in Iran," said Mr. Cannistraro, the director of intelligence programs for the National Security Council in the Reagan administration. "He was a willing collaborator." 
Today, House and Senate committees continued their investigations into the pardon. A representative of Mr. Rich's lawyer Mr. Quinn said Mr. Rich would turn down an invitation from a House committee to waive attorney-client privilege so that Mr. Quinn could testify more fully about his efforts on Mr. Rich's behalf.

4 Candidates At the Walls Of Academe

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
THE mini-movement to get Bill Clinton to run for mayor seems to have lost all its steam, not that it had much to begin with. Can't imagine why, begging his pardon.
 So that leaves New York Democrats with the same four mayoral wannabes who have been around all along, though the number could grow should the Rev. Al Sharpton grace us with his candidacy. Thursday night provided a chance to see the present cast of characters all in a row, sort of a political equivalent to the preview of fall fashions offered this week at Bryant Park. 
 The setting was the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, in the old B. Altman building at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. The host was the Professional Staff Congress, the university's faculty union.
In alphabetical order -- a system that comes naturally to professorial types -- the candidates strutted their stuff. They were, in case you don't have the names straight yet, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president; Mark Green, the public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller; and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker.
If ever there was an audience primed for a Democratic Restoration at City Hall, this was it.
For many at CUNY, Rudolph W. Giuliani is Ivan the Terrible, Attila the Hun and Vlad the Impaler, only less charming. They feel he has scapegoated them for too long, calling professors lazy, administrators incompetent and students half a notch short of dumb. Not surprisingly, few among the 150 or so who gathered in the Graduate Center's auditorium were about to bathe the Republican mayor in love.
The mood was set by the union's president, Barbara Bowen, who called for "a revolution in thought at the mayor's office." It was time, she said, to replace "the present regime of slander," to end the city's "calculated disinvestment" in CUNY, to reshape what had become a "politicized board of trustees" under Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
It was, in short, a perfect arena and a perfect issue for the Democrats to pound away at Giuliani policies, free of worry that they might be seen as soft on crime or high on taxes or low on moral fiber or anything else deemed toxic in the prevailing political climate.
Pound away they did. Some of them even showed off before the crowd, using a vocabulary worthy of the SAT's but not destined for street campaigning, words and phrases like "paradigm," "remunerative," "sine qua non" and "Augean stables."
THE consensus was that Mr. Giuliani has failed New York schools, CUNY campuses included. They needed less bashing from the mayor's office and more fiscal and moral support, though no one was prepared to commit to specific dollar amounts, not in an economy that may be going wobbly.
Even at this pupa stage of the campaign, the candidates showed clearly differing styles in how they plan to deal with the inescapable shadow cast by the present steward of City Hall.
Messrs. Hevesi and Vallone, the more right-leaning Democrats, criticized Mr. Giuliani but in language not remotely inflammatory. Messrs. Ferrer and Green, tilting left, did not flinch from testing verbal bombs for possibly permanent slots in their arsenals.
"I'm not Rudy Lite," Mr. Ferrer said. "I'm not a kinder, gentler Rudy, or Rudy with a smile." As for Mr. Green, no one had to scratch his head over whom he had in mind when he denounced "government by tantrum, government by vendetta, government by enemies list."
Those lines were well received. But unintentionally, some in the audience demonstrated why Mr. Giuliani has found it easy, and politically profitable, to accuse CUNY of embracing mediocrity.
Alone among the candidates, Mr. Hevesi urged the faculty to hold students to higher standards. His appeal drew hisses. The comptroller, who once taught political science at Queens College, then suggested that professors volunteer to teach a few more hours a week -- not many, just a few. More hisses. When he said he would love to restore CUNY to its tuition-free status of long ago, but asked which municipal services people would want to cut to help pay for it, some cried, "Raise taxes."
You think maybe this was a crowd not fully in sync with the popular mood?
Still, it was a politically sophisticated group. What does it say about the dynamism of this race that the auditorium was less than half full? Sure, the election is nearly nine months away. But you knew that Bill Clinton would have filled the house.

HEADLINE: To Keep the Estate Tax, or Kill It? 

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 You report (front page, Feb. 14) that Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor, says the estate tax promotes economic growth by helping create a society in which success is based on merit rather than on inheritance. Yet the estate tax penalizes the very thing that Americans seek through their merit: wealth. The contradiction is exquisite.

HEADLINE: No Choice But To Strike 

BYLINE:  By Anthony H. Cordesman; Anthony H. Cordesman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is the author of "Iraq and the War of Sanctions."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Yesterday's air strikes against Iraq were a necessary, if not vital, part of United States strategy in dealing with Iraq and the Persian Gulf. It was not American saber rattling. It was Saddam Hussein who had stepped up Iraqi air defense activity, and who had tried to create a new kind of trap for American and British aircraft. President Bush may have chosen to react with an unambiguous message, but it was Mr. Hussein who provoked the strikes.
 America cannot afford to show any weakness in dealing with Mr. Hussein, and it will almost certainly have to follow these strikes with strikes in the future. This is not simply a matter of enforcing the no-fly zones or protecting the United States and British aircraft that enforce them. It is part of a broader strategy of military containment that ensures that Iraq remains militarily weak, does not actively threaten its neighbors and understands it cannot openly manufacture and deploy weapons of mass destruction. 
 There are many reasons why such military containment is necessary. The most important reasons are strategic. The Persian Gulf has two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves and is the key source of oil exports. We cannot be indecisive in dealing with the region's most threatening dictator. 
Furthermore, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are just as vulnerable to Iraqi aggression as they were in 1990, and Mr. Hussein's sons are still claiming that Kuwait should be a province of Iraq. If it were not for the American presence in the Gulf, Iraq could invade Kuwait just as quickly as it did a decade earlier.
There are tactical reasons for containment as well. Mr. Hussein is doing his best to convince the Arab world that he can be the military champion of the Palestinian cause, that he is the leader of the one government that openly challenges Israel's closest ally. At the same time, he, his sons and his closest associates continue to try to intimidate friendly regimes like King Abdullah's in Jordan and to heap verbal abuse on the leaders of important moderate states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
If Mr. Hussein created a successful military sanctuary in the no-fly zones, this would be seen as a symbol of his growing strength. If he then succeeded in shooting down an American or British plane, it would be seen as an Iraqi triumph.
Unfortunately, we have no real alternatives to military containment. America can talk about backing Iraqi opposition groups outside the country, but most such groups are hopelessly weak and divided and have little support in Iraq. Nor do they have Saudi, Kuwaiti or Turkish support. The groups that do conduct some military operations inside Iraq are Iranian-backed Shiite groups whose goals scarcely coincide with American interests. Covert operations to help create or support an internal Iraqi opposition may be an option, but is one that will take years to put in place.
Sanctions against Iraqi military forces can be made more effective. We have broad support in the Arab world. Iraq has not had any significant arms imports for more than a decade. Economic and energy sanctions, however, are playing out their course. We cannot hope to get broad support to strengthen them, and Mr. Hussein already has all of the revenues he needs to pay off his military and security forces and Iraq's elite. Economic sanctions now largely hurt the average Iraqi, not the regime.
More broadly, we have no real hope of conducting serious inspections for weapons of mass destruction. There have been no such inspections in nearly three years, and Iraq has almost certainly created many cell-like operations to develop and make missiles, as well as chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Even a strong inspection program could only partially constrain Iraq's efforts. A strong military shield is the only way to keep Iraq from rebuilding large-scale capabilities to develop such weapons. 
Is military containment a frustrating strategy? Of course. So, however, was four decades of containment of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. They are gone, and without a massive war or any invasions. If we are strong and persevere, Saddam Hussein's regime will inevitably face the same fate.

 BODY:
 THE MIND
OF THE CEO
By Jeffrey E. Garten.
309 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $26.
 Plato envisioned a class of well-educated guardians who would oversee ancient city-states. Thomas Jefferson spoke of a government run by a virtuous natural aristocracy, selected for its skills, not its genealogy. W. E. B. Du Bois called for a talented tenth to lead the struggle against prejudice.
Jeffrey E. Garten's group of elites consists of the chief executives of the world's largest companies, and there is a savvy sense of timing to his idea. Over the last 15 years, governments from Eastern Europe to North America have been in retreat, dismantling regulations and cutting welfare benefits. All the while, companies have grown to unheard-of sizes, becoming the new century's version of empires, with networks of employees and customers on which the sun never sets. 
Against this background, Garten, the dean of Yale University's School of Management, set out to interview 40 of the most important corporate executives about the state of the world. He emerged respectful of their ideas and awed by the complexity of today's business climate. Above all, however, Garten became convinced that none of the chieftains fully grasp the responsibilities they now have.
It has fallen to the executives, Garten believes, to develop a more sustainable version of globalization, one that includes less inequality and a stronger financial structure. Yes, they must worry first about profits. And no, a raft of new regulations is unlikely to be the answer. "Yet," Garten writes in "The Mind of the CEO," "these leaders are badly underestimating the rise of global problems that will affect their firms and the environment in which they operate."
Unfortunately, Garten, a former Clinton administration trade official who has made a name for himself since as a smart, loyal critic of corporate America, devotes only the final third of the book to his far-reaching vision. The rest is a summary of big business today. Students of corporate America are unlikely to learn much from it, while other readers will probably struggle to get through the monotony of industry detail.
The book's weaknesses spring largely from its methodology. Garten's interview list, which includes the heads of AOL Time Warner, General Electric, Goldman Sachs and Toyota, is impressive, but he did little to build on it. There are no interviews with employees or other people who interact with these companies daily. As a result, the few descriptions are of the executives' mannerisms and their offices ("we met in a conference room, where coffee, fruit and bagels were available on a silver tray"). More damaging, the executives often lack credibility -- and the book, by extension, balance. One executive, for instance, claims his workers do not care that much about how much money they make. 
Only in the final chapters, where Garten lays out the details of his thesis, does he take control of the narrative. At a time of rapid change, he writes, no one person should hold the offices of chief executive, chairman and president, as many do. Stand-alone chairmen could focus more on long-term issues, such as convening a version of the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference for the post-cold-war, Internet age. They could advise American officials on soothing the rising hostility to the United States and advise emerging nations on avoiding new crises. 
Unlike Plato's guardians, of course, Garten's mandarins hold no formal responsibility for society, and he recognizes that this is the chief obstacle to his vision. Almost three out of four Americans already think businesses have too much influence, according to one recent poll. Many executives, for their part, construe their mission solely as the maximization of profit. "It's dishonest to pretend otherwise," Rupert Murdoch tells Garten.
It may well be. It is hardly dishonest, however, to suggest that the greatest beneficiaries of recent economic change should think more imaginatively about its effects than they have thus far.

 Storm on the Horizon
The Challenge to American
Intervention, 1939-1941.
Justus D. Doenecke.

FDR
The War President, 1940-1943.
A History.
By Kenneth S. Davis.

Random House. $39.95.
 The period between 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, and 1941, when the United States entered World War II in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was one of the most dangerous eras in history. Most contemporary historians approve of Franklin D. Roosevelt's sometimes devious efforts to support Britain and France and to steer the United States into war against Hitler and the Axis powers, and many concur with the judgment of Isaiah Berlin in his essay "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt": "He was the greatest leader of democracy, the greatest champion of social progress in the 20th century." Every historical consensus, however, deserves to be challenged -- even if the result of the challenge is to reaffirm the conventional wisdom.
In "Storm on the Horizon: The Challenge to American Intervention, 1939-1941," Justus D. Doenecke, a professor of history at New College of the University of South Florida, revisits the arguments made by opponents of Roosevelt's foreign policy in the years preceding Pearl Harbor. The geopolitical argument that the United States did not need to take part in World War II was made in 1997 by Bruce Russett in "No Clear and Present Danger," and restated recently by Patrick J. Buchanan in "A Republic, Not an Empire." The story of the struggle of American isolationists against intervention in World War II was ably told by Wayne S. Cole in "Roosevelt and the Isolationists." Doenecke's book adds little to this literature. It is simply a chronological compilation of published and private statements by American anti-interventionists. 
Minor figures like the American fascist Lawrence Dennis are quoted at length, along with major figures like the historian Charles A. Beard and the perennial Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas. Doenecke, the author of several previous books about this subject, is sympathetic to the anti-interventionists, writing, "Their heritage, like that of the interventionists they so bitterly fought, contains prophetic elements as well as foolish ones." In retrospect, however, what stands out is the folly of individuals like the Anglophobic writer Harry Elmer Barnes, whom Doenecke quotes: "Had Hitler tortured and then killed every one of the half million Jews living in Germany in 1933 such a foul and detestable act would still have left him a piker compared to Britain's blockade of 1918-19." 
"FDR: The War President, 1940-1943," is a more imposing book. Kenneth S. Davis died in 1999; this posthumously published book is the fourth in a series whose first volume won the Francis Parkman Prize. As a work of narrative history, this volume, like its predecessors, combines detailed narration of events with irritating rhetorical tics, like the alternation of long paragraphs with dramatic single sentences that sometimes fade into ellipses: "Everyone assumed the immediate impendence of a historic White House legislative proposal, a proposal bound to raise a storm of controversy. . . ."
The rambling editorial comments that Davis interweaves with long passages of straightforward chronicle add up to a cumulative indictment of Roosevelt for being insufficiently liberal. Davis is justly critical of Roosevelt's approval of the internment of Japanese-Americans and his indifference to the rights of African-Americans. Less reasonably, he criticizes Roosevelt for enlisting business elites in the war effort. He quaintly refers to one government official, Floyd B. Odlum, as "big-business man Odlum." Another villain is Donald M. Nelson, chairman of the War Production Board: "Nelson was now to become a major player in that historical drama whence emerged the American Leviathan of the last half of the 20th century -- an America whose whole life, economic and social and cultural . . . was absolutely dominated by big business." 
Davis also criticizes Roosevelt for allowing military officers and civil servants to control the Manhattan Project, rather than the scientists, who were "now to become in effect the servants, the hired hands, of these same administrators and of others (after the Army took over)." But Davis's major complaint, it soon becomes clear, is the refusal of the United States and Britain to share atomic secrets with Stalin's government: "It was common knowledge that in the military mind, antipathy to Communism was greater by a good deal than antipathy to Nazi-fascism, and since Moscow was headquarters of a Comintern presumed to have spread round the world a remarkably efficient network of espionage and subversion, the measures deemed to keep secrets away from the Russians would no doubt be stringent in the extreme." Even though it was available and widely discussed before he died, Davis appears to have been unaware of the new scholarship, based on Soviet archives, showing that Soviet espionage in the United States peaked during the Roosevelt years.
Having faulted Roosevelt for sacrificing liberal reform to the imperatives of big business and the military, Davis calls a character witness to testify on his subject's behalf. He endorses the thesis of an article written in The Nation in 1942 by the journalist I. F. Stone, in which Stone magnanimously forgave Roosevelt for letting "big business mobilize our economy for war pretty much on its own terms" and for establishing "a government of coalition with the right" on the grounds that "the president is only a man, with only 24 hours a day at his disposal." Stone, whom Davis calls a "liberal political commentator" and "perhaps the most intelligently critical of all those who wrote for the public prints" was no liberal at all, but a radical leftist who spent the Roosevelt years as an uncritical apologist for Stalin.
Strong political convictions need not prevent a historian from being scrupulously accurate with respect to facts. But Davis's credibility as a historian collapses completely when he alleges callous indifference on the part of Roosevelt to the fate of Europe's Jews. "The first undeniably true reports, in the late summer of 1942, that the German government was actually carrying out Hitler's final solution brought Roosevelt face to face with a great moral challenge, the greatest such of his public life, in the opinion of this author. . . . Could he have done anything to reduce the Holocaust? The present author says 'Yes.' "
Yet Davis's list of actions that Roosevelt could have taken but failed to take is unconvincing. He thinks that Roosevelt should have thrown all his energy into finding "safe havens" for the Jews, "and doing this now, while millions of the doomed were yet alive." A case can be made that Congress (which, rather than the president, controlled immigration policy) could have accommodated more refugees in the 1930's by relaxing immigration quotas. But by the middle of 1941, the emigration of Jews living under German occupation was forbidden by Nazi edicts. Davis does not explain how, a year later, in the autumn of 1942, Roosevelt could have helped the Jews trapped in German-occupied Europe to reach safe havens. He speaks of the possibility of a "massive Jewish rescue effort" starting in 1942 without ever making it clear what he means.
Davis is not content to condemn Roosevelt for failing to undertake a Jewish rescue effort of an undefined but presumably military nature at the end of 1942, when the D-Day invasion was still a year and a half away. He supplies a selfish motive. According to Davis, "To add to the burdens he was already carrying . . . the risks and anxieties of a massive Jewish rescue effort, a burden that perhaps weighed heavier in his imagination than it would actually have been for him personally, must have seemed to him utterly impossible. He may well have felt, deep down, that to do so would be fatal to him." This is a calumny. There is not the slightest evidence that Roosevelt rejected a "massive Jewish rescue effort" because he felt "deep down" that the stress of doing so would overtax his health. Davis has made all this up. 
"FDR: The War President: 1940-1943" is not history. It is sensationalistic historical fiction of the kind associated with Oliver Stone and the Edmund Morris of "Dutch." Franklin Delano Roosevelt's reputation as a historical figure will survive this book. Kenneth S. Davis's reputation as a historian will not.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A review on Feb. 18, about two books on President Franklin D. Roosevelt and World War II, misstated the number of volumes in the Roosevelt biographical series by Kenneth S. Davis. "FDR: The War President, 1940-1943. A History" is the fifth in the series, not the fourth.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Ticket Fees, Taxes Add Up

BYLINE:  By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE cost of flying is going up, especially for those who need to change their tickets. And when the increases are flat fees, not percentages, which has been the case lately, cheaper trips take a proportionately bigger hit, as do children's tickets, senior tickets and other discounted categories. 
 The increases include higher fees charged by airlines for changing nonrefundable tickets and relatively small tax rises. While change fees are not, strictly speaking, part of the ticket price, they affect vacation travelers more than business travelers, because business travelers tend to buy more expensive refundable tickets. 
 Probably coincidentally, the government has again cast an icy eye on the way Web sites are displaying total ticket costs, particularly when "fuel surcharges" -- these fare increases based on trip mileage that began to appear a year ago -- are involved. 
Here's why your ticket dollars are airborne. 
The fees for making changes in nonrefundable domestic tickets rose last month from $75 to $100. Continental Airlines started the rush, and soon all seven major domestic carriers were aboard. Continental's rationale was that when it changed passengers' itineraries, it found that reselling the original seats became more difficult as the date of departure neared, and, accordingly, its costs increased. 
The airlines left standing -- at least for now -- a $150 charge for changing a European or Asian ticket. 
There were minor variations in how the fee is being applied. So if you have a ticket you bought before the new fees kicked in, be sure the reservations agent checks the rules when you want a change. 
Continental raised to $100 from $75 its fee for changing nonrefundable tickets for flights within the United States and to Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Bermuda and the Caribbean. The fee also applies to tickets on Continental Express. Changes to tickets sold before Jan. 19 are not subject to the higher fee. Continental: (800) 231-0856.
United raised to $100 its fee for changing tickets to every place except Europe. The higher fee was in force for all tickets as of Jan. 29, regardless of when they were bought. United: (800) 241-6522.
US Airways likewise went to $100 on its regular domestic tickets and tickets to Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and Canada. The effective date was Jan. 30, and the new rate does not apply to tickets bought before Jan. 31. For its shuttle tickets, the change fee went to $75 from $50; for the line's Metrojet flights, there is still no charge. US Airways: (800) 428-4322.
Delta raised its fee for domestic-ticket changes to $100 on Jan. 29. The rise also affected Delta tickets on A.S.A., Comair and ACJet but not on SkyWest and Delta Express. The change fee on the Delta Shuttle went to $75 from $50. Delta: (800) 221-1212.
Northwest jumped aboard on Jan. 31, but applied the new $100 fee only to tickets bought that day and later. It covers all domestic North American tickets. Tickets on Mesaba and Northwest Express are also affected. Northwest: (800) 225-2525.
T.W.A. joined hours after Northwest, levying the $100 fee on tickets for trips in the continental United States, Hawaii, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also applied the higher fee for changes made to tickets purchased from Jan. 31 onward. T.W.A.: (800) 221-2000.
American initially went to $90 for its change fee, on Jan. 24. Then on Jan. 31, it took a second bite, going to $100 for changes made to any ticket after Feb. 1. The fee applies to all American and American Eagle flights in the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America. Changes to Hawaii tickets already cost $100. American: (800) 433-7300. 

Ticket Taxes
As for taxes, the United States approach to air tickets is shifting. Since Oct. 1, 1999, the government has applied a 7.5 percent tax to the base domestic fare. This tax, which was 10 percent before Oct. 1, 1997, is identified with a "US" on the corner of the ticket. Meantime, the "flight segment tax," levied for each takeoff and landing, has been climbing: On Jan. 1, it went from $2.50 to $2.75, bringing the amount for a nonstop round-trip to $5.50. If there is enough space in the breakdown area of the ticket, segment taxes are marked "ZP." 
The impact of a shift from a percentage to a flat tax is interesting. In a comparison of an adult ticket on Northwest Airlines from Newark to Minneapolis outlined in the accompanying chart, taxes accounted for 10.2 percent of the adult ticket but 12.6 percent of the lower-priced ticket for an infant in its own seat. 
This is what tax mavens call regressive taxes. 
For tickets to international destinations, the United States does not apply a 7.5 percent tax, but a departure tax and an arrival tax. These are also marked "US" in the little tax box. These are indexed to inflation, and on Jan. 1, they went from $12.40 to $12.80, meaning a round trip international ticket has a $25.60 nick. In addition, tickets to other countries also involve a $5 Customs fee (YC) for most returning passengers; an animal and plant inspection service fee (XA) of $3; and an immigration fee (XY) of $6. Because there is too little space on the ticket to itemize these, they usually turn up lumped under "XT."

Computer Displays
The Department of Transportation has been nagging the airlines about whether their computer displays are quick enough to tell travel agents and consumers the whole truth about prices. On Jan. 18, Samuel Podberesky, the department's assistant general counsel for aviation enforcement, fired off another warning -- there was one on March 18, 1996 -- to airlines and online agencies like Expedia.com not to put "a so-called fuel surcharge" on a separate screen or as a footnote on the bottom of the display. 
Usually, when one shops for a fare online, the airlines ask for travel dates. The government said this sort of search produced the real fare quickly. The warning said, however, that searches that do not specify a travel date produce screens of data that do not put the surcharge forward immediately.
"Where these 'fuel surcharges' (or similar carrier-imposed surcharges) are listed separately and are not included in the basic fare presented to the public," the warning said, "this is deceptive. . . . Such listings in other media have led to enforcement action in the past." 
In the Northwest Airlines Web fare material discussed above, there were hints of this sort of problem. The actual total fare, including taxes, fuel surcharges and taxes on the surcharges was always posted in "summary" in the left-hand column. But when "rules and restrictions" was called up, the display said "surcharges not included until itin priced." Then, when I added the $18.60 given as the fuel surcharge in the note, the calculation still did not reach the fare in the left-hand column. When an expert at Northwest talked me through it, he explained that the $18.60 was charged in each direction, and it too was subject to a tax: I needed to add $40 to reach the quoted fare. 
The fuel surcharge distorts the fare schedule; the child's fare is no longer half the adult's fare, for example. This may be why the airlines are reluctant to 'fess up right away.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on Feb. 18, about increases in fees for changing a nonrefundable ticket, misstated the date United raised its charge to $100 from $75. It was Jan. 26, not 29. The column also misstated the scope of the change. Only tickets bought on or after the 26th are affected, not those bought before.
The column also included an outdated reference to tickets on US Airways' low-fare Metrojet service. A $75 fee was instituted Feb. 7, after the article was researched but before it appeared.

HEADLINE: Solving AIDS: Look at Brazil 

 BODY:
 Tina Rosenberg's article (Jan. 28) was an insightful and global perspective on the AIDS crisis. Brazil's success in addressing the spread and treatment of AIDS should be included in the notes of every publication that addresses the epidemiology of the disease. No one questions the need for economic incentives to develop better drugs to end this plague. But where does the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry end and compassion for our fellow man begin?

HEADLINE: Solving AIDS: Look at Brazil 

 BODY:
Rosenberg was accurate: we must urgently assist poor countries to confront AIDS. She focuses on Brazil, which has the seventh-largest economy in the world and a tax base that allows its government to spend $444 million a year on AIDS drugs. 
As she notes in the article, sub-Saharan African countries are not in the same economic position and, more tragically, are facing an epidemic that is more severe. The situation there will not change, even if antiretrovirals are provided free of charge. Yes, drug prices and international trade law are large parts of the problem. More significant, though, is the provision of basic medical care.
Access to pain medications, for example, or to intermediate drug treatments for very treatable H.I.V.-related infections need to go hand in hand with access to any introduction of advanced medical care like antiretroviral therapy and monitoring. 
 This path is not the easy one, but it is the one that will create significant impact in treating the overall disparities in health care that prevent access to AIDS therapies in Africa.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
New Housing for Reviving South Amboy Waterfront

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A RESIDENTIAL enclave rising along Raritan Bay in South Amboy is the latest sign that this Middlesex County city's two-mile-long waterfront is undergoing a revival after sitting dormant for nearly 50 years.
 Called Lighthouse Bay, the $50 million 32-acre housing development will have 115 town houses and 70 single-family detached homes. Most of the residences are being designed with Victorian-style architectural features to reflect South Amboy's housing stock and its past as the gateway to the New Jersey Shore, said the developer, Baker Residential of Pleasantville, N.Y. 
 The houses will rise over the next three years on the site, which is within the city's 130-acre southern waterfront redevelopment area. They are also near a New Jersey Transit train station and a planned high-speed ferry, both with service to Manhattan, about a 60-minute train trip from South Amboy. 
Christopher T. Baker, vice president and general manager of Baker Residential, said Lighthouse Bay would capitalize on those transit links as well as the city's water views and shore location. Being a shore community within commuting distance to Manhattan represents an excellent marketing opportunity, he said, saying, "what we're selling is convenience and lifestyle." 
Moreover, in the "surrounding areas of South Amboy, the demographics are strong and the job formation is good," Mr. Baker said. The project, he added, is expected to draw young professionals, families and empty nesters. 
Lighthouse Bay is part of a larger redevelopment effort begun five years ago to revive this 1.8-square-mile city's once-industrial waterfront. The activity so far has taken place on the southern waterfront. There the Baker project joins Shore Gate, a 114-unit condominium for people 55 and over. Shore Gate, together with a municipal library, youth center and middle and high school, give the redevelopment a community focus, according to Mayor John T. O'Leary. There is also a new waterfront park that sits mostly in neighboring Sayreville, which surrounds South Amboy. 
The redevelopment will take place over seven years. Ultimately, it will encompass 345 acres and spread to the central and northern sections of the city's coastline, which began to decline in the 1950's and, until recently, was bypassed because it was inaccessible to the highway and mass transit system that serves the rest of South Amboy. The city, which has 8,000 residents, is close to such roads as the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and Routes 287 and 440. 
The redevelopment plan, using $50 million in federal and state loans and grants, seeks to overcome that hurdle by providing road access to the bay. For instance, development of the county park and municipal complex also brought a new road, John T. O'Leary Boulevard, named for the mayor, that connected those projects to the city's downtown and opened up the rest of the southern waterfront to development.
IT also calls for creating an intermodal transit hub by adding to the existing bus service enhanced train service and the Manhattan ferry, which will be run by SeaStreak America of Atlantic Highlands. That, city officials hope, will make South Amboy the transportation powerhouse, if not the industrial one, it was at the turn of the century, when three railroads and a ferry operated there. 
Also planned for the waterfront redevelopment area, which is now mostly desolate, are up to 1,500 residential units, a 400-slip marina and up to three million square feet of commercial space. There will also be open space and a public walkway to the bay. 
"We needed to bring life back to the city, so we went the public grant route to create the environment necessary for development to take place," said Mr. O'Leary, a native of South Amboy and its mayor of 14 years. "The next industry to come into town will be the high-tech industry."
John F. O'Connell, the city's former director of economic development, said that in redeveloping its waterfront South Amboy hoped for the same kind economic ripple effect that washed over Hudson River waterfront towns, like Jersey City. The waterfront is the city's opportunity to help balance its tax base, which relies heavily on residential property owners.
But, the redevelopment will be done "one step at a time" to preserve the city's small-town flavor and its residents' quality of life, Mr. O'Leary said, adding that it would also complement, not compete with, the nearby reviving six-block downtown.
Under the redevelopment plan, developers must provide studies on the impact their projects on the city's coffers and schools, said Stanley R. Marcinczyk, South Amboy's business administrator. Estimates are that Lighthouse Bay along with up to 275 future residences -- to be built in the south waterfront by Baker -- will generate $2.5 million to the city a year and produce 120 school age children, he said. 
The Baker project will generate an estimated $3 million in new tax revenue to the city a year. Since it will cater to a broad group of buyers, it will have a "negligible impact" on schools, Mr. Marcinczyk said.
It will also promote transit-friendly development. Last year, the area around the train station and planned ferry was designated a "transit village" as part of a state program to attract private investment and spur development close to transit hubs. The designation makes the city eligible for increased state aid.
OF the public financing for the redevelopment, Congress has awarded the city $14.2 million for road improvements. That includes a new road to provide access from the downtown to the bay, which will allow construction of a ferry terminal and open up the 140-acre central waterfront area to the planned mixed-use development, Mr. Marcinczyk said. The road will be completed by early summer and the ferry will begin operating by the end of the summer, he said, adding that the state was simultaneously expanding three bridges within a quarter of a mile from the waterfront.
New Jersey Transit, the overseer of the state's mass transit system, has committed to spending $18.2 million at the South Amboy train station. With 1,100 daily riders, the station is one of the busiest on the North Jersey Coast line. The line is the second busiest in the state's transit system, with 16,000 riders a day, according to the transit agency. Improvements under way or planned include expanding the parking at the station for 250 cars and building a five-block-long elevated train platform. 
Jeffrey A. Warsh, New Jersey Transit's executive director, said the transit village program in South Amboy "affords us an opportunity to create a viable intermodal facility in a densely populated and transit-hungry area." The growth in ridership at South Amboy's station is expected to outpace that of others on the North Jersey Coast line, which is to double its ridership in the next decade, he added. 
In the first half of the 20th century, South Amboy was home to a string of factories and the Eastern Coal Docks, which transferred Pennsylvania coal and other goods for distribution along the East Coast. But in 1950, a munitions explosion on the waterfront started the city's decline, Mayor O'Leary said. By the 1980's, most of the factories had shut down, as had the coal docks. After that, the Corps of Engineers dredged the Raritan Channel, creating 66 additional acres of land.
Today, that land along with 64 more acres, mostly owned by the city, forms the South Amboy's southern waterfront redevelopment area, where the Baker project is rising. The Baker development follows Shore Gate, which when it opened two years ago was the first sizable new housing in the city in 40 years. Since then, all of the project's 114 one- and two-bedroom units have been sold for prices ranging from $89,000 to $139,000, said Tony Danza of North Haledon, the developer.
At Lighthouse Bay, the 115 town houses will have three bedrooms and 2,200 to 2,600 square feet and one- or two-car garages. The one-family detached homes, each on 8,000-square-foot lots, will have 2,300 to 3,500 square feet, three or four bedrooms and two-car garages. 
All the residences will have balconies, porches, patios or decks. The project will also offer a 3,000-square-foot waterside community center, including a pool, Mr. Baker said. 
He said prices would start in the high $200,000 range for the town houses and in the low $300,000 range for the single-family homes and go to $500,000. Sales will start in June, with initial occupancy by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
In Dance, Preserving A Precarious Legacy Begins Onstage

BYLINE:  By ANN DALY; Ann Daly teaches performance studies at the University of Texas at Austin.

 BODY:
ONCE the arcane domain of historians and librarians, preservation has become a veritable rallying cry throughout the dance world. Maybe it's a sign of the flagging energy of contemporary dance, or a case of millennial self-consciousness about the past and future, or the result of conservative funding priorities, but preservation now occupies a top spot on the field's agenda. Organizations like the Dance Heritage Coalition, the National Initiative to Preserve America's Dance and the George Balanchine Foundation have succeeded in raising consciousness about the critical and immediate need to safeguard the notoriously precarious legacy of American dance. 
 The call for preservation raises a fundamental question: what is lost to us if a dance tradition dies? It's a question to be considered not just by the preservation movement but by everyone interested in cultural policy. 
 Take the case of Martha Graham. After suspending operations nearly nine months ago, the Martha Graham School reopened on Jan. 16. The company remains in limbo, however, and its modern-dance repertory, one of the great documents of 20th-century America, is at risk of perishing. Paradoxically, Graham, who died in 1991 at the age of 96, was named by the Dance Heritage Coalition as one of "America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures" a few months after the board of her nearly bankrupt dance center announced the shutdown last May. 
A dance treasure, however, is not a sunken chest of gold doubloons. Once buried, it can never truly be retrieved. In order to maintain the integrity of a classical repertory, a dancer must be in constant training for a specific technique and style. Videotape and notation notwithstanding, dance is an oral tradition, whose fullness of history, meaning and conditions of creation are passed along from generation to generation. It is not a treasure that can be framed, stored or polished. Dance is a practice, not an object.
This is not to say that dance should not be documented. It should be documented, preserved and made accessible. The Library of Congress, which acquired the Martha Graham Archives in 1998, has planned to create a "living history" on video, produce multimedia reference works and sponsor live performances. 
But preservation does not substitute for actual performance, in which individuals gather in a public arena for a shared experience and, potentially, a shared conversation. 
At a conference on cultural policy last October in Washington (sponsored by Americans for the Arts and the Center for Arts and Culture), Julia Foulkes, a dance historian and professor at the New School University, called the fate of Graham's company "a dramatic expose of the fragile existence of modern dance."
Ms. Foulkes traced the difficulties of modern dance in American culture: "Its relatively short history, the high labor costs involved in a performing art, the lack of permanence of the artworks, compounded by the difficulty in recording and preserving dance or reproducing it in any commodified form." And she concluded with an impassioned plea: "If Graham's company and school do not survive, I hope we can at least carry forth this insight into formulating cultural policy for the 21st century."
The federal government officially maintains a "no policy" cultural policy -- despite its myriad tax codes, military bands, arts agencies, fellowship and exchange programs, educational standards, archives and museums, monuments, national parks, cultural attaches, broadcast regulations and copyright laws, and the First Amendment. 
In the last two decades, however, a cultural policy network has developed among researchers, administrators and policy makers. Literature has been published, university programs established and annual conferences organized. By last August, when the Pew Charitable Trusts announced an initiative to "usher in a new era of cultural policy development," the idea had gained critical mass. Beginning in March, the Center for Arts and Culture, an independent research organization, will release a series of recommendations and issue briefs on "Art, Culture and the National Agenda."
During the debates over money for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the scarcity of reliable research on the arts hampered the cultural sector in making a compelling case for them. As a result, a flurry of dollars has been directed toward data collection, much of it economic. Many a researcher is now gathering numbers to prove that the arts produce a measurable, significant and meritorious impact on the economy. 
The problem with this approach is its implication that the arts are justifiable only through their market value. If Graham's company generated less local restaurant and parking revenue one year than the year before, would it then be that much less valuable to us? The case to be made for Graham -- or any other artist -- is as a public good, not as an economic good. 
When the arts endowment was founded in the 1960's, art -- defined specifically as high art -- was seen as needing protection against the pernicious incursion of popular culture (not to mention communist culture). As such, support for artists served as an antidote to an increasingly commercialized society. By the 1980's, the social role of the artist had shifted, for two reasons. First, popular culture was no longer the enemy. Second, what qualified as art was no longer restricted to high art. 
Mary Schmidt Campbell, a former Cultural Affairs Commissioner of New York City and now dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, interprets the past decade's "culture wars" -- intense public debates over the nature, purpose and financial support of art -- as a backlash against this thriving cultural pluralism. "Diversity was the mandate of the Endowments," she wrote in a 1998 essay. "Having achieved this diversity, however, the Endowments are now witnessing a public deeply uncomfortable with its ramifications." 
If diversity was a mandate, it turned out not to be an end in itself. As the variety of artistic practices in America proliferates, their vital, if underrecognized, role in the democratic process becomes more pronounced. 
The arts are a public forum where we tell one another -- in symbolic language -- who we are, who we've been and who we'd like to become. Every artwork is, as Graham titled one of her dances, an "American Document" that can incite and engage the imagination of its audience. The arts frame an opportunity for civic dialogue, when commonalities as well as differences can be debated and elaborated. That was the message in Pittsburgh last November, when leading business and foundation executives signed the Pittsburgh Arts Accords, affirming private sector support of the arts. The arts "empower people to participate effectively in a democratic society," the accords said, "by developing skills of perception, reflection, interpretation and communication, which promote understanding of diverse and cross-cultural values."
Graham tackled some of the most fundamental, enduring and contested issues of American identity: the tension between individual and community, the mastery of space, the dilemma of womanhood and the social role of ritual and religion. For a younger generation just discovering the Graham company last season, and eager for more, her languishing repertory is a lost opportunity to participate in the continuing creation of our national life.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Film or Digital? Don't Fight. Coexist.

BYLINE:  By JOHN BAILEY; John Bailey, a member of the American Society of Cinematographers, is on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD 

 BODY:
THE ninth-floor screening room of DuArt Lab, on West 55th Street in Manhattan, is a home away from home for many exhausted filmmakers. They collapse into its chairs late at night to munch pizza while watching the "dailies" of their current production. I know it well. I have photographed a dozen feature films in New York in the last 15 years. So what was I doing a few weeks ago arriving in broad daylight carrying a roll of 35-millimeter film that had just arrived from a lab in Los Angeles?
 I just had to see 15 minutes of "The Anniversary Party," the feature-length drama starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, which I had photographed this past summer, as soon as the film was ready. In the strictest sense, "Anniversary Party" is not a "film" at all. It is a movie shot -- "captured" is the term of choice -- on digital videotape. And this reel, which I pass to the whimsical projectionist Norberto Valle Jr., is the first segment processed for theatrical release: color corrected and transferred to 35-millimeter film by two Los Angeles companies in the forefront of digital imaging. 
 As Norberto threads the projector, he proudly tells me of his daughter's studies at Princeton. And the moment seems to crystallize the meeting point of several different journeys: her future, my past and the possibilities for a technology that could become the launch vehicle for Hollywood movies as they soar somewhat uncertainly into the digital skies -- trailing behind them the last vestiges of many jobs like Norberto's.
The American cinema's past has for the last 30 years been intertwined with the rise of American film schools. Many of the producers, directors, writers, cinematographers and editors making mainstream movies today are graduates of those schools, and, like me, most have made their movies on 35-millimeter motion picture film. But a friend who teaches cinematography at a major film school recently lamented that his students were refusing to shoot their projects on film. This generation of filmmakers-to-be grew up with camcorders, and they find it bothersome to learn what they call the "technical stuff," like focus and exposure. They relish the immediacy of video and consider its hands-on ease of operation a birthright.
But in 1969, a few years out of film school at the University of Southern California, I happily joined the major film union, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, as an assistant cameraman -- to do the "technical stuff." The first studio film I worked on was Monte Hellman's cult classic "Two-Lane Blacktop." Seven years later, I was the camera operator on "Days of Heaven," a film by Terrence Malick. The Academy Award-winning cinematography of the late Nestor Almendros on this movie remains a touchstone for the ravishing beauty and luminous detail that celluloid film can capture. Since 1978, I have used this medium to photograph more than 40 feature films, from "American Gigolo" and "Ordinary People" to "As Good as It Gets" -- all of them photographed, printed and exhibited on motion picture film. When "The Anniversary Party" is released later this year, it too, will be printed and exhibited on film. But its capture, on digital video, was my first foray into the world my friend's students take for granted.
I used the European PAL 25-frame system, which promises a clearer, more resolved image than the current American standard, NTSC. But all the video systems being embraced by a new generation of "digerati" are poor stepchildren to the one developed by Sony and Panavision. Called HD 24P because of its higher definition, this is the camera George Lucas recently used to photograph the forthcoming "Star Wars: Episode II," the one for which he expressed such unqualified enthusiasm, the one whose result he called "indistinguishable from film." 
His claim has ignited a firestorm of rebuttal from dissenting filmmakers, some of whom have seen and used the HD 24P video camera in tests and actual production. Many filmmakers are convinced that celluloid film is still far superior to digital videotape in tone, texture, color and the capacity to resolve detail and complex patterns. They further claim that film cameras have more flexibility and reliability in actual work conditions, and that motion picture film and cameras are capable of significant refinement beyond current levels. No less a filmmaker than Steven Spielberg has said that so long as film labs remain open, he will make his movies on film.
When I began photographing "Anniversary Party" in Los Angeles for its co-stars, who also wrote and directed it, I had no intention of being sucked into this maelstrom. For me, the worst part of the hysteria is that it is the manufacturers and studio marketers who seem most invested in getting rid of film and who stand to rake in the most profits. For them, it is not an issue of creative expression, aesthetics or improved picture quality. It is an issue of bottom-line economics. In their hoped-for environment of total control of the means of distribution and exhibition, millions of dollars would be saved on each film by eliminating bulky film negatives and prints. Elaborate encoding formulas would also act as a curb on piracy and unlicensed exhibition.
But what is at stake is too important to be left to the number crunchers. If cinema is the defining art form of our time, the artists who make the movies, who create the drama and execute the images that so move us, should also be its custodians. If image capture is now the major battlefield in this film-versus-video war, the cinematographer is on the front line. His skilled eyes see to it that the work of writers, directors, editors and designers is conveyed properly to the audience; the cinematographer must be heard, not just enlisted for an ex-post-facto rubber stamping (as happened in the development of the 16-by-9 format for high-definition TV). For if the video-equipment manufacturers and the accountants looking for ever larger profit margins have their way, movies on celluloid film will soon exist only in temperature- and humidity-controlled vaults, nothing more than revered icons of a lost, lamented "Silver Age."
On the other hand, times do change, and no one wants to be left behind. Which brings me back to "The Anniversary Party." Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming wanted to tell the story of an intimate gathering of friends that goes terribly wrong. They asked some of their friends -- Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jane Adams, John Hickey, Parker Posey, Mina Badie and Jennifer Beals -- to act in it with them. Because of its very low budget (despite the cast), its superfast 19-day shooting schedule and its informal video techniques, Jennifer and Alan call it their "home movie." 
In agreeing to photograph it for them on video, I was responding to their desire to give the movie a sense of immediacy and spontaneity while reflecting the lush, upscale lifestyle of its characters. I was also hoping to answer for myself questions that had arisen during my participation in a panel discussion on new technology at last year's Sundance Festival. The audience of predominantly young filmmakers seemed, along with most of the panel, convinced that film (celluloid) was dead. This was news to me, even though dozens of articles have been insistently making the point for a year. But it did seem that the days when student filmmakers complained bitterly of having to use video cameras on their first-year projects were gone. Film had become, in these circles, decidedly unhip.
I have sympathy with these young film artists seeking to redefine the medium. My own generation of film students -- Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Brian De Palma -- fell under the spell of the French New Wave of the 60's, which had taken film and socio-political issues onto the streets and into the cafes of Paris. Within a few years, my peers were adapting the New Wave's revolutionary techniques to American cinema, creating a radical and fresh style that is now established movie grammar. How different are these young people, dazzled by the possibilities opened by Dogma 95, the Danish movement?
Begun by the directors Thomas Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier, Dogma 95 rejects the use of lighting, camera dollies, scored music and a host of other tools of mainstream cinema. Its reductionist aesthetic is a perfect framework for the spontaneity and improvisatory tendencies of many digital video movies. It argues for a democratization of the medium. Thousands of these movies are now being churned out by young people working without any studio oversight, hopeful that their cinema will capture the ever-elusive zeitgeist of a culture hellbent on moving on to the Next New Thing.
So when Jennifer and Alan asked me to photograph "Anniversary Party" on digital video rather than film, I embraced the concept in a spirit of discovery and reinvention. My wife, Carol Littleton, who is editing the movie, speculated that if our friend Larry Kasdan were to make "The Big Chill" with us today, we might encourage him to use digital video (even though we know that posterity might not have access to it, just as we can no longer view some of the more than 70 video formats that have come and gone since videotape was introduced).
So here I am at the DuArt screening room to review this first reel of film rendered from the original video. These final scenes of "Anniversary Party" contain both day and night sequences and shots made in very high-contrast sunlight. What I see is a surprise: after watching it a few times, I decide that the video-to-film footage looks much better than I had expected. 
Of course, this isn't an accident. Throughout the shooting and postproduction, state-of-the-art techniques were used to optimize picture quality. First, a master digital videotape was assembled from a clone of the original camera tapes. Then, using a DaVinci 2K digital color-correction system, Mike Sowa at Laser-Pacific Media Corporation made a final master on the D1 format. From this, David Hays at the video facility E-Film made a 35-millimeter film negative on an Arri laser recorder, the best of all the current tape-to-film machines. The negative was further corrected for color and density at Deluxe Lab by the film timer Mike Milliken. This is the elaborate, costly and time-consuming journey any digital movie makes to reach the projectors of a local multiplex; a movie captured on 35-millimeter film is simply printed at the lab. 
Is this final result in the tape-to-film process as good as film, as good as film printed from an original film negative? Well, I can only say it is different, fundamentally different. To understand why, we have to look at the differences in the capture surfaces, where the image is created. The silver halide crystals embedded in the film emulsion, the surface that contains the pictorial record, are random and continuous. There is no definite pattern to the crystal array, called grain, and it is assuredly an analog process. Shadow and highlight detail, color definition and image sharpness can have an enormous range and subtlety, limited only by the size of the negative frame itself. Whether Super-8 or Imax, it is the same film. Video capture, however, happens on a chip called a CCD. The limiting factor is not just the size of the chip but the number of pixels on it. These pixels are not random or shifting. Their position is fixed. A good analogy for the pixel array is an image made of mosaic tiles. 
Imagine that the position and defining borders of the tiles remain static as the images on the tiles continually change. The question arises: is this pattern apparent, even subliminally? Does the static pixel array of digital video render images whose quality is fundamentally different from those created by the ever shifting, random movement of film grain? Is the dreamlike state of suspension that we associate with film inherent in its photochemical architecture?
Joerg Agin, president of the Entertainment Imaging division of Eastman Kodak, compared the current state of film and digital video capture in a report in a recent issue of the International Cinematographers Guild magazine. In Mr. Agin's view, if you were to scan a single frame of 35-millimeter color negative film, you could convert it to a digital file of 9 million to 12 million pixels. The CCD recording chip of the Sony HD 24P camera records effectively about two million pixels for each of the three primary colors, significantly less than the number of a high-quality film frame. This is a theoretical comparison, and some video engineers dismiss such numbers, as the technologies are totally different. But I find it a helpful way to explain the difference to nontechno-geek filmgoers. Many other technical and aesthetic considerations -- contrast, exposure latitude, color definition, frame rates and exposure sensitivity -- also enter the equation; and none of these seems to tip the balance toward any existing video system. In addition, in an era of "run and gun" production, working cinematographers and directors must assess the equipment's portability, speed of setup and reliability under extremes of weather.
While serving on the foreign film committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over the last six weeks, I watched feature films from more than 35 countries. Several used elaborate digital techniques, like the Taiwanese "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." But some, like Portugal's "Too Late" (shot in the mud and tidal waters of the Tagus River) or Iran's "Time for Drunken Horses" (shot in the extreme cold and snow of the mountains bordering Iraq), favor the proven durability of film cameras.
After finishing the film rendering of "The Anniversary Party," I had the opportunity to participate with two fellow cinematographers, Aaron Schneider and James Chressanthis, in a test sponsored by Eastman Kodak. Kodak, deeply involved in digital imaging as well as its traditional film business, wanted a fair comparison of film and video for presentations. So we shot with film and video cameras side by side under exactly the same conditions.
BOTH systems were used in challenging photographic situations -- all the tests I had seen previously were made under very controlled conditions favorable to video. I attempted to use both the film and video cameras in more stressful and revealing settings. The results are being finished on both tape and film, and will be shown in both media. On the basis of my initial viewings, I don't expect to abandon film any time soon. And that is the medium I will employ with the director Callie Khouri for "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," which we will start shooting in early April.
For the most part, "Anniversary Party" was shot with the technical polish that is the hallmark of mainstream Hollywood films. We adopted a Dogma 95 aesthetic only for an early scene of a game of charades, and then in the climactic scenes in which the characters' close-knit relationships begin to unravel under the influence of the drug Ecstasy. So "Anniversary Party" is a kind of hybrid, a movie made by traditional filmmakers using tools and techniques of the newer medium. And here, it seems to me, lies the lesson at the core of the whole film-or-digital debate.
In the mid-19th century, within a decade of the invention of photography, writers announced the imminent death of painting. But in fact the rise of photography freed painting from its more onerous task of simply recording reality. Beginning with Impressionism and onward through Abstract Expressionism, painting recreated itself. Photography and painting cross-fertilized each other in an ongoing dialogue throughout the 20th century. Film and video can do this in the 21st. They should coexist, not compete, each pursuing and further developing its unique qualities. It is unfortunate that much of the current dialogue consists of partisans of one medium attacking partisans of the other from behind ever more entrenched battle lines. Perhaps it will be a new generation of viewers now in their infancy, with eyes not yet trained to the look and texture of film, who will calmly assess and accept the limits and merits of each.

HEADLINE: New Haven and Yale: A Couple With a History 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
FOR much of Yale's history, its significance was overshadowed by other concerns: shipping, then carriage-making, then weapons production.
 Envisioned as an academy for ministers in the Congregational Church and civil servants, the Collegiate School was formed in 1701 in and around Saybrook, 50 miles east of New Haven. When the college, soon to be named for merchant Elihu Yale, arrived in New Haven, the town boasted four public buildings: the meeting house of the First Society, a small jail on College Street, a grammar school and a guardhouse for the night watch, wrote former Yale professor Rollin G. Osterweis in "Three Centuries of New Haven." 
 The advent of Yale coincided with the rise of the New Haven port, and the quiet town transformed itself into a thriving commercial center. 
Between 1748 and 1774, New Haven's population swelled to more than 8,000 from 1,400, Mr. Osterweis wrote, and schools of masted ships flocked to the popular port.
With the separate growth of economy and academy, the 19th century ushered in a series of town-gown clashes.
"What could have been more delightful than for off-duty sailors and restless college boys to bait each other?" reasoned Brooks Mather Kelley in "Yale: A History."
During an 1806 riot, the townspeople were so offended by the behavior of a student by the name of Guy Richards that they dubbed him the College Bully, a title the students apparently relished: They co-opted the post and elected their own Bully until the faculty banned the position in 1840, Mr. Kelley said.
There was a five-day riot in 1824 when residents got word that Yale Medical School students had snatched a body from the West Haven cemetery for use as a cadaver.
And in 1854, after a dispute between residents and students erupted at the Homan's Atheneum theater, a mob of townspeople followed about 50 Yale men back to campus, hurling rocks and bricks from a nearby construction site. A resident was stabbed to death, although a grand jury investigation into the killing was wrapped up without an indictment.
By the time Yale was officially declared a university in 1887, it was a relatively minor fixture within a booming hub, home to a robust carriage industry, the largest lock producer in the country and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.
"Yale was just a place up by the green, which held itself a little bit apart from the city," Mr. Leeney said.
Beginning with the Great Depression and again after a post-World War II decline in arms production, industry fell away, leaving the city and the university staring at one another across the green.
As the Depression crippled New Haven, Yale, which had started amassing turf during the early 1920's, embarked on a building boom fueled by an influx of cash from the Harkness family and John W. Sterling, an 1864 graduate who willed $15 million to his alma mater. Even as the heavy construction engendered resentment within the have-not camp, buildings like Harkness Tower and Sterling Memorial Library supplied jobs.
"Ironically, the building of those buildings saved New Haven from the Great Depression," said Judith A. Schiff, an archivist whose office at Sterling library is cluttered with photographs and books that tell the story of the city, the university and its centuries-old partnership.
New Haven grew increasingly troubled during the 20th century, its post-war manufacturing base eroding again after the Vietnam War as companies moved South. Yale, however, simply grew: its endowment swelled to $10 billion, and with time it acquired $2.9 billion worth of property.
"It's the best moment in the last 100 years in the history of the university's relations with the city," said Gaddis Smith, Yale's Larned Professor of History, emeritus, and the author of a forthcoming book about Yale in the 20th century. Still, he cautioned, "Who knows where the economy is going? As a historian I know that nothing ever moves in a straight line."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
A Sushi Baron Expands

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

 BODY:
JAY KIM admits that supermarket sushi has a bad reputation. But Mr. Kim, who opened his first sushi bar in a Dobbs Ferry convenience store eight years ago, is determined to change people's perceptions.
 "You can't fake it with sushi," he said. "I have to make sure everything is fresh; that's the most important thing." 
 Mr. Kim specializes in providing fresh sushi in unexpected places, like the convenience store, private parties, and functions held at catering halls, including the Doral Arrowwood, the Tarrytown House, and The Castle. Last year, he opened a branch of his Sushi by Jay in a Scarsdale storefront and the real estate agent who brokered the deal suggested that he expand into supermarkets. 
Mr. Kim balked at the idea until he met Rick Sciulla, then the seafood manager at the Edwards chain, which was converted to Stop & Shop. The two bonded immediately. 
"Jay is from the old school," Mr. Sciulla said. "He does a lot of little things that separate himself from the rest. Other companies are very commercial; Jay is the opposite of commercial."
In Stop & Shop, Mr. Kim found a kindred company. "They understand that quality is important," he said. "When you deal with other supermarkets, you know what they ask first? What percent can you give us? Those guys, they asked, 'How can you make the customer happy?' That's why I liked them."
So last April, he opened full-service sushi bars in three Stop & Shop stores in New Jersey and one on Long Island. This year, he will expand into another 25 outlets and sell his own brand of soy sauce, wasabi and other sushi supplements. 
Mr. Kim attributed his success to avoiding common sushi sins, like leaving the fish out too long or using frozen yellowtail and tuna. At his supermarket counters, raw sushi orders are prepared while customers shop the aisles, and the menu is as extensive as that of most Japanese restaurants. The store provides the equipment and takes a percentage of his gross. He supplies the fish and the employees. 
Mr. Kim is frugal and proud of it. He keeps his overhead low, makes deliveries in an economy car and works out of an office in his Ardsley home. His wife, Ellita, fills in behind the counterin his Dobbs Ferry space or in Scarsdale when necessary.
For someone accustomed to keeping close tabs on all aspects of his business, growth presents challenges. Mr. Kim plans to franchise his counters out to experienced sushi chefs who will be responsible for conforming to his strict standards. He will also rent warehouse and office space and play more of a supervisory role to ensure that the overall supply is fresh.
"They will be my clones," he said. "When you see the name Sushi by Jay, the customers have to trust the product. I'm not going to expand just for the sake of it. If I can't keep the quality up, I'll cut back."
In his native Korea, Mr. Kim worked in a sushi restaurant to put himself through college. He became a salesman after he graduated, but shed the suit and tie in 1986 when he moved to Rockland County and began working in a Manhattan fish store that featured a sushi bar. 
An advertisement in a Korean newspaper took him to Dobbs Ferry, where the proprietors of Chang's Market sought someone to rent and operate their in-house sushi bar. Ownership of the convenience store has since changed hands -- it's now called Brothers Market -- and Mr. Kim, 45, outgrew his cramped space. He gained additional space and now seats 10 customers and does a brisk take-out business. 
During a typical dinner rush, the head chef, Tom Tran, prepares hand rolls and slices slabs of raw fish with assembly-line efficiency. Mr. Tran and his fellow chefs, Yeesoon Wong and Jacob Choy, move with the economical grace of modern dancers. Mr. Wong balances on his tiptoes to add a dollop of sauce atop a piece of sea urchin, for example, and Mr. Choy reaches around Mr. Tran to fill a take-out tray without knocking him over.
Mr. Kim, whose round face is framed by an arc of gray hair, is a hands-off boss who is quick to laugh, but he is serious about sushi. His efforts have cultivated a loyal customer base, particularly among students at Dobbs Ferry Middle School and High School, just up the road from his store.
"The upper grades are allowed to go off-campus for lunch and I get so jealous when my sister tells me, 'I had sushi for lunch,' and all I had was cafeteria food," said Kate Sterne, 11, a middle school student, as she picked up an order of dumplings and California rolls for dinner with her friends Nicole Bisceglia, 11, and Kristina Dibisceglie, 12. 
Later, several high school students from the Masters School, a private school nearby, crowded around the sushi bar. 
"It's my third time here this week," said Lindsay Brox.
Sarah Adler-Milstein said, "Everyone at school loves Jay's," as her friends Annie Sklaver, David End and Lisa Riordan nodded in agreement. 
Mr. Kim takes particular pride in serving the youngsters. For their sake, he has not raised prices in his flagship store. "Maybe this is Asian thinking, but when kids come with a dollar or two and ask me how much for that, I feel they have to eat first before I make money," he said. 
"Sometimes they come and say 'Jay, I have $2, can I have a California roll?' I say, 'What the heck.' I think about my child. If he wanted to eat something and he had only $2, I'd want him to eat. One time a student said to me: 'Hey, Jay. You're the best thing that ever happened in this town.' It was kind of cute. Maybe he wanted some free sushi, I don't know." 
Mr. Kim may be a shrewder businessman than he lets on. For now, most students limit themselves to imitation crab, the main ingredient of a California roll, but they just might graduate to more sophisticated fare, like raw yellowtail and fluke. 
In time, they may even become as adventurous as Craig Ruoff, one of Mr. Kim's most devoted customers, who often dines on esoteric items like salmon roe and sea urchin. A picture of Mr. Ruoff and his wife, Jennifer, hangs on the sushi bar's wall and the couple hired Mr. Kim to cater their wedding reception at Temple Beth Am-Shalom in White Plains. 
"He was the hit of the party," said Mr. Ruoff, an Irvington resident. "People still talk about it. My wife and I are sushi addicts and we're picky about where we go. There are a lot of good Japanese restaurants in Westchester, but when you meet Jay and talk with him, he's so likable you want to give him your business."

HEADLINE: Proposal for Fewer I-95 On-Ramps 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE WOODSIDE 

 BODY:
INTERSTATE 95 in Connecticut, also called the Connecticut Turnpike, is not like turnpikes in other states, where exits might be 15 miles apart. Here, travelers can jump on and off every half-mile in some areas. Studies of driving habits prove that I-95 is used as a handy route across town as well as the main thoroughfare out of the state.
 The frequency of on-off ramps aren't the main cause of congestion, according to the State Department of Transportation. That cause would be simply the number of cars and trucks on the road: four times the amount of vehicles it was designed to handle in the 1950's. Every day, for example, about 160,000 cars go by a fixed counting point in Bridgeport. 
 A committee Gov. John Rowland appointed last year, after holding a transportation summit, was charged with finding ways to improve traffic flow in the state, which officials think now is in danger of interrupting the smooth flow of the economy. That 15-member group, which includes officials from state agencies, legislators and business people, has proposed closing six of the on-ramps on I-95 during rush hours. They believe that when fewer cars merge, more cars will move.
On weekday mornings, between 6 and 9 a.m., the on-ramps heading south, toward New York City, would close at Interchange 4 in Greenwich, 12 in Darien, 21 and 23 in Fairfield, 31 in Stratford, and 35 in Milford.
Between 3 and 6 p.m. the on-ramps heading north, toward New Haven, would close at the same interchanges, except that the No. 12 ramp would be open in Darien, where the committee thinks a new extra lane there helps traffic, and interchange 10 would close in Noroton.
None of the off-ramps would close. Traffic always would be able to get off the highway. Closing lanes won't dramatically clear out I-95, but it will help, said Richard A. Martinez, chief of planning for the State Department of Transportation. 
"In roughly the 50 miles from the New York state line to New Haven, there are 48 interchanges," he said. "What happens every time you have a ramp that comes on, you have a conflict point, because the traffic on the ramp has to weave or merge in with the traffic that's already there. Any time you get any kind of turbulence, that creates backup."
Mr. Martinez said the D.O.T.'s most recent traffic counts and surveys found that the average trip length on I-95 during rush hours is only seven miles. "If you use the local roads and kind of go around, you might get there in the same period of time," he said.
Mr. Martinez said the committee chose the ramps it picked because those are areas where the traffic is heavy. He said they have yet to meet with local officials or business people. The State Legislature would have to vote on the ramp closures, and the earliest they could be closed would be about a year from now. 
Business people and officials in Milford said they don't want any ramps to close at Interchange 35. They worry that sending traffic, (including trucks) on back roads could cause more problems.
Bic Drive is home to many industries and businesses that include the Bic Corporation, Subway International, the Milford Ice Pavilion, G.E. Credit Union, AT&T, Northeast Electronics, the Milford Power Company, the Gas Equipment Engineering Corporation, a condominium complex called Caswell Cove, and the sewage treatment plant for the city of Milford.
Any employee of one of the companies who lived west of Milford would drive through back roads to go home at the end of the day. Any trucker who came from Fairfield County or New York to make an early morning delivery would be faced with a gate and a police officer when trying to get back on the highway.
"The only two ways I could see would be down Plains Road through a residential area and then enter the highway at Exit 36," said Kenneth Brannin, vice president of production and regional plant services at Bic, where 1,200 employees working three shifts make pens, shavers and lighters. 
Mr. Brannin said Bic has staggered the workers' shifts to improve traffic flow onto the highway. He said traffic problems would worsen on the back roads if the ramps closed, while the closure wouldn't do much to improve flow on I-95.
Subway World Headquarters sits only a quarter-mile from Interchange 35. Les Winograd, public relations coordinator for Subway, said most of the employees live toward New Haven, meaning that they couldn't easily get back on the highway after work.
"We have over 500 employees who are probably going to be driving through windy, narrow side streets coming from the north side," he said.
"
In Fairfield, a car merging onto 95 northbound at Exit 21 will push into cars and trucks trying to slow down for a highway service station, directly after which is Exit 22, and, a half-mile farther, Exit 23. This stretch is always crowded at peak times. John C. Metsopoulos, Fairfield's first selectman, said the plan is worth trying. "If we can reduce during rush hour people using the highway to get from one end of town to the other, it could have a very beneficial effect," he said. "It would keep local traffic local, encouraging them to use local businesses in the morning. It would encourage interstate travelers to stay on the highway." 
Mr. Metsopoulos, who was a state legislator representing the 132nd District between 1984 and 1994, said he supported closing entrance ramps during his second two-year term and "was told that will never work. I'm glad to see it's being looked at." 
"I-95 is an interstate highway," Mr. Metsopoulos added. "It's not a local road, and yet the exits are designed almost to make it a local road. If we're going to get it to flow better as an interstate, we have to use it like an interstate." 
Darien First Selectman Robert F. Harrel Jr. said that closing ramps would do more good if they were closed all the time, not just at certain hours. Closing the New York-bound on-ramp at Interchange 12, in the heart of the town, and the New Haven-bound ramp at Interchange 10 in Noroton, both could help if it didn't cause more confusion, he said.
"I don't believe in closing these things at rush hour. Close them. Put barriers up," Mr. Harrel added. He suggested trying it for six months. 
Mr. Harrel, who attended most of the transportation committee meetings, said he and other officials in his region have insisted on solving the highway problem for more than a year.
He said he will push the state government to study the traffic flows in Darien before and after the ramps close, to see if doing so changed anything. "I want to find out the way the rats run," Mr. Harrel said. "Eighteen thousand people live here, and they want to have at least a semi-scientific look at this."

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE; 
Great Neck Arrival Is a Step Up in Value

BYLINE:  By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM; E-mail: licarte@nytimes.com

 BODY:
REFINED, often remarkably good food at reduced prices is the story at the three-month-old Giraffe Room in the Inn at Great Neck. There have been a number of restaurants in this little hotel at 30 Cutter Mill Road (516-773-2000) in the heart of Great Neck Village -- some excellent, others disappointing and all quite expensive. This casual but still classy room, with sculptured, stuffed and carved giraffes, diverse bright china and exceptional three-course, $19.95 fixed-price dinner from Sunday through Friday ($25.95 on Saturdays), is less stuffy and far more economical than its predecessors.
 The fixed-price dinner is not a skimpy, cut-rate affair but an absolute steal of a meal, offering most of the dishes on the a la carte menu, including shrimp cocktail, she-crab soup, clams casino, prime rib of beef, salmon and seafood paella. A la carte portions were larger than those on the fixed price menu but the ones on the set meal were sufficient. Few patrons will complain about the quantity and even fewer about the quality of the food here. 
 The waiters, who knew who ordered each dish and even suggested cutting into the center of the roast beef "to be sure it's done the way you want it," the subtle Latin twists given to many offerings by Antonio Alvarado, the executive chef, and the cool jazz sounds filtering into the dining room on Wednesday through Saturday nights) from performers in the adjacent lounge -- all made dining at the Giraffe Room a lovely experience.
Patrons sit in the warm, woody, luxurious room, with its columns and sconce lighting, and tackle memorable steaks, terrific pieces of tender prime rib of beef covered with onions; flaky baked salmon in a caramelized onion crust; and a fresh red snapper with a peppy, chunky tomato-dominated sauce that enhances rather than overwhelms the fish's delicate white flesh; and memorable steaks.
The buttery filet mignon, with its seductive roasted shallot-merlot sauce, and the crusty, 14-ounce New York strip steak, with its full-bore beefy flavor and caramelized onions, were worth the additional $6.50 price. Given a boost by its mango salsa, grilled swordfish, which is often chalky-dry, was almost juicy here. Only a slightly dry cashew chicken with a drab bourbon peppercorn sauce and an otherwise exemplary paella marred by a load of dreadfully strong, old mussels (half of which didn't open) disappointed.
Appetizers were, if anything, even better than entrees. The four-piece shrimp cocktail was the equal of those at twice its price. The she-crab soup, a rich, creamy South Carolina specialty flavored with sherry and Worcestershire sauce, was as good as you'll find north of the Mason-Dixon Line. The long, slim spring rolls, given a herb-induced Southwestern spin, were worthwhile and the baby green salad, sporting crumbled goat cheese, red and yellow roasted peppers and tangy, top-notch raspberry vinaigrette, was a winner. Caesar salad, with dressing that left a bitter aftertaste, wasn't.
Those who want to dip into the a la carte menu would be well advised to try the ring of five tiny, soft meat-filled Maryland crab cakes ($6.50) or the pan-seared tuna atop a bed of soothing avocado drizzled with habanero pepper coulis that gives the fish a welcome kick.
Desserts on the fixed-price menu were small, satisfactory and limited. A warm, ripe French apple tart a la mode, a trio of mango, lemon and raspberry sorbets with a sprinkling of berries, a homey coconut custard, and especially a fresh fruit plate of sweet honeydew, pineapple and berries, all made the grade.

Openings
There will be a new eatery at the site of the former Woodshed in Bridgehampton, the Almond Bar and Restaurant, at 1970 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton, (631-537-8885). Co-owned by Eric Lemonides and Jason Weiner, the chef, Almond will be a modern French bistro. Mr. Lemonides is a veteran of both Manhattan and the East End, who most recently sold his restaurant, Lunch, on the West Side of lower Manhattan. He also was a maitre d'hotel at Della Femina, Karen Lee's and Pacific East. Mr. Weiner was the executive sous chef at Aqua in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. He was also a chef at Charles Nob Hill in San Francisco after leaving Manhattan's China Grill and was the sous chef at Nick & Toni's during the summer of 1997. At Almond, classic bistro entrees like steak frites, snapper Provencal and roast chicken will be in the $14 to $19 range. It will also offer sandwiches like the croque monsieur, fish po' boy and a burger.

HEADLINE: An Intricate Bond; 
New Haven's Past and Future Are So Tied to Yale, but It Took 300 Years for the Two to Get Along

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
FROM behind the wheel of his silver Lincoln Town Car, Bruce Alexander turned left onto Winchester Avenue, a humble pockmarked strip that is something of a crossroad for the city of New Haven.
 To his right was a low-slung white building that houses what remains of the Winchester Repeating Arms company, once the core of the New Haven economy and one of the city's largest employers. 
 To his left was a cluster of brick office buildings with tall windows, buildings that host a smattering of biotechnology companies that Yale University spawned and that its officials say represent the new heights to which Yale has taken its commitment to the city.
For all the street's lack of aesthetic glory, Winchester Avenue, no less than the stunning Sterling Memorial Library or the well-preserved town green, tells the story of New Haven at a time when the city's Ivy League centerpiece is marking its tercentennial. And Mr. Alexander, one of Yale's seven officers and its first to focus exclusively on the university's relations with New Haven, represents the face of Yale as it assumes a greater role in the life of its oft-maligned, and at times deeply depressed, host city. 
Since New Haven outbid Hartford as home to the Collegiate School in 1716, the city and the university have become so interwoven that it is difficult to imagine one without the other. Yale, which now owns about 7 percent of all the land in the city, is its biggest employer and third-largest taxpayer. City government is stocked with Yalies: The head of the housing authority, Robert A. Solomon, is a Yale Law School professor, and Henry J. Fernandez, a graduate of the law school, is the city's economic development administrator.
Yale's significance to New Haven has ripened in the last three centuries, and what was once a feather in the cap of the local leadership has arguably emerged as the force saving New Haven from the fate of other East Coast cities abandoned by industry and grasping about for a future. 
"Bridgeport is New Haven without Yale," said Robert J. Leeney, editor emeritus of The New Haven Register.
"It's located in pretty much the same way. It was an old port," he said, adding, "The Yale presence always did something here."
Well, not always. For years, the university kept its distance from the city, not getting too involved, pretty much letting its host fend for itself. When Susan L. Hartt, the executive director of Market New Haven, told her father, Julian N. Hartt, the 89-year-old former chairman of the Yale Department of Religious Studies, that the university was starting to pay attention to the community, he told her: "Well, it's about time. It only took them about 295 years."
University officials have heralded the arrival of its president Richard C. Levin in 1993 and his appointment of Mr. Alexander in 1997 as one sign of the sea-change in Yale's approach to the world outside its imposing iron gates. Indeed, in recent years Yale has committed $10 million toward subsidies for university employees buying homes within city limits. Through taxable property like a golf course and retail strips, the university has become among the highest taxpayers in the city. 
And in what may prove to be the most impactive development, the university is nurturing the nexus of science and business to create a biotechnology sector that has already brought millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs into town.
"Yale at first did not understand that it had to fill in the gap when those industries and businesses left," said Mr. Alexander, formerly an executive with the Rouse Corporation, where he oversaw the development of Manhattan's South Street Seaport and Harborplace in Baltimore. "I don't know that the university was prepared for that role. I don't think the leadership of the university saw themselves in those terms."
Despite its academic eminence, Yale has not been able to solve New Haven's problems. In some cases, residents have accused the university of being the problem; it has had years of acrimonious labor disputes, and in other cases, the very existence of a bastion of privilege has infuriated the city's impoverished elements by the sheer power of contrast. Nonetheless, the 1,600 pounds and the offer of prime space along the town green that lured Yale here under 300 years ago have proved a priceless investment, and may yet be the city's saving grace. 
"The city isn't going to be healthy unless the people who live here and near here and work here celebrate the city," Ms. Hartt said. The university's involvement "is an expression of the change in Yale's attitude toward its homeland."
And the change in attitude of its homeland toward Yale. When Mayor Richard C. Lee ran for re-election in 1955, his opponent, Phil Mancini, circulated a cartoon depicting the mayor as Yale's quarterback. "Let's Win New Haven Back From Yale," the caption read. Although Mr. Mancini lost, the campaign highlighted a resentment, a sense that Yale's gain was the city's loss. It is a sense that seems to have diminished over time, but has not quite disappeared. 
"There are always people who will hate Harvard; there are always people who will hate Yale," Mr. Lee said in an interview at his Hamden home. "I cannot think of anything where the university was a minus factor."
Today's politics are a world away. Mayor John DeStefano Jr. sees his job as championing Yale, not fighting it. "It's not like in a mayoral campaign anymore you can run against Yale," Mr. DeStefano said. "It doesn't sell anymore."
It doesn't sell, in part, because Yale owns 800 of the city's 12,000 acres and employs 10,000 people.
And so in about 1995, when Mr. Levin, the Yale president, asked the mayor if the university could buy space in the center of town that houses the Whitney Grove Square office building, Mr. DeStefano consented. "It allows my largest employer to grow," he said. "You want your largest employer to grow."
When your largest employer is tax exempt, its growth can make for a mixed fortune, a predicament that was mitigated with passage of the state's payment in lieu of taxes program in 1978. Under the program, which university lobbyists helped push through, the state now pays New Haven 75 percent of what it would collect were educational institutions taxed.
Yale itself paid $2 million in taxes last year on nonexempt properties, plus $2 million for fire service.
Shifts in the tax arrangement have bolstered the city's coffers and the university's reputation, minimizing the disincentives to Yale's growth. Beyond budget lines, though, Yale has and continues to shape New Haven in ways that cannot be quantified, creating a town-gown synthesis that is increasingly deliberate, strategic and serious.
Across the country, universities have been investing in their host communities with renewed vigor, particularly when those communities are less idyllic than, say, Hanover, N.H. or Williamstown, Mass. The good business sense of this approach is clear: Applications dropped between 15 percent and 20 percent, for example, in the two-year period after the sophomore Christian H. Prince was murdered on his way home from an on-campus party. 
"I think that was a true wake-up call for us to recognize the need to be attentive to our larger environment," said Linda K. Lorimer, a vice president and secretary of the university and a trustee at the time of the murder.
A longtime New Haven resident who raised his children here, Mr. Levin, Yale's president, has steered the university on a course that stretches beyond adherence to a national trend. An economist known for his approachable manner, Mr. Levin has won over many longtime critics of the university, and under his leadership Yale has buttressed its commitment to the city with financial investments.
As recently as five years ago, William G. Battle, the director of the Newhallville Restoration Corporation, considered himself a "severe critic" of Yale.
"My biggest complaint now is that they don't do enough," Mr. Battle said. "Yale is very much like an inconstant mistress. You love her, but you've sure got to watch her all the time.
"If they're not well-guided by a president like President Levin, they can be very, very intrusive," he said.
When Mr. Levin arrived as a graduate student in 1970, New Haven was resisting Yale's requests to build two new residential colleges, and relations were "fairly rocky," he recalled. 
"I think that had to do largely with Yale's lack of attention to building the kind of relationship that would have made that something welcomed by the city instead of something that seemed threatening," he said. 
As president, Mr. Levin has tried to "routinize a close connection" with the city by urging new deans and directors to develop programs with an outreach component, for example, and uniting downtown merchants behind a voluntary added tax.
"We've sort of taken our seat at the table and played the role that a good corporate citizen would normally play in a small or medium-sized city, as a source of advice and counsel and often a partner in investment," he said.
Take the university's home buyer program, in which Yale employees who buy houses in town receive $25,000 over 10 years. Since 1994, 441 people have bought homes worth more than $50 million through the program, according to university figures. In recent years, 80 percent have been first-time home buyers, officials said.
While faculty housing subsidies are not uncommon, they are generally seen as a perk to lure professors and off-set high living costs. By extending the benefit to blue-collar workers and excluding New Haven's most exclusive areas, Yale has signaled that its initiative is intended less as a benefit for employees than an attempt to stabilize New Haven.
"Yale is trying to get you to buy in certain neighborhoods that will help the city," said Barbara L. Pearce, the president of H. Pearce Company Realtors. "If you want to buy in a downtown neighborhood now which is very high-end, they're not going to help you do that."
In the 20 years that have passed since Ms. Pearce returned to her hometown after attending Harvard, the change in Yale's approach to the city has been palpable. Fifteen years ago she headed an association of local business leaders, many of whom were wary of giving Yale a seat at the table because the university, they felt, did not share the private sector's concerns.
"The expectation now is if something goes on in New Haven, Yale will step up to the plate, and they'll give as much or more as anybody else," Ms. Pearce said. 
Yale's recent $200,000 contribution to a fund-raising drive for arts organizations was more generous than any corporation's, for example, and the university has committed $750,000 to a marketing campaign geared toward residents and tourists.
Also, hundreds of children benefit from academic and extracurricular programs such as the Leadership, Education and Athletics in Partnership initiative and the Amistad Academy charter school, which Yale students helped envision and establish. 
More concrete are the physical manifestations of Yale's presence in New Haven. Yale has dislodged veteran tenants in favor of lucrative chains (think Yale Co-op vs. Barnes & Noble), but it has also converted rubble-cluttered lots into heavily trafficked hot spots. Yale helped the embattled Dwight neighborhood secure a new Shaw's supermarket, the first supermarket chain to open a branch in downtown New Haven in 30 years.
The anti-gentrification cries that have at times greeted the university's attempts to reconfigure, revamp and refurbish seem to be less vocal these days, but some community leaders remain wary.
The Rev. Scott D. Marks, the lead organizer for the Connecticut Center for a New Economy, a community organization that supports labor unions, said he was ambivalent about Yale's gentrifying influence.
"You can sort of smell the wealth of Yale simmering over to the poor sections of this city," he said, riding past a strip of ramshackle houses, some lived in and others boarded up. "If biotech comes to the city and dominates in the way that they say, eventually this will become very expensive property," he said, asking of the residents: "Where on earth are they going?"
"Somewhere there needs to be a glimmer of the hope that's being kicked around by the university in the poorer areas," he said. "Yale didn't just show up here. They've been here, and they've sort of watched this happen to a city."
Yet when it comes to the Broadway area, where Yale replaced longtime local storeowners who could not afford rising rents in favor of chains, which could, Mr. Marks acknowledged the advantages of the newcomers. "I always support the creation of jobs," he said.
The people most upset about the changes on Broadway seem to be the alumni, who harbor a nostalgia for haunts like the Quality Wine Shop and the Yale Co-op. Now the block is dominated by Barnes & Noble, with Urban Outfitters on the way.
Others point out that Yale is hardly the first landlord to raise rents, and that the benefits of development outweigh the downsides of gentrification.
"It's sort of like saying, gee, the suburbs are being developed," said Mr. Solomon of the Housing Authority. "Yale is the advantage that New Haven has over other cities that would deteriorate but for someone as wealthy as Yale.
These days, business more often than not means the biotechnology boom, which is old news in places like Palo Alto, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass. Yale was slow to react, though, its officials adhering to a purist line and frowning on entrepreneurial alliances. 
That attitude began to change a few years ago, and last year Yale spinoffs raised more than $1 billion in private equity placements and created 1,000 new jobs, said E. Jonathan Soderstrom, managing director of Yale's Office of Cooperative Research. Eighteen biotech companies, six of which are publicly traded, have headquarters in New Haven, and three or four more are expected to begin this year. 
They might settle in Science Park, the nascent biotechnology hub across from the drastically downsized Winchester Repeating Arms. 
While some doubt the viability of the area, which borders blighted neighborhoods and initially failed to attract clients, several developers with sterling track records are betting on its future.
Lyme Properties plans to spend about $200 million to renovate the abandoned Winchester headquarters and, if the demand exists, another $300 million to build a new 1.5 million square-foot complex that will hold a combination of biotechnology and other companies.
"There is absolutely no question that we would not have decided to do this project were it not for the presence of Yale," said David Clem, a managing partner at Lyme.
But even if biotech does take, will it raise the city's poorer populations? 
"It makes New Haven a vibrant city, but it still leaves a group of people who need to be fully trained," said Kevin Rakin, the president and chief financial officer of Genaissance Pharmaceuticals, the largest biotech company in the area. "That is just the reality of a new economy company."
Which is why Mr. Battle, who sits on the board of Science Park, fought hard to have light industry included in the building plans and is considering how he might urge Yale to help train biotechnicians.
"We've had knock-down drag-outs, but I think we've come to a meeting of the minds," he said. "This may be the first time that certain things that are good for Yale are also good for the neighborhoods."

HEADLINE: In Baltimore's West Side, Preservation Story Unfolds 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES BELFOURE 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
TWO and half years ago a development plan that would have demolished hundreds of buildings in Baltimore and filled the cleared area with retail stores, parking garages and residential projects, seemed inevitable.
 The structures that faced demolition included many historic buildings, ranging from Federal-style row houses to an Art Deco store. But the plan involved a section of the city in deep decline, and it had the support of an impressive roster of public agencies and private interests. 
 Now, however, that strategy, known as the West Side Master Plan, has been abandoned. On Jan. 8 an agreement was signed between the city and the Maryland Historical Trust, the state's preservation agency, to scrap the original plan and approach development with an eye toward preserving the neighborhood. 
The new approach, which came about largely through the efforts of two groups, Preservation Maryland and Baltimore Heritage, will protect more than half of the historic buildings in the 28 blocks that make up the Market Center Urban Renewal Area.
For preservation advocates, the agreement is a milestone in the way in which cities handle redevelopment, using preservation instead of a bulldozer.
"This is the largest revitalization plan of its kind in the country," said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who worked with the groups to revise the development plan.
The plan has been changed to preserve 270 buildings out of about 400 with an additional 105 to be reviewed case by case. The remainder are likely to be demolished. The agreement also calls for any new construction to be aesthetically compatible with the neighborhood.
In addition, in any development proposals, the city must require the preservation of the designated buildings, most of which are late 19th century and early 20th century commercial structures. Among the buildings to be preserved are an S. S. Kresge Company store, which was built in 1938 and is one of the few Art Deco structures in downtown, and four other buildings with cast iron facades, including the city's most ornate, the Alberti, Brink & Company building, which was erected in 1867.
The Market Center Renewal Area straddles Howard Street, once Baltimore's most elite shopping thoroughfare, and extends west to Lexington Market and the Baltimore campus of the University of Maryland. The project is expected to cost $355 million while creating 2,500 parking spaces, 350,000 square feet of retail space and 500,000 square feet of residential space. 
Two projects -- the $56 million renovation of the Hippodrome Theater and Bank of America's Center Point project, a $50 million development of retail and residential space -- are scheduled to begin this spring. Projects that are already under way include a $12 million conversion of the former Hecht's department store into apartments and a $15 million conversion of the former Stewarts department store into a "telecom hotel," which contains space rented by telecommunication and Internet companies to house their equipment. 
The battle to preserve the area started in 1998 when the renovation plan was originally unveiled. The plan was financed not by the city but by one of the West Side's biggest property owners, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, a charitable trust. Harry Weinberg, an investor who died in 1990, bought up buildings in the late 1970's when the area was in decline. The foundation, which has assets of $2.5 billion, owns the Stewarts building. The plan recommended demolition for residential buildings, parking garages and "big box" retailers like T. J. Maxx and the Sports Authority. About 150 historic buildings were threatened with condemnation. 
IT was not just the destruction of the buildings but also the suburbanlike solution in the heart of downtown that dismayed residents wanting to preserve the neighborhood. Another crucial issue was the displacement of more than 100 small merchants.
"The plan responded to what the city wanted at that time," said Bernard Siegal, president of the Weinberg Foundation, which, with the University of Maryland and the Baltimore Development Corporation, helped to develop the renovation plan. 
Mr. Siegal said the mayor at the time, Kurt L. Schmoke, wanted to renovate the area quickly and change the character of the neighborhood. Along with the merchants, members of Preservation Maryland and Baltimore Heritage were among the few who spoke against the plan at the time. 
"It was definitely a David and Goliath battle," said Tyler Gearhart, executive director of Preservation Maryland. "No one initially paid any attention to us."
But gradually, the preservation groups built opposition, initially by unveiling a preservation-based development proposal that stressed two issues: the high cost of city acquisition and the economic benefits of using federal and state tax credits to preserve the neighborhood.
The National Trust entered the picture in June 1999 when it named the West Side as one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. At the same time, Preservation Maryland and Baltimore Heritage were surveying the buildings and putting together a nomination for the National Register of Historic Places.
But it was a 10-minute film, "Baltimore's West Side Story," that played an important role in turning the tide in favor of preservation explaining what would be lost if the plan went ahead. In January 2000, the film was shown before the feature film at the Senator Theater, the only remaining Art Deco movie theater in the city. 
About the same time, preservation advocates received another break. The new mayor, Martin J. O'Malley, had voted against the redevelopment plan as a city councilman. 
"O'Malley was a great ally," Mr. Gearhart said, "who understood there had to be a balance between preservation and new development."
Then in February 2000, part of the West Side was listed on the National Register, creating the Market Center Historic District, which largely coincided with the renewal area.
IN the end, State Senator Barbara A. Hoffman of Baltimore became a crucial ally. In April 2000, Senator Hoffman attached language to a bill financing the renovation of the Hippodrome that required the city to minimize demolition and offer fair financial packages to displaced merchants. That requirement led to last month's agreement along with a revised master plan.
"Historic buildings are what make a city different," Senator Hoffman said. "You can go anywhere and see a shopping mall."
The Hippodrome is considered the catalyst to the success of the entire project. The 2,300-seat vaudeville theater, built in 1914 and vacant since the early 1980's, will be combined with two adjacent late 19th century banks into a venue for Broadway-style shows. The Hippodrome block is next to the campus of the University of Maryland and is expected to be the crucial link between the rejuvenated neighborhood and the university. 
While the western edge of downtown Baltimore deteriorated, the university stayed and expanded, and both plans envision the university campus as an anchor in the neighborhood.
The new agreement means some projects like the Weinberg Foundation's proposed $150 million retail development along Lexington Street will have to be redesigned. But Mr. Siegal of the foundation is unperturbed. 
"The city's requirements have changed, and we're working to come up with a plan," he said. "One or two buildings at a time will be converted and leased."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Building at 75 Varick Street, Now 1 Hudson Square; 
A Landlord's Subtractions Lead to an Addition

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY'S zoning rules limit the size of buildings that can be constructed on a given site. But a close reading of those rules can sometimes produce an unexpected benefit for landlords, particularly when an older building is being renovated for a more modern use.
 That is what is about to happen at the light-industrial building once known as 75 Varick Street. The owner, Trinity Real Estate, has renamed the 1.2 million square foot building between Grand and Canal Streets, calling it 1 Hudson Square, and is renovating it for office tenants, rather than for the printing companies it has housed since it was completed in 1930. 
 In the printing days, air-conditioning was limited to a few window units in the boss's office. But office tenants, paying annual rents in the mid-$40's to the mid-$50's per square foot in that part of town, can be expected to want plenty of cool filtered air. So Paul J. Rosen of Rosen Johnson Architects, the architect for the renovation, has designed three mechanical rooms on each of the building's 17 existing floors to supply air-conditioning. 
The rooms average about 1,000 square feet each. That means that about 50,000 square feet of what was formerly rentable space in the building has been set aside for infrastructure. Under zoning rules, because the space is no longer available for rent, it can be deducted from the building's allowable bulk, or floor-area ratio (for example, a building on a 15,000-square-foot lot with a floor-area ratio of 5 can have 75,000 square feet of space).
With 50,000 square feet of new space available to be built, the architects and Trinity officials have decided to add two floors of what is likely to be highly desirable penthouse space to the top of the building. The new 18th and 19th floors, each 25,000 square feet, will be combined with the now-vacant 17th floor to create a glass-walled triplex intended for executive tenants.
Because most of the buildings on the west side of Manhattan just north of Canal Street are relatively low-rise, the new floors will have good views of the rest of the city, New York harbor and the New Jersey coastline.
"It is going to be very dramatic space," said Joseph T. Palombi, executive vice president of Trinity Real Estate, which is owned by the Parish of Trinity Church, at Broadway and Wall Street. "The 18th floor will have a slab-to-slab height of 20 feet and the 19th floor will be 15 1/2 feet high," he said. (Typical floor heights in steel-framed buildings are 12 to 13 feet.)
The conversion of 75 Varick Street to 1 Hudson Square is part of Trinity's program of transforming many of the industrial buildings it acquired during the Depression of the 1930's to office use to tap into the city's seemingly relentless demand for office space.
TRINITY is putting $50 million into the building, which is the southern anchor of its properties in what it is calling the Hudson Square section of Manhattan. Brokers active in the area said that that part of the city had been so designated on old maps, but that the term had fallen into disuse when the area was remapped and the streets named for historical figures such as Richard Varick, mayor of New York City from 1789 to 1801; Rip Van Dam, a Dutch-era governor; and William Houston, a delegate to the Continental Congress. Trinity said it revived the name as a way of creating a sense of community for a neighborhood making the transition from industrial to office use.
"Young people like the SoHo-like quality of the area," said Daniel O. Horowitz, a senior managing director of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage firm that represents tenants. Mr. Horowitz, who recently arranged to move an e-commerce consulting company called Novo into nearby 10 Hudson Square, said that these are the type of tenants who provide special rooms for employees to hang their bicycles after riding to work.
Converting the building involved installing all new windows to muffle the rumble of traffic entering and leaving the Holland Tunnel and adding a special scrubber to cleanse incoming air of automotive pollutants, said Mr. Rosen, the architect. "The building had no central HVAC," he said, referring to the shorthand for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.
He said the decision was to locate the air-distribution units deep in the interior of the floors, some of which are as big as 70,000 square feet, and to put the equivalent space on top of the building. "We took the worst space deep in the building and put it on the roof where it is the best space," Mr. Rosen said.
ALTHOUGH the addition is permitted by the zoning rules, Mr. Rosen said that convincing the city's Buildings Department that the two new floors were justified was "a long process." He said other building owners had used similar tactics to use less desirable space for mechanical functions so they could add a floor on the top of a building or enlarge a mezzanine level.
But he said that not all buildings legally eligible for such alterations were capable of doing so because some lack a structure sufficiently robust to support the additional loads. Even 1 Hudson Square, whose industrial-strength floors are capable of supporting 300 pounds per square foot (compared to less than 100 pounds a square foot for a modern office building) will need reinforcement for some of the columns on its upper levels to support the weight of the new floors.
Because of the demand for office space and the near-record rentals now being paid, Mr. Rosen said, most building owners are checking to be sure that their buildings are built to the full floor-area ratio allowance and if there is any opportunity to use mechanical alterations to add more desirable space. But, he said, in many cases the amount of space that could be added was not economical because of the high cost of construction.
Mr. Palombi of Trinity said the reinforcing work at 1 Hudson Square would take place in the next 45 days, after which construction of the new floors would begin. He said the company would be able to deliver the space to tenants within 12 months. The new floors, he added, will be the "crown" of the building.
Mr. Palombi said that because of the building's proximity to Canal Street and the Holland Tunnel, a decision was made not to draw air in from anywhere near the street, but to concentrate the air intakes and cooling towers on top of an existing mechanical penthouse on the roof. By taking air in from the roof and chemically scrubbing it, the air fed into the offices in the remodeled building will be cleaner than the air in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Rosen said. Additional vertical shafts were added to the building to assist in air distribution.
The existing mechanical penthouse, whose roof is 35 feet higher than the rest of the building, will be partly demolished and incorporated into the new 18th and 19th floors, Mr. Rosen said.
The conversion process included enlarging and remodeling the decidedly modest existing lobby of the building and the conversion of five freight elevators for passenger use. The existing passenger elevators also were furnished with new cabs.
Mr. Rosen described the building's existing electrical system as the equivalent of a bunch of extension cords. That is all being replaced with new aboveground transformer vaults for additional power and new electrical closets. In addition to new vertical shafts for air, risers were added for fiber-optic telecommunications and Internet access.
Mr. Horowitz of Julien J. Studley said that landlords in many parts of the city have tried to gain an advantage within the zoning rules. "On Park Avenue, some buildings have had space shaved off lower floors to add to the top," he said. "One Hudson Square is a version of that; you create premium space by reallocating space."

HEADLINE: In Berlin, a Road With an Identity Crisis 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA WEISS 

 BODY:
YOU can find almost everything on the Berlin Turnpike in Berlin, from live lobsters to live adult entertainment. One thing you can't find, however, is a road sign that reads "Berlin Turnpike." They all bear the road's official name, Wilbur Cross Highway.
 Most people in town call the road the Berlin Turnpike. Oddly, in Newington, to the north, and Meriden, to the south, that is its lawful name. But not in Berlin. There, the thoroughfare formed by Routes 5 and 15 is named for Wilbur Cross, a former Connecticut governor. 
 That may change soon if local officials and business owners have their way. They have pushed a measure in the State Legislature to change the name and a town meeting to discuss the issue is scheduled for Wednesday night. They believe naming the road consistently after their town would alleviate the complications that arise when one man's Berlin Turnpike is another man's Wilbur Cross Highway. 
"People, especially in this part of the state, have no clue what the Wilbur Cross is," said Bonnie Therrien, the town manager. Residents refer to the road as the Berlin Turnpike so routinely, she said, that many businesses list that address on their letterheads. Making that name official only makes sense to her.
"It would just seem natural that Berlin have the Berlin Turnpike going through it," Ms. Therrien said. "You should have the main drag that runs through your town named for you."
Thomas Stregowski, chairman of the town's Economic Development Commission, said he also favors the change. "I'm totally convinced it should be called the Berlin Turnpike," Mr. Stregowski said. "It's the town of Berlin. It represents the town of Berlin. Wilbur Cross was a prominent gentleman, but it doesn't do anything for the town."
Any prospective change would not be implemented for about a year, Mr. Stregowski said, so that local companies can deplete their inventory of old business cards and stationery. He expected that renaming the road will help promote local industry. "It sort of gives us a piece of identity," Mr. Stregowski said.
That identity is what makes the name change so crucial to Edward Egazarian, the local businessman who initiated the crusade. To him, the new name evokes the old days, when the Berlin Turnpike had enough name recognition to rival legendary Route 66.
"In the 50's and 60's, this was 'The Strip,' " Mr. Egazarian said. "Everyone in the state used to bring their hot rods to the 'pike to race or just drive up and down."
Mr. Egazarian is a man of such single-minded vision that Delicious Dogs, the luncheonette he runs on the highway, has only one item on the menu. He bought the land and began parking his silver hot dog-vending truck there back in 1985, when one of his franks cost 75 cents. (It now runs $1.75.) He later built Ridgeway Plaza, a commercial building in which his stand occupies a back corner, because he said he believed in the future of the highway. But he also believed in its past. 
Mr. Egazarian recalled the time a few decades ago when the highway was lined with motels, shops and restaurants, luring travelers to such attractions as a "sock hop," where roller-skating waitresses served burgers on trays they hooked to car windows. "This was basically the oasis between New York and Boston," he said.
Glenna Grelak also waxes wonderfully nostalgic for the turnpike's glory days. "Twenty-five years ago, this was Restaurant Row," said Ms. Grelak, whose family has owned the Hawthorne Inn, a restaurant on the highway, for 54 years. Along with the inn, dining options included a Manero's steak house, several Chinese restaurants and the local hot spot the Wonder Bar, she said. 
There was also enough activity to draw hordes of high school kids and young adults, Ms. Grelak said. "But they wouldn't say, 'Let's hang out on the Wilbur Cross Highway.' It was 'Let's hang out on the Berlin Turnpike.' "
This is not to suggest that Berlin's historic highway has always taken the high road. David Wattington of Waterford, a lunchtime customer at Mr. Egazarian's hot dog stand, recalled being drawn to the road in his youth for its rather randy reputation.
"I remember breaking away with all my high school buddies to go to the Berlin Turnpike in the 60's," Mr. Wattington said. "We thought it was a big deal. That's where all the strip joints were."
Built in 1717, the road was originally called the Hartford-New Haven Path, said Kathleen Murray, a volunteer in the local history room at the Berlin Peck Memorial Library. The road was just a cow path. By 1799, it had become the Hartford-New Haven Turnpike. The adjoining highway, which runs from the Housatonic River Bridge in Stratford to Route 5 in Meriden, was designated the Wilbur Cross Parkway in 1937. Neither she nor the State Department of Transportation knew when the section in Berlin was named for Governor Cross.
That honor may have kept his name alive, but not necessarily his reputation. Of more than a dozen people questioned earlier this month, not one could say who he was or anything about him.
"I know I read it. Twice," said Bogdan Burchardt, owner of a sign-making company on the highway. "I just don't remember."
Mr. Borchardt, who also favored a name change, is less concerned that people know who Mr. Cross was than where his highway is. "Most of my customers, when I tell them I'm on the Wilbur Cross Highway, they can't find it," he said. As a result, he uses two different business addresses. His business cards say he is located at 1662 Wilbur Cross Highway, but he gives out-of-towners refrigerator magnets that place him at 1662 Berlin Turnpike.
(Mr. Borchardt is another example of popular vernacular triumphing over proper names. His company is called Signs by Computer Works, but people commonly refer to it as Berlin Sign. And although his given first name is Bogdan, everyone calls him Danny.)
To give the highway the name by which it is already popularly known, no state mandate is necessary, said James Mahoney, economic development director for the town of Berlin. The transportation department researched the matter and has assured him that the name was never officially sanctioned by the state in the first place.
"We conferred with the state, and they concurred with us that they don't see any record of this being named by the legislature as the Wilbur Cross Highway," Mr. Mahoney said.
Even so, town officials have enlisted Ann Dandrow, a state representative from Berlin and Southington, to sponsor House Bill No. 5897 in the State Legislature. Scheduled to be voted on during the current legislative session, the bill will not only formalize the name change, but also preempt any future attempts to have the road renamed for someone else.
"We do have a penchant for naming highways in Connecticut," said Mr. Mahoney. They include the Taras Shevchenko Expressway, on Route 9 in Newington, and the Thaddeus Kosciuszko Highway, on Route 72 in New Britain.
Even if the bill were not to pass, Berlin is free to rename the road within its borders if it wants to. Mr. Mahoney said the Town Council is likely to approve the change if no local business owners or residents object. And so far, no one has.
Ultimately, a road by any other name is bound to smell as sweet, especially when you add the irresistible aroma of hot dogs on a grill. Just past 3 one recent Friday, a man in a faded plaid flannel shirt and jeans stepped up to the takeout window at Delicious Dogs. The customer, Joseph Serra, insisted that the road he was standing alongside was the Berlin Turnpike.
"The Wilbur Cross doesn't start until the stoplights end," Mr. Serra said. "Pass the stoplights, you can't use a commercial vehicle anymore."
Mr. Serra also had his own version of what Mr. Egazarian's restaurant is called. "No one knows this as Delicious Dogs. It's Eddie's," he said. "I always tell people, 'Want a great hot dog? Go to Eddie's on the Berlin Turnpike.' "

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
The Dot-Com Jobless, at Play

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT is hard to feel too sorry for some of the unemployed masses of young people. Sure, it is sad that their dot-com dreams have ended. And it is unfortunate that their stock options are worthless.
 But pity them? Many of them are having entirely too much fun. 
 Yes, the boys and girls of Silicon Valley and other dot-com centers are taking their severance money and doing all sorts of exciting things now that they are jobless: traveling, renovating homes, going back to school or reveling in happy relationships. It's amazing what the dot-com downturn has done for their social lives.
Alli Ehrenberg, 28, and Myles Weissleder, 30, are engaged to be married in September -- hardly a possibility when Ms. Ehrenberg was working long hours as a brand manager at Addis.com, a design firm in the San Francisco Bay area.
"Who had the time?" she asked. "Losing my job was the best thing that could have happened to us as a couple and for me personally. I'm not stressed. I'm not worried. I can enjoy our time together instead of always thinking about work." Ms. Ehrenberg now spends her days planning her wedding, doing yoga and sleeping in. Mr. Weissleder runs a small Internet marketing company. 
Michael Feinstein is also enjoying his free time. At 26, he is the newly deposed director for business development at the now-defunct Bigwords.com, which sold college textbooks at a discount.
The way he sees it, the recent layoffs have only enhanced his personal life, and those of his high-tech comrades. "Right after we folded, two out of our three founders got engaged, one to the former C.E.O. of Petopia.com, which also failed," said Mr. Feinstein, who lives in San Francisco and is now vacationing in Southeast Asia. "Another is on the verge. My old roommate was having a long-distance relationship with a woman in New York, but after his company fell apart he asked her to move out here." She did, he said. 
Mr. Feinstein used to attend galas to introduce the newest or coolest in Web sites, gadgets or marketing concepts. Now he attends more intimate dinner parties. And people are not talking only about initial public offerings and business plans. 
"Night life used to be very homogeneous," he said. "It had a shallow feel to it -- young kids celebrating the fact that they were making money. The failure has almost brought them down to earth. People are talking about real things, exploring different ideas. It's actually interesting going out now."
Mr. Feinstein's relationship with his girlfriend, Melinda Smith, 24, a San Francisco writer whom he has been dating since last summer, has also flourished. Before his company folded, the couple were relegated to weekend and late-night dates, "but now we can hang out during the week," he said. 
One possible pitfall is that his newfound freedom may give him time to stray. "There's more opportunity for temptation because I'm exposed to more people now," he said. Still, for the most part, his unemployment has turned a casual romance more serious.
The explanation is up for debate. Mr. Feinstein, who is applying to business school, says it has to do with the need for stability in a generally unstable world, where so many young people have tied their sense of self-worth to their careers. "When someone loses a job, they often feel insecure and need something to hold on to -- an anchor," he said. "What's better than a relationship?"
PERHAPS, but it may be even deeper. Maybe these people who have spent the past two years locked in an office are realizing some things that older workers already know: that there is more to life than a computer and a mouse, that live, not virtual, connections matter, and that stock options do not. These young people may be having their midlife crises early.
Of course, not every story has a happy ending. Jennifer Thompson's relationship ended after her boyfriend's dot-com company did. "I was devastated, but I couldn't compete with his job," said Ms. Thompson, 29, a graphic designer in Manhattan.
As for Ms. Ehrenberg and Mr. Weissleder, they intend to enjoy their free time together as long as the money holds out. Ms. Ehrenberg wants her next career to offer a change in direction -- hopefully less stressful and with flexible hours. "There's more to life than just work," she said.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Students, Not Enough Staff 

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
LAST winter, school administrators in Hopewell began a search for someone to teach physics and chemistry. After months of digging through files, advertising in newspapers and magazines and even holding a job fair, they finally got lucky.
 But in June, the teacher called to say he had accepted a position at another high school that was more conveniently located. The search for a science teacher at the Hopewell Valley Central High School -- a job that pays from $37,000 to $55,000 -- started all over again. 
 "He probably found four more jobs," said Patricia Priesing, a human resources supervisor in the upper-middle-class district. "We are getting massacred. We have a terrible time finding teachers in math, science, world languages and special education. We don't know what we'll do next year. We're going to lose some people to retirements, and math and science teachers are scarcer than hen's teeth." 
Around the state -- as in much of the country -- this scene is playing out repeatedly because of a bulge in enrollment in the lower grades, called the Baby Boom echo, an aging teaching force and an inability to retain teachers because of low salaries and enticing jobs in technology businesses.
Finding qualified people to teach high school math, science, technology and special education classes is particularly hard. And the pool of applicants for administrators, guidance counselors, school nurses and librarians is also shriveling.
In New Jersey -- where state testing for fourth and eighth graders will soon include a section on a foreign language -- schools are scrambling to find teachers. In fact, some districts are already delaying language training in the elementary schools because they simply cannot find the instructors. And the situation is not likely to improve any time soon.
In Hopewell, Ms. Priesing said she was panicking last summer after clawing through a stack of resumes and calling more than 15 teachers -- all of whom had found other jobs. Just before school was to begin, a woman who had recently moved to the area from out of state applied for the job and was willing to work as a substitute until she could receive state certification.
After putting up with the same kinds of frustrations, the Newark public schools went so far last month as to hire a full-time recruiter to help fill positions in a staff that, when full, numbers 4,000 teachers. This was nothing new. In 1999, the state Department of Education hired two recruiters to help lure teachers to the public schools, said Karen Harcar-Morris, director of the Office of Innovative Programs and Practices. The state has also set up a Web site -- www.njhire.com -- where schools can post openings along with recruiting events and programs. 
"We certainly acknowledge that there is a shortage," said Ms. Morris. She said that not only were more than 5,000 teachers a year leaving the state's classrooms but that the number "will increase with the graying of the teaching force."
In just 25 years, the picture has changed from one in which applicants were lined up to get each coveted teaching post to one in which districts are turning the tables on business by aggressively recruiting teachers from private industry as well as looking to the parochial schools.
There is indeed, a pressing need for the push:
*The average age of a teacher in New Jersey is 47, and of the state's 93,000 teachers, the Department of Education estimates that one-third of them will reach retirement age over the next decade.
*The number of teachers changing jobs or leaving through retirement is steadily increasing, the New Jersey Teachers Association says, noting that in the 1995-96 school year, 5.4 percent of the teaching force left, and that by the 1999-2000 school year, that percentage jumped to 8.1 percent. Moreover, a third of those left after teaching five years or less.
*Nationwide, studies show that after five years of teaching, 40 percent of the teachers leave the profession, says Dr. Richard M. Ingersoll, an associate professor in the graduate school of education at the University of Pennsylvania.
*The schools in New Jersey continue to become more crowded, with 1,289,221 students in attendance in the 1999-2000 school year, as against 1,264,259 in 1998-99.
*There are now about 212,000 students from the age of 3 to 21 receiving special education in the state's public schools now, up from 180,000 in 1990.
*In what she described as a "huge crisis," Jeanne Oswald, deputy executive director of New Jersey Commission on Higher Education, said there "was not a group of people in the schools preparing for" a 1999 court ruling affecting the state's 30 poorest districts. The ruling established new requirements for preschool teachers, mandating that by September 2004, all 3 and 4 year olds in those schools had to have a certified preschool teacher. Beginning in September, no teacher can be hired in poor districts without certification.
*The state's low unemployment rate has also drained the pool of substitutes who earn an average of $70 to $75 a day; some districts are paying $100 to $110 a day to help keep them.
"It's tight all around," said Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, "from superintendents to teachers to substitutes. The key areas are special education, world languages, math, science and technology."
But the biggest single reason for the severe personnel shortage can be summed up in a word: money. Better jobs in technology have lured many math and science teachers from the classroom.
Pay for teachers in public schools generally ranges from a starting salary of $30,000 to $60,000 or $70,000 for those who are experienced and have continued their education.
"We've lost wonderful teachers in math to computer companies," Ms. Priesing said, because in terms of pay, "the sky was the limit."
Still, Lynn Maher, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, insisted that low pay was not the only issue.
"For some, it's the quality of the work experience itself," Ms. Maher said. "Teachers are often treated like children. There's no provision to use bathroom facilities sometimes. The workload has increased tremendously. Education has become a political football and test scores are driving the pressure. Teachers deeply resent that. They want to educate the whole child. Tests are only one measure."
In an urban district, for instance, a teacher might be judged on their students performance in tests even though more than half the students did not spend the entire year with the same teacher because of high student turnover, she said. "This creates an unhealthy atmosphere."
And money considerations aside, Dr. Ingersoll does not accept the conventional wisdom that increasing enrollment and more retirements are the crux of the problem.
"It's not so much shortages, it's turnover," he said. "There are too many bodies prematurely leaving the profession. There is a lot of dissatisfaction."
Indeed, the most alarming set of figures shows that of the 2.5 million teachers in the United States, about 40 percent of those who have been teaching five years or less will leave. Stated another way, the turnover rate for teachers is about 14.3 percent a year -- and 16 percent among math and science teachers -- Dr. Ingersoll said. Furthermore, he said research he conducted in 1995 showed that 11 percent of all the nation's teachers left after one year in the classroom, and 29 percent left after three years.
While he said higher salaries in other fields enabled teachers to quit -- since the pay "is relatively low compared to other occupations" -- he maintained that they were not the main reason. Dr. Ingersoll said student discipline and tensions in the workplace drove out many to teachers.
"Schools with more discipline problems and less tough discipline policies have higher turnover," he said. "How much say teachers have in their workplace and how schools are run make a difference. It's working-conditions issues. Support is also very important."
He said his analysis showed that more than 28 percent of the teachers who left the profession cited job dissatisfaction as their primary reason. Of that number, he said about 13 percent retired, 26 percent left to pursue other careers and 40 percent left for family or personal reasons. 
Dr. Ingersoll said that in addition to better pay, teachers needed support from their administrations as well as adequate supplies and classroom facilities. He said that when he taught high school social studies in Pennsylvania, he remembered getting a chalk allotment at the beginning of the year and being told that when the chalk was gone, he would have to buy his own.
"It's not like you're going to steal chalk," said the professor, who in 1999 presented some of his findings to the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, which was headed by Senator John Glenn.
Dr. Ingersoll -- who taught in Delaware as a well as Pennsylvania over eight years -- said he finally stopped teaching public school for the same reason that many others did.
"Student discipline issues really wore me down," he said, "and I was actually a popular teacher. Student discipline needs to be addressed along with the issue of voice and power and say."
Teachers being forced to work outside their areas of expertise -- like baseball players playing out of position -- was another cause of tension among teaching staffs, he said. In fact, he said that research on that very problem had been cited by former President Bill Clinton in various speeches and mentioned in in education reports around the country.
"It's very challenging to teach things you don't know," said Dr. Ingersoll, who has written a book on the subject, "The Control of Schooling," which will be published by Princeton Press this year. "This is one of those things that drives turnover."
Until those types of issues were addressed, Dr. Ingersoll said he did not expect the teacher shortage to improve appreciably. "Take a closer look at your retention," he advised districts. "You can't afford to lose people."
In the Newark public schools, for instance -- with 44,000 students and 4,000 teachers -- there are still more than 50 openings said Randall Kanter, assistant superintendent for human resources. "Whatever is happening in other districts is happening more here because we're the biggest in the state." 
In addition to shortages in the usual fields -- science, math, foreign languages and special education, Mr. Kanter said Newark was also struggling to find English teachers, "a position that only a decade ago attracted 100 applicants for every job."
"It's definitely a seller's market out there," he said.
For that reason, Newark has begun paying more than many school districts in the state. In a contract that recently agreed on that will run through September 2003, starting teaching salaries will begin at $40,000 and go to $80,000, depending on experience. In addition, there is a tuition reimbursement provision for the teachers who are in midcareer to give them an incentive to keep working there, he said.
"Retention is key here," he said 
In addition, he said that the district had adopted a mentoring program set up by the state so that young new teachers, or those coming from other careers, would have an experienced teacher to help guide them through the first two years on the job. And the full-time recruiter started in January. 
"That's what we needed to do to be competitive," Mr. Kanter said. "You try to grab the best people out there."
In districts where salaries are lower, or there are labor disputes, staffing problems, understandably, are more acute.
For example, Monroe Township in Middlesex County, where school employees have been without a contract since July 1999 and voted down the latest contract offer in mid-December, more than 40 staff members -- mostly teachers -- have left in the past year, said Caren Castaldo, a substance abuse counselor who is co-president of the Monroe Township Education Association.
Openings in the district of about 3,100 students -- where the teaching salaries currently range from $30,535 to $57,285 -- include a high school science teacher, an industrial arts teacher, a physical education teacher, a part-time substance abuse awareness coordinator, a head for the science department in the high school and a foreign language teacher. 
"It's a crisis," Ms. Castaldo said.
Math and science teachers go elsewhere, she said, because "they can write their own ticket."
Stacy Grimaldi, who is in her seventh year teaching high school math at Monroe Township High School, said she understood why people did not want to go into teaching -- or stay in it.
"Teaching has gotten a bad rap," Ms. Grimaldi said. "People know if you want to be a millionaire, you don't become a teacher. Some people think my day ends at 2 p.m., but I'm up until 10 p.m. working." 
Instead, she said that other fields, like the computer industry, were able to lure teachers with much higher salaries and better schedules. "You don't have to work in the office five days a week in industry. A lot of people want flexibility. They want a three-day week, or to work on the weekend. I go into the office 180 days a year. I can't say, 'I'm going to work from home today.' "
But teachers do have summers and weekends off as well as every conceivable holiday.
So far, she has not considered leaving for greener pastures. "I really enjoy the interaction with the students," she said. "I don't think I'd be happy doing anything else."
Eileen Zibbe, who has been a school bus driver in Monroe Township for 25 years, agreed, though she said she, too, had seen many others leave in the past few years. In fact, Ms. Zibbe said things had gotten so bad that she that the everyone from the supervisor to a maintenance worker have had to pitch in.
The district, which is rural, has experienced a building boom in recent years, increasing the need for drivers, while low unemployment, low pay and stringent licensing restrictions have made drivers harder to find, she said. 
"There are so many kids anymore and so many homes going in here," Ms. Zibbe said. "Why come here for $11 an hour when you can go somewhere else for $13?' 
Nor is Monroe Township the only district with a shortage of bus drivers. Evesham Township, in South Jersey, has also had problems finding and keeping drivers.
"In the support end, bus drivers are the toughest hire," said John Dyer, Evesham's human resources manager. "Why? Full employment. Plain and simple."
Mr. Dyer, who was a partner in a transportation company in the 1970's, said he remembered how the pool of drivers started to "dry up as the economy got better and better."
And the same is true for those victims of unfortunate circumstances, otherwise known as substitute teachers. In Montclair, for instance, Michael Osnato, the superintendent, said substitutes used to stay in the pool for more than a year But, Mr. Osnato said, "we have rapid turnover now because people are getting full-time jobs. They are getting snapped up."
In West Windsor-Plainsboro, home to 8,300 students, substitutes now receive $70 to $75 a day, and the district is working hard to recruit and keep them, said Gerri Hutner, a spokeswoman. 
Ms. Hutner said the district had begun hiring the mothers of students with a minimum of 60 college credits. "There's a national substitute shortage," she said. "It's a great economy, and there are a lot of other jobs out there."
The substitute shortage has become so dire that services are cropping up around the state that provide substitutes. For instance, Diane Lorber, who used to teach emotionally disturbed children, now runs the Substitute Service in Lincoln Park, which does not find the substitutes but calls them and assigns them.
In 1984, the company served 8 districts in the state; now it provides about 400 substitutes a day to 32 districts.
Ms. Lorber came along and bought the business in 1994, when she decided to leave the classroom after three years at a private school.
"I was just burned out," she said. "It really took its toll on me."

HEADLINE: DEVELOPMENT; 
For Rent: Office Space In Central Hackensack

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK 

 BODY:
John DeNoy stood at the window of his restaurant near the Bergen County courthouse and looked out at the falling snow. Normally at this hour of the morning, the place would be filled with people bantering with him over bacon and eggs or just coming in for coffee and a muffin to go. Today, John's Restaurant was as empty as a freeholders meeting.
 "I'm bored," Mr. DeNoy lamented. "No customers." 
 For more than a decade, about 550 county employees had occupied Court Plaza on lower Main Street, just across the street from John's. But for the past few months they have been migrating to the new $62 million administration building a few blocks away, which will eventually house most county offices.
In the late 1980's, when Court Plaza -- two buildings of polished gray granite and reflecting glass -- went up across from the courthouse, the $40 million complex was seen by many as a cornerstone of Hackensack's downtown redevelopment efforts.
Today there is a 160,000-square-foot-vacancy on lower Main Street -- and some concern about its effect on the downtown revitalization plan.
"I hope for the sake of Hackensack it's filled quickly," said Douglas Bern, the new chairman of the Board of Freeholders, who, along with fellow Democrats, opposed the new county building. "It's not good news for economic development in Hackensack and for the continued revitalization of the central business district."
But the county executive, William Pat Schuber, the Republican who led the drive for the new county building with the support of a then-Republican majority on the Board of Freeholders, said he did not see a problem for either Hackensack or the landlord, Alfred Sanzari Enterprises, which built Court Plaza.
"The location that Sanzari has there is such prime real estate," Mr. Schuber said. "I don't think he's going to have any problem over the long run of renting that place with prime tenants."
For his part, Mayor John Jack F. Zisa said that when the county first proposed a new office building, he was concerned about the effect on the city if Court Plaza stayed vacant too long.
"But in the long run," said Mayor Zisa, a Republican, "I believe it will have a very positive impact by housing that many more people and bringing in even more potential customers to Main Street."
Officials from Sanzari say they are equally optimistic.
Jerry L. Barta, vice president and director of leasing and marketing for Sanzari Enterprises, said that the company planned to gut the interior of Court Plaza South -- which is expected to take about four months -- to make it more appealing to corporate tenants. With rental at $28 a square foot, he said Sanzari expected to attract companies from New York, where the rents are far higher, as well as from other places in New Jersey. The county has been paying $250,000 a month on a lease that expires March 31.
For instance, office rentals in Newark range from $29 to $34 a square foot and on the Jersey City waterfront, which has been a magnet in recent years for major financial companies, from $35 to $40 a square foot, said Richard Baumstein, executive director of the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the leasing agent for Court Plaza South.
Furthermore, said Mr. Baumstein, "There is no space in Jersey City, so if you need 100,000 square feet today, you don't want to wait two years to get it," adding that more than 50,000 square feet is available on each floor.
Mr. Barta of Sanzari Enterprises put it his way: "Long term, it's going to get better as the building gets released to other users. Short term, a lot of money is going out and not as much coming in."
The complex consists of Court Plaza North, a six-story building filled primarily with lawyers as well as the district office of Representative Steven Rothman and the headquarters of the Sanzari company itself. Court Plaza South is a three-story building with two wings, which the county moved into shortly after it opened in 1988.
The exodus to the new administration building began last month and is about 95 percent complete. At first, it was only a trickle. But by early this month, the two subterranean levels where parking spaces were often scarce suddenly looked as vacant as a desert -- except for the county's filing cabinets, desks and tables, which were temporarily stored there.
The new 261,000-square-foot, five-story county administration building, along with a 1,300-car parking garage, was built on county-owned land across from the courthouse by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which will lease it to the county until 2026, when it becomes the county's for a dollar. The county expects to save about $73 million by not paying commercial rates, which are subject to rent increases. 
"Most major departments will be under one roof at last," said Mr. Schuber, including the county clerk's office, which had been in the courthouse; data processing, situated in Wood-Ridge; and the superintendent of schools, who had been in Paramus.
As for Court Plaza South, Mr. Barta said: "The symbol that this was to the revitalization of Hackensack doesn't change at all. The county's vacating our building creates an opportunity for other users to come to Hackensack to support the redevelopment of downtown."
Mr. DeNoy -- whose fate has ben affected by Court Plaza before -- just hopes this happens sooner rather than later. The block of buildings that included the coffee shop he opened 35 years ago, when he was 26 years old, was razed to make way for Court Plaza. At that time, he expanded his restaurant and opened across Sussex Street near Main Street, and business was good -- until a few weeks ago.
"We've lost a third of the business just in the mornings," he said. "Lunch is only off a little."
Then, for a time, at least, fortune smiled. The next morning a broken water pipe emptied the courthouse and sent hordes of county employees to wait out the repairs in John's.
"It was the second-biggest day we ever had," Mr. DeNoy said cheerfully. 
But the next day, a blackout forced him to improvise -- without electric power. "We served a lot of tuna and roast beef," he said.

HEADLINE: Going Back to the Mortgage Store 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHEN James and Maureen Fleming bought their 2,100-square-foot Cape on one and a quarter acres in Trumbull, Conn., last April for $227,000, they took out a $202,000 30-year mortgage at 7.75 percent interest. But as mortgage rates gradually fell in the months since then, the couple decided to refinance. Two weeks ago they decided to take out another 30-year mortgage, this one at a 7 percent interest rate, and they expect to wind up with a monthly mortgage payment of $120 less than before. 
 In the process, the Flemings also flew in the face of what for years had been conventional wisdom -- that it is not usually worthwhile to refinance unless the new rate is at least two percentage points less than the existing rate. Instead, they went ahead and refinanced even though their new 7 percent loan does not come close to the once-magical two percentage point threshold. 
 In recent weeks homeowners have been rushing to take advantage of lower interest rates, though mortgage specialists say some may be waiting for the rates to drop even further, in the expectation that the Federal Reserve will shave interest rates another half point or so, as it did last month. 
Despite the timing predicament, lots of former fence sitters have already opted to refinance. "Since the first of the year refinancing has soared," said A. J. Romano, the founder and chairman of a mortgage brokerage company in Stratford, Conn., that bears his name, the company through which the Flemings obtained both loans. Joseph Romano, the founder's son and president of the family-owned financial services business, estimated that in the last couple of weeks he alone had approved at least 30 refinancing loans with a total mortgage value in excess of $11 million.
Meanwhile, in the last few weeks throughout the metropolitan area, as throughout the United States, refinancing has been heading skyward. In each of the first five weeks of 2001, refinancing loan applications nationwide have not fallen below 54.6 percent of total family home mortgages, soaring to 64.1 percent in the week that ended on Jan. 12. At that rate, refinancings are flirting with the record set in 1998, when interest rates in the 6 percent range propelled refinance loans into orbit.
"That year, 50 percent of all the loans originated for one-to-four family homes were for refinancing," said David Warner, a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. "The refinancing percentage and the $1.5 trillion amount of those loans are both all-time records. This year we expect 39 percent of the loans will be for refinancing and their value will be slightly more than $1.4 trillion, which would make both categories the second highest ever." 
There is good reason for the trend, experts say. "This is an excellent time to refinance, with mortgage rates low and a good chance for a lot of people to get out of higher rates that seemed good at the time they took them," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., which publishes information on the mortgage market. "We expect this window of refinancing will run into the spring, spurred by a lot of people doing debt consolidation."
While lower rates have been the primary stimulus to refinancing, saturation advertising on television and on the Internet, as well as old-fashioned fliers in the mail, have also played a part. 
"We were getting all kinds of unsolicited mail telling us to refinance," said Mr. Fleming, a technology manager for DataViz Inc., a Trumbull company that specializes in software for Palm hand-held organizers. Mrs. Fleming works for the Gartner Group, a Stamford company that specializes in technology research. 
But the Flemings were more convinced by the fact that five or six co-workers had recently refinanced. And, as Mr. Fleming put it: "Since we plan on staying in our house for another 15 years or so, why not lower our mortgage payments when we can? Especially since refinancing cost us almost nothing, about $100, because there were no closing costs or points." Nor was there a penalty for repaying their existing loan early. Almost all financial advisers caution against taking out mortgages with prepayment penalties.
Similarly, there is wide agreement among mortgage lenders that the rule of thumb about two percentage points is an anachronism. "It hasn't applied for a long time," said Paul Quinn, the branch manager of Washington Mutual in White Plains. "People are financing for longer periods of time, and by doing so they're able to recoup their closing costs on the refinance and save money with each subsequent month." 
Because the rise in property values in recent years has translated into bigger mortgages, the two percentage points once seen as a minimum needed to justify refinancing has been supplanted by a drop of as little as three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company.
When the Flemings decided to take out their new loan, they also made other decisions that will cut down their monthly payments. Because the value of the house had risen, their equity in the house had passed the 20 percent level, meaning that they no longer had to pay private mortgage insurance, or P.M.I. The savings of $65 each month from no longer paying P.M.I., along with the $120 savings on their new mortgage loan (which was for a slightly lower amount than their previous loan), add up to about $185. And it is not lost on them that by investing that extra $185 each month, which amounts to $2,220 a year, they could wind up with a helpful nest egg for their five-month-old daughter's education. 
But how can consumers figure out at what point they will recoup the fees associated with a refinancing loan and begin to save on their new mortgage? "Most loan officers can do that calculation in a few minutes using software," said Palmer Heenan, senior vice president of Weichert Financial Services, an arm of the New Jersey-based real estate services company. 
Another way is for borrowers to use what the Mortgage Bankers Association describes as "a crude rule of thumb": add the current principal and interest payment (but not the amount in escrow) and subtract the new principal and interest payment to find the monthly saving. Add the total of all fees and any other costs required to take out a new loan and divide that total by one month's saving. For example, if total fees are $3,000 and the monthly saving is $300, the borrower would break even in 10 months.
The Mortgage Bankers Association points out that fees and costs vary widely by state and county. The main thing to consider, according to Joseph Romano, is that "the customer has to pay those costs or brokers or lenders have to pay." In the case of the Flemings, they would have received a mortgage rate of 6.875 percent if they had paid upfront the costs involved in the refinancing, including the lawyer's bill, appraisal charge, mortgage filing fees and underwriting fees.
Mr. Heenan agrees. "Let's face it," he said. "You can roll those costs into a new 'no-charge loan,' but the borrower would have to pay a higher rate, or you can charge the borrower points. Either way, there's no free lunch." (Each point represents 1 percent of the total loan.) 
While the sharp rise in refinancing has been ignited by the prospect of getting lower monthly payments by trading in a mortgage with a higher rate for one with a lower rate, some homeowners with sufficient equity in their homes use the new loan to pay off their existing mortgages and then trade up to more expensive houses. Still others borrow more than they need to pay off their existing mortgage, in order to have money for other purposes.
For example, when Michael Kizilbash and Nancy Dubuc, a Manhattan husband and wife, decided a few weeks ago to refinance the co-op apartment they bought last spring in the West Village, they thought about borrowing a little extra to use on home improvements. 
But their main reason for wanting to refinance, said Ms. Dubuc, who works in the programming department of the History Channel on cable television, was to avail themselves of an interest rate lower than the one that came with the adjustable mortgage on the $375,000 30-year loan. They are currently paying 8.25 percent for the first seven years, after which the rate is to fluctuate depending on the prime rate. 
Mr. Kizilbash and Ms. Dubuc do not have their refinanced loan yet, because they have not signed the final papers with Manhattan Mortgage in the expectation that rates will fall again when the Federal Reserve meets next on March 20 -- an expectation widely shared by mortgage lenders, brokers and realtors. 
A. J. Romano, who is also the president of the Connecticut Society of Mortgage Brokers, is among those who think mortgage rates will drop further, but he is not expecting anything earth-shaking. "They'll probably only go down just a little," he said. "Maybe one-eighth of a point." 
MR. KIZILBASH and Ms. Dubuc, of course, would welcome any further declines, no matter how slight. Meanwhile, the couple has already filled in most of the necessary paperwork and paid about $600 in upfront closing costs with a balance of about $1,200 due at closing for various fees, including those for their application, the bank's attorney and the required credit check. If rates do surprise almost everyone by creeping back up, they will take what they believe to be the best deal available, which as of this writing is again a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage, but this time with a 7 percent rate throughout the loan's first seven years.
"Even if interest rates stay the same before and after the Fed meets," said Mr. Kizilbash, a creative director at a Manhattan ad agency, "we'll execute the loan." No wonder. That rate reduction of 1.25 percentage points, he said, will translate into a tidy saving of more than $300 a month. 
Somewhat surprisingly, not everyone is thrilled with the likelihood of lower rates. "If rates do go down, it's going to lead to a commensurate tightening of standards, making it more difficult to get a mortgage," said Leon G. Shilton, a professor of finance at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business Administration. The reason, he explained, is that "the underwriters might force appraisers to lower their values on houses, because buyers of mortgages are hesitant to load up with low-interest-rate mortgages because of the risk that rates will go up again and will reduce the value of their mortgage holdings." 
The Mortgage Bankers Association found that although home loans of all sizes averaged $161,735 last year, refinance loans in 2000 averaged $177,162. The implication would seem to be that at least some of that $15,427 difference went for other things. 
All reputable lenders approve of refinancing so that borrowers can trim their interest rate, but refinancing can also have a sordid side in some cases where borrowers' total indebtedness increases. As recently as 10 days ago, Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the nation's biggest source of financing for mortgages, issued a statement about predatory lending. Such lending practices, which are usually aimed at lower-income families, the elderly and single women who are heads of households, include charging excessive fees for applicants to obtain loans, replacing the original loan with a refinanced subprime loan at a higher rate and imposing stiff penalties for borrowers who wish to pay off loans early. 
A poignant example cited by Fannie Mae, which together with several federal and local housing leaders convened a round-table discussion of predatory lending, involved the mother of an employee in Fannie Mae's Washington office. The woman, Carol Mackey, recounted how she had contacted a local mortgage company for a home equity loan to pay off $1,500 in credit card debt and remodel the condo she had owned for almost a decade. 
Instead, her new loan saddled her with a prepayment penalty, her previous 7.25 percent interest rate ballooned to 13.9 percent and her monthly mortgage payments more than doubled to $1,103 from $510.
Such abuses usually happen because certain subprime lenders -- a term that refers to those making loans to individuals with less than ideal credit ratings -- persuade unsophisticated or elderly borrowers to trade in a low cost loan for a higher cost loan, said Eric Stein, the head of the secondary market program of the North Carolina-based Coalition for Responsible Lending. And they load up the new loan with high upfront fees and with high prepayment penalties aimed at keeping borrowers from getting off the high-interest treadmill. 
While such abuses have been around for years, Mr. Stein said, they have grown in recent years as subprime lending has expanded.
Similar abuses were detailed last May before the House of Representatives Banking and Financial Services Committee by Cathy Lesser Mansfield, an associate professor of law at Drake University. One of her many examples explained how predatory lenders included the existing mortgage in the proceeds of the loan, thereby increasing the amount of money on which the borrower paid points and fees. 
Professor Mansfield concluded her testimony by saying that the subprime home equity market "demonstrates that justifications for rate limits still apply today, and that fees and rates in the market need to be regulated." 
IN a subsequent telephone conversation, Professor Mansfield said that all borrowers should be on guard against "teaser rates" -- rates that usually rise and often double within six months to two years. They should comparison shop and consult with people or community organizations that understand the refinancing market to make sure the deal they were promised is the one they are getting. 
"Some people refinance based on the promise that in a year or two they'll get a better rate," she said. "But nobody should ever take out a refinancing loan unless there is some current benefit." 
One couple certain to benefit is Charles and Lisa Mounts, who bought a vacation house in Goshen, Conn., last July and a few weeks ago arranged for a refinancing loan through Romano Mortgage that is two percentage points lower than their original mortgage. That spread is somewhat unusual in the current market, where most refinancings now range from one-half point to one and a half points.
But that is not all that is unusual about the Mounts' loan. To begin with, they found their broker on the Internet. And for another, although they are Americans, the Mounts currently live in London, where Mr. Mounts works for Goldman Sachs. "But," Mrs. Mounts said, "we managed to make the final arrangements for the loan with the help of e-mail, faxes and cell phones."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
For Schundler, the Question Is Not Why, but Just WHY?

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Say what you will about Bret T. Schundler, the quixotic mayor of Jersey City, no one can accuse him of shying away from a fight. 
 In 1984, he worked on Gary Hart's long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination for president. By 1992 he had switched parties, opposed the powerful Hudson County Democratic machine and become the first Republican since 1917 to hold the office of mayor of Jersey City. 
 Last year, he backed Steve Forbes's short-lived run for the Republican presidential nomination. 
Mr. Schundler has now embarked on his most daunting task yet, his entry into the race to win the Republican nomination for governor. This time, the odds against Mr. Schundler are so steep that many New Jersey Republicans are left wondering just why he is running at all.
It's certainly not because the primary battle will be easy. Mr. Schundler brings some impressive attributes to the race. He is intelligent, Harvard-educated and articulate, and has a clearly defined political platform. Jersey City has enjoyed such an economic resurgence in the past decade that Mr. Schundler can reasonably claim some credit for its improvement.
Yet Mr. Schundler's Republican rival, Donald T. DiFrancesco, still seems to hold a huge political advantage. As both acting governor and president of the State Senate, Mr. DiFrancesco has an unprecedented opportunity to dictate the state's political agenda. He also has the support of party leaders in 18 of the state's 21 counties, a factor that will help him easily win the preferred position on the ballot on primary day. 
Mr. Schundler's strategy is clear, of course. He holds conservative views on a variety of incendiary social issues -- including support for school vouchers, teaching sexual abstinence in schools and severe restrictions on abortion rights -- which will help him win enthusiastic support from the right in New Jersey and beyond. Anyone who doubts the strength of the conservative vote in the state's Republican primaries need only look back to 1994, when Brian T. Kennedy, a virtual unknown, spent less than $25,000 to oppose Chuck Haytaian for the Senate nomination and came away with more than 30 percent of the vote.
To woo moderate Republicans, Mr. Schundler has also wrapped his message in a populist package, like the current White House occupant, by promising lower property taxes, school reform, a less-intrusive style of government and the fresh perspective of an outsider.
To date, there have been few signs that Mr. Schundler is tapping into some deep vein of discontent among Republican voters. He has raised nearly $1 million and spent most of it on direct mail, yet a public opinion poll taken this month showed him trailing Mr. DiFrancesco by 45 to 16 percent among likely primary voters. His official entry into the race -- announced last week in front of the New Jersey State House -- was attended by just a few dozen people, many of them who had driven down from Jersey City. Mr. Schundler then boarded a campaign bus -- the same one Senator John McCain used during last year's presidential primary -- and was met by sparse crowds.
All of which raises the question of why? Even if Mr. Schundler pulled off an improbable victory in the primary, many political analysts suspect that he would be a tough sell to New Jersey's moderate electorate.
"This is a moderate state," said Clifford Zukin, director of the Star Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll. "It's hard to envision someone too far from the center, on either side, winning a statewide election."
That argument has become a drumbeat among state Republicans, who have been pressuring Mr. Schundler to withdraw from the primary. Each day Mr. Schundler stays in the primary, they argue, he forces Mr. DiFrancesco to spend money and political capital trying to placate the party's restive right wing at a time when he should be honing a centrist message for the general election. 
Some Republicans suggest that Mr. Schundler' is less interested in this November's race than in some future contest, like next year's Senate race, and that a primary fight would help him solidify his base and build statewide name recognition. 
Mr. Schundler brushes aside suggestions that his candidacy is weakening the state's Republican Party, and instead insists he is the best chance to save it. 
"I think Don DiFrancesco will get blown out if he's the nominee this fall," he said. "And there's a good chance that the party will lose control of both the Assembly and the Senate. So if I wanted to run in 2002, my best bet would be to stay mayor of Jersey City and be one of the few Republicans who could still raise money and assemble a viable campaign. I'm running now because I think I can win and I think I can make a difference."
That kind of talk is unlikely to win Mr. Schundler many friends among the party's power structure. But Mr. Schundler said that his track record of backing political mavericks is actually better than it may appear: Gary Hart lost New Jersey in 1984 and Steve Forbes lost the state in 2000, but Mr. Schundler points out that he has won three elections in a row.
"People want someone with the courage to stand up to the special interests and make a change," he said. "There may be those who disagree with what I propose, but no one can question that I have the courage to say what I believe."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES; 
For the Not-So-Retired, Freedom and Flexibility

BYLINE:  By DANIEL F. CUFF 

 BODY:
IN 1999, Sam Chororos turned 65 and decided to find out when he could start collecting Social Security.
 "I was in the highest tax bracket," he said. "They told me: 'You make too much money. It doesn't make sense to collect.' " 
 That was in the bad old days, when people were limited in what they could earn if they wanted to collect their Social Security checks. Mr. Chororos, an owner of J. C. Manufacturing of High Point, N.C., and a resident of Matawan, N.J., was pleased last year, however, when a new law permitted people 65 and over to collect their full benefits regardless of their earned income. Previously, people who were 65 to 69 faced income ceilings if they wanted to receive full benefits. 
Now Mr. Chororos is receiving his salary from his company, and the government deposits his Social Security check directly into his bank account.
"God bless America," he said. "What a country." 
As far as taxes go, good things have been happening for retirees. 
First came that law that frees people to stay in the work force if they so choose without a reduction in benefits. And recent regulations announced by the Internal Revenue Service lengthen life-expectancy schedules for people with tax-deferred retirement plans. As a result, retirees can take less money out of their nest eggs if they choose, allowing more of their money to grow tax-deferred for a longer time.
The freedom to work without incurring loss of Social Security benefits has ended the need for strategies to lessen or defer income, or even to work off the books. "Hopefully a lot of that has gone," said Martin Nissenbaum, national director of retirement planning at Ernst & Young in New York.
And that freedom has apparently been a bracing feeling for retirees -- even rich ones who hardly need the government money. "People really feel proprietary about their Social Security," said Mr. Nissenbaum, whose clients are high-income earners. "Even if Social Security is only $15,000 a year, and they are making a million, they want to get their money." After all, they contributed to the program throughout their working careers. 
The new rule has also given retirees more flexibility in reaching a goal that most financial planners advocate: to leave their money untouched in tax-deferred savings plans until 70 1/2, the mandatory age to start withdrawals. The freedom to work can keep retirees from having too much extra time on their hands; it can also provide the spending money that might otherwise come out of those accounts and be taxed as ordinary income.
"I strongly suggest not to take any money out" of tax-deferred retirement accounts, said Doug Stives, a certified public accountant at Wiss & Company in Red Bank, N.J. "If a client has $1 million in a stock portfolio and $1 million in a retirement plan, I plead with them to deplete the portfolio first." 
If you retire at 65, he said, you should use up your savings account or sell stock and pay capital gains taxes on it, instead of tapping those tax-deferred accounts and "paying taxes on every dime."
Mr. Nissenbaum agreed. "People are uncomfortable about using up their principal," he said. "But it makes more sense to use up these assets first."
Of course, there are exceptions, and Mr. Stives cited two of them: if you expect to come into more money later in life or if you have "a ton of deductions" and need to offset them with some income that can come from a retirement plan.
Mr. Stives praised the new federal plan that effectively cuts the amount of money that must be taken -- and taxed -- from tax-deferred retirement plans after reaching the mandatory age of 70 1/2. Any money in these plans may be removed without penalty between the ages of 59 1/2 and 70 1/2, but the problem is that the money is taxed as ordinary income -- even if some of the money in the account came from long-term capital gains (which are always taxed at a lower rate). And the government usually collects up front at the time the money is withdrawn. 
So if you do not need this money to live on, you can now slow down the withdrawal stream to allow more to accumulate tax-free and to have more to leave to beneficiaries, Mr. Stives said.
The Internal Revenue Service accomplished this by changing its rules governing minimum distributions from retirement accounts, including I.R.A.'s, 401(k)'s and the like. The agency is eliminating a complicated process for determining the minimum amount that needs to be withdrawn and replacing it with a simple chart based on longer life-expectancy period for most people. 
Under the old rules, for example, a single person who is 70 1/2 with $100,000 in a retirement account would have had to withdraw a minimum of $6,250. Under the new rules, he or she would have to withdraw only $3,816. 
The most affluent retirees may be in a particularly favorable position to let such accounts grow, if they are also receiving money from traditional defined-benefit pension plans. That is because the limit on benefits provided by defined benefit plans is rising to $140,000 in 2001 from $135,000 in 2000, after cost-of-living adjustments announced by the I.R.S.
ANOTHER adjustment may also be of interest to retirees and people planning for retirement: an increase for 2001 in the amounts of long-term care insurance premiums that may be included in any medical expense deduction. The new amounts are $230 for people 40 and under, up from $220; $430 for those 41 to 50, up from $410; $860 for those 51 to 60, up from $820; $2,290 for those 61 to 70, up from $2,200; and $2,860 for those 71 and older, up from $2,750.
Other changes will allow some people who are saving for retirement to sock away more this year than last. They may put up to $35,000 in defined-contribution plans this year, like Keogh plans for self-employed people, up from $30,000 last year. (The I.R.S., by the way, is dropping the Keogh name, referring simply to self-employed plans.) But the $10,500 limit will remain for salary-reduction contributions to 401(k) plans and 403(b) annuities.
In those plans, of course, an important consideration is how to invest the money. Many retirement accounts shrank in value last year as the stock market declined, causing some retirees to worry that stocks might be too risky for them.
"People didn't have to be too bright and terribly lucky" to have made double-digit gains in the stock market before last year's shocks, Mr. Stives said. That gave them confidence that was undone last year, he added, and many of them turned to money market funds,
But it is equally dangerous, Mr. Nissenbaum said, to put all of one's money into safe, fixed-income securities because of the risk of inflation at a time when retirees are living longer. The retirement period can last for decades, sometimes rivaling the time spent in a career, and investments must provide money that stretches to that horizon. 
"The downturn was focused on tech stocks, not on blue chips," Mr. Nissenbaum said. "The market is still the place to go on a long-term basis."

HEADLINE: Nhu An Tran, Noah Zaring 

 BODY:
Nhu An Tran and Noah Samuel Zaring, who received master's degrees in international economics and international relations from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where they met, were married yesterday in the Dahlgren Chapel at Georgetown University in Washington. The Rev. 
Shay Auerbach, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. On Friday, the couple held a traditional Vietnamese ceremony, in which their families were formally introduced, at the home of the bride's parents, Le thi My Nhan and Tran van Kien of Fairfax, Va.
 Ms. Tran, 32, is keeping her name. She is an economic development consultant at Development Alternatives, consultants in Bethesda, Md., and will relocate next month to Haiti, where the bridegroom, 29, a foreign service officer for the State Department, is to become a vice counsel. 
 The bride graduated from Georgetown. Her mother is a librarian at the Lauinger Library there. The bride's father, who was from 1963 to 1965 the minister of finance for the Republic of South Vietnam, retired from the Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, where he taught social studies and French. 
Mr. Zaring graduated from Grinnell College in Iowa. His parents, Jane Zaring and Dr. Philip Zaring, live in Ames, Iowa. The bridegroom's mother retired as an editor at Iowa State University Press there, and his father retired as a professor of British history at Iowa State.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN; 
Will a Shuttered Subway Lead to Shuttered Shops?

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
A plan to suspend service on the B and D lines at the Grand Street subway station, a major hub serving Chinatown, has community leaders worried that the area's fragile economy will be devastated by the disruption. Specifically, they fear that some mom-and-pop shops will be forced to close if the many Chinese immigrants living in Brooklyn find it more difficult to travel to these stores.
 New York City Transit has a plan to make the DeKalb Avenue station the last stop for Manhattan-bound B and D trains in Brooklyn, so that track repairs can be made on the Manhattan Bridge. Work is expected to begin in July and end in 2004. 
 Henry L. Chung, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, told about 40 Chinatown residents at a Community Board 2 meeting Tuesday that the plan was "irresponsible and unreasonable" and showed that the transit agency was "out of touch" with the neighborhood.
"Grand Street station is a primary subway stop for hundreds of thousands of workers, business owners and customers commuting to and from Chinatown," Mr. Chung said.
The station was built in 1967 to connect the B, D and Q trains in Brooklyn to the Sixth Avenue line in Manhattan. In recent years, the city's swelling Chinese community has made the station a bustling portal for workers and weekend shoppers, so much so that a second entrance was added in 1999.
Under the agency's detour plan, Brooklyn residents going to Chinatown would have to take new Q and W trains to Canal Street. A shuttle to the Broadway-Lafayette Street station in SoHo would link the Grand Street station to Brooklyn-bound trains.
Steve Strauss, a community liaison official at New York City Transit, said his agency would try to minimize the impact of the changes. But, he added, referring to the bridge repair work, "the options here are very limited by physical factors."
Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents Lower Manhattan, was among those who offered recommendations, including running a bus shuttle between the Grand Street and DeKalb Avenue stations and delaying the shutdown until an economic impact study could be done.
"A lot of businesses are on the margins in this community," said Rocky Chin, a City Council candidate. "We're cordial here, but there is a feeling in the community that we are being blindsided." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring; 
When Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WHEN the Chrysler Corporation introduced its second-generation minivans at the 1995 Detroit auto show, it did so with style, special effects and symbolism. Against a backdrop of a frog pond dotted with lily pads, the new van leaped over the old one.
 It was an apt image. In those days, Chrysler, the smallest and most nimble of the Big Three, routinely leapfrogged its competitors as it invented new types of vehicles, like the minivan, and then reinvented them in stylish new ways. By mastering and dominating a few parts of the market, Chrysler made more money per vehicle than any other mainstream automaker. 
 The company's daring designs and production agility are what attracted a German suitor, Daimler-Benz. But in the two years since the companies consummated their "merger of equals" -- it turned out to be a German takeover -- the Chrysler Group has stopped playing leapfrog. After losses estimated at nearly $2 billion in the last two quarters, Chrysler is in the midst of a grim revamping that includes 26,000 job cuts, reductions in vehicle production and demands for cost concessions from suppliers. 
The German executives now running Chrysler attribute its reversal of fortune to a faulty plan. Two key assumptions -- that the economy and vehicle sales would continue to boom, and that it could raise prices to increase its revenues -- proved inaccurate.
But Chrysler's products are a factor, too. Its innovative PT Cruiser is a home run, but the rest of its lineup consists of base hits.
Given its No. 3 status in Detroit, the pre-merger Chrysler had to take gambles to set itself apart, and it made its mark with bold designs that caught the public's imagination. Although the passage of time has made them seem less radical, vehicles like the 1992 Dodge Viper sports car, the '93 Dodge Intrepid sedan and the '94 Dodge Ram pickup were sensations when new.
But Chrysler has had trouble duplicating the initial success of its products as it brings out new versions. In part, big advances have been hard to make as engineers tried to hold down product development costs, which had been the industry's lowest. Meanwhile, competitors are moving ahead and nibbling at niches -- like minivans and Jeeps -- that Chrysler used to dominate.
"The secret to Chrysler's success was owning a segment, or doing something in a segment, that forced competitors to react," said Jim Hall, senior vice president of AutoPacific, an auto-industry consulting firm. He says he doesn't see that happening now.
Consider the Neon. When it arrived as a 1995 model, it was a breakthrough in American economy cars. Instead of plain, mundane, boring and slow, it was cute, bright, peppy, fun to drive and brimming with personality. At around $10,000, it represented a good value. And it was a hit.
When the Neon was redesigned five years later, it was undeniably improved. But the price was higher, the styling was blander and some problems with the original -- a noisy ride, for one -- persisted. The competition, which by then included several improved Korean cars, was tougher. The Neon has sold poorly of late.
Last fall, it was the minivans' turn for another revamping. Again, improvements were made: the new models are quieter and have better engines. But the market shifted faster than Chrysler: the Honda Odyssey had established itself as the minivan to beat, and buyers were waiting months, and paying premiums, to get them. In contrast, unsold Chrysler vans began to pile up right away, and the company had to offer sales incentives almost from the start.
Now, the same pattern seems to be playing out with the redesigned 2001 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring. Like the Neon and the minivans, these midsize cars are nice enough, and they are distinctly improved. But after test drives in two of them, I had to conclude that although they are competitive in their size and price range, they do not set any standards for their class. In today's fiercely competitive market, just good enough may not be good enough.
A word about the names: Gone are the Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler Cirrus sedans and the Dodge Avenger coupe. The Breeze was eliminated because the Plymouth brand is being phased out. (Only the Neon and Prowler carry the Plymouth badge for 2001.) The Stratus, formerly a sedan only, comes as a coupe, too, replacing the Avenger. The Chrysler Sebring, which had been only a coupe and convertible, is now also a sedan, replacing the Cirrus. Chrysler consolidated the names to make it easier and cheaper to market the cars.
There is another twist: Except for their names, the coupes and sedans have virtually nothing in common. Sebring and Stratus coupes are based on the design of the Mitsubishi Eclipse, and they are built by Mitsubishi in Illinois. The sedans were engineered by Chrysler and are built in Sterling Heights, Mich., as is the Sebring convertible. Oddly, the convertible was not derived from the platform of the two-door coupe, as one might expect, but from the four-door sedan.
Here are driving impressions of two cars:

Dodge Stratus Sedan
In the 1990's, Chrysler's cars didn't fit neatly into existing market categories -- its "LH" sedans (the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision) were larger than midsize cars but not as bulky as full-size models. Its Neon was too spacious to be called a subcompact. And the first Stratus and Cirrus of 1995 (the Breeze arrived later) straddled two other segments.
Too substantial to be called compacts but not as large or expensive as the typical midsize car, they created a new class that has never been neatly labeled. A cab-forward design -- with the wheels at the car's corners and the engine and passenger cabin moved forward -- gave the sedans plenty of passenger and cargo space despite their fairly compact outside dimensions.
The redesigned 2001 Stratus still gracefully wears the cab-forward design, and it still has plenty of room and a large trunk. With its four-section grille and a body that looks wide, stocky and low, the Stratus is clearly a member of the Dodge family.
The interior has been refined, and the dashboard has few seams. Still, some of the plastic pieces seem cheap, a common trait of Chrysler products.
There are substantial improvements under the hood. The basic Stratus sedan comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder, revised to deliver 150 horsepower. And a new, optional
V-6, a 2.7-liter engine with 200 horsepower -- 32 more than before -- makes the Stratus one of most powerful sedans in its class. The top model, the ES, can be ordered with an AutoStick automatic that can be shifted manually (though without a clutch).
The brakes are beefier, the body is stiffer and the suspension and steering are retuned. The new Stratus is surely better than the previous one, but only incrementally. By and large, it didn't feel like an all-new car.
The ride was reasonably comfortable on smooth roads, a rarity in Michigan, but noise, especially from the tires, seemed excessive. The body showed a tendency to roll a bit on turns.
The plainest Stratus, the SE, starts at $18,425. My SE test car had the optional V-6 engine, a power driver's seat and antilock brakes, with a sticker of $20,310. Chrysler is currently offering a $1,000 rebate on all Stratus and Sebring models except the convertible, and there should be plenty of negotiating room on the price.

Chrysler Sebring Coupe
My weeklong test drive of the Chrysler Sebring coupe began inauspiciously. I flew into Detroit from sunny Mexico during one of Michigan's worst snowstorms in decades. After de-icing the car at the airport, I headed for the northwest suburbs in the wee morning hours. The trip, normally 45 minutes, became a harrowing three hours in blizzard conditions. Snow accumulated rapidly on roads that hadn't been plowed.
The Sebring held on surprisingly well until I turned into my unplowed subdivision. Snow was piled high, and the low-slung car didn't have enough ground clearance to budge even an inch. I ended up abandoning the Sebring and walking home.
I retrieved it a few days later, but with the roads icy I never had a chance to truly test its performance. Still, the Sebring's similarity to the Eclipse was clear, down to the prominent air vents in the dashboard.
The new Chrysler and Dodge coupes have different engines than the sedans. The two-door Stratus and Sebring have a 2.4-liter in-line four cylinder with a single overhead cam (142 horsepower) or a 3-liter, single-cam V-6 (200 horsepower). A five-speed manual transmission is available with the smaller engine. The top-of-the-line LXi with the V-6 can be mated to AutoStick. Two models are available: the LX and LXi.
The LX test coupe started at $20,505; options, including antilock brakes, pushed the price to $22,085.
The old Sebring seemed to have special appeal to young, single women, and the new coupe is quite attractive. One could even call it sleek and sexy. Still, as was the case with the Stratus, the Sebring didn't feel like a car that began with a clean sheet of paper. It felt like an Eclipse.
For at least a decade, Chrysler's cars had a distinct character, and that was often enough to make up for their deficiencies -- noisy cabins, inferior materials and spotty quality control. The Sebring benefits from incremental improvements, and like the Stratus it is a pretty good car, but it lacks distinction in a crowded market. With its high quality, Toyota can thrive with bland mass-market cars; Chrysler cannot.
As it retrenches, Chrysler must hold down engineering costs. But it needs again to develop fresh products -- like the PT Cruiser -- that the public can't resist. The Sebring and Stratus don't go far enough.

INSIDE TRACK: Progress measured in baby steps instead of by leaps and bounds.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
By Listening, 3 Economists Show Slums Hurt the Poor

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
HOUSING vouchers have been a ticket out of the slums for thousands of poor families since the 1980's. But only recently have researchers begun to pin down the benefits of moving to better neighborhoods. And three economists may have stumbled on the most important benefit of all -- by engaging in some unconventional economics.
 Economists rarely cast themselves as caseworkers interviewing poor people and listening to their troubles. Most are more at home with equations, computer models and other people's data about human behavior. Taking off this harness, the three economists -- Lawrence F. Katz and Jeffrey B. Liebman at Harvard, and Jeffrey R. Kling at Princeton -- took to the streets of Boston and demonstrated through their research what many people sense intuitively. 
 That does not detract from their achievement; demonstrating the accuracy of an intuition can carry weight among policy makers. What the three established in their research was that slums pull down families, damaging them emotionally and physically. That insight runs counter to current public policy, which tries to improve life in the slums by spending millions on police, schools and jobs. And now comes the finding that all this outlay misses the point. The slums themselves are the problem. The culture of poverty begins to lift only when slum dwellers move to better neighborhoods.
"Either it was the neighborhood that caused the problem, or the innate characteristics of the people themselves," Mr. Liebman said. "We had no credible way to convince someone that it was the neighborhood until we did this research."
There is a story here. The voucher program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, called Section 8, gives residents of public housing projects rent subsidies so that they can afford homes in better neighborhoods. The families who get the limited number of rent vouchers are usually headed by single mothers with low incomes.
One goal is to give families a ticket out of segregated, inner-city projects. Another is to improve people's lives by subsidizing rent in more affluent surroundings. Most families move to working-class communities where the poverty rate is 20 percent to 30 percent of the population, compared with 40 percent or more in the projects. But the improvement in family performance was not clearly evident. So HUD ordered a study.
People who wanted to leave the projects volunteered to participate in a lottery. The winners got considerable help in using their rent vouchers to move to neighborhoods with poverty rates below 10 percent, usually in the suburbs. "Very few people without help or prodding would choose to move outside the city limits," Mr. Katz said. The lottery losers remained in the projects as a control group. The random selection implicit in a lottery meant that improvements in the lives of those who moved, compared with the control group, were not a result of superior personal characteristics that had compelled them to move in the first place.
The HUD study, which began in 1994, involved housing projects in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Boston. Mr. Katz, Mr. Liebman and Mr. Kling got the research rights for Boston. They were going to focus on the usual goals -- school and job performance -- until they decided to conduct interviews. 
"I thought they were going to say they wanted access to better jobs and schools," Mr. Liebman said, "and what we came to understand was their consuming fear of random crime; the need the mothers felt to spend every minute of their day making sure their children were safe."
So the economists designed their research to see what happened when the fear of crime lifted in the new neighborhoods. Six years after the study began, there has been measurable improvement in the behavior of boys and in the mental health of mothers, who suffer less from depression. There were fewer asthma attacks and a big decline in injuries, partly from fewer fights, but also because playgrounds were no longer uniformly paved in concrete.
What did not improve markedly was school and job performance. If these had been the focus of the research, then subsidizing rents to get families out of slums would be harder to justify. Still, the research continues. The three economists are on a team working in all five cities and they are shifting their focus to schools and jobs. "We may see improvements in earnings five or six years out," Mr. Katz said, "and the kids may be less likely to drop out of high school."
But the Boston research is already significant. Dismantling slums and integrating residents into better-off neighborhoods -- never an easy process -- now has more scientific justification. That is a finding that standard economics would have missed.

HEADLINE: The Town That Gags Its Writers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEAVITT; David Leavitt is the author, most recently, of the novel, "Martin Bauman; or, A Sure Thing," published last fall by Houghton Mifflin, and, with Mark Mitchell, of "In Maremma: Life and a House in Southern Tuscany," to be published in May by Counterpoint.

 BODY:
RECENTLY one of my students at the University of Florida wrote a story about a young writer who lives at 895 NE 107th Street in New York City. It goes without saying that this student had never been to New York. In her story, the hero, an aspiring novelist, rents a charmingly rundown flat in Manhattan, has an interesting if low-paying job and spends much of his time sitting in coffeehouses with his friends, talking about literature and philosophy.
 After I read the story, I asked my student to come and see me. I wanted to set her straight on a number of points, not the least of them how New York addresses work, but I also wanted to offer her a dose of reality -- if possible, without injuring any fragile illusions on which her education might depend. After all, I had once nurtured fantasies not unlike her own. In 1983 I moved to New York to be a writer in New York, found myself an overpriced and uncharmingly run-down flat, and got a job as a slush reader for a publisher. And New York, in a matter of weeks, managed to destroy entirely the idealism that had brought me there. 
 Herewith another version of the story, the one I told my student. 
In this version, as in the original, the fictional hero is a fledgling novelist. I shall call him Paul, after the novelist played by George Peppard in the movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and also after the glamour-besotted hero of Willa Cather's story "Paul's Case."
Paul, my Paul, moves to Manhattan straight out of college to hone his craft. To make a living, he takes a job in publishing. Many of the people with whom he works turn out to be writers as well, so almost instantly he finds himself living, as he had hoped he would, in a community of fellow aspirants. They eat many meals together. 
On weekends they sit in coffeehouses, sipping lattes and tea, and sometimes talking about literature. Yet more often, because they work in publishing, they talk about publishing. They talk about money. They talk about X, 23 and fresh out of the Columbia M.F.A. program, who has just gotten a six-figure advance for her first novel. Is it true that X's agent included a Marion Ettlinger head shot with her manuscript when he sent it out? Is it true . . . ? Is it true . . . ?
One evening a friend of Paul's, also a writer (but published), takes him to a book party. There he is introduced to numerous agents and editors, including X's, most of whom look over his shoulder while they talk to him, their eyes on the door through which someone more important might be about to enter. By and large the editors are smooth-talking and urbane, yet more than a few are wallflowers, lacking, it seems, in even the most basic social skills. 
As for the agents, one gives him her card and suggests that he call her. He does. Her assistant tells him that she is in a meeting. He calls again a week later, and she is still in a meeting. She is in a meeting for the next six months. Another agent tells him that if he hasn't made it by this point, he never will. A third insists that he must cement his reputation with a collection of short stories before he can even hope to publish a novel. A fourth tells him that short stories don't sell, and that he shouldn't even bother writing them.
Paul shares a chunk of his manuscript with an editor at the house where he works. She expresses guarded enthusiasm and asks to see more. Before he has a chance to show her anything, however, she takes another job. Her replacement, finding his pages in a file drawer, and not yet having learned his name, sends him a form rejection letter. Paul is too shy to explain that the pages were his.
 HE buys a season ticket to the reading series at the 92nd Street Y, and never goes once. He subscribes to The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books and Publisher's Weekly, the last of which he reads more avidly than either of the others, especially the advance reviews and the rights column, from which he learns that X has now sold the foreign rights to her book in 15 countries, that Redbook has bought first serial rights, and that two studios are vying to option one of her short stories. X is now rich; he sees her at another party, surrounded by admirers, wearing a Hermes scarf. 
In the evenings, when he is not eating with his friends, Paul attends panels on publishing issues sponsored by the Authors Guild or PEN. After a panel called "Asian Writers: New Voices," he worries that because he is white, he will never find a publisher. After a panel called "Women Writers: New Voices," he worries that because he is male, he will never find a publisher. After a panel called "Gay Writers: New Voices," he worries that because he is heterosexual, he will never find a publisher. 
A friend of his (who is also my friend, Mark Mitchell) has told him: "In New York, I worry about other people's work. Away from New York, I worry about mine." On strolls through bookstores, Paul memorizes the logos of the most famous publishers -- dogs, dolphins, ships -- and learns by heart whose books they grace and whose they do not.
X's novel comes out. It is a flop. On the other hand, the buzz about another first novel, this one by Y, could not be more enthusiastic. Although Y was not paid a six-figure advance, The New Yorker is bringing out his first chapter. Elizabeth Hardwick, Renata Adler and Susan Sontag have all given him blurbs. When Y's novel appears, it is featured on the front page of The New York Times Book Review. 
Having read the review, Paul looks in despair at the manuscript of his own unfinished novel, which could not differ more, either in tone or content, from Y's. Has he made a dreadful mistake? Should he start again? On the other hand, when he actually sits down to read Y's novel, the reading of it takes him so far from the chatter surrounding its publication that upon finishing, he has trouble coming to. For Y, despite everything, is the real thing, a writer. 
Still, a consciousness of the industry (and all that word implies) ferments just on the other side of the glossy jacket. Paul knows from friends with inside information that Y's novel will have its debut at No. 7 on the New York Times best-seller list, that Y is to be the subject of a profile in New York, that someone is thinking of composing an opera based on his book. . . . 
So it goes. All around Paul, the media make noise, in many ways louder than that of the traffic outside his window. Among other things, it tells him that he must learn to sell himself, a labor that takes him every day further from his computer, and deeper into the churning chaos of the market.
IN her wonderfully satirical story "Levitation," Cynthia Ozick gives us a couple, both novelists, called Feingold and Lucy. Feingold, in addition to writing, works as an editor. The one principle on which he and his wife agree is "the importance of never writing about writers," which they call "The Forbidden Thing." Eventually "The Forbidden Thing" is transformed into "The Forbidden City, because not only were they (but Lucy especially) tempted to write -- solipsistically, narcissistically, tediously, and without common appeal -- about writers, but more narrowly yet, about writers in New York."
As Paul, like Feingold and Lucy, is a fictional character, let us introduce him to them at a Sunday afternoon brunch whose host is Feingold's agent. Seeing something of themselves in Paul, themselves in youth, they take him under their common wing. They introduce him around. They offer him detailed editorial advice. Theirs is a city, in Ozick's words, full of people who live on "pity, and therefore on gossip . . . who had lost three successive jobs, who was in danger of being fired, which agent's prestige had fallen, who could not get her second novel published, who was persona non grata at this or that magazine . . . who was being snubbed, who counted or did not count."
The Feingolds joke that they are "secondary-level people."
"Feingold had a secondary-level job with a secondary-level house. Lucy's own publisher was secondary-level; even the address was on Second Avenue." Theirs may even be the "secondary city" of which George Steiner writes in "Real Presences," when he calls for the sweeping away of the very ephemera, the "high gossip" with its "tenor of busy vacancy" that the Feingolds personify. At night, Paul begins to dream about bombs dropping on publishing parties, wiping out every source of his anxiety.
Sometimes he wonders if he should leave. Should he leave? The truth is, after only a few months, he finds it hard to imagine living anywhere else besides Manhattan. Once he could have. But since then the island seems to have ruined him for life elsewhere. For six months, he realizes, he has not crossed either river even once. He recalls Woody Allen in "Annie Hall," driving in a daze through Beverly Hills at Christmas. To the rest of the world, even to his hometown and the town where he went to college, he has become allergic.
On weekends, when he wakes up in the morning, the first thing he does is pick up the phone to call one of his friends. "Any news?" he asks. If the refrain sounds familiar, it is because it is one of the catch phrases from E. F. Benson's Mapp and Lucia novels: New York City has become, for Paul, as hermetic, as provincial, as Benson's Tilling-by-the-Sea.
PAUL loses his apartment, which he is subletting illegally. The landlord finds him out, and the woman from whom he is renting, in a panic, evicts him. He has to find another apartment quickly, and as he refuses categorically to move to Brooklyn or Queens, he ends up on the Lower East Side, in a sixth floor walk-up, paying close to $1,000 a month for one room. He must ask for help from his parents to make his rent.
He becomes acutely conscious of real estate. In one of the design magazines to which he turns when he wants to relax, he sees a spread of X's new loft in SoHo. Y, he hears, has just bought a floor-through in a converted church in Greenwich Village. The parties he goes to seem always to take place in palatial Upper East Side duplexes full of high ceilings and views. 
In an effort to make himself feel better, he tries to remember that in living as he does he is following in a long tradition. After all, from "La Boheme" onward, literature and opera and cinema have exalted the idea of the young writer starving in a garret. 
And yet in the old days being poor in New York was easier, because New York was cheap. It's hard to lose yourself in the fog of art when you can't afford an air-conditioner, and the erratic thrum of a jackhammer rises up from the street. Through the thin walls comes the sound of techno played too loudly. Babies and sirens cry.
At a party Paul meets a novelist he has long admired. "When I'm working," she tells him, "I can disappear into my study and not come out . . . for days." As it happens, this novelist is married to a stockbroker, and lives on Central Park West. How enviously Paul envisions her study, its walls upholstered in some quieting damask fabric, its capacious oak desk overlooking the park.
WHERE does this story end? What will happen to Paul? His fate, I'm sorry to say, is uncertain. Perhaps he will publish a novel and have a great New York success, be voted into the American Academy, and win the Pulitzer Prize. Or perhaps he will get a promotion and become a powerful editor who snubs young supplicants at parties. Or perhaps he will lose his job and be forced, by economic necessity, to leave New York.
This last outcome, in my view, would be the most salutary. For once he gets out of New York (and in Paul's case he would have to be dragged kicking and screaming), he may discover, in the sudden quiet, that he can hear his own voice. No matter what the Feingolds of the world may say, writing itself is the thing that really counts.
Let's move him to Gainesville, Fla., where I write now. Let's put him in a decent apartment that rents for $500 a month. Is he happier? There aren't nearly so many movies to choose among, nor is the local independent bookstore as well stocked as the Strand. Yet the street on which he lives is tranquil and tree-lined, and if he drives a few miles, he can swim in a lake.
My purpose in telling this story is not to discourage young writers from developing the business acumen, or the instinct for fashion, or even the shell of self-protective irony that writers need in order to survive and that they have needed since the age of Dickens. These muscles matter, yet something about New York teaches us to tone them, to flex them at the expense of others that matter more: imagination and craft. 
In New York we live surrounded by monoliths, institutions both vast and self-sustaining that must convince us of our dependency on them in order to survive. Thus the myth persists in the publishing industry that publishers create writers, and not the other way around, that dog or dolphin on the spine of a book will make what he writes literature. Yet the truth is that only writers can make literature. The whole massive enterprise rests on the scrawny shoulders of novices like Paul.
If he is to learn this lesson, though -- which is really the lesson of his own power -- he will first have to get out of New York.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
The City by the Bay? To Them, It's Oakland

BYLINE:  By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
WHEN John Protopappas started buying a few residential and office properties in this traditionally unfashionable blue-collar city in the early 1980's, "not many people wanted to join me," he recalled. Through the years of the city's decline, his business grew slowly.
 Today, his Madison Park Real Estate Trust owns about 2,500 residential units in Oakland and a few office buildings, including the downtown's signature Tribune Tower, which he bought in 1995 for $300,000. Although hardly a giant by the standards of major investment trusts, Madison Park, of which Mr. Protopappas is chief executive, has grown to $45 million in assets from roughly $4 million in 1985. 
 An important factor in the company's expansion, Mr. Protopappas says, has been its focus on Oakland, which is enjoying an economic resurgence. The city's new attractiveness is seen in real estate, as developers like Walter Shorenstein of San Francisco have started to buy major properties. 
Fifteen years ago, the idea of building luxury lofts or attracting high-end office developers to Oakland, where the 395,000 residents are largely poor or working class, would have seemed absurd. Yet in the last five years, Mr. Protopappas, 42, has been able to sell virtually every unit he can get his hands on. He is also developing four other major projects in the city.
The changes are most evident downtown. Despite its central location in the region -- it is the main transfer point for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system -- it was also largely characterized by deteriorating buildings and failing stores. Now smart restaurants are popping up, and stores are returning. Oakland's boomlet -- with rising property values and plummeting vacancy rates -- is a reflection of new real estate opportunities that have emerged in scores of once-neglected industrial cities across the country, from Tacoma, Wash., to Tulsa, Okla., to Baltimore. These cities all have gained favor with old- and new-economy companies, particularly as they seek lower rents in what appears to be a time of corporate retrenchment.
OAKLAND has suffered for years from comparison to San Francisco, just across the Bay Bridge. San Francisco boosters refer to their hometown as "the City" as if there were no other city in the Bay Area, or even California. (And no one ever sang about leaving his heart in Oakland.)
To be sure, Oakland's renaissance has had less to do with its intrinsic appeal than with simply being in the right neighborhood. Mr. Protopappas points out that prime office space in Oakland rents for $48 a square foot, roughly half the going rate in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. For Class B space, which includes older buildings in less-desirable areas, rents are about $18 a square foot.
"It's really about the fact that San Francisco has become so expensive, and so has the valley," Mr. Protopappas said at his offices in the 20-story Tribune Tower. "It's attracting new-economy companies and older-economy companies that want to be near the new economy."
The technology surge in the Bay Area has done much to remake Oakland. In the 1990's the area, which includes Oakland and neighboring cities, excluding San Francisco, was among the 10 fastest-growing high-tech metropolitan regions with populations of more than one million. It is now home to more than 300 high-technology companies. 
Today, the tough times affecting the Bay Area's technology industry and the businesses that service it may also be benefiting Oakland. In the last six months, as much as one million square feet of sublease space has hit the market in San Francisco, largely a result of the dot-com shakeout, while Oakland has continued to fill new space as more companies move there. Vacancy rates for top-quality office space in Oakland fell to about 3 percent this year from about 12 percent in 1996, while vacancy rates for Class B space dropped to 6 percent from about 15 percent. 
Steven Marshall, president of Marshall Associates Inc., an 11-person company that designs laundries and kitchens for large corporations, moved the company to the Tribune Tower last year, when the rent in his San Francisco building went to $75 a square foot from $25; his new rate in Oakland is $27.
Mr. Marshall cited other factors that made Oakland attractive, like lower business taxes and less-expensive parking.
Much credit for Oakland's revival, Mr. Protopappas and others say, also belongs to Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former governor of California, who became the city's mayor in June 1998. 
"Five years ago, downtown was occupied by hostile forces," Mr. Protopappas said. "What Jerry Brown is creating is an environment that has people walking around downtown with disposable income. Jerry Brown has been a very effective leader. He's been a visionary who deals well with the bureaucracy and has put the city on the map."
Mr. Brown says Oakland's comeback is a result of a "learning experience" derived from decade-long anti-business policies, which concentrated on extracting benefits from companies to support the city's social-service programs. 
In contrast, he assiduously courts developers like Mr. Protopappas. Mr. Brown has also worked to provide the kinds of efficient city services, including sanitation and public safety, that matter to prospective corporate clients, entrepreneurs and middle-income residents. Within the next few years, Mr. Brown estimates, as many as 10,000 people will move into central Oakland, many of them middle-class and above.
Not everyone in the Bay Area, even in Oakland, shares Mr. Brown's enthusiasm for the city's economy. 
Nancy Nadel, a city councilwoman who represents Oakland's downtown and adjacent areas, says the mayor's development-oriented strategy is raising residential rents and displacing many of the city's poor. "My concern is, every day I get five calls from constituents who are being evicted because they can't pay the higher rents," Ms. Nadel said. "We have to be concerned that the growth of the city helps all the residents of the city."
SAN FRANCISCO residents appear to be taking Oakland's revival in stride.
"Oakland has its place, and we're delighted with their resurgence," said Roberta Achtenberg, senior vice president for public policy at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Achtenberg, a former San Francisco supervisor, said it was natural that companies with budget concerns would migrate to Oakland. "But if it's diversity and creativity of the work force you want," she added, "you still tend to want to go to San Francisco."
Claudine Osipow, president of DCO International, a seven-person plastics-trading company that moved from San Francisco to the Tribune Building in July, acknowledged that clients were surprised when she told them of the move. Yet Ms. Osipow, a San Francisco resident, said she had no regrets.
"It's still a bit limited for restaurants," she said, "but I can always take the train to San Francisco and be there in 20 minutes."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS; 
Not in My Backyard? That Depends on the Payroll

BYLINE:  By BEN SPIESS 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
THE Yukon and Northwest Territories, the beautiful but forlorn territories in Canada's distant northern corner near Alaska, have coexisted as peacefully as the caribou that crisscross their vast expanses of tundra and scrubby spruce forests. But the prospect of a multibillion-dollar Alaskan natural-gas pipeline snaking southeast to feed the lower 48 states has touched off a quiet struggle between the two territories to win the project, which could mean prosperity for just one of them.
 In what could be the biggest economic boom for northwest Canada since the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a consortium of oil companies hopes to build a pipe up to 1,800 miles long that would carry natural gas from Alaska's North Slope; the deposit is the largest known undeveloped gas reserve in the United States. The rising value of natural gas -- it has tripled in price in the last year -- may make such a pipeline commercially profitable. 
 "For most big oil-and-gas projects, the feeling is, 'not in my backyard,' " said Ken Konrad, the head of the gas development team in Anchorage for BP Amoco, a consortium member. "With this project, everyone wants it in their backyard."
BP and its partners, ExxonMobil and Phillips Petroleum, are spending $75 million just to determine the project's viability and the potential route. Their decisions are expected late this year.
Both territories are increasingly looking at the pipeline as an economic salvation, largely because they see few alternatives. Combined, the Yukon and Northwest Territories are about one-fifth the size of the continental United States, but have a combined population of about 70,000 -- only slightly larger than that of Portland, Me.
Unemployment rates in both territories are near 12 percent, roughly double the national average. Falling metal prices -- gold prices in particular -- have severely depressed the mainstay industry, mining.
The premiers of the two territories, Pat Duncan of the Yukon and Stephen Kakfwi of the Northwest Territories, have been crisscrossing North America on rival selling tours. Both met last month with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada. Mr. Kakfwi swung through Washington in October to talk to officials of the Energy and Interior departments. Ms. Duncan has met with oil executives in Anchorage and with Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska in Juneau.
The competition has created an awkward relationship between the two premiers, whose interests are usually aligned. Both say publicly that a pipeline would inevitably be good for all. "We're not degrading anyone's project," Ms. Duncan said last month. 
But the spirit of the rivalry comes through, reflecting the big stakes. "It's no secret where we want Alaskans to put the pipeline," Mr. Kakfwi has said.
Both territories have been auctioning exploration leases, betting that if a big pipeline were built nearby, it would spur development of their own, smaller reserves.
Local construction companies, which have little work now but are virtually assured years of full-time employment if the pipeline is built within driving range, follow each snippet of pipeline news. In the Yukon capital, Whitehorse, where 22,000 of the territory's 32,000 residents live, Jon Rudolph, owner of the Golden Hill Ventures construction company, said things were so bad that he had laid off most of his employees.
Asked what would happen to the Yukon if the project went to the Northwest Territories instead, he said, "Well, this territory will just continue to decline."
ABOUT 600 miles away in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, the hopes of Nellie Cournoyea also rest on natural gas. Inuvik, population 3,000, sits on the northern edge of the territory, in the Mackenzie River delta. Ms. Cournoyea is the chief executive of the corporation that manages the Inuit local economic interests.
The Inuit in the region still depend on caribou and fish for food. But with a decline in the fur business, few people can live comfortably. "Everyone struggles to find work," Ms. Cournoyea said.
She hopes that the pipeline will run nearby, because the Mackenzie delta has eight trillion cubic feet of its own gas reserves. 
Many people believe that Mackenzie could get its own, separate pipeline. But Mackenzie's reserves pale in comparison with Alaska's 35 trillion cubic feet. 
ExxonMobil, BP and Phillips have given no clue about their preference. The companies envision a pipeline that would begin operation in 2007 and deliver up to four billion cubic feet a day to the lower 48 states over 30 years, augmenting current supplies by about 7 percent.
At first glance, the Northwest Territories route, which would follow the Arctic coast to the Mackenzie River delta and south to Alberta, makes more sense. At 1,400 miles and costing an estimated $5.5 billion, a pipeline on that route would be about 300 miles shorter and 30 percent cheaper than one on the Yukon route, which would likely follow the Alaska Highway.
With lower transportation costs, the route would also likely mean more money for the Alaskan government, which owns a royalty share of North Slope gas. 
BUT Alaska's governor and Congressional delegation support the Alaska Highway route via the Yukon because it would bring natural gas to cities like Fairbanks. With memories still fresh of the oil pipeline that made Alaska rich, a project across the state to the Yukon conjures visions of a second bonanza. 
The Northwest Territories route may also draw opposition from environmental groups, because it would border the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But officials in Northwest Territories see lower costs and shorter distance as their best advantages.
"When I look at a map, the straightest line from the North Slope to the lower 48 is through Northwest Territories," said Joe Handley, the territories' finance minister. Mr. Kakfwi has predicted that "ultimately, this is going to be decided by which project delivers gas at the lowest cost."
Alaska's producers are not alone in trying to bring big reserves to market. Other large reserves in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico and off Nova Scotia are also under consideration. As fresh supplies reach the market, prices will fall, said Bill Gwozd, an analyst at Ziff Energy in Calgary, Alberta. But over the longer term, Mr. Gwozd forecast, prices will strengthen.
But prices are not necessarily predictable. During the last natural-gas price shock, in the mid-1970's, an Alaska natural-gas pipeline seemed certain. In the Northwest Territories, companies poured hundreds of millions of dollars into exploration. 
In the Yukon, developers built a subdivision to house an expected influx of workers. Ms. Duncan, the Yukon premier, remembered neighbors in Whitehorse who bought welding trucks and supplies, ready for the boom. In the mid-1980's, prices collapsed. The Alaska pipeline never happened.
"Some of those trucks are still sitting there," Ms. Duncan said.

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES; 
Act Now, Save Later As the 1040 Changes

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
SO far, people looking to adjust their financial plans to save on taxes this year have been spared the anguish of muddling through an assortment of mind-numbing modifications to the 45,662-page tax code. Aside from the usual inflation-adjusted increases for certain deductions, the biggest change for 2001 has been a cut in the capital gains tax for lower-income people -- a change that is only now being phased in as part of a 1997 law.
 But hold on to your calculators. While the 2001 tax year may have started quietly, monumental changes are brewing in Washington -- remember the 1986 tax overhaul? -- that could make tax planning more challenging this year, advisers say. 
 One result is almost certain: just about everyone should eventually get a tax cut, though how much and when are far from clear. 
Saying that it is needed to shore up the faltering economy, President Bush has proposed a $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years. He also wants to gradually repeal the estate and gift tax, reduce the marriage penalty and double the child tax credit.
The Democrats favor only half as big a tax cut over all, in the neighborhood of $800 billion, and want it to be focused more on low- and middle-income Americans. "It's hard to predict what compromise might be reached," said Thomas P. Ochsenschlager, a tax partner at the Grant Thornton accounting firm in Washington, but he does not expect the president's plan to pass unscathed through the House and Senate tax committees. 
So how should taxpayers alter their financial plans in the meantime? The answers depend primarily on when the tax cut takes effect -- next year, the middle of this year or retroactive to Jan. 1.
Making the cut retroactive -- as Mr. Bush has proposed to help jump-start the economy by putting more money into taxpayers' pockets sooner -- "means you really don't have to do much planning," said Martin Nissenbaum, the national director for personal income tax planning at Ernst & Young in New York, adding that "it's basically too late."

UT a change effective in 2002 would mean vast tax-planning opportunities, he and other tax advisers said.
It would make sense, for example, to defer as much income as possible into next year, when rates would be lower. Examples include year-end bonuses and, if you are a small-business owner, accounts receivable. And investors might want to move out of short-term holdings like Treasury bills and to buy notes or bonds with longer maturities.
At the same time, they could accelerate as many deductions as possible into this year, when deductions could be taken at a higher rate, the experts said. Examples are charitable contributions or payments of fourth-quarter estimated state taxes.
"With lower marginal rates, that means income is worth more if you get it after the change, and expenses are worth more if you have them before the change," said Larry M. Elkin, a tax accountant and financial planner in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. "Giving $100 to your favorite charity under the existing top marginal rate costs about $60 out of pocket. With the rate lowered to 33 percent, it's $67 out of pocket."
Under Mr. Bush's plan, the tax savings for a married couple with two children and combined annual income of $50,000 would amount to $1,975, according to estimates from CCH Inc., a tax consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill. If that family earned $100,000, it would receive a $5,914 break, CCH said.
FOR now, one sure way for some people to save on taxes is to take advantage of a new capital gains rate that became effective this year. The rate on investments, like stocks and bonds, that were held at least five years before being sold dropped to 8 percent from 10 percent for people in the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket. The five-year gains rate for most other taxpayers will drop to 18 percent from 20 percent, but not until 2006. The 1997 tax law, which instituted the changes, called for the gradual phase-in.
"If you have property that you're going to be selling, that meets the five-year requirements, think about transferring that to your children or someone in a lower bracket so they can take advantage of the tax benefits," Mr. Nissenbaum said. That strategy could benefit families who sell investments to pay for college costs.
But planners say there is no reason to make many changes yet when it comes to some of the big tax-favored areas like contributions to tax-deferred retirement plans and state-sponsored college savings plans.
The tax advantages of these plans are not expected to change, and even if marginal rates drop, making them slightly less advantageous, they are still attractive. If any action is taken in Congress this year, it would probably be to allow more generous contributions. 
Taxpayers will need to focus on estate planning, advisers say, even though proposed changes regarding the estate tax would not take effect until several years from now.
Mr. Bush wants a gradual repeal -- over eight years -- in the estate tax, which can be as high as 55 percent on large estates. The tax, which kicks in for estates over $675,000 this year, a threshold that is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006, affects only about 2 percent of all estates in the country, but it has been a hot issue, particularly among business owners. Couples, by dividing ownership of assets, can shield $1.35 million from gift and estate taxes this year and $2 million by 2006.
Many more people could benefit from elimination of the gift tax, a proposal that is still being worked out by the White House and members of Congress.
Some people use gifts to lower the value of their estates. Under current law, individuals can give up to $10,000 a year each to as many people as they wish, with no tax consequences. If a spouse joins in, the maximum rises to $20,000. Those restrictions could disappear under a tax overhaul. But again, the question is, when?
Some taxpayers may be tempted to refrain from serious estate planning until the dust settles, but that would be a mistake, Mr. Elkin said. "Don't make large taxable gifts if it looks like that tax will go down or go away, but that does not mean you should not plan," he said, pointing out that both death and taxes are inevitable and that some people will die before the law changes. 
Regardless of the outcome of that debate, some other changes that are effective this year may be reason enough to revise estate plans. The Internal Revenue Service has issued new withdrawal rules for individual retirement accounts and most other retirement accounts. In a key change, the life-expectancy tables governing required minimum distributions have been lengthened, allowing people to leave more money in their accounts to grow tax-deferred for later years or for their heirs.
"Basically, a lot of people don't have that ability even to take advantage of the existing $675,000 exemption," said Seymour Goldberg, a tax lawyer in Garden City, N.Y., referring to the estate tax. "With the new changes in the I.R.A. rules, people can just use their I.R.A.'s" to pass on wealth to their heirs, he said. If a spouse, for example, is the beneficiary of an I.R.A., a child can be made the contingent beneficiary. Then if the spouse does not need the money, he or she can disclaim it, and the child will inherit the I.R.A., which may be paid out based upon his or her own life expectancy.
Some changes intended to adjust for inflation also take effect this year. Among them are an increase in the the business mileage deduction, to 34.5 cents from 32.5 cents, and in the amount of interest from a qualified student loan that can be deducted, to $2,500 from $2,000. 
"The big changes are yet to come," Mr. Nissenbaum said.

When Income Is Untouchable

What a dream! There really is money that the Internal Revenue Service cannot touch. What's more, says Mildred Carter, a lawyer and federal tax analyst at CCH Inc., tax-free income reduces adjusted gross income and can thus limit phaseouts of itemized deductions and personal exemptions for upper-income people. A lower income can also help shield Social Security benefits from taxation. Among the exempt payments are these:

Gifts, bequests and inheritances.

Life insurance proceeds paid after death.

Child support payments made to a custodial parent.

Certain amounts received for personal injuries and sickness.

Most municipal bond interest.

Scholarship and fellowship grants to degree candidates for tuition and course-related fees, books and supplies.

Certain employee benefits, generally including accident and health insurance premiums and some life and long-term-care insurance premiums, up to $5,200 a year of undergraduate tuition reimbursement and child or dependent care up to $5,000 a year.

Most reparations for Nazi persecution.

HEADLINE: Perspective; 
At Daytona, a Sunday Drive With the Right Feel and Fervor

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 17 

 BODY:
He was a car-crazy kid who raced dragsters, but he couldn't find anyone willing to bet a million dollars that he could really drive. That's a basic story line off pit road; every tire changer was once a ride away from becoming a contender. But Bill Davis did find a woman who could organize his ambitions, manage his dreams and chat up a sponsor. "I never had a passion for something the way he did," said Gail Davis, his wife of 19 years, "but I was willing to follow his and work hard."
 So here they are on the eve of stock car racing's major league campaign. Come Sunday, Nascar's Winston Cup season opens with its Super Bowl, the Daytona 500, and two brand-new Dodge Intrepids from Bill Davis Racing will vroom off to extend their owner's passionate adventure. 
 One of them, the No. 22 Caterpillar Dodge driven by Ward Burton, will be starting in the 10th position of the 43-car field. Ward Burton, the 39-year-old older brother of the more successful Jeff Burton, finished eighth in the Daytona 500 last year, his best in six tries, and ended the season in 10th place. His teammate Dave Blaney, in the No. 93 Amoco car, is 38, coming off a rookie season in which he competed in 33 races and finished in the top 10 only twice. He will be starting in the 20th spot. Starting position is based on speed in practice laps and qualifying races. 
Typically, Davis said Friday that while Blaney's car was "running a little hot," both cars had a good chance to win. Hot or not, newcomers have a tough time in a three-hour race in which drivers who know and trust each other will "help" each other. 
For Davis, for Dodge and for Nascar, it's the start of a crucial season. The sport's old cowboys are fading and its new astronauts have yet to emerge. Dodge is racing again after 16 years, and there is always the question of how a new car will run in relation to other cars, not to mention one whose parent company may be headed for a wreck. Nascar's first large-scale network television contract will give the sport more exposure and perhaps less slack. This may account for the sudden spate of suspensions for technical violations. 
At 50, Davis can move with the new -- he believes in computerized wind-tunnel data -- but still remember when the seat of a driver's pants, his "feel" for the car's vibrations, responses, smells and sounds was the heart of testing and tweaking. He describes himself as an active, "hands-on" owner.
Davis was raised in Little Rock, Ark. His father was best friends with Julian Martin, a more successful trucker from Batesville whose son, Mark, eight years younger than Bill, did have access to the money that buys real wheels. Bill Davis went to work for Julian's trucking company and became part of the young Mark's crew. Martin, of course, is now a Nascar star, a perennial challenger for the championship. 
It took Davis a little longer to get into the big leagues. He started his own coast-to-coast refrigerated trucking company, and when he hired Gail 20-odd years ago as a business manager he was able to spend more and more time at the track. As a minor league owner, his first driver was Mark Martin. But "it wasn't in the cards for us to be together," Davis says without bitterness. Martin was headed to the top and needed an owner who could him put in fast cars right away. 
In 1991, Davis put a 19-year-old Jeff Gordon in a Busch Series racer. The future superstar was rookie of the year and the next season jumped to Rick Hendrick, one of the richest and most successful owners. Davis will only mutter, "Jeff was impatient and didn't have confidence we could be successful," but Gail's fine, pale features tighten as she says, "Jeff didn't honor his commitments."
Davis didn't make it to Winston Cup, the big leagues, until 1993. His driver those first two years was Bobby Labonte, who then moved on to Joe Gibbs. Last season, Labonte won the title.
By this time, although Gail might join Bill at the races, she was running the Davis trucking company. It was big enough -- $5 million a year in revenues -- to need a full-time head, yet not big enough to support serious racing. Sponsorship and a manufacturer that would assume some costs were critical. In eight Winston Cup seasons, Davis has competed in 248 races, winning two, finishing second five times, piling up $11,680,917 in prize money. This is big money in almost any sport but this one. As much as half may go to the driver and to crew incentive bonuses. 
Costs are staggering. Bill Davis Racing has 105 employees. One day of the endless testing costs about $40,000. Cars and crews have to be transported to a track that has to be rented, and tires are bought like socks. Each of the 23 Cup tracks is different enough in configuration and length to require chassis and engine modifications, if not an entirely different chassis and engine. And for every change there must be more tests. 
Then Dodge drove back into Nascar. Dodge had been an important Nascar manufacturer from 1950 through 1985. Richard Petty won three of his seven championships (and his father, Lee, won his championship) behind the wheel of a Dodge. Petty has said his favorite car was the Dodge Charger. When a legendary crew chief, Ray Evernham, became Dodge's lead owner, and Petty Enterprises jumped from Pontiac, the offer from DaimlerChrysler, the parent company, suddenly became more attractive to Davis to leave Pontiac, too. There would be money and engineering help from a company that wanted to win soon. 
"It gave us a chance to be a factory team, to start with a blank computer screen," Davis said. "And to be part of something with the Pettys. With all that, it was still a leap of faith."
So far, it has been a back-and-forth leap. Since the Dodge deal was struck, Chrysler was taken over by Daimler, and it is not totally clear how the German company feels about an all-American brand sport, especially as hard times and layoffs loom. On the other hand, Dodge dealers have reportedly footed half the bill for the 10 Cup cars, and there has already been a payoff on the huge ad campaign: Evernham's star driver, the popular Bill Elliott, won the pole position for the Daytona 500 with a speed of 183.565 miles an hour, and his hot rookie, 20-year-old Casey Atwood, is No. 21. The second and third spots were also won by Dodges. 
There is a rumor that Nascar's latest attempt to "manage competition," its new aerodynamic package, favors the configurations of the Dodge chassis. It would be politic for Dodge to do well in its first year, and economically helpful to the Davises. Neither of their cars is fully sponsored. No. 22 has a blank lower rear quarter panel. There's more space on No. 93. Some good results would fill those little billboards. 
"We can always find ways to improve ourselves and every way costs money," Bill said. "More testing, more engines, more data."
"Unless you're really wealthy," Gail said, "you can't just say, 'I'm going racing.' "
"Even if you're wealthy," Bill said, "I got to think it takes more than just money. It takes hands on that car. The team that rubs on it most will be successful."

Series So Far
This is the fourth article in a series following auto racing, its safety, its sense of family and its popularity. Previous articles were about the sport's appeal to a cross- over audience, the search for a superstar and a veteran driver's viewpoint.

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Voice Optimism on Growth Despite Slowdowns 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PALERMO, Sicily, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the world's richest nations expressed optimism today that prospects for continued global growth remain good despite economic troubles in the United States and Japan.
 "The basic factors that have supported sustained growth in many of the major industrial economies remain in place," the Group of Seven said in a statement closing the gathering. 
 Specifically addressing the slowdown in the United States that has raised concerns that the world's largest economy could be slipping into a recession, the ministers urged Washington to use both interest rate policies and budget policies like tax cuts to support a rebound in growth. 
Both Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, have said the United States economy has ground to almost zero growth. But after a brace of hefty interest rate cuts in January, both now believe that a revival is in the wings.
The Group of Seven statement said "economic fundamentals remain strong" in the United States.
For Japan, the statement said a "modest recovery" was expected, but warned that "downside risks remain." They urged the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply to stimulate growth. The Japanese finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said afterward that the final wording of the statement had been modified to take into account the Bank ofJapan's move on Friday to cut its official discount rate.
But the explicit reference to monetary policy, rather than the general terms mentioned in September, suggested that the group regarded that as the key tool for more tinkering.
In Europe, "growth prospects remain favorable," largely because of strong domestic demand in the 12 European Union nations using the euro single currency, the group's statement said.
With an eye to new uncertainty about oil prices, the group's final statement noted that "lower energy prices and stable oil markets are important" for sustained growth.
Although oil prices dropped from near 10-year highs late last year, an American-British attack on Iraqi air defense installations on Friday and commitments by key oil producers to restrain supply have upset forecasts of more stability in the oil market.
European officials said the Russian authorities invited to the meeting here had "clearly committed themselves" to accept repayment of Russia's multibillion debt to international lenders.
Ministers from the seven nations -- Germany, France, Italy, Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada -- also reaffirmed their commitment to a debt relief initiative for poor countries. But they said a "broader, more ambitious strategy," including further opening of markets to exports from the poorest countries, was needed for poverty reduction.

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Fear Implications in Egypt's Trial of a Sociologist 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Prosecutors in the Supreme Security Court began their arguments today in the case against Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a prominent sociologist whose trial on charges of defaming Egypt is being closely watched for its chilling effect on the work of human rights groups and other independent research organizations here. 
 Mr. Ibrahim, the founder of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies, was accused, along with 27 others connected to the center, of spreading false reports about Egypt abroad. Prosecutors said he had harmed the country's image through exaggerated reports on various issues ranging from electoral fraud to tension between Muslims and Christians. Other charges against Mr. Ibrahim include accepting foreign donations without government permission, using donated money for personal gain and bribing newscasters to report favorably on the center's work. 
 "This country is more important than anything -- it is the nation that shelters you and you disparaged it with ease," said the prosecutor, Samih Seif, in opening arguments. 
"But it is also our nation," he continued, "and we will never accept a lying swindler to say such things about our country." 
The Khaldun Center had used nearly $160,000 from the European Commission for a project to increase public awareness of voting rights in Egypt; the project included producing a short film that mentioned past accusations of electoral fraud. The commission released a statement in December saying external audits had not given any cause for concern. 
Mr. Ibrahim had repeatedly called for independent judicial review of elections in Egypt and the Khaldun Center had planned to monitor the parliamentary elections last fall. He had also written an article in a Saudi magazine satirizing the trend among Arab leaders of grooming their sons for succession and mentioned Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak. 
The Khaldun Center had conducted research on democracy, civil society and minority rights. In Egypt, as in much of the Arab world, it is against the law to insult the country or its leaders. The center was closed after Mr. Ibrahim and others were arrested last June. Mr. Ibrahim, director of the sociology department at the American University in Cairo, holds dual Egyptian and American citizenship, and his arrest drew criticism from the State Department. 
Outside court today, his lawyers said the government would have difficulty proving any of the charges. Ibrahim Saleh, the main defense lawyer, said the Khaldun Center was a private organization working under contract and as such was not subject to the law requiring all foreign donations be reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs. 
Also outside court, Mr. Ibrahim, who is free on bail, said the prosecutor had presented nothing new. "I am sure I will be cleared," he said. "I am just a sociologist. I observe, document, analyze, and I try to make some recommendations."
Various international and local human rights organizations sent monitors to follow the trial. "The point of the trial is to eliminate the human rights movement in Egypt," said Negad al-Borai, of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights. 
"They are trying to prove that they can control any organization, that they can eliminate anyone they want," he said. "After this case, whether there is a verdict against Saad Eddin Ibrahim or not, many people will think twice before joining such groups."

HEADLINE: Police Seeking Two Teenagers Charged in Dartmouth Killings 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Police officers continued searching today for two Vermont high school students they have charged with the stabbing deaths last month of a couple who taught at Dartmouth College. 
 The students, Robert W. Tulloch, 17, and James J. Parker, 16, were last seen in or near their hometown, Chelsea, Vt., about 25 miles north of the Dartmouth campus, on Thursday, the police said. 
 The police announced that they were searching for Mr. Tulloch and a companion late Friday, about three weeks after a friend found the bodies of the professors, Half and Susanne Zantop, in pools of blood at their home in Etna, N.H., near Hanover. Today, the police named Mr. Parker as a suspect as well, saying the two worked together in the slayings. 
The warrants were a significant break in the weeks-old case, but still left many unanswered questions. 
"To the best of our knowledge, these individuals are not connected to Dartmouth," said Laurel Stavis, a Dartmouth spokeswoman.
The police said they believed Mr. Tulloch, who is 6 feet 1 and 155 pounds, and Mr. Parker, who is 6 feet and 150 pounds, were driving a 1987 silver Audi.
The young men were each charged with two counts of first-degree murder, and officials plan to prosecute them as adults.
At a press conference this afternoon in Hanover, a senior assistant attorney general, Kelly Ayotte, gave no details on the teenagers' motive or method. Ms. Ayotte said the police had forensic evidence "that ties them to these crimes."
Asked if the boys knew the Zantops before the killings, she said, "That's one of the aspects of the investigation that's still being examined."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is assisting local and state police, has posted information about Mr. Tulloch and Mr. Parker on its Web site, www.fbi.gov. 
A Chelsea High School classmate said the two young men had disappeared for a few days after the killings, saying they had been on their way to Colorado to go rock climbing, The Associated Press reported. The classmate said Mr. Tulloch told her they had turned back because of an infected cut on his leg, which he said he got from hitting a sap bucket in the woods. 
The Zantops, who were natives of Germany, were widely popular at Dartmouth. Susanne Zantop, 55, was the chairwoman of the German department; she had also taught comparative literature and was a distinguished research professor in the humanities. Half Zantop, 62, was a specialist in economic geology, and had been a professor in the earth sciences department since 1976. They had two grown daughters.
At Dartmouth, students and faculty were left struggling to understand.
"It's a random event in which people seemingly unconnected to the community can do so much damage," said Edward Berger, faculty dean for arts and sciences at Dartmouth, according to The Associated Press.
"What can you say to these things?" Mr. Berger said. "It just points out the reality of our very existence."

HEADLINE: In Harlem's Ravaged Heart, Revival 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Burgers grilling, fruit punch staining baby faces, summer scenting the air. In a courtyard on 129th Street, the tenants are having a barbecue.
 The architecture is Mediterranean in feel, a plaza flanked by two buildings freshly painted peach and yellow. To the front, a gate to protect the pristine setting. To the rear, a Technicolor splash of green: a garden with gazebo. 
 Urania Muniz, a film editor, teaches her 4-year-old to say "Excuse me" before interrupting. Tuesday Brooks, a young woman starting a cable television talk show, sits near Terrence Booth, 25, a retail pricing analyst. 
A blues trio rocks, and Janice Anderson, a religious retiree opposed to such entertainment, rolls her eyes. The president of the tenants' association reprimands a child roller-skating in the courtyard. The rules forbid it.
The details of the scene are ordinary, the change they signal extraordinary. Not long ago, there were no rules on this block, West 129th Street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues in Harlem. The courtyard was a vacant lot where drug dealers ran from the police. The adjacent buildings had long been empty, their only fresh paint new graffiti. Ms. Anderson and some of the older folks at the barbecue lived on the block. The rest -- black, white and Hispanic young professionals secure in the information economy -- wouldn't have dreamed of it. 
In 1994, The New York Times described 129th Street as "another America," such was its isolation and deprivation. The block, then almost uniformly black, had been bent by poverty, welfare and unemployment, by alienation between men and women, by drug dealing, addiction and violence.
The block's reputation was so fearsome that police dispatchers issued warnings before sending officers. Cabs collected residents only off the block. The walls of tenements blotted out the sky, and the future. Empty lots became the defining image of childhood for a rap producer raised here, who named his record label Vacant Lot.
Change, it seemed, would never come.
But it did. More than six years later, 129th Street is, increasingly, just an American block. It has moved, in Ms. Anderson's turn on a biblical phrase, "from the darkness and into the marvelous light." 
The years have brought unprecedented economic growth; a startling decrease in crime; the ebb of crack; the remaking of welfare; an influx of immigrants; a city drive to redevelop the housing stock under its control; and the rise of neighborhood organizations focused on restoration. 
Months on 129th Street, from that summer barbecue to the first day of school to a Christmas celebration, showed the dimension of its changes. Visits at dawn and midnight, conversations in homes and on corners, illuminated their texture and their limitations. Even from July to January, the evolution on 129th Street was remarkable: buildings renovated or sold, jobs lost and found, lives undone or refashioned. It seemed a constantly molting place, reflecting both the churning that is always a staple of poverty, and the ever faster rate of change here.
Change, too, has rippled across Harlem, once the nation's black cultural capital, but more recently a landscape of despair. From 1970 to 1990, central Harlem's population dropped by more than a third. In 1990, its median income was $19,169, compared with $41,415 citywide. Harlem had been severed, in essence, from the island of Manhattan. Now, slowly, it is rejoining it.
The changes have played out differently on different blocks. On some, revitalization has been slowed because a federal program to underwrite home loans fell prey to unscrupulous profiteers. On others, the city has yet to restore derelict housing. And 129th Street itself is a work in progress, with much unchanged for its roughly 1,400 residents. 
But the block, which once embodied everything wrong with America's inner cities, today reflects much that can go right. So far, 17 of the block's 35 buildings, from town houses to tenements, have been rehabilitated. The block now has an art gallery, a Mormon church, a racially mixed preschool. A community development office matches residents with jobs. A lush little garden, tended by residents, thrives.
Deliverymen actually deliver food, and cabs deliver passengers. Trees -- notable for their long absence -- are growing. This fall, the street was repaved, smooth as ice, for the first time in years. Housing was even built on one of the last vacant lots, which had been used for the rap company's poster.
The reduction in crime has erased old fears and thus old borders. New life suffuses the block. Artists, actors and taxi drivers. A mortgage consultant and import-export entrepreneurs. Young black professionals looking for cheap rent. Middle-class, middle-aged black homeowners. Police officers. Africans in glorious robes. Hispanics. Whites.
Many of those profiled in The Times's 1994 series have since experienced transformations large and small. A teenage mother now works for a city official. A young man paralyzed in a drive-by shooting in 1993 left the block in search of better housing while his brother became a rap artist. A studious young man finished college and is in the Navy. His sister, now off the block, and his mother, still on it, found their lives altered, like many here, by the imperatives of new welfare laws. Those laws, which require work in exchange for benefits before they are cut off entirely, pushed many residents into the work force. Their landing has been cushioned by an economy as supportive as a trampoline. 
That is not to say that the poor have bounced into the middle class. In 1999, the median household income in Central Harlem was $20,625, barely up from 1990. But the routines of work, combined with better housing and lower crime, have made the block feel more like a middle-class place. 
If 129th Street is -- in its architecture, geography and population -- idiosyncratic, it is also emblematic. Its rebirth has been duplicated in urban neighborhoods from Brooklyn to Houston to Oakland. It has all taken place during the longest and deepest economic expansion in American history. But since previous booms left no impression on this block or others like it, the story of 129th Street's, and Harlem's, transformation is clearly more complex, and often politically contradictory. 
Conservatives can point to tough-minded welfare policies and aggressive police work. Liberals can point to the lowering of immigration bars, which brought an influx of strivers, and to the $300 million the city has invested in housing in Harlem since 1994. Government policies like the Community Reinvestment Act pushed banks back into inner cities. A federal empowerment zone helped lure some new businesses, but more came because they needed new retail markets. And then there are powerful, unpredictable human factors, like a younger generation turning against crack, or exhibiting, perhaps, a greater tolerance for integration.
Consider the mix of factors that brought new, better-off residents to 129th Street. As the boom fueled the real estate market, and the city failed to build much new affordable housing, prices in better neighborhoods zoomed out of reach. At the same time, housing officials, community leaders and landlords, determined to break Harlem's resolute concentration of poverty, to transform a ghetto into a neighborhood, were recruiting a new type of resident. 
The fruits of that effort are perfectly displayed at the block's prize building, 38-44, with its courtyard. Its upwardly mobile tenants have been picked as carefully as actors for a film. And in a place where doors are left open and stoops are extensions of living rooms, their complex is separated from the street by filigreed iron bars. It is a gated community.
An oasis in the ghetto, one resident says, for much of the ghetto remains intact. Amid the transformed buildings and transplanted residents, the way up, or out, for many of the block's residents still seems poorly mapped. Limestone facades can be scrubbed. Limited education, racism, defeatist thinking, addiction and a shifting economy are harder to overcome.
Poverty has shadowed residents from welfare to work, while other people's prosperity may price them out of Harlem. And for some, a rising tide has revealed only how low they are marooned.
The drug economy still thrives here, as does the war on it. At twilight, Harlem's fabled street life bursts forth. A gun skirmish over the summer between two Bloods was a reminder how easily violence can reignite. As the block hovers between ghetto and neighborhood, cultural, racial and class tensions eddy quietly. And some worry that on a block where vast extended families created a village, the gain in normalcy may mean a loss of community.
The block is on the cusp, as is Harlem. A recession or a spike in crime could reverse its progress. And moving forward, for some, has its perils, too. Decades of decline could not erase Harlem's historic black identity. Success may be more powerful.

Doors of Gentrification
Wendi Higginbotham has lived in an elegantly refurbished brownstone on this block for two and a half years. Ethlyn, or Effie, Fredricks has lived in a tenement here off and on since she was two days old. 
A mother of three, Ms. Higginbotham is a lawyer for the city's housing department. Ms. Fredricks, a mother of six, is a former welfare recipient now making moccachinos at a Midtown coffee bar. 
Ms. Higginbotham, a distant cousin of A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., the judge, and J. C. Higginbotham, the jazz trombonist, is short-haired and no-nonsense. Ms. Fredricks, with red bangs and a breathless way of speaking, appears at first glance as if she is doing constant battle with life, and at second glance as if she is winning.
They are unlikely cohabitants of the block, but not accidental ones. 
Both live in buildings that were owned and neglected by the city for years. If 129th Street's eclectic architecture -- from an 1860's house built when Harlem was a suburban village to the brownstones and tenements built during its boom -- tells of its rise, the few buildings still sealed up hint at how it sank. The drugs and riots came, the middle class left, and in the 1970's the city began taking, and sitting on, vast quantities of property from tax-delinquent landlords. As of 1994, the city owned 1,381 buildings in Harlem, 615 of which were vacant. 
That truth withstood the housing efforts of Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, and outlasted the Bronx's resurgence. In 1994, 129th Street and surrounding blocks were a forgotten pocket, with buildings sealed like scars or usurped by drug users.
But starting in 1994, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani established an array of programs to transfer city-owned properties to private owners. The goals were to relieve the city of the burden and expense of property management, and to restore whole neighborhoods rather than individual buildings.
Officials from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development mapped out particularly distressed clusters. In dozens of buildings on 129th Street and four surrounding blocks, the city either renovated brownstones to be sold outright or turned tenements over to developers to restore and eventually own.
Entered from Lenox Avenue, 129th Street is still fronted by failure: on one corner, a once-grand privately owned apartment building brought to its knees by neglect, and on the other, where the dance hall Connie's Ballroom once stood, a half-finished building owned by the Pentecostal Faith Church that has blighted this block for years. But walk east, and fresh facades abound. 
Even the brownstone doors, with burnished wood and brass panels, shine. "I got to go all the way up to Westchester County to see doors like that," one carpenter observes. "The doors say everything."
They say how private passion shaped public policy. When the brownstones' doors first arrived, Ibo Balton, the housing department's planning director for Manhattan and a black resident of Central Harlem, rejected them as too institutional looking. People, he said, need a sense of arriving home. For him, rescuing Harlem was personal. "This is the spiritual capital of the African diaspora," he says. "Something had to be done."
That something included creating a more economically diverse populace anchored by new homeowners -- particularly black ones -- in an area where the ownership rate stood at just 6.7 percent in 1993. Aware that so many other urban revivals have failed, public officials hoped that an increase in homeowners, along with thorough rehabilitations, private investment and oversight by strong neighborhood organizations, would preserve Harlem's gains.
To that end, Ms. Higginbotham was able to buy a redone brownstone. And Ms. Fredricks hopes to buy her apartment for $250, as part of a low-income co-op, after renovations. 
"I'm trying to leave something for my children," she says. "I want to give them a sense of accomplishment." 
Sixty percent of the units the city has built or rehabilitated in Harlem since 1994 have been for low-income families -- defined by the city as earning $44,960 or less. The rest are for those who earn more. 
Preferences for brownstones like Ms. Higginbotham's went to Harlem residents, but they sold for $200,000 to $300,000 to buyers earning up to $89,920. The next round is being sold at market rates, $400,000 and up, to buyers with no maximum income.
Along with the market, then, the city is gentrifying Harlem, and on this block, it has had an active partner. The Abyssinian Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization based in Harlem, owns dozens of buildings, including four on this block, and has worked with the city to develop more. 
Similar organizations helped revive the South Bronx, and they have played an increasingly active role in other inner cities. They are nonideological, working closely with government but also believing that the market must be lured back.
Abyssinian Development was founded in 1989 by the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a venerable black institution, to revitalize Harlem partly by bolstering its middle class. It wanted to reseed Harlem with a proudly bourgeois element, to make it more than a warehouse for the poor.
"Our intent was always to have a diversity of income levels," says Karen A. Phillips, Abyssinian's chief executive.
On this block, the people are being selected as carefully as the doors.

The Developer as Social Scientist
The man doing much of the selecting at the vividly styled 38-44 and at six other buildings on this block is Gregory Pascal, who was picked by the city under a program that gives minority entrepreneurs its buildings to renovate, manage and own.
He is 57 years old, virtually bald, lanky and black. Born in poverty to West Indian parents who lived in Venezuela, he came to the United States in 1968. He picked oranges in Florida and apples in Michigan, drove a cab, became a citizen and began managing housing in the Bronx.
Now he has 24 buildings in five blocks of Harlem. He lives in the Bronx. The city requires him to allow those who lived in his buildings to return after renovations, and to reserve 75 percent of the apartments for low-income tenants for 15 years. But otherwise, he is the neighborhood chessmaster.
He has relocated hundreds of tenants during renovations, sometimes placing them in remarkably unpleasant conditions. He has told mothers that children selling drugs had to go. He has shrunk apartments, forcing families with many children to squeeze -- or move, and stripping others of income they had gained from renting extra rooms. He has ordered lifelong residents to give away appliances and beloved pets.
Mr. Pascal wanted a Spanish touch for 38-44, hence its courtyard and colors. He wanted to relax its tenants, and so installed a system that plays soft jazz in the halls.
When one tenant complained about his selection, Mr. Pascal asked, "What do you want me to play, rap?"
Later, he says, wincing, "I will pull out the whole system before I will play rap." 
Soft of voice, strong of conviction, Mr. Pascal believes that this block needs new models and values, more working people and less homogeneity. Empowered, he has set out to make it happen.
His motives combine self-interest and social engineering. He sees the concentration of poor blacks as bad for his buildings and for the poor. If you do not diversify economically and racially, he says, "you're just making a more expensive ghetto."
He believes in competition, in keeping up with the Joneses.
And the Joneses are here. People like Patricia Johnson, 35, a market research analyst married to an investment banker, and a member of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. To her and other new arrivals, 129th Street is an affordable way station that will allow her to save. "The next time I move," she says, "I will be buying a house."
People like Urania Muniz, 30, and her husband, Huascar Pimentel, 32, a stagehand, who came from Queens for the low rents, but also the proximity to Manhattan's parks and museums. Nearly 100 years after the Lenox Avenue subway joined Harlem with Midtown, its convenience is being rediscovered. 
And people like Tuesday Brooks, a Teachers College graduate and Army Reserve veteran, drawn by low rent, or Terrence Booth, a child of military parents, raised in Germany, who came to New York for its career opportunities. 

Off the Stoop, on the Payroll
As Effie Fredricks saw it, her mother and father worked and paid taxes their whole lives. When she went on welfare as a young mother, she felt she was simply taking back what they had put into the system so that she could stay home with her six children. She had raised only some of them to adulthood when the government told her to get to work.
When The Times visited here in 1994, Ms. Fredricks's household was not unusual. Some people on the block worked, but enough did not that by day, 129th Street had a crowded lassitude. Welfare let the many single mothers here give their children in time what they could not in material things. It also unmoored them from the mainstream economy.
Then came a vast political and philosophical shift in public policy: the end of entitlement. In 1995, New York City began requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to work for their benefits. The next year, the federal government passed legislation that put a five-year lifetime limit on benefits.
The greatest consequences of those changes are yet to come. But already, the number of welfare recipients in 129th Street's ZIP code dropped to 5,925 in 2000 from 10,317 in 1994. 
Many residents, angry at having to work for, in effect, less than minimum wage, left the rolls and got jobs or disability payments, or leaned on boyfriends. Some were cut off only for missing an appointment with a caseworker. 
Ms. Fredricks adapted. She found the job in the coffee bar. At first, her calves ached each night after standing on her feet all day. She took hot baths and persevered. She had no choice. 
Some, certainly, felt transformed. Deborah Wynns Williams arrived on the block three years ago just off drugs and still on welfare. She spent her days on the stoop, angry at the world. Then welfare began giving her problems. So a year ago, she found a job as a security guard, working 40 hours a week for $5.25 an hour, with health care. Beaming, she calls the job, if not the pay, "the light of my life." 
Most of the block's former welfare recipients have become security guards or home health aides. The wages are minimum or just above; the challenge, to better that -- through, for example, a union job. Women here, once able to offer expert counsel at wresting welfare benefits, now help one another navigate the labor marketplace. Two women from the block were hired at Ms. Williams's security company on her recommendation, she says with pride. 
The individual effects of welfare reform may take years to shake out. Children are learning the value of work and reaping the benefits of higher incomes, but also spending more time alone, and with greater economic insecurity. But the broader effect on 129th Street, where almost no building has been untouched by the new laws, is already clear. 
Each morning last summer, a collage of uniforms, a current of purpose, left the block, passing Ralph Acosta, 70, a former chef who has watched life here from a corner post for a decade. Where once there had been a trickle of workers, there was now a steady stream. Mr. Acosta said so many good mornings it wore him out. At noon, when he turned his grizzled head to survey a street depopulated by work, he would say, "I ain't never seen the block this quiet." 
The morning exodus included Terrance Washington, a towering 22-year-old in Army greens who works at the 125th Street Armed Forces Recruiting Station. Mr. Washington left the block for the Army, but drawn by word of change, he returned. His morning march in full uniform suggests the block's increasing accommodation of all sorts of aspirations.
In the past, peer pressures on 129th Street militated against achievement -- what people call "the crab syndrome" in that anyone climbing out of the barrel was pulled back. To succeed, or to try to, was to be "white," a description still heard as an insult here.
Those pressures are diminishing. The government basically ordered residents to go out and try. The city's prosperity, which has cut unemployment to 5.5 percent, made trying seem just a little more possible.
Some have made their start just blocks away, where chain stores and other businesses are reshaping Harlem's commercial face. Last year, Michael Eberstadt opened Slice of Harlem, a pizza parlor, and Bayou, a more formal restaurant, at Lenox Avenue and 125th Street, creating 50 jobs, most of them filled by Harlem residents. 
Dawn McKnight, 33, a former welfare recipient living on 129th Street, is now a Slice of Harlem cashier. She earns $6 an hour and still needs government help to pay rent. Still, she is working.
But in a reminder how interdependent and fragile the pieces of this community's resurrection are, Mr. Eberstadt says that the survival of those low-end but badly needed jobs depends on an increase in high-end customers, specifically homeowners.

Crackdown Works, Like It or Not
The busiest business on 129th Street in 1994 was drugs, specifically crack. Lines stretched down the street, looking, residents say, like people waiting for free cheese.
With the drug trade came violent crime. The old people on 129th Street, afraid of flying bullets, mostly just stayed inside. Young people, losing friends to casual vendettas, became schooled in funeral protocols and steeped in grief.
Old and young had long ago stopped expecting the police to do much about it, and the police had seemed to stop wanting to. When they came to the block, bottles hurled from rooftops greeted them. The 32nd Precinct called it the "problem block."
Back then, Sgt. Theodore Wright had been at the 32nd barely a year. A black man, he kept a file of newspaper clippings on innocent people who had been shot in the city. He saw ending the slaughter, on 129th Street and elsewhere, as a mission. 
He recently retired after 20 years on the force, having seen homicides in the 32nd Precinct drop to 17 in 2000 from 52 in 1994. Every major crime is down, in fact, from robberies to assaults.
The old people sit outside at night now, worrying only about where their grandchildren are. The latest generation of teenagers does not spend weekends at funeral parlors.
Sergeant Wright credits many factors. Killings eliminated some of the most violent offenders, and a younger generation turned its back on crack. And then there was the change in police tactics and ambitions. Beginning in 1994, the police force began precinct-based, focused assaults on both violent crime and quality-of-life crime, be it public urination or open-air drug markets. On 129th Street, that meant major drug dealers were arrested, and minor infractions -- smoking marijuana in public -- could land you in jail as officers checked for outstanding warrants. The police demanded identification from young men in front of buildings, including their own.
Hanging out and public drinking declined. So did the carrying of guns, in light of regular police pat-downs. Young men on the block, reluctant to credit the police, today describe carrying weapons as "outdated."
The drug trade has far from vanished, but the long lines are gone. Much of the traffic has gone indoors, with the police trying to follow it. Under the Manhattan district attorney's "No Trespassing" program, officers can arrest anyone unable to prove they live in or are visiting someone in a building.
Using nuisance abatement statutes, they are closing small stores that peddle drugs along with cigarettes or beer.
Prosperity has also given the police new allies -- landlords, who once had little economic incentive to keep drug dealing out of their buildings. Mr. Pascal, for example, bought out a store over the summer that he thought was peddling drugs and guns. "With the economic upturn there is no reason to play games," says retired Deputy Inspector Kevin Barry, who until recently oversaw the Manhattan North Narcotics zone. "There are plenty of good tenants out there."
And the new tenants, particularly homeowners mindful of their investment, are plenty willing to call the police. 
Throughout the city, the newly aggressive enforcement led to heated debate, most notably after the killing of Amadou Diallo; 129th Street had that debate, too, and it continues. Many young people saw the more intense police work as harassment at best, racism at worst.
But to Sergeant Wright, the human dividends -- the lives saved, the fear banished -- justified the methods. "Was it constitutionally right?" he asks of some enforcement. "I would say no. Did it serve a community purpose? I would say absolutely."

Same Songs, but New Lives
Young men like Big Stan and Dame Grease would have been nettles on Sergeant Wright's skin when he came to the 32nd Precint. They were drug hustlers, huddling in the cold, running from the police, passing time by passing joints.
They had had what they describe as typical childhoods on 129th Street, which is to say no real childhood. "When we came up, all we seen was violence and drugs," Stan says. "That's all we knew." Their families were cobbled together -- aunts, godmothers, the streets and each other. School seemed irrelevant, work ludicrous. Why give up $1,000 a week at 13 or 14? Stan thought he would hustle until he was gone.
Back then, he was Dennis, and Dame was Damon. Dennis's younger brother Mel, profiled in the 1994 articles, had been paralyzed in 1993 in a drive-by shooting. Murders were taking their friends. They became fathers. It was enough to make them think. 
"There had to be something we knew how to do," Stan says. "We weren't here to do nothing."
They had learned music on the side as the rap industry exploded. Stan found he could write. Dame produced much of the million-selling first album of a young man, Earl Simmons, now known as DMX, who is from Yonkers but hung out on 129th Street. Suddenly, the block had an export.
Today, Big Stan is a rapper, writing lyrics like these: "Accept the fact that now I'm a grown man standing on my own two/Used to hate guns but now I own two/Twin glocks for cops/Use? I promise to/I ain't going out like Amadou."
Dame Grease, 26, founded a record label of his own, Vacant Lot, on 129th Street. Its first album, "Live on Lenox," was released last fall in the new Harlem USA shopping complex, itself a vacant lot in 1994. 
"We never thought we'd be rapping this way," goes the refrain of one song on the album. It is easy to understand why. The block did not casually produce recognized artists and legitimate entrepreneurs. "Out of 100," Dame Grease says, "3 people knew how to stop and build a business."
Stan says his skin crawls when he sees younger versions of himself. He wants the next generation to have something to strive for. "Even if I don't make it I know I found my purpose," he says. "I found something that meant something."
The years since 1994 have turned his whole outlook around, he says. "I used to be real dark." His success, and Dame's, has lifted the block's outlook too. On 129th Street, 2000 was the year of Vacant Lot -- the graffiti everywhere, the T-shirts on backs, the posters on bikes, like a country's colors worn by patriotic citizens. 
A group of younger men from the block have also formed a record label, Famo. Stan watches, ambivalent only because he knows that as few will "blow up" in rap as make it in pro basketball. It is too soon, as well, to tell whether the block's young men will follow the model offered by Dame Grease's business, or the message -- a gangsta rap glorification of outlaw life -- in his music. 
And for Stan and Dame, the crazed life on the old block shaped their lyrics. Harlem, raw and dangerous, was their muse. What happens when the muse is tamed? 

Integrating All Over Again
Starting a century ago, boom and depression, land speculation and migration transformed Harlem into the epicenter of black consciousness. Within those larger forces, individuals also brokered change. As overbuilding created an excess of vacancies in the then-white area, Philip A. Payton Jr., a black real estate agent, sensed opportunity and persuaded a landlord to rent to blacks. 
This block turned from white to black in what seemed a historical instant. Now, in degrees, it is turning again, transformed again by individual initiative.
In 1987, Lars Westvind, a Swedish-born artist, bought a shell of a building on 130th Street, historic Astor Row, and made it a home, raising three children there. In 1994, he bought his first 129th Street building for $43,000 because it abutted his backyard. He bought a second, then a third, restoring them with his own sweat. Other than a few studios, they function as rooming houses.
He is riding the Manhattan real estate market, in which professionals see a Harlem studio for $800 as a bargain. While some new tenants who can pay Mr. Westvind's rents are black, more are not. Many who find their way to him are Europeans like Mr. Westvind and his wife, who is Turkish.
And so, almost single-handedly, he integrated 129th Street. White people have long passed through to buy drugs, and some still do. These days, though, they are more likely to be walking home after work.
"I'm not looking at color," Mr. Westvind says. "Just at who can pay the rent." 

Africans, Not African-Americans
Africans can pay the rent. That is a credo that Ismail Shamsid-Deen increasingly makes a living from.
In the 1970's, Mr. Shamsid-Deen, who is black, founded a nonprofit agency, Development Outreach Inc., to provide housing for Harlem's people. His target block was 129th Street. He wanted to serve his community.
But after two decades of providing housing to what he sees as ungrateful, destructive tenants with capped rents, Mr. Shamsid-Deen is despairing. His three buildings on 129th Street are crumbling. His finances are troubled. His bitterness chokes him.
So now, he is filling empty apartments with immigrant Africans. In the 1990's, the government significantly expanded the number of visas available to Africans, and others have come fleeing unrest or seeking education. The number of Africans in New York now exceeds 100,000, with many concentrated around 116th Street in Harlem. More than 100 have settled on 129th Street, enlivening it with their colorful robes.
Waves of immigration, and the new energy, values and customs that immigrants bring to flagging neighborhoods, fit a pattern as old as American cities. The Africans on 129th Street came to America to fill needs, find opportunity or both. Amadou Ahmed Bah, 73, and his wife, Mariama, 42, fled Liberia, where he was a physician's assistant, because of civil war.
Mamadou Kone, a 45-year-old taxi driver, came to America from Mali after his father died. In the shoebox bedroom his two daughters share, the elder, Aminata, 17, goes online beneath a busty Lil' Kim poster on one wall and the wizened grandmother, now over 100, she left behind in Mali on another. 
Out on the street, Ibrahima Diop, 53, stands robed and sandaled, cell phone in hand, making reservations for his tricontinental life. An import-export entrepreneur, he shuttles among this block, where he shares an apartment with three others, Paris, where his family lives, and Senegal.
The Africans come to 129th Street to be near Harlem's mosques and part of its informal economy. They come because the drop in crime has provided a safe feeling. "Before, Africans were scared to come because of the violence," Mr. Kone says.
And some have come to this block because word of mouth tells of a welcoming landlord. The owner of the three buildings housing many of the block's Africans is a "Muslim agency," says Mr. Diop, who is, like most of the Africans, Muslim. "They only give apartments to Africans because they don't do drugs, they pay their rents."
The founders of Development Outreach Inc. are Muslims, but Mr. Shamsid-Deen insists that the apartments are open to anyone -- anyone not on welfare. It just happens, he says, that the Africans are the only ones coming, which suits him fine. They work, he says. They run their own businesses. And, although many live doubled up or worse, they will pay $700 or $800 in rent.

A Civic Life, or Death
In October, the signs go up: "Your Block. Your Choice." For the first time in about four years, the 129th Street Block Association is to meet.
Tired of struggling against neglect from without and rot from within, those striving for better conditions retreated. The street's once-thriving block association was divided by drugs -- some were unhappy that dealers financed block parties memorializing fallen comrades -- and weakened by apathy. When the renovations temporarily dispersed residents, the association died.
But today, new and old residents are demanding services they believe affluent neighborhoods receive. When discussing erratic police response, poor sanitation collection or the lack of speed bumps, the refrain is always the same, as is the demarcation: "Below 96th Street, you wouldn't see this." 
The ever louder complaints about ever smaller problems are a sure sign of the block's health. Transforming that energy into action is Abyssinian Development's Community Vision office on 129th Street, financed by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. Its staff, Pat Simon and Gil Gonzalez, does everything from prepare resumes to mediate tenant-landlord disputes.
Mostly, however, they have been coaxing building and block associations into being. They recognize that if housing, jobs and crime reduction are the muscle and bone of this block's restoration, the rebuilding of civic life is the sinew -- the lasting tissue that will bind it enduringly.
The drive to revive 129th Street's association came from two new residents -- Sonja Manly, a paralegal, and Janice Wilson, a professional dancer. They put up the signs. More than a dozen residents came.
With many new to the block, they turned to Janice Anderson, a 30-year resident, for some history. She recounted 129th Street's fall and rise and concluded, "People are getting a mind now to want to do things."
But, she said, many longtime residents also were struggling to adjust. As if to underscore her sentiment, a dispute followed over whether young drug hustlers on the block should be dealt with through job counseling or a police crackdown. 
West 129th Street has come from the darkness into the marvelous light. But some, unsettled by change, blink in the brightness. Others, bypassed, still live in the shadows.

HEADLINE: The Road to a Roadster 

BYLINE:  By James Bennet; James Bennet is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Inside the General Motors advanced design studios in Warren, Mich. -- past the security guards, past the sign reading "no cameras or image-capturing devices," through two sets of locked doors -- designers sketch cars on computers and race them in three-dimensional form, silent as phantoms, around the room. But the studios still have an earthy, elementary-school smell: wet clay, that primitive image-capturing device. It is a reminder that for all the lasers and digital power, something artistic and intuitive, even atavistic, happens there. 
 One brisk gray day last spring, five clay models of cars sat on worktables in one of the studios. Each model was done to one-third scale. Some had skins of silver plastic to simulate steel, while others, still being sculptured, looked like artfully nibbled blocks of milk chocolate. Only on second glance did I notice that each model was of only half a car, in profile: they were pressed against mirrors to give the illusion of a full vehicle. 
 The models were of roadsters. A few had sheer sides and clipped-off rear ends; others were so curvaceous, with bulging fenders sweeping down and rearward, that they might have appeared in a General Motors studio 50 years before, when the female form supplied the design metaphors. Only one would be chosen to go from clay to car, but all of them looked slicker than anything G.M. had put on the American road in years. 
If you had to pick a vehicle to represent this age -- the way the Chevrolet Bel Air evokes the 50's or Ford's Mustang the 60's -- you would surely, sadly, go with a sport utility like the Ford Explorer or the Chevy Suburban, dismal antifashion statements of profound faddishness. But all the big trucks have overshadowed a more hopeful trend: the automakers have been designing cool cars again. The car industry is, in its way -- that is, slowly and not smoothly -- participating in the design revolution sweeping through industrial products, making art, or at least something easy on the eyes, out of laptops, teapots and toilet-bowl brushes. Auto executives have come to believe that as quality, technology and costs even out among manufacturers, design will be left as the most important selling point.
Dave Lyon is in charge of Buick's advanced design studio, and as he showed off the clay models, he seemed exhilarated by his new freedom at General Motors. "They've had both hands tied behind my back," he explained. Lyon, who is only 32, is white and male, but besides that, he looked less like a G.M. manager than any I had met. He had on a black zippered jacket over a black sweater, a gray shirt and gray wool pants. He and a team of young designers have been assigned the mission of reviving one of the industry's oldest and least venerated brands, of bringing back the days, as he put it, when "Buick was hot."
After covering Detroit in the mid-90's, I went back several times over the last year to try to understand how imagination had come back in vogue, to see who the designers were and why their ideas were surviving the industry's soul-deadening bureaucracies. General Motors interested me because it must travel so far so fast. Miles from being the design leader these days, it is anxiously, sometimes clumsily, trying to catch up. Last year, to try to focus the blurred identities of its various brands, G.M. killed off its Oldsmobile line. It is also trying to design its way out of the mess. Nowhere is G.M. aching for a captivating new look more than at Buick, whose buyers, with a median age of 68, are the industry's grayest. "Many of our owners," one of Lyon's colleagues told me, "have bought their last car." 
The roadster that I watched Buick design, build and unveil over the last year is a "concept car," as distinct from a "production car." Concept cars point the direction of a brand's design, and in years past they ran to fantasies like rocket cars. More recently, concept cars have hewed closer to reality, for reasons of company politics: designers have used the resulting public clamor to get their concepts duplicated in the factories as production cars. Volkswagen's bubbly New Beetle, Chrysler's cartoonishly retro PT Cruiser and Ford's 2002 Thunderbird all began life as concept cars. 
Concept cars are marketing tools, but Buick's roadster-in-the-making had more marketing urgency behind it than most. Buick was paying Tiger Woods millions of dollars to advertise its cars, Lyon explained as we walked through the studio. But it was hard to pretend that a guy like Woods would drive a snoozer like the LeSabre, your grandfather's Buick. "You can't force that match," Lyon said with chagrin. 
This roadster would be the car that Tiger built. He did not dictate the design himself, though he reviewed early sketches of the car during a golf tournament last summer and then checked out a fiberglass mock-up in the fall. His interests, however, gave the designers direction. They studied his taste in sound systems and his golfing equipment to build a car that fit his style and, literally, his golf bags. In the Buick studio, the designers kept one of his regulation P.G.A. bags, a totem of Tiger, to ensure that it would fit.
Designers must still resort to end runs like concept cars because culturally they do not quite fit in. They may not be artists -- fine artists mock them as slaves to the mass market -- but they are not gearheads either, and engineers can smell that a mile away. Designers love cars with a passion that they cannot explain, and that gains them respect within the companies. But they do not care much about what is under the hood, and that makes them less than normal. Lyon, who grew up outside Chicago, was 12 when he switched from drawing dinosaurs to drawing cars and began dreaming of the career he now has.
Instead of gushing about gear ratios, designers tend to talk, as Lyon does, about "the aesthetic of the car -- how they sound when they race, the smell, the look." They intellectualize cars as cultural artifacts or as expressions of a nation's psyche. They think of them not just as transportation or even as racing machines but also as curved mirrors passing through their environment, gathering the light, reshaping it and giving it back. With all that abstract and aesthetic cogitation backing them up, they are astonished when the bean counters tell them that it would simply be too expensive to use 17-inch wheels on a particular vehicle or when the engineers tell them the factory could never reliably put that curve in a hood. But since all they care about is design, they rarely know enough to argue back. These are among the reasons that it is usually a bean counter or an engineer, and never a designer, who winds up running an auto company. Because they are nerds with style, the designers console themselves by making fun, behind their backs, of the way the engineers and finance guys dress. 
Wayne Cherry, the fifth design chief in G.M.'s history, wants to restore Buick's trademark portholes. He thinks of the portholes as jewels and as a way to express what he calls the "designy-ness of Buick." Not everyone is thrilled with the idea. With reason, engineers cannot understand why anyone would cut holes in a perfectly good fender for something that might not fit well and will perform no function. "Trying to defend portholes to an engineer is like trying to show TV to a dog," Lyon told me over dinner one night. "They just see a glowing box. 'Go away, styling boy!"'
Engineers and finance guys live in an objective world where cost and risk are plotted point by point. They crave data, which leaves designers like Lyon mumbling that they left their data in their other pants. Design is a subjective, risky business, and the industry is learning again to value that. As Lyon put it, "There is no data point for 'cooler."'
Once you enter the Buick advanced design studio, you pass into an alcove that is meant to remind the staff of the qualities that Cherry has assigned the brand to distinguish it from Cadillac, Pontiac, Saturn and the other squabbling G.M. siblings. Two leather club chairs sit on a floor of polished wood. In glass cases facing them is an array of signifiers for the gentry: an Olympus 35-millimeter camera wrapped in leather, a bottle of Knob Creek bourbon, a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles. Early one Saturday morning last May, Cherry gathered his top design executives with Lyon's team to review progress on the roadster. These reviews can take hours, so the men -- of the 20 or so G.M. designers I met, all were male -- perched on hip-high gray chairs mounted on wheels. To move around the room, they pushed off with their feet and slid backward over the speckled linoleum floor, wheels squeaking. Three clay models remained, but Cherry was focusing on just one. Viewed head on, the car had a dramatic tumble-home; the sides were shaped like parentheses, but at its apex each curve was abruptly chopped down and in, toward the car's cabin. The effect was to create a sharp edge at the top of the curve and to take a sense of weight out of what might otherwise seem a tubby car. The design, seen in profile, also incorporated a Buick hallmark called the "crosscheck" or "sweep spear": the crease that formed the top of the parentheses started in the rear and rose up along the door before dying beneath the side-view mirror; a second crease intersected the first one's downstroke and carried the curve out over the headlights, which were slashed across the front end. The design called for three portholes on each side of the hood, one for each cylinder of the V-6 engine. 
The design was the work of Sang Koh, a 28-year-old graduate of the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit, who started at G.M. last January. At his high school in suburban Maryland, Koh's guidance counselor urged him to pursue architecture. But buildings do not move, so they did not move Koh. He did some research on his own and discovered that he could make money by drawing cars. Now, silent, arms folded, Koh hovered expressionlessly by Cherry's shoulder as his design chief gently rejiggered his baby. 
Buick has another studio devoted to redesigning its existing cars, like the Regal. The role of the advanced studio is to confect novel products that might join the lineup. In all the studios, design is an amorphous process. Once the company determines what type of vehicle is needed -- a Regal redesign or a new roadster -- junior designers compete to sketch the new look. Countless sketches were presented for the roadster, of which five were chosen to become the clay models I saw in the studio. But while the car's design begins with the victorious clay model, it changes, often significantly, as senior designers weigh in. It changes further as engineers, accountants and even potential customers have their says. Cherry, the design chief, has the final word in the studios, but ultimately his superiors will decide if any design should be manufactured. Cherry had already ordered Koh to combine a front end that he designed for one of his clay models with a back end that he designed for another. 
Cherry is trying to fight G.M.'s reliance on market data, to restore the emphasis on a junior designer's execution of the senior designer's vision that unearthed the cars of the 30's through the 60's. Ideally, one of his top allies explained, design decisions should be based one-third on data and one-third on intuition. "The other third," he told me, "is guts." This approach puts tremendous weight on the aesthetic sensibility of one executive. As tall and rangy as the roadster was snub, Wayne Cherry is an imposing figure who is rumored by underlings never to have taken a vacation. He wears small rimless glasses and dresses in grays and blacks. Last spring, I saw him react in horror at the New York auto show to a light purple '57 Bel Air, tarted up to full "American Graffiti" fatuousness. The car, he said, should properly be painted black and celebrated for its power. This one had the wrong wheel covers and two antennas sticking out the back. "They've got the fuzzy dice, which drives me nuts," he said. "They even put a gold emblem on it." 
Cherry grew up in Indiana, a Chevy guy arguing with the kids who loved Fords. He spent 26 years in G.M.'s European subsidiaries, where he developed a clinical detachment from American culture and auto design, with its tradition of sculptural improvisation if not excess. In Europe, for its narrow roads and high fuel prices, the auto companies have for generations built smaller cars without our prized tail fins and chrome doodads. 
Cherry came back to the States in 1992, the leader in a return migration of American auto designers that occurred as the American companies rediscovered style. J. Mays, credited with the design of the New Beetle, was hired by Ford, and Freeman Thomas, who styled the lovely Audi TT roadster, is now at the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler. All three have shown they can cater to American tastes. The nonfunctional portholes on the Buick are kin to the equally gimmicky, if gorgeous, chrome vents on the hood of the '63 Corvette, which Cherry pointed out to me at the auto show. "That's part of the American thing," he said of the vents.
With its fealty to celebrity and golf, the Buick Roadster he was examining under Koh's watchful gaze was indubitably an American thing. Cherry was insisting that the roadster's interior convey as much a sense of the new Buick aesthetic as its exterior. This meant, for example, that the seats would resemble those club chairs in the alcove. But it also meant that the interior would have an advantage hidden by its exterior: the small back seat, designed for humans or custom-made golf bags. Cherry thinks that the practical addition of a back seat -- to the most impractical of car designs -- will close the sale with Buick's target audience of 30- and 40-something parents by giving them "permission" to buy. 
Cherry spent most of that morning silently appraising the exterior. He was concerned about the mock-up of the convertible top. "Why is it retro?" he asked. It needed sharper edges, he said, more structure. Cherry was also troubled by the aggressive way the lines along the sides of the car were stretched up over the rear fenders, flattening the fenders on top as the lines tucked inward to produce a narrower rear. The form was too stark, not as graceful as he wanted Buicks to be. But he did not say anything, knowing from long experience that the art of car styling would ultimately yield to the demands of function. Once his young designers thought about having to fold that roof away, he knew, they would realize that the back end had to be broader than Koh had designed it. Otherwise, the roof would never go down.
It is fitting that the man who created mass auto styling began his career customizing cars for Hollywood stars, who were themselves retailing glamour and style to the masses. Harley Earl, the first chief of what was then called Art and Color at G.M., dressed in flashy suits and kept a direct line to the chairman so that his authority would go unquestioned. He could not draw well himself -- at least no one ever saw him pick up a pencil -- so he spouted profanity and sexual metaphors to direct his staff. It was during the late 50's, as he was comparing deck lids to women's rears and pointy bumpers to their breasts, that Earl canceled a brief experiment with female designers for car exteriors.
In designing his own version of the roadster, Lyon had turned for inspiration to Earl's '38 Buick "Y-Job." Believed by G.M. to be the first concept car, it was a sinuous machine of black-painted steel and chrome that, perhaps because of the war, never made the leap to production. Lyon argues that those old G.M. designs connect to the American psyche: "We've got the biggest bank account in the world, and for years we were afraid to write checks on it." 
But while Koh also looked over the Y-Job, he did not have much sense of Buick's history and did not seem much interested. Instead, he set out to draw a Buick convertible that he would want to drive. Those initial drawings, done on a computer, show dreamy visions of the car lighted in lilac against a black background, with a silver grille like shark's teeth incongruously gripping the staid Buick badge. But Cherry's insistence on following the Buick hallmarks, and his subsequent fiddling, resulted in a car unmistakably descended from the Y-Job.
Senior designers rely on green designers in the hope that they will import an exciting idea from beyond the high company walls. Men Lyon's age now run most of Cherry's advanced design centers. "They haven't had 20 years of people saying no to them, like me," said Tom Peloquin, a 44-year-old member of Lyon's team.
Over a hamburger in Warren one afternoon, Peloquin explained another of Cherry's goals for the roadster: stance. "This is why an Audi looks good," he said, reaching for a pen and a sheet of notebook paper. Volkswagen and its Audi luxury brand are widely admired for their clean sedan designs. Each car is recognizable as a member of the same family because each has a curving roof line that appears taut, bent into place, as though energy is stored there. It is excellent "product" design -- uncluttered, simple, derivative inside and out of the machine's function -- which is why some American car designers dismiss it.
Peloquin sketched a head-on view of a car with a window disappearing into a door; he added a tire that stuck slightly outside both. "You subconsciously perceive that the car is firmly planted on top of the tires," he explained. The car's cabin was contained within its tires, conveying a sense of security and stability if sacrificing interior volume. Peloquin drew a familiar comic-book figure of a man with hands on hips and enormous calves and feet. "It's like Mr. Salty on your bag of pretzels," he said. "He's got good stance." As we left the restaurant, Peloquin gestured at a Honda Civic customized so that its tires poked out like thrown elbows: "See what kids do with their Hondas? Every teenager in America understands stance."
To give it a solid stance, the new Buick roadster was designed to have mammoth 20-inch wheels at its edges, wheels that to my eye look too big. In addition, the wheels are pushed forward and back, toward the corners of the car. Though it is a front-wheel-drive car -- a fact bound to dismay enthusiasts -- it carries a new six-speed automatic transmission that sits ahead of the engine instead of behind it. That enabled the designers to eliminate eight inches of front overhang, giving the car solid proportions.
Peloquin and I drove south past Detroit to a company called A.S.C., a contractor that was converting the roadster design into a working model. In a workshop there, sculptors were molding a full-scale clay model of the car. The work was a jarring mix of high and low technology. Once the clay model was finished, a laser would pick its surface, marking a new point every four millimeters -- millions in all -- to determine the precise measurements for manufacture. 
But the sculptors were using old-school methods to check the model. The car was lined up parallel to overhead fluorescent lights. Periodically, a sculptor would wet the clay surface with a sponge, then smooth a piece of black plastic against it. The plastic reflected the narrow fluorescent tubes, revealing whether, as Koh intended, the light bent in a bow along the side of the car as though it were being sucked down into the vortex of the front wheel. Any zigzag in the lines meant a dimple or bump in the surface, perhaps as small as one millimeter, which the sculptor filled in or shaved off with a thin length of bendable steel.
A terrifying number of things can go wrong in a car design, setting aside basics like whether the tires will hold up, basics with which the industry has trouble enough. Will the engine fit under the hood? Is there room for chains to go over the tires in snowy states? There sure is a lovely, squashed-oval shape to that side-view mirror -- it does nicely echo the grille and the tail pipes -- but, um, when you open the door with the window up, will the glass actually clear it? (In one version of the roadster, it did not.)
Peloquin had come to A.S.C. to confront a recurring headache. Working with an overall budget of only about $2 million to take the roadster from initial sketches to concept car, the designers were cutting costs by borrowing parts from other cars. The modified Corvette windshield they had chosen was turning out to be a tough fit, requiring repeated tinkering with the A-pillars, the forward pillars supporting the roof. Mike Hutchins, a G.M. engineer on the team, told Peloquin he had spotted another problem that the designers had overlooked. When the design moved from clay to steel, a small gap -- four or five millimeters -- would appear where the hood met the car's body. That gap could be visible either from the front, where it would alter the line on top of the grille, or from the side, in the form of a slight overbite. Peloquin knew how important the face of the car was to Cherry. "It should line up in front view," he replied. "I just don't want anything where lines jog. I mean, Wayne will go crazy." 
'You probably didn't expect to see that from Buick," Dave Lyon declared in November as he whipped the cover off a sky blue model of the roadster, now named (in a nod to Tiger) the Bengal. We were inside the Design Dome, a windowless cavern in G.M.'s Warren complex within which the company's chiefs for 45 years have exercised final say over whether to stamp out hundreds of thousands of copies of a designer's dream or to toss it aside. G.M. was giving journalists a first look at the concept cars it intended to roll out during 2001. What the reporters saw that wintry day was a fiberglass mock-up. The real car still lay in unpainted pieces on the cement floor of the A.S.C. workshop.
Of the seven cars and trucks displayed, the Bengal stood out. It was pretty. It had a pillowy shape in a room full of jagged edges; it had an easy elegance beside the Robocop severity of the Cadillac Vizon and a piscine grace next to the grunting, buglike hulk of the H2SUT from Hummer, another brand that G.M. recently added to its dysfunctional family. 
A paradox of this burst of imagination in car design is that it is happening as the industry consolidates. As a Hummer is now a G.M. product, a Chrysler, Dodge or Jeep is a Mercedes sibling. A Jaguar is a Ford, and the same goes for a Volvo or a Land Rover. Each of these brands has historically had unique qualities. But to realize economies of scale, automakers are using some of the same components, like brakes and engines, in cars of different brands. In the best case, the resulting efficiency can encourage a company to take a flier on a daring design, since the risk is reasonable even if the vehicle winds up selling in low volumes of, say, 30,000 a year. That kind of thinking resulted in the PT Cruiser, which is a Dodge Neon sporting its granddaddy's zoot suit (really someone else's granddaddy, since it resembles Fords of the 30's more than any Chrysler).
This approach could veer toward "badge engineering," which was General Motors' downfall. Alfred P. Sloan Jr., G.M.'s visionary leader from the mid-20's to the mid-50's, envisioned a company that would make cars for "every purse and purpose." Car buyers would start out in a Chevrolet, and then as their fortunes improved and their yen for status sharpened, they would graduate to Pontiac, then to Oldsmobile and Buick and finally to Cadillac, the luxury brand. Sloan also introduced the idea of the annual model change to keep drivers yearning after something new. To ensure that so many evolving brands would stay distinct, this system put a premium on investment in design and engineering. In the 70's and 80's, as Americans turned to Japanese cars, G.M. struggled to cut costs and compete. Along with its vehicle quality, its branding discipline collapsed. The only difference between Cadillac and Chevy models of one car, besides their badges, was that the Caddy had leather seats and a luggage rack. 
To differentiate the brands again, Cherry is assigning specific design qualities to each one. The mandates are as detailed as how many spokes must appear in the wheels (for Buick it is eight) and as vague as what ephemeral qualities the designers are trying to capture. Chevrolets are supposed to be low cost and "functional but spirited," while Buicks are trying to become "romantic" and "graceful" and Cadillacs are trying something called "art and science," the most avant-garde styling of the bunch. 
The G.M. concept cars could certainly not be accused of looking alike, which means badge engineering may not be inevitable. But as I looked around the Design Dome that day, I wondered whether G.M. might be creating a new problem for itself. Its cars might look too different from anything else on the road.
As we drove to A.S.C. that afternoon, Lyon said that he and his colleagues joked sometimes about designing Buicks rather than Porsches. But, he said, "you know, maybe we've moved the needle a little bit." Still, he fretted about whether the Bengal would ultimately go into production. "We're still a very data-driven company," he said. "We need a lot of reassurance." Once the decision to go forward is made, the actual car could be available within two years. But, he said, "that decision making is the toughest part of the business right now." And the slowdown in the economy, should it last, will make things tougher.
Last month, with a dopey skit by company executives, flashing lights and a techno beat, General Motors presented the Bengal at the annual Detroit auto show as "a performance roadster" with "easy access to two custom golf bags -- or seating for two additional passengers," presumably even if they are not shaped like golf bags. The car got the welcome that G.M. hoped for. The Bengal won AutoWeek's award for "best concept." Automobile Magazine put it on its cover and used it as a prime example for a story about how G.M. design got "its groove back." Autoextremist.com, a gimlet-eyed critic of G.M., called the Bengal a reminder of "the design talent that resides at General Motors" and said it would be "a worthwhile addition to G.M.'s production car portfolio, as soon as possible." G.M. continues to hint that it will ultimately build the car, but its top bosses have not made the final decision.
The Bengal is proof that G.M. can conceive something more imaginative than a retro version of what came before or the realization of a focus group's muddled demands. Whether G.M. will follow through by developing an affordable version of the design is the next test of the company's turnaround.

Citigroup Buys E.A.B. For $1.6 Billion in Cash
Citigroup of New York, the parent company of Citibank, announced last week that it would buy European American Bank, which has its headquarters in Uniondale, for $1.6 billion in cash.
 E.A.B.'s roots in Long Island's economy can be traced to the 1920's, and for decades it has been a retail presence on the Island, involved in both business and civic activities. 
 Citigroup, which is buying E.A.B. from ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, said that it anticipated closing a limited number of branches on Long Island. Citibank has 27 branches on the Island, and E.A.B. has 68. 
The acquisition gives Citigroup a presence on Long Island comparable to Fleet's and to North Fork's. Both banks had been considered likely bidders for E.A.B. before Citigroup's announcement.
Citigroup officials would not specify how many jobs would be cut because of consolidation. E.A.B.'s two top executives, Edward Travaglianti, its chairman and chief executive, and Brendan Dugan, its president, will have key positions in the merged company, Citigroup said.

Around the Island
Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE: ARW) has announced that its net income more than doubled in the fourth quarter last year. Arrow, the electronics components and computer products distributor in Melville, reported record net income of $109 million, or $1.09 per share, on sales of $3.7 billion, compared with net income of $44 million, or 46 cents a share, on sales of $2.6 billion in 1999. Francis M. Scricco, the company's president and chief executive, said efficient integration of Wyle Components and Wyle Systems, acquired last year, helped drive up operating margins. Arrow reported total 2000 sales of $13 billion. . . . The North Fork Bancorporation (NYSE: NFB) has agreed to acquire Commercial Bank of New York for $175 million in cash. Commercial Bank has 14 branches, mostly in Manhattan. . . . Cablevision (NYSE: Cvc) of Bethpage said last week that it expects less than 2 percent growth in cable subscribers in 2001 but anticipates revenues from high-speed Internet services and its Lightpath telephone service to grow as much as 12 percent. Cablevision plans to invest some $1 billion in cable, commercial telephone and new-media businesses this year.

Car Dealers' Lament: Take My Incentive, Please

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
GERALD SMITH was impressed with the latest version of the Oldsmobile Aurora, redesigned for 2001, when he first saw it last fall, but he was put off by its $30,000-plus price tag. Then General Motors announced in December that it planned to phase out the Olds brand, and Mr. Smith began strategizing.
 "I got to thinking, maybe with the demise of the division and the slowdown in car sales, maybe I can get a luxury car in a normal-car price," said Mr. Smith, 41, a sales representative from Menomonee Falls, Wis. 
 Mr. Smith was right on the money. Last week, he bought a dark blue Aurora with a six-cylinder, 3.5-liter engine, and luxury accouterments like leather-trimmed seats and aluminum wheels, for $26,095 -- more than $5,000 off its sticker price. That discount, which included a $2,000 G.M. rebate, helped clinch the deal, he said. "I don't think in this environment I would buy a car without a rebate," Mr. Smith said. 
Nor would he have to, unless he was buying one of the few car models in great demand. With the auto industry beset by a sales slowdown that began unexpectedly in October, analysts say automakers are offering some of their deepest discounts, both in incentives paid directly to consumers and in enticements to dealers to help sell their cars and trucks. 
The automakers had been enjoying record sales -- running at a pace of 18 million vehicles through much of 2000 -- when worries about the economy and rising interest rates started keeping buyers out of showrooms. The slowdown came just as automakers were increasing production to meet the previously strong demand.
"There is no better time to be negotiating -- hard-nosed negotiating -- with your dealer," said Joseph Phillippi, an industry analyst at UBS Warburg in New York.
Opportunities for deals appear boundless. In 2000, the cost of direct consumer incentives, including rebates, discount lease deals and low-interest loans, topped $2,000 a vehicle, on average, for the first time, according to CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. In 1999, the average was $1,800.
In January, the direct offers climbed again, to an average of $2,548, almost triple the level of 10 years ago, CNW said.
Total incentives, including money paid to the dealers that can often be passed on to customers, climbed above $3,700, on average, last year, from $3,188 in 1999. Last month, they surpassed $4,000 a vehicle, a threshold that some industry officials had thought would never be reached.
IT is incredibly competitive," said Joel Manby, who has worked for Saturn and for Saab's American operations and is now chief executive of Greenlight.com, which was acquired by CarsDirect.com, an Internet buying service. "It is one of the toughest times I have ever seen." 
Mr. Manby said he was startled recently to see a television commercial offering discount financing on the Honda Accord, the nation's best-selling car in January. Through Feb. 28, Honda is offering loan rates as low as 3.9 percent for 36 months on Accords equipped with four-cylinder engines.
Honda is known for focusing attention on its cars' features, not on discounts. "The fact that even Honda is doing something tells you a lot," Mr. Manby said.
That said, Honda is offering no incentives on other popular Hondas, like the small Civic and the Odyssey minivan. The only other Honda incentive is on its slow-selling Passport sport utility vehicle.
There are also no incentives on popular vehicles like the Chrysler PT Cruiser, for which Chrysler recently told dealers it has orders to fill the next two years of production. But such vehicles are the exception.
The generous offers have done little so far to clear out showrooms and lots. Industry sales fell 6.2 percent in January from a strong performance the previous year; it was the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The drop was less than the 9 percent decline that forecasters had expected. The figures probably would have been worse had the automakers not increased incentives and stepped up sales to fleet customers like businesses and rental car companies, said Ron Pinelli, an analyst at the Autodata Corporation, a statistics and marketing firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
Many automakers may have to continue their incentives if they want to make a dent in bulging inventories of unsold cars. The sales slump started so quickly, and at a time of year when factories were at their busiest, that automakers had little time to react. As a result, dealer inventories stood at 84 days, on average, at the end of January, well above the 60-day average that dealers prefer at this time of year.
The highest figure among major automakers was at G.M., with 102 days' worth of cars at dealer lots. The total stood at 98 days at Ford Motor and 82 at Chrysler. In the last six weeks, G.M. and Chrysler have cut back by as much as one-third the number of vehicles they planned to build this quarter, moves that have affected new vehicles like the Pontiac Aztek, introduced in June, and the latest family of Chrysler's minivans, which went on sale in September. 
But incentives are the automakers' primary tool for clearing showroom lots. The drive is particularly intense at Oldsmobile, where G.M., in advance of the division's looming discontinuation, has offered rebates of up to $3,000 a vehicle, plus a five-year, 60,000-mile warranty. As an alternative, buyers can choose a plan that calls for no down payment and no monthly payments until 2002. People who already own an Oldsmobile can receive an additional $1,500 off any of the specials if they buy a new Olds.
Word of the deals has drawn some consumers to showrooms, particularly in the Detroit area, traditionally Olds's strongest market. Bob Saks, a dealer in Farmington Hills, Mich., who typically sells 50 Oldsmobiles a month, sold 75 in January and is on track to sell 100 in February. His dealership had 30 Auroras in stock in December, but only three remained last week. 
Jim Muir, owner of a dealership in Sterling Heights, Mich., north of Detroit, said he made his first January profit in years last month, thanks to the bargain seekers. "This is the best going-out-of-business sale in history," he said, adding that he was sorry the recent sales flurry could not have come sooner. "I'm fine, considering the diagnosis is terminal," he said. 
In fact, the new popularity of Olds has prompted some dealers attending this month's National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Las Vegas to ask G.M. to reconsider dropping the Olds brand. But G.M. refused. While the company has not set a final date, industry analysts expect that Olds will most likely be gone by the end of 2002.
SOME of the best bargains in the industry can be found on S.U.V.'s, which were in hot demand and short supply just a few years ago. Now, with a wide variety of models available, rebates are plentiful, including $1,500 on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and $3,000 on the Chevrolet Blazer.
Even one of the newest entries, Ford's Escape, has a 7.9 percent discount loan deal, only months after the vehicle reached showrooms. Analysts say automakers, which once expected to get through the first year of a vehicle's life without offering incentives, are now devising deals faster than ever.
Such overtures, monetary and otherwise, do not surprise industry veterans like Ernie Rizzolo, the sales manager at Douglas Motors in Summit, N.J. "The American car market is now driven by incentives," Mr. Rizzolo said. "Even if your car is new, the customer is going to watch to see what happens."
And there is a lot to watch. Consumers have easy access to information about incentives -- not only from television and newspapers but also from the Internet. Automakers routinely publish their latest rebate plans on Web sites, while consumer sites like Edmunds.com and message boards on Yahoo.com abound with leads to the best deals. 
Art Spinella, the president of CNW Marketing, advises shoppers to negotiate with dealers for even bigger discounts or free optional equipment. "Unless you say, 'That's too much, I can't afford to pay that for a car,' you won't know if you can get a better price," he said.
Dennis Lawrence, 42, a sales representative for a boat manufacturer in Laguna Hills, Calif., recently bought a Volvo S60 sedan, a model that has been on the market for only a few months. He refused to pay the car's $32,000 sticker price and kept negotiating with local dealers via e-mail until he found one that would sell him the car for $29,000. 
Mr. Lawrence said his biggest weapon was his willingness to walk away. "There was no real anxiousness on our part," he said. 
The abundance of vehicles on showroom lots helped, too. "About every five miles out here in California, there's another car dealer," he said. "You have no trouble finding what you want."

Dismissing a Dozen, Hiring One

BYLINE:  By Jonathan D. Glater 

 BODY:
The New York law firm of Dewey Ballantine was in the news twice for its arithmetic last week -- once for subtracting some associates, and again for adding a bankruptcy lawyer from a rival New York firm, Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft.
 Dewey Ballantine announced on Friday that Michael J. Sage, formerly a partner at Cadwalader, would join Dewey Ballantine's bankruptcy group. 
That announcement came a few days after Sean M. Moran, a partner at Dewey Ballantine, confirmed rumors that it was laying off 12 midlevel and senior lawyers because the attrition rate at the firm had fallen too low as fewer lawyers left in search of dot-com or investment banking riches. 
 From a purely business point of view, the law firm's two moves make sense -- bankruptcy is a healthy line in economically weak times, and associates have become very expensive.
"The firm continues to want to grow, and our growth is intended to be over 5 percent," Mr. Moran said. "Folks just aren't leaving."
But there is no connection, Mr. Moran added, between the firing and the hiring.

Appliances And Music: Best Buy's Prospects

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
VALUE investors who bet on the Best Buy Company late last year were richly rewarded: after dropping to $22.31 on Dec. 8, the stock doubled in less than six weeks.
 But now investors in the company, a fast-growing consumer electronics and major appliance retail chain, are wondering what is next. Analysts and money managers are divided over whether the company's shares can return soon to reflecting the 20-percent-plus profit growth rates that Wall Street had come to expect from Best Buy, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., and is known for its huge stores, 413 in all. 
 "One day, this stock is going to be trading in the $60's and $70's," said Gary Balter, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston, who has a strong buy recommendation and a 12-month target of $60 on the stock. "The question is: When do you buy it?" 
Not long ago Best Buy was trading at that target -- and higher. Known for its efficiency -- sales per square foot of $893 outshine those of its closest competitor, Circuit City Stores, where the comparable figure is $571, Mr. Balter estimated -- Best Buy's stock hit a 52-week high of $88.87 last April. But it ended the year down 41.2 percent, plunging 39 percent on Nov. 9 alone, when Best Buy executives surprised Wall Street by announcing that its third- and fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would be well below expectations.
Worries over weak holiday sales and a Circuit City warning on profit margins and sales contributed to the swoon. So did Best Buy's decision to spend $685 million, including $260 million it borrowed, to buy the bankrupt, 1,370-store Musicland chain. 
At its low, the stock was trading at just 12.5 times 2001 fiscal-year earnings estimates that had been reduced to $1.78 a share. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings in the last week of March. Its accounting year ends on March 3.
After the free fall of Best Buy's stock, David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management, which manages the $3.7 billion Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity fund, took a 1.5 percent position in the company. His price per share was in the high $20's, but he has not added to his position. "The stock was much more attractive a month ago," he said. "I'd love it if we got another wave of fear."
While most people, including Mr. Dreman, do not expect the stock to fall to those levels again, concern about the economy and the Musicland purchase could keep the stock relatively flat for a few months, analysts and money managers said. Even if the economy picks up, the large-appliance business remains tricky. Last fall, Circuit City, the nation's second-largest retailer of such appliances, behind Sears, Roebuck, said it was abandoning that market.
And Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores, both known for competing on price, recently began selling large appliances in some markets.
According to the Consumer Electronics Association, appliance sales are expected to rise 6 percent this year after a 10 percent increase in 2000.
"Best Buy had a nice run, and I wouldn't be surprised if it backed off a bit," said Todd Kuhrt, a senior analyst at Midwest Research in Cleveland. Indeed, after jumping to $49.80 at the end of January, Best Buy stock has slid back, closing at $40.01 on Friday. Mr. Kuhrt is neutral on the stock even though he has a 12-month target price in the high $40's.
While Mr. Kuhrt says Best Buy got a good deal on the stores that operate under the Sam Goody, Suncoast, Media Play and On Cue names, all acquired in the Musicland deal, he worries that it could take awhile to make them profitable and that mastering the different retail concepts in the Musicland chain could be challenging. 
THE store formats for the two companies are vastly different. Best Buy executives are familiar with operating huge, 45,000-square-foot stores in large metropolitan areas, while Musicland operates much smaller stores, typically in malls, that tend to sell CD's and videos, which are heavily discounted by many other retailers.
Laurie Bauer, a spokeswoman for Best Buy, said that the company was not surprised by Wall Street's poor reaction to the Musicland deal and that company executives had worked hard to explain their rationale. In particular, Ms. Bauer said, Musicland's 200 On Cue stores -- 6,500-square-foot stores in rural areas -- will expand Best Buy into a new market. Musicland's other stores, she said, should also help attract more women and younger shoppers.
Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior equity portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Fund, said he believes that the Musicland deal will be a plus for Best Buy."Long term, the Musicland deal is a great thing, because it's a nice way to extend and expand without the major capital expense," said Mr. Ghriskey, who invested 0.23 percent of his fund's assets in Best Buy just before the stock collapsed in November. "But any transition is difficult." 
Still, he said, the stock's potential is strong: "If you look out 9 to 12 months, this is a good place to be."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 25, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investing in the Best Buy Company, the retailer of consumer electronics and appliances, referred incorrectly to the financial condition of Musicland Stores, a company it acquired on Jan. 31. Musicland renegotiated agreements with creditors and suppliers in 1997; it was not bankrupt.

If You Wow Them, They Will Come

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HAYT; Elizabeth Hayt's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about artists whose subject is nature run amok.

 BODY:
ONE Saturday last fall at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, a security guard was positioned at the door, a clicker in hand, counting heads. A solo show by Damien Hirst, his first in four years, had opened to great fanfare, drawing throngs of visitors. The crowd, a mix of uptowners, downtowners and suburban day-trippers, was a record for the gallery -- some 7,000 people passed through its glass doors that day. This was on a par with blockbuster museum shows like the Museum of Modern Art's 1998 Pollock retrospective, which drew just under 8,000 visitors on the day of peak attendance, the 1999 Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" show, which drew 9,000 to 10,000 people on opening day, and the Armani retrospective last year at the Guggenheim, where about 6,000 visitors showed up on Saturdays.
 At Gagosian, the throng had come to gawk. In Mr. Hirst's display were a 20-foot-tall painted bronze anatomical figure, gynecological examining rooms submerged in tanks filled with live fish, and vitrines lined with everything from pills (8,000 of them) to dogs' skeletons. 
 "Because of his notoriety, Damien draws a broader cross section of people than a traditional art audience," Larry Gagosian, the owner, said. "It's art that has this genius theatricality. The objects themselves are interesting and in many cases ground-breaking in regard to definitions of sculpture, but somehow the ensemble of these works, together in the gallery -- the juxtapositions, the shifts in scale -- creates a spectacle."
Spectacle is the buzzword in contemporary art these days, and Mr. Hirst is its practitioner par excellence. In the early 90's, with artists like Kiki Smith and Sean Landers, the politics of identity and abject, even pathetic, subject matter were the lingua franca of the art world. By contrast, many of today's most prominent artists both here and abroad are fabricating super-size, lavish works with the same technical wizardry (and in some cases budgets) as a Hollywood production company. (The art in Mr. Hirst's show cost more than $1 million to fabricate.)
Theatrical art has a number of historical precedents dating back at least to the Baroque era with Bernini's "Ecstasy of St. Theresa." In the 20th century, spectacle appeared from time to time in one eye-popping form or another. But now its manifestations are appearing in installations, sculpture, painting, photography, performance and film, with artists offering the same razzle-dazzle as the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the Museum of Natural History, celebrating an aesthetic of sensory saturation.
"There's an earlier history to this," said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of Fine Arts at New York University, "but it was grittier, howling and Allen Ginsberg-y, whereas now it looks like a computer production, which it often is."
Mr. Rosenblum went on to offer an explanation for the development: "Looking at art is no longer a private elite event. It has a huge public audience. After all, the Phillips Collection is going to Las Vegas! The audience for modern art has multiplied, and people like spectacle. Art has become part of popular entertainment." A year ago, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis mounted "Let's Entertain," an exhibition featuring 80 artists whose work deals with the influence of an entertainment-oriented culture on the production and content of art.
Artists agree that they are no longer content to be recognized only by their peers and a small circle of critics, curators, collectors and dealers; rather, they want to participate in a larger cultural arena. "I'm not interested in a purely hermetic art world audience," said the photographer Gregory Crewdson. "I want a larger audience." The painter Julian Schnabel is another case in point: now a director as well, he recently released his second feature film, "Before Night Falls."
Art has mirrored the economic boom of the last five years. Bruce Wolmer, editor of Art and Auction magazine, said that in this age of good times, glamour and entertainment, artists seem to be aspiring to, rather than opposing, the zeitgeist. What's more, for art to command attention, it must compete with the splash and punch of popular visual culture like movies, fashion and advertising.
"Ambitious art wants to have the same impact as Tom Ford's Gucci ads and Steven Meisel's Versace ads," Mr. Wolmer said. "Glamour was once regarded as a superficial aesthetic, but now it's a powerful aesthetic. Almost 35 years ago, the French theorist Guy Debord described our age as the 'society of the spectacle.' Now spectacles have become the art of our society."
It used to be that artists whose work was too closely aligned with consumerism were accused of trying to hoodwink the viewer by passing off a commodity as a lofty work of art (think Warhol.) But now a Brillo box is considered as legitimate as a Brancusi. According to Jack Bankowsky, editor of Artforum magazine: "Installation art was meant as a critical response to the conventional media, and now it has become a convention in its own right. I think art should inhabit and use the tools of the moment. It should go into the belly of the beast as opposed to standing at a safe distance. Using the technologies available can speak to contemporary reality. To wrest attention from the spectacle of the commodity is a valid enterprise."
But other authorities are more circumspect. "I have nothing against extravagance in principle, but any art that has no engagement for the viewer other than awe is suspect," said Robert Storr, senior curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. "Part of the problem with a lot of this stuff is that it does the work for the viewer, who just leans back and says, 'Golly!' Art can be excess, but it's not entertainment. Paul McCarthy is a good example of someone who makes you work and think by giving more than anybody can handle."
Mr. McCarthy is one of the innovators of art as spectacle. His retrospective at the New Museum of Contemporary Art includes raunchy sculptural tableaus of mechanized mannequins, which offer a dark spin on American fairy tales and theme-park entertainment. "Disney is our contemporary landscape," the art dealer Jeffrey Deitch said. "The best art will reflect that and challenge you. Disney comforts you, whereas the best art shakes up your comfort level and perception. Paul McCarthy's 'Garden' makes you gasp." 
Mr. Deitch was referring to Mr. McCarthy's 1991-92 work, which is on view at Deitch Projects and may be considered Little Red Riding Hood's worst nightmare. Made from abandoned sets for the television show "Bonanza," the installation includes an artificial forest with a pair of motorized, fiberglass male figures hidden in the foliage, pants pulled down, engaging in lewd behavior.
Another originator of the kind of art that leaves viewers slack jawed is Jeff Koons. During the 80's, his ready-mades -- spanking new vacuum cleaners encased in Plexiglas boxes, as well as a kitschy ceramic sculpture of Michael Jackson and Bubbles, his monkey -- drew parallels between consumerism, pop culture and fine art. In 1992 he produced "Puppy," a 40-foot-high public sculpture made of 70,000 flowering plants with a self-sustaining internal irrigation system; the work has been seen worldwide, most recently to Rockefeller Center.
In 1993 Mr. Koons began "Celebration," a series that includes mural-size, Crayola-colored paintings depicting a child's paradise of balloons, party hats, toys and animals. Next month at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles he will exhibit a continuation of his "EasyFun-Ethereal" paintings, a series he began in 1999 and first showed last October at Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin. With these recent works, Mr. Koons has continued to tap the cultural reservoir of glossy surfaces, hedonistic excess and swollen materialism that has long preoccupied him.
"We're exposed to certain technologies and, at some level, I hope we're rejoicing in them and articulating the language of our visual experience by bringing it into art," he said. "Look at the new Conde Nast building and Times Square, and how packaging and marketing have changed through the computer, PhotoShop and special effects in film. There's this parallel reality, and it's a fantasy world."
To recreate this parallel reality can be very expensive. Although Mr. Koons has planned 20 sculptures for "Celebration," he has been able to manufacture only half that number, with dealers and collectors financing the production. His "Balloon Dog," for example, which was exhibited in London last fall at the Royal Academy of Art's "Apocalypse" show, is a metal sculpture measuring 10 feet high by 12 feet long and costing more than $1 million to make. 
Mr. Koons's exorbitant budget is partly explained by the army of experts on whom he has relied: a Nobel-prize-winning physicist, Bavarian woodcarvers, Italian glass and porcelain makers, structural engineers, horticulturists, Little Tykes and Fischer Price manufacturers, not to mention 20 to 70 studio assistants, depending on the size of the piece. 
Mr. Koons is not alone in his vast enterprise. Matthew Barney, the sculptor and video artist who created the operatic and visually rapturous "Cremaster" films, started out in 1995 with a production team of 10 and now works with a crew of 35. Mr. Crewdson, whose large-scale color photographs of eerie suburban scenes were previously shot on location in the Berkshires, now constructs a full-scale sound set and requires no less than 20 stagehands to create a single image, making his work rival feature films.
Vanessa Beecroft, an Italian artist, staged "Show," a live exhibition of 20 models, some nude, others clad only in red rhinestone Gucci bikinis, in 1998 in the rotunda of the uptown Guggenheim Museum. Last April, after negotiating for a year with administrators in the Navy, she recruited and directed 35 submarine sailors to stand for two hours in ceremonial formation in dress blues on the flight deck of the Intrepid, moored in the Hudson River just north of 42nd Street.
For the "Apocalypse" show, the Japanese artist Mariko Mori presented "Dream Temple," a stunning octagonal structure approximately 17 feet high with a perimeter of 33 feet. The piece is made of gleaming and translucent materials, like varnished metal, fiberglass, optical fibers and four different types of glass, including iridescent and colored Venetian. Ms. Mori was able to realize the project -- two years in the making with a team of architects and artisans -- only with financial help from the Prada Foundation. 
WHILE artists have historically relied on a team of assistants -- Peter Paul Rubens had 7 to 10 workers in his Antwerp studio and Andy Warhol had no more than 6 during the heyday of the Factory in Manhattan -- art production today has evolved into an industry. Peter Lunenfeld, a professor at the Arts Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., attributes the phenomenon to a combination of simple logistics and by the so-called theory of "festivalism." In recent years, more and more galleries have opened in former industrial spaces in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, and international biennials have proliferated, creating expansive, new exhibition spaces. "There is a whole generation of artists who have come of age filling these huge spaces, like the Chapman Brothers, Pipilotti Rist, Ugo Rondinone, Diana Thater and Jason Rhoades," Mr. Lunenfeld said. "These spaces are bigger, the artists have the budgets to match and the art is expanding to fill them whether it needs to or not."
Spectacle art has also attracted an audience hungering for an alternative to computer culture, Mr. Lunenfeld said. People want "a break from 17-inch monitors," he said.
"The virtualization or computerization of everything makes you want Radio City or the Cinerama Dome, a movie theater in Hollywood with enormous screens. In fact, sometimes I'll chose to see a worse movie there rather than a better one somewhere else just because it's on a bigger screen." 
Although Mr. Lunenfeld was referring to his own taste, he could have been speaking of the art world in general, where bigger is better, and more is more.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
A Wary Eye On the Future For Military Contractors

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
MOST people didn't notice, but on Wall Street the $125 billion military industry was on a roll well before George W. Bush arrived in Washington.
 Feeding off the Clinton administration's outlays for the Pentagon in fiscal year 2000 -- the first major increase in military spending since the mid-1980's -- the Standard & Poor's aerospace index soared 57 percent last year. Expectations are that the good times will continue. But so far that assumption is largely based on campaign rhetoric, because Mr. Bush will not submit his first budget until the end of the month. But last week, he suggested that sweeping changes lie ahead. 
 Byron K. Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, took some time on Thursday to talk about his expectations. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Mr. Bush said he intended to emphasize new technology and weapons systems. That implies a fair amount of change. Is the Pentagon capable of that?

A. It's a very interesting space to watch. There are a series of strategic studies under way right now.
Still, there is a side of me that says there will not be that much substantial change, that not many major programs will be canceled.
But in the same breath, there are some areas that are near and dear to the secretary of defense, like missile defense and space in general.

Q. Are you expecting a big increase in the military budget?

A. There is a modest upside to spending. But the very clear signal is that the administration is not going to shovel money through the door of the Pentagon. During the campaign, Al Gore was talking about a bigger defense budget than Mr. Bush.

Q. During the 1990's the Pentagon encouraged, and the Clinton administration condoned, an extensive consolidation of the military industry. Mr. Bush seems to suggest that new suppliers, particularly of technology, will be part of the Pentagon's future.

A. There are five big contractors -- Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop-Grumman and Raytheon. And there are whole layers of companies below them that are not in the public eye. But to really open up the system there would have to be a great deal of reform in very unique regulatory requirements ranging from a separate and distinct cost-accounting system to intellectual property rights.
To bring in the broader economy, you have to make it as easy to do business with the Department of Defense as it is with I.B.M. or General Motors. There are some political as well as bureaucratic walls to climb.
Now in some areas defense companies have been taking commercial technologies, dealing with these arcane regulations and applying them to defense contracts. Cisco Systems has teamed with a couple of defense contractors, for example.

Q. Military contractors' stocks had a very nice move last year. Are you optimistic that they can go higher?

A. I am modestly cautious. We are entering a period of change, and you don't know how that change is going to play out. Part of that change is due to the change in the defense budget, but the other change is in the rest of the investment scene. The meltdown in technology has made other areas relatively attractive, including defense.

Q. Which of these stocks do you like?

A. I look at things that have low expectations, or are perceived not to be doing well. I am focusing on three: General Dynamics, Northrop-Grumman and Boeing.
I like Northrop-Grumman because they are doing things with unmanned air vehicles and sensors, and there is a possibility they will make more B-2 bombers.
Talk of change has made people pessimistic about General Dynamics, but I don't think there will be much change in procurement of naval vessels or armored vehicles. The naval programs will be stable, and they are well hedged for change in the armored vehicle area.
As far as Boeing is concerned, its prospects are primarily tied to the commercial aircraft market, which accounts for about 60 percent of their business. But they are the leading company in ballistic missile defense.
Also, L-3 could potentially do very well in this environment. They have an electronics focus and a commercial focus as well.

Q. In the 1980's, when the Reagan administration budgeted huge amounts for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Soviet Union was this country's obvious antagonist. Today's threats are much more diffuse.

A. The threat today isn't as obvious to hedge against as it was in 1980, but it is something the United States will have to hedge against in the future. I think missile defense will be a major research and development area.

High-Stakes Politics: The Race to Rule the Nation

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the Reagan years? Republicans couldn't stop predicting they were on the verge of becoming the new majority party.
 They were wrong, it turned out, and although the Republicans now control the White House, House and Senate for the first time since the Eisenhower administration, no one in the party has yet declared victory over the Democrats. 
 The balance of power is so even at this extraordinary moment that a macabre death watch is on in the Senate, where the demise of just one lawmaker could give Democrats the majority.
For their part, Republicans are well aware of the historic pattern of midterm defeats for the party in the White House. Nonetheless, giddy Republicans say that one month into his presidency, George W. Bush -- despite the circumstances of his election -- could be showing them the way to majority status. And he's doing it by inventing a kind of Republican populism on issue after issue designed to make voters take a second look at the party. 
"What he's trying to do now is change the brand name a little bit for people who basically agree with us but will not look at our brand name," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3rd, the Virginia Republican in charge of the House Republicans campaign effort.
Gone are the days when Republicans celebrated the business class and "trickle down" economics. Instead, the president's rhetoric is calculated to appeal to Democratic target voters like blue-collar households, Catholics and parents dissatisfied with public education. 
"The president now has the opportunity to create a new governing majority based on a new time, a new approach, a new agenda and a new philosophy of compassionate conservatism," says Karl Rove, one of Mr. Bush's closest aides. 
When the president promotes domestic energy exploration, he says it is a way to help people with their heating bills. He touts his education plan as aiding lower-income families with children stuck in failing public schools. And when he stumps for his $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax cut, he trots out a single mother of modest means. 
"For every additional dollar she makes above $25,000, she pays a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone who's wealthy," he says. "And that's not right and that's not fair." It was left to Jon Corzine, the wealthy Democratic senator of New Jersey, to point out that he would get an estimated $1 million a year tax reduction under Bush's plan.
Mr. Bush can mount this effort secure that the party's traditional business base and the other donors who gave record sums to his campaign know they will fare well under his administration. His tax plan would reduce all tax rates and eliminate the estate tax. His energy policy would be a boon to the oil industry. And he is issuing executive orders attempting to rein in the political influence of organized labor.
Democrats insist that Republican majoritarian dreams are just that, and they cite the recent election as proof. Vice President Al Gore, after all, won the popular vote in 2000 and Democrats picked up seats in both the House and Senate.
"The only way either party is going to make significant inroads is if Republicans figure out how to make significant inroads with minorities or we figure out how to do better with rural white men," said James M. Jordan, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "I would submit to you that we have the simpler job."
Still, Democrats seem caught off balance by Mr. Bush, and unsure of how best to oppose him. 
"I think the Republicans have taken playbooks from the Democrats," said Senator Thomas A. Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota. "They appear to be trying to obfuscate or blur the differences. And I think to a certain extent they've succeeded at that."
SO far -- using charts and other gimmicks to get on television, now that Bill Clinton isn't making their case -- Congressional Democrats have stuck with their traditional theme: that Mr. Bush's tax cut ignores the needs of the great middle class. 
"Mr. Bush's rhetoric sounds great," Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said at one such news conference. "But as people begin to read the fine print, they are finding out that while the very wealthy will get a huge bonanza, the average family will get nothing or so little as to make no difference."
But Democrats are sharply divided over whether class warfare works anymore. Party moderates argue it risks alienating as many people as it wins over; conservative Democrats want to stress debt reduction.
In response, Democratic leaders are trying to broaden their line of attack against Mr. Bush's tax cut plan. They emphasize that they, too, support tax cuts, albeit smaller ones, but also want debt reduction and spending on popular programs like health care and education.
Such a stance, party strategists say, will appeal to the suburban moderates who these days decide elections. But it can also look like ideological surrender. The same Democrats who last year were willing to support $250 billion in tax cuts and then $500 billion, now have upped their ante to $750 billion.
In the end, the new majority party may be determined by which programs pass and which don't. Conservatives have long favored the introduction of individual Social Security accounts because it would begin dismantling the most popular government program -- one that gives people an affinity to the government and to Democrats. In fact, much of Mr. Bush's agenda -- from tax cuts to Social Security to private insurance competition with Medicare -- is aimed a reducing that dependence.
The Democrats, by contrast, hope that their proposed new middle-class benefits, including a Medicare prescription drug benefit and assistance for crumbling schools, will make people feel they have a stake in government. Mr. Bush's tax cut, they note, would make it more difficult to pay for such programs.
THE struggle over these agendas is just beginning. It pays to remember that this is Mr. Bush's honeymoon period and that Newt Gingrich's "Contract with America" passed the House with great fanfare only to falter in the Senate.
Two Senate Republicans last week came out against Mr. Bush's tax cuts as too costly. And the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee announced that he was not interested in Mr. Bush's call for a sweeping overhaul of Medicare.
So as he begins organizing for the critical midterm election of 2002, Mr. Davis, the Virginia Republican, for one, is cautious about predictions. "It's a long, long way to go," he said.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Shadow President; 
This Episode of 'The Clintons' Makes Bush the Star

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT'S a silly question, maybe, but one worth asking: What shape would President Bush be in if Bill Clinton had just skipped the last week of his presidency and left town quietly, without pardoning the fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, without a carload of gifts and without casting a covetous eye on a plutocratic suite of offices in a Manhattan high-rise?
 What if he had resolved to go home and "carry the grips upstairs," as Harry S. Truman did? Or climbed aboard Marine One with a jerky wave, like Richard M. Nixon, and left the stage empty for his successor? 
 Worth asking because the answer is so consequential: Mr. Bush would almost surely have had less of a free ride than he has in fact had. And he would probably not have taken command of his job so quickly. 
Confident as he may have proclaimed himself to be, the new president took office with no wind behind him. Having lost the popular vote, having won the electoral vote only with the help of a painfully divided Supreme Court, Mr. Bush was greeted with suspicion both inside the Beltway and beyond. He seemed to have blundered in nominating a hard-line conservative as attorney general when he clearly needed to build a coalition with the moderates.
But all that seems like ancient history. Democrats in Washington speak little about the debacle in Florida. Most of them have muted their attacks on the new attorney general, former Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. They are concentrating their criticism not on Mr. Bush but on former Vice President Al Gore for having run what they view as a feckless campaign against Mr. Bush and on Mr. Clinton for having badly bungled his exit.
All last week, the television networks and cable outlets led their broadcasts with news of Mr. Clinton's troubles. Mr. Bush's first weeks in office have passed with very little critical examination in the news media, and the Democrats have been unable to challenge him effectively, although many of his proposals are controversial.
Mr. Clinton, who had hoped to be one of his party's principal voices after leaving office, has been thrown so thoroughly onto the defensive that he has had little to say about Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposals or his administration's first steps away from Clinton-era foreign, economic and security policy.
The former president's star money-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, recently installed as the Democrats' national chairman, has felt obliged to keep his head down, too, at a time when one of his star contributors, Denise Rich, is accused of buying her former husband's pardon.
 FOR their part, the Democrats on Capitol Hill have had trouble attracting anyone's attention with their complaints about some of Mr. Bush's proposals. When the party leadership held a news conference last week to oppose the president's tax-cut plan, it was all but ignored, while hearings on the Rich pardon merited all-day coverage on the all-news cable channels.
As a result, a Democratic senator said, "We give Bush an open field, with nobody playing defense to keep him from gaining 30 yards a pop."
Mr. Bush has, of course, made some adroit moves that have helped smooth his way -- meeting with legislators from both parties in a number of settings, indicating his willingness to compromise on major issues like taxes and health care and, in general, comporting himself with more dignity than Mr. Clinton, without making too big a point of it. Editorial writers and the top Democrats have done that for him, with help from the former president.
Bush ran on bringing dignity back," said William M. Daley, who served as Mr. Clinton's commerce secretary and later as Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, "and I think the actions by Clinton of the last couple of weeks are giving him a pretty good platform."
It is difficult to believe that Mr. Bush, who has not held a full news conference in a full month in the Oval Office, could have escaped tough criticism on that ground alone if not for the red meat that Mr. Clinton has provided for reporters who might otherwise have been looking for ways to bring the new president's honeymoon to a rapid end.
President Bush, no political fool, has tried to sound as if he'd like to get all this behind him, especially the Rich case. He campaigned as the candidate of dignity, remember, who would end the Washington backbiting. But in his comment on the pardon and the investigations of it that have now begun, he said that Congress would "do what it will do," which does not sound much like the words of a leader trying to pull his troops out of combat.
There has been a downside for Mr. Bush, of course. Some of his policy proposals have been all but buried in the avalanche of coverage of the Clintons, and he has resorted to other means, like interviews with local television stations and newspapers, to get his message across. But he will have plenty of time to speak later when Congressional wheels begin grinding.
The honeymoon will inevitably end. Even now, outspoken Clinton loyalists remain in Washington; one night last week, when news coverage had been mercilessly critical, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was applauded loudly as she walked into the Palm, a Washington watering hole favored by Democratic movers and shakers. Six months from now, the furor surrounding the former president will surely have calmed, although he has a way of keeping the political pot bubbling, even when not in his best interests.
And Mr. Bush will stub his toe. Probably several times.
STILL, he has been given an extraordinary assist. Harry McPherson, who came north from Texas 45 years ago to work for Lyndon B. Johnson, has watched many a transition, and he said the other day he had never seen "anything as disorderly, unattractive and helpful to the new guy as this."
Most Democrats are sick to death of it. A campaign consultant closely identified with the party leadership reported with astonishment the other day that he had received a newly printed volume, produced and mailed at government expense, called "The Farewell Addresses of William J. Clinton."
"The plural," he said. "That's what gets me. Washington had one farewell address. Clinton had several."

A New View of Where America Fits in the World

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENTIAL campaigns are a notoriously bad environment for debating how America will approach the world. During the cold war, every candidate sought to prove he would be tough on the Communists, and his opponent a wimp. In this murkier age of global markets, globe-trotting terrorists, disintegrating superpowers and distended peacekeeping missions, George W. Bush made realists happy by assuring them he would protect America's "national interests," while assuring allies that America would stop lecturing and conduct a "more humble foreign policy." 
 No one was quite certain what it all meant. 
 But in the past few weeks, Mr. Bush has begun defining his terms, setting his priorities -- and in the case of Iraq, giving notice that he may be new to this, but he doesn't plan to show it.
Last week, Mr. Bush set a broad new direction for America's military, told reservists that he would bring a halt to the "overdeployments" of troops around the world, and talked about gas exploration and new immigration policy with President Vincente Fox in Mexico. Most dramatically, he approved an air raid on radar control facilities near Baghdad that he hopes will chasten Saddam Hussein on the eve of Gen. Colin L. Powell's first visit to the Middle East as secretary of state. The raid underscored Mr. Bush's first foreign policy objective: to take command of events overseas, while being far more selective than the Clinton administration about which thickets to enter. That is more an inclination than a strategy, and there are plenty of rough edges.
So far, for example, Mr. Bush's approach to Russia has been somewhat less than humble. In the past few days Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has declared that Moscow's role as an "active proliferator" of missile technology helped propel the White House toward developing a national missile defense -- a plan the Russians and Chinese detest. Then there is Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who has bluntly declared that the Clinton administration's loans to Russia were "crazy" and has told the Kremlin to pay off the old Soviet Union's debts and forget about new aid until it cleans up rampant corruption. 
Mr. O'Neill also says countries like Russia that mismanage their currencies and economies are on their own, and should expect no cash from Washington. On the other hand, he says, Japan will no longer get Clinton-like lectures about how to reverse its decade-long economic decline.
This may not add up to a global vision. But it sure sends a message: don't expect us to leave home as often, and don't expect us to whip out our American Express card when we do. It's not isolationist -- but it's far less activist than the let's-have-a-summit approach of Bill Clinton. (Iraq, of course, is a special case.)
One of Mr. Bush's senior foreign policy aides put it this way: "The point Bush makes to us in meeting after meeting is that while the U.S. is indeed very powerful and influential, if we are using that power everywhere, we will either cause a backlash or not prove very effective." It is a sentiment Mr. Bush himself expressed last month, just before the inauguration, while touring his ranch in Crawford, Tex., with two reporters. "I worry about our ugly-American problem," he said.
BUT can he trust that Japan will change the way it runs its economy, or persuade the Arabs and Israelis to talk rather than shoot, without keeping the United States in the prescription-writing business?
"You would be misreading the new administration to think that there is an aggregate decision to ratchet down," said Philip D. Zelikow, the director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a longtime friend and associate of Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser. "The two words they use the most often are discipline and strategy. It comes out of a sense that the Clinton people were too undisciplined, and they let events drive them."
Mr. Bush's team, he argued, is "trying hard to recover choice." That is why this president has no intention of playing the middle in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and why he abhors tying up the military in "nation-building," which in his view hurts readiness for emergencies.
All this fits nicely into Mr. Bush's preference for pragmatism over ideology. Like his father, he tends toattack problems through personal relationships -- which is what the ranch diplomacy with Mr. Fox was all about. Perhaps this was Mr. Bush's idea of humility: he talked about a "North American energy policy" rather than one the United States presumes to dominate, and he appeared to be taking seriously proposals for a guest worker program that sends shivers up the backs of some conservatives in his own party.
The flip side of the Bush team's predilection for the personal is a lack of much real enthusiasm for the multilateral institutions that Mr. Clinton saw as the vital wiring of a globalized world.
In his last speech to the United Nations, Mr. Clinton talked about promoting a global rapid-reaction force that, with American help, could intervene inside national borders before civil war turned to genocide. Don't hold your breath for Mr. Bush to repeat those words. As a close military adviser to Vice President Cheney notes, "There's a real sense in this White House that the Haitis and Rwandas and Kosovos of the world are not materially better off after our interventions than they would have been without them."
IF that's the analysis, though, Mr. Bush's few weeks in the Oval Office have already taught him to speak with a lot more subtlety than he did on the campaign trail. 
For example, there he was last week at NATO's Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk, Va., repeating that he would consult, consult and consult some more before doing anything precipitous about pulling troops out of the Balkans. Similarly, in an exchange of letters with President Jiang Zemin of China last week, he said Beijing had nothing to fear from an American missile defense. He says he is certain he will convince the Chinese, over time, that his plan is not aimed at them.
The fear in Europe and Asia, of course, is that the talk of consultation is just for show -- that Mr. Bush wants to put a multinational patina on views he's already arrived at.
"That's not the case," a senior adviser argues. "I am certain that the consultations will affect our plans in a variety of areas."
Of course, the real test of America's new management won't come until grand pronouncements confront some global reality. Iraq is just a start. The first time a Rwanda-like carnage unfolds on CNN, or a Russia-like financial crisis threatens to take out the Nasdaq, the conversations about "overdeployment" and "crazy" financial interventions will get truly interesting. That's also when the president who has been overseas three times in his adult life gets his first real tour of the world.

America's Dream: A Mexico Like Itself

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
WE stopped in wonderment," wrote Bernal Diaz del Castillo, chronicler of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, after entering this Aztec capital in 1519. "Some of our soldiers even said that perhaps they were seeing all of this as though in a dream."
 People from the United States have had a hard time seeing Mexico straight, too. Millions come here and never see it at all, spending their days in tourist enclaves speaking English and spending dollars. Others gaze down from on high and see an image of their own devising. Now President Bush has come to Mexico seeking "a closer partnership with the United States" based on everything from natural gas to migrant labor. 
 For two decades, the distorting prisms of the wars on migrants and drugs and communism have made American panjandrums paint Mexico as a pretty scary place, but one that could be tamed by projecting American political and economic power.
In 1980, The New York Times published an opinion article by a conservative writer and editor named Constantine C. Menges warning that Communist advances in Central America threatened to make Mexico the "Iran next door": a revolutionary state wracked by "leftist terror" and "destabilization by a coalition of reformist, radical and Communist groups." William J. Casey, the director of central intelligence under President Reagan, believed all that and worse. He hired the man and together they pushed that view very, very hard.
None of it ever happened. "It is as though the cold war had been a mask that blinded us to the reality of the world," the late Mexican poet and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz told The New York Times in 1992.
When selling widgets became more important than shipping weapons in Latin America, American foreign policy smiled on Carlos Salinas de Gortari, president of Mexico from 1988 to 1994. Those smiles helped push the North American Free Trade Agreement to passage. Mr. Salinas and his team were just like us, American policymakers thought: they had gone to Ivy League schools and spoke English, so they thought and acted just like us.
I KNOW no government anywhere that is more competent," Henry Kissinger said in 1993. Hindsight suggests otherwise. Mr. Salinas left a legacy of political corruption, crony capitalism and economic crisis from which Mexico is still trying to recover.
And when the war on cocaine replaced the war on Communists, Washington's drug czar, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, praised his Mexican counterpart in the war on drugs as a man of "absolute unquestioned integrity." Days later, the very same man, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested; he was later convicted for working for the drug lords.
What made the high and mighty misread Mexico? More than wishful thinking, it was mirror-imaging: projecting American thought processes and value systems on everyone else. Adm. David E. Jeremiah, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has critiqued it as "this 'everybody thinks like us' mind-set," a classic American cultural assumption that underlies cockeyed intelligence and myopic policy.
So can the United States see Mexico any more clearly now?
"Things are changing," says Mexico's new foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda. For years, he said, the United States thought "Mexico was a country where what mattered was stability, whoever delivered it -- it didn't make much difference how nice or not nice they were." So when Washington wanted good things to stay stable or bad things to change, it banked on whoever was in power, a Salinas or a Gutierrez -- individuals, not institutions, since the only institution in Mexico was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power since 1929. The United States thought it was seeing reasonable men who thought and talked in the American way, a government minister who went to Yale or a four-star drug czar schooled in American strategy, when what lay beneath was an ancient political machine that corrupted almost everything it touched.
The machine and its facade fell apart two months ago, when Vicente Fox became president, the first opponent of the ruling order -- Aztec, Spaniard or Mexican -- to take power peacefully. The vote showed that autocracy was dying in Mexico, and the institutions of democracy were being born.
THESE days, he is not masking Mexico to make it look like what American leaders want to see. He is saying that if Mexico builds its own institutions of democracy out of the rubble of the old order -- like the conquerors built this capital from the stones of the Aztec city they destroyed -- that in 10, 20 or 30 years, long after he is out of power, people might have better lives. He means by that better wages, education, health, housing, police, courts, maybe even politicians.
He says this without saying that Mexico is going to achieve it by becoming more like the United States. And this is something else that may be changing in Mexico.
"He doesn't need to come across as an American," Mr. Castaneda said. "He doesn't want to convince Americans that he's like them. He doesn't want to convince Americans that he wants Mexico to become like them." The two countries may become "much closer," Mr. Castaneda said. "But closer doesn't mean more alike."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nothing personal, Saddam. Just bidness. Bush family bidness.
 Grab the cannoli, drop the bombs. 
 While Bill Clinton is chaotically smashing his legacy, W. is methodically renovating his dad's legacy.
Keen to protect the family honor, the new president is going back, piece by piece, working to sand away the scars of Bush I. 
Amid the Republican hosannas for 43, it is easy to forget the Republican raspberries for 41 when he lost the White House eight years ago.
The name Bush was anathema to the right for years, until the Lewinsky scandal sparked Bush nostalgia.
Thursday night, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Virginia, the audience was giddy at every mention of the Bush restoration, and squealed and aimed cameras at Dick Cheney as though he were Jennifer Lopez. (D.Che)
Outside the banquet hall, a booth was plastered with bumper stickers alarmed about "The Homosexual Agenda" -- "Recruit Children," "Destroy the Boy Scouts," "Take Over Public Schools."
Under the heading "Devaluing Life," were stickers shrieking about the "Morning-After Pill," "Baby Body Parts for $ ale" and "Stem-Cell Research."
Inside, over steaks and wine, Charlton Heston, head of the N.R.A., was offering the new president (back in the White House) advice in the voices of some of his movie characters.
As Long John Silver of "Treasure Island": "Aye, the battle was nip and tuck, we was all a-swearin' blue fire, but ya didn't falter. You ran our colors back up the mast -- eight long years now that fine emblem's been missin'. But let down your mates, sir, and you'll face the plank." 
As Bill Tyler of "The Mountain Men": "Keep your powder dry, Mr. President. Take a deep seat in the saddle and don that faraway look that marks a true man of vision."
As Col. George Taylor of "Planet of the Apes," Mr. Heston brandished a banana and advised: "Please, no monkeying around, Mr. President. We had enough of that during the last administration." 
W.'s political career rose from the ashes of his father's '92 loss. He learned from his father's mistakes. Now he wants to correct them.
If the Bush name was tarnished by leaving Saddam in power, W. can fix that. He has brought together the Bush I players Cheney, Powell and Rice to see if that unfinished war needs to be finished. (Not to mention the pleasure of payback for Saddam's assassination plot against Poppy in '93.)
If the Bush name was tarnished by breaking the no-new-taxes pledge in an honorable effort to cut the deficit, W. can fix that. He can ignore the deficit and cut taxes.
If the Bush name was tarnished by the airy-fairy Points of Light (Pints of Lite) office, W. can fix that. He instituted a faith-based social services program so serious it is a threat to the separation of church and state.
If the Bush name was tarnished by schizophrenic attempts to be Greenwich blue blood and Midland barbed wire, with Maine weekends colliding with invocations of pork rinds and "Hee Haw," W. can fix that. He can stay home on the Crawford range.
If the Bush name was tarnished by a recession that Mr. Clinton took credit for vanquishing, W. can fix that. He is blaming Mr. Clinton for the slowdown, so he can get credit for the eventual recovery.
If the Bush name was tarnished by association with the name Quayle, W. can fix that by associating with the name Cheney.
If the Bush name was tarnished by a lame attempt to be the Education President, W. can fix that with a dedicated attempt to be the Education President.
If the Bush name was tarnished with conservatives who thought the family more Rockefeller than Reagan, W. can fix that by modeling himself on Reagan. With appointments like John Ashcroft and Gale Norton, he is dancing with the ones who brung him.
If the Bush name was tarnished with oilmen friends by a decision to limit offshore drilling, W. can fix that by pushing to open the Arctic refuge and other areas to exploration.
If the Bush name was tarnished by "Don't cry for me, Argentina" Bushspeak, that fractured syntax that could render the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band into "the Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird," well, W. can't fix everything.

As Warnings Flash, Buyers Hit the Brakes

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The markets lost ground last week, undermined by bad earnings news and troubling economic reports.
 The slide began on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, indicated that the Fed was not likely to cut interest rates before its next regular meeting. 
 Evidence of continued weakness among technology companies flashed again on Thursday, as Nortel Networks, the communications equipment maker, announced layoffs and reduced earnings forecasts.
 On Friday, a widely watched barometer of consumer confidence dropped to a seven-year low. And a report on the prices of finished goods showed that they rose at their fastest pace in more than 10 years.
 The Nasdaq suffered the most, ending the week at 2,425.38, down 45.59 points, or 1.8 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 also declined, finishing at 1,301.53, off 13.23 points, or 1 percent. Only the Dow industrials escaped, though barely, reflecting an investor shift to companies better able to weather tough economic times. The Dow ended at 10,799.82, up 18.37 points, or 0.2 percent.
 The bad news also hurt the bond market. The yield on the 10-year bond finished at 5.09 percent, up from 5.02 percent the previous week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Praised by Bush, A Church Center From the Streets 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush was campaigning for president, he stopped in downtown Los Angeles at the Dream Center and praised it as the kind of religious antipoverty program he wanted his administration to support. Now that Mr. Bush is president, a close look at the Dream Center suggests how such charities might use public money in their work. 
 The center is a church for worshipers and a ministry for people in need. It was founded more than six years ago by a father-and-son team of Pentecostal pastors, Matthew Barnett, now 27, and his father, Tommy Barnett, the leader of an Assembly of God church in Phoenix. 
 Matthew Barnett said he wanted "to build a church that never sleeps" to serve the community. "All the programs are born by walking the streets and seeing the need." 
The group bought a former Franciscan hospital and renovated one wing. The center houses about 200 volunteers and 200 recovering drug and alcohol addicts, gang members and ex-convicts who call themselves BADD -- Born Again and Delivered Disciples. They rely on intensive Bible study and cold-turkey detoxification. Of those who make it through the first 30 days, when there is the greatest attrition, about half stay through the full year and finish the program, the center says.
The Dream Center is a virtual shopping center for social services, offering an emergency shelter, an AIDS hospice, volunteer doctors, a center for teenagers, a private school and a food program that the center's administrators say provides 20,000 meals a week.
The center costs more than half a million dollars a month to run, they say, raised from private donors and profits from the albums recorded by the Dream Center's band in its own recording studio. The only support the Dream Center receives from the government is surplus food.
The center is asking the state of California and the federal government for $700,000 in grants to start a job training program.
In the past, churches have complained that although they are eligible to receive government aid, they are sometimes discriminated against because their programs are too religious. The Bush administration is scheduled to open an office on Tuesday that would encourage cooperation between government agencies and religious social programs like the Dream Center. LAURIE GOODSTEIN

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES; 
Swinging for Lower Rates

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE size is in flux, and the timing is under review. New components may be added. Other provisions may fall out or be scaled back. And at a time of sharp partisan division here, there is always some risk that politics, ideology and economics will combine to create gridlock.
 Nevertheless, chances are good that by summer Congress and the Bush administration will agree on the biggest tax cut in two decades. And while business groups are scrambling to increase their share, the bulk of the tax cut is all but certain to go to individuals. 
 "It's at least 75 percent that it's going to happen," said Stanley E. Collender, managing director of the federal budget consulting group at Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations and consulting firm. 
President Bush's proposal to cut taxes by $1.6 trillion over the next decade will be the starting point as Congress begins work in earnest on taxes and spending. His plan would reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, provide a break to many two-income couples and phase out the estate tax.
What emerges at the end of the legislative process, however, will no doubt have been substantially altered in detail, if not in size, from the outline that Mr. Bush sent to Capitol Hill earlier this month.
"If you look back, Congresses have tended to give presidents the tax and spending targets they have requested," said Clint Stretch, the director of tax policy at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. "If the president asks for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, it's very likely that that's what he's going to get. At the same time, Congress has typically reshaped those tax packages."
Many Republicans in both the House and Senate want to increase the size of the tax cut and to make it retroactive to the beginning of this year. Democrats want to scale back Mr. Bush's plan, perhaps halving it to $800 billion, and to refocus its benefits, primarily on low- and middle-income people. And members of both parties are hearing from companies, interest groups and individuals who want to insert pet provisions into the bill.
The political debate is shaping up to be intense, and the lobbying is already furious. In trying to handicap the outcome, there is another wild card: the economy. 
The recent slowdown has made it easier for Mr. Bush to sell his plan as inoculation against recession. Continued deterioration in the economy may provide additional impetus to speed up and enlarge the tax cut. If the economy rebounds quickly, the push for a bigger, faster tax cut may lose some steam.
Further, some members of both parties are concerned that a big tax cut could lead to a fiscal mess if the projected federal budget surplus does not materialize as expected. 
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested that Congress consider phasing in the tax cut so that it would take effect only if the surplus was realized on schedule and the national debt was reduced according to plan. A bipartisan group of five senators is trying to build support on Capitol Hill for a similar approach.
A TRIGGER mechanism that ties the tax cuts to the actual surplus -- not an estimated surplus based on long-range predictions -- is the only way we can be sure we are voting for fiscally responsible tax cuts," Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said.
For all the political and economic uncertainties, the basic components being considered for any tax cut are well established.
The heart of Mr. Bush's proposal is a reduction in all personal income tax brackets. There are now five of them: 15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent. Mr. Bush's plan would reduce that to four -- 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent -- and tax more income at lower rates.
The change would be made over five years, under Mr. Bush's proposal, and the effect would be to cut income taxes for everyone who pays them.
BUT the Bush plan would give far bigger cuts to people at the upper end of the income scale than to people in the lower- and middle-income brackets. And it would do nothing for low- and moderate-income families who pay no income taxes but must still pay the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare.
The Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, calculated overall effects of the Bush income-tax proposals -- including reducing rates, expanding the child credit and limiting the marriage penalty. The group says that if the proposals were fully phased in, the top 1 percent of married couples filing jointly, who have an average income of $1.38 million, would get an average tax cut of $44,757, while the lowest 20 percent, with an average income of $18,450, would get a cut of only $116.
Republicans contend that it is only fair that wealthier people get a bigger portion of the tax cut, because they pay a bigger share of income taxes. In 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available, the top 5 percent of taxpayers paid 53.5 percent of the individual income taxes, according to the Tax Foundation, a business-oriented group, while the bottom 50 percent of the taxpayers paid only 4.2 percent.
But Democrats, objecting to so large a reduction to the well-off, say less-affluent people need the money more and would be more likely to give the economy a lift by spending any additional money they received through a tax cut.
Because of the concern over fairness -- and because the rate reductions account for about one-third of the cost of Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion plan -- some analysts say it is possible that Congress will scale back the proposed rate cuts.
Democrats are considering plans that would create only one new bracket, 10 percent, or expand the current 15 percent bracket to higher incomes. They are also studying proposals that would effectively grant lower-income workers a rebate to offset some or all of the payroll taxes they pay. Some moderates in both parties are discussing plans that would reduce or delay any change in the top marginal rate of 39.6 percent.
"The rate cut is likely to be changed so it skews more toward lower- and middle-income families," Mr. Collender said. "As it is, the value of the tax cut for lower-income families is very small."
Two other aspects of Mr. Bush's proposal are likely to be included in any final tax bill this year. One is reducing the so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that causes many two-income couples to owe more taxes than they would have if they had remained single. The other is an increase in the child credit, now $500 a child.
To ease the marriage penalty, Mr. Bush's plan would create a deduction for married couples filing jointly of as much as $3,000 -- 10 percent of the lower-earning spouse's income, up to a maximum of $30,000. 
Congress passed a bill last year that would have addressed the matter differently. The bill, vetoed by former President Bill Clinton, would have increased the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly so that it was twice the deduction for single people. And it would have increased the taxable income covered by the 15 percent bracket for couples filing jointly to twice the level for single filers.
That approach was more generous to married couples than Mr. Bush's, but it would also have been costlier -- $292 billion over 10 years, versus $88 billion. It is unclear which approach Congress will settle on this year, but some action on the marriage penalty is likely.
"That one's a done deal," Mr. Collender said. "Voting against it makes it look like you support living in sin."
Mr. Bush's proposal to double the child credit, to $1,000, is also likely to win support on both sides of the aisle. But his proposal contains a provision that is likely to be criticized by Democrats. 
The provision would allow married couples earning as much as $200,000 to claim the credit, up from $110,000 under current law. Some Democrats want to see the benefits of the increased credit focused on lower-income people.
THE part of Mr. Bush's plan that will probably draw the most fire, however, is the proposal to repeal the federal tax on large estates. 
Repealing the tax has long been a cherished goal of conservatives, who say it is unfair for the government to levy what amounts to a tax on death. But liberals say repeal of the tax would be an expensive giveaway to a relative handful of extremely wealthy families. Only 2 percent of all estates, those valued at more than $675,000, are subject to the tax; in 1998, more than one-fifth of all estate-tax revenue came from just 374 estates worth more than $20 million each.
Analysts say that there is ample room for compromise on the estate tax. Democrats supported an alternative last year that would have effectively exempted two groups that are often cited as its primary victims, small-business owners and family-owned farms, while continuing to levy the tax on most multimillion-dollar estates.
In the last few weeks, Mr. Bush has made it clear that he wants Congress to keep the total tax cuts to the $1.6 trillion he has proposed. But there is considerable pent-up demand on Capitol Hill for additional types of tax reductions. Some of them may make it into the final legislation, even if it means displacing or cutting back on some of Mr. Bush's provisions.
ONE that is certain to get a serious hearing is scaling back the alternative minimum tax. The A.M.T. was established three decades ago to prevent upper-income people from escaping income taxes through sophisticated tax strategies. 
But because of complexities in the tax code, the A.M.T. increasingly applies to people who earn as little as $30,000 a year.
Other ideas that could end up in the tax bill this year include a reduction of the long-term capital gains tax, an expansion of the individual retirement account and 401(k) retirement savings programs and a reduction in taxes on Social Security recipients who have substantial earnings aside from their retirement benefits.
Business groups are pressing for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent and an acceleration in the rate at which companies can write off their investments in equipment.
"When you add up all the things that aren't in the president's proposal, we're talking about real money," said Mr. Stretch at Deloitte & Touche. "Congress will insist on putting some of those things in the package, so something will have to give."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
A Questionable Crutch for a Limping Economy

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
HAVE investors lost faith in Alan Greenspan's magic?
 In early January, when Mr. Greenspan cut interest rates by one-half of a percentage point, stocks roared as investors exuded confidence that the market could indeed be saved. And when the Federal Reserve Board cut rates once more at the end of last month, strategists said again that the market was poised for recovery. 
 Now, however, investors aren't so sure. The Nasdaq, which has taken the brunt of the beating from fearful investors, lost 5 percent of its value on Friday and is down 1.8 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average is flat so far in 2001. 
A month or so ago, investors seemed certain that any economic slowdown would be quick and relatively painless. They argued that earnings weakness would pass and that share prices would rebound.
No longer. A steady drumbeat of dreary earnings reports from technology stocks -- Dell Computer and Nortel Networks most recently -- have investors concerned that the hangover from the bull-market party may last much longer than they previously thought. 
That is a reasonable view, said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. He compared the economy today to that of 1990, the last time the United States endured a recession. That downturn ended quickly, in 1991. But while the Federal Reserve chopped the federal funds rate from 9 percent in 1990 to 3 percent by 1993, it wasn't until 1994 that the economy got out of a sluggish growth mood. 
What worries Mr. Paulsen today is the possibility that the Fed's rate cuts may not be able to rouse technology spending. "If the tech sector is driven more by new-product introductions, whether the Fed lowers or raises interest rates may have no impact," he said. "That was O.K. when tech was contributing 5 percent or less to economic growth. Now it's one-third of the growth rate and it becomes critically important." 
Indeed, Mr. Paulsen thinks that the United States has avoided two recessions in recent years solely because of the economic growth provided by new technologies that won the hearts of corporations and consumers. One near miss occurred in 1995 after the Mexican peso devaluation; then, sales of personal computers bailed out the country. Later, in 1998, when the rest of the world was in turmoil, buying into the Internet boom helped the nation avert the crisis. 
"Even though we think the Asian crisis ended in 1999," Mr. Paulsen said, "signs that we hadn't really exited the crisis remained." Among them are excessive stock market volatility; depressed commodity prices, other than those that are energy-related; continued corporate layoffs; and persistently wide corporate bond spreads. "Maybe all those things indicated that most of the world didn't get out of economic crisis, but it was masked by the boom in technology," Mr. Paulsen said.
This picture has troubling implications for corporate earnings in 2001. "Normally, we go into a recession after a period where pricing power has been strong," Mr. Paulsen said. Not this time. On Friday, the report on producer prices showed that raw goods, excluding food and energy, actually fell in price by 7.4 percent, year over year. While energy prices have spiked, companies cannot pass along the price increases. "This will put a unique pressure on profits," Mr. Paulsen said. "It's a tough place to be."

HEADLINE: Burmese Junta in Talks With Democracy Leader 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The first sign that something unusual was going on was the disappearance of editorial cartoons pillorying Myanmar's pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, as a "democracy princess," a "political stunt actress" and a "Satan of destruction."
 Then the diatribes against her that have been a staple of the state-controlled press became more muted and indirect. Soon after that, newspapers stopped printing periodic announcements of forced "voluntary resignations" of members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party. 
 "The papers are even less interesting now than they were, if you can imagine that," said a Western resident of Myanmar, formerly Burma.
During the last month the reason has emerged, and it has stirred a tremor of excitement among experts watching the long, sad political standoff in Myanmar, a police state.
For the first time since 1994, the military junta that runs the country has begun holding talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. Both sides have suspended their war of words in a tentative period of what diplomats call confidence building.
Small convoys of government vehicles have been observed entering and leaving Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's home, where she has been confined for the last four months. Diplomats say she has been talking with top leaders of the junta who in the past refused to deal directly with her.
But beyond this, almost nothing is known: why the military government has decided to talk, what subjects are being discussed or where this new approach might lead.
Most experts agree, though, that there is still a clear bottom line. The military that has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and the current junta -- in power since 1988 -- have no intention of giving away or sharing any substantive power.
"At this point, the most we can expect is some loosening up around the edges," said Josef Silverstein, an expert on Myanmar who is an emeritus professor of political science at Rutgers University.
It is still possible that the talks are just a ploy to make the government appear flexible in the hope that international sanctions will be eased and foreign aid from countries like Japan will begin to trickle in again.
The United States and Europe have been squeezing Myanmar for years with political pressure and sanctions. The United States has banned new business deals there by American companies and refuses visas to Myanmar government officials. The European Union has scaled back contacts with an Asian regional grouping that includes Myanmar.
They are responding to the quashing of a democratic movement that swelled in 1988 with a peaceful nationwide uprising. Thousands of people were killed in massacres by the military. 
Two years later, in a monumental miscalculation, the military held a parliamentary election in which Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won 88 percent of the seats. The junta quickly annulled the results and instituted an even more thorough political clampdown.
Late last year, it appeared that the government was determined to eliminate once and for all the National League for Democracy, jailing its members or forcing them to resign and isolating Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi from her supporters.
Now the government seems to have changed tack sharply. In its first substantive gesture, last month it released 85 members of the party who had been imprisoned during the last year. It is still believed to be holding as many as 1,700 political prisoners, including 35 people who were elected to Parliament in 1990.
The news has touched off a debate over whether the sanctions have caused this new softening.
If the talks are more than public relations, several factors may be at play, and economic pain appears to be chief among them. Myanmar's economy is a mismanaged shambles and getting worse, with inflation rising and the currency rapidly losing value, some of the last foreign investors pulling out and economic growth slowing to a crawl.
Monopolies run by the military and its cronies have skewed and sapped the economy. The World Bank recently described Myanmar as "trapped in abject poverty."
A European diplomat in Myanmar who has not supported sanctions said he had come to believe that they were decisive. One final straw, he said, was a recommendation last November by the International Labor Organization to its 175 member nations to reconsider doing business with Myanmar.
But other experts disagree.
"The difference in analyses is whether the sanctions were at the heart of the economic downturn and therefore of the willingness of the government to make concessions," said David I. Steinberg, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University, who visited Myanmar last month. "I say the sanctions played a minor part."
A parallel source of pressure has come from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the regional economic grouping that admitted Myanmar as a member in 1997 and has mostly pursued a policy of economic and political engagement.
The Asian financial crisis that same year dashed hopes in Myanmar for a surge in regional trade and investment. And the continuing political intransigence of the government has soured some of its neighbors on forging closer ties.
The push for a more flexible approach to the opposition may have come from Myanmar's strongest backer in the region, Malaysia, whose prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, visited early last month. Myanmar has become a liability to the 10-member Asean grouping, straining relations with Western nations and embarrassing the Malaysians who insisted on its admission.
More broadly, it may be that both sides, like a pair of exhausted boxers, are ready to seek a way out of their futile 12-year standoff.
Despite all its efforts, the military government is still reviled by much of the population, still struggling for legitimacy, beset by enemies on all sides, and by reported internal rifts.
It continues a seemingly endless battle against ethnic insurgencies and is so nervous about dissent that it has kept most universities closed for years.
The democratic opposition, ground down and unable to function openly, has won nothing, although it maintains high respect abroad and continues to draw young recruits into its ranks. It has come under increasing criticism for promoting sanctions and boycotts that have contributed to the hardships of the population and failed to force reforms.
A number of experts say that at least some members of the military government would like to compromise. The junta has said for years that it wants to shift to civilian government -- though these civilians may mostly be military men in suits. 
The trick is to find a way to loosen its grip without losing everything. The examples of Russia and Eastern Europe are not encouraging. And so the junta hangs on for dear life.
"Once you begin to pull that thread, the whole sweater can unravel," said Mr. Silverstein of Rutgers. "That's what the military is worried about."

HEADLINE: Architect of Bush Presidency Still Builds Bridges of Power 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE and FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Inside the White House Cabinet Room on Thursday evening, President Bush waited to receive Republican senators. But his guests were in no hurry. Just outside the door, there was something of a logjam because they wanted, first, to pay respects to the aide who is widely viewed as the principal architect of the Bush presidency: Karl Rove.
 "The line backed up because every one of them stopped and said, 'Hello,' " Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee said. "They know how important he is. Everybody knows that in terms of putting it all together, in terms of the politics, in terms of strategy positions and also policy, that Karl is the hub, the central node of activity that surrounds the presidency." 
 Many Republicans, some of them advisers to President Bush, say that although Mr. Rove, a political operative from Austin, Tex., has not worked in the capital for more than two decades, he has already created a profound sphere of influence here. He is proving that his role as a mastermind of Mr. Bush's political career did not stop at the Texas border. 
More than any other person in the Bush administration, Mr. Rove, who plotted Mr. Bush's run for the presidency and was his chief campaign strategist, has been the driving force in setting out how Mr. Bush spends each week, and even each day, including whom he sees and what he talks about.
Officially, Mr. Rove is the president's senior adviser, with purview over the offices of political affairs and public liaison. But he is also in charge of a new Office of Strategic Initiatives -- something of a research group in the White House -- and that role allows him to dive into almost every facet of the administration. "Basically, Karl Rove has carte blanche to stick his nose into anything he deems appropriate or necessary," Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist who worked on the campaign, said.
Mr. Rove is commanding attention as a new power in this town. Even as he arrived late for a recent interview over dinner at the Oval Room, a restaurant two blocks from the White House, he could be seen lingering on the sidewalk to conduct just a bit more business on his cell phone.
Once inside, Mr. Rove indulged in fried calamari (he never drinks) and reflected on his new role. He carried with him a binder titled "Long Term Planning Sessions," but refused to let reporters have even the quickest of peeks inside. He flashed a meeting card that showed a day crammed with meetings in the West Wing.
In a subsequent interview, Mr. Rove dismissed whispers among Republicans on Capitol Hill that he was, in the words of one, building "the Karl Rove empire." He groaned and said his response to that was "to laugh and chortle a little bit."
"Look," he said, "I work for the president and my immediate superiors are Josh Bolten, the deputy chief of staff, and Andy Card, the chief of staff." When he was asked if he truly had to get Mr. Card to sign off on things, his response fell short of a yes. "If I'm smart, I do. Listen, I do what I'm told."
It is true that Mr. Card has far more Washington seasoning than Mr. Rove does, and sees the president more often. Vice President Dick Cheney, of course, enjoys the president's deepest trust and has dealt with Washington power players far longer than Mr. Rove has.
And Karen P. Hughes, the president's counselor, oversees a fief that is larger than the 30 or so aides under Mr. Rove, and enjoys a firmer claim to the president's ear, say Bush advisers who call her probably his closest staff confidante. It was Ms. Hughes who was Mr. Bush's guest at the head table at the exclusive Alfalfa Club dinner in late January.
Even so, Mr. Rove, 50, is integrating himself into a broadened Bush political operation because he has succeeded in exerting influence in and outside the White House. He arrived in town with a vast network, having done direct mail work and other consulting for many Congressional campaigns. "Karl has one advantage over Andy and Karen, and that is that he is truly a strategic thinker," one prominent Republican said. "And he's as good as they are at operations, but better at strategic planning."
While others around Mr. Bush were distracted by the Florida recount and by planning their own moves to Washington, Mr. Rove plotted in daily detail the first five to six weeks of the Bush presidency, several administration officials said. The first week, they said, it was Mr. Rove who choreographed Mr. Bush's meetings with members of Congress, arranging that the Republican leadership come to the White House first, followed by the Democrats. It was Mr. Rove who suggested that Mr. Bush address a Democratic House retreat.
It was Mr. Rove's idea for the president to summon Democratic elders to the Oval Office on Mr. Bush's first Monday in office, they said. "It was Karl's sense that that would dramatize a sense of bipartisanship," one White House official said.
It was Mr. Rove, apparently, who urged the president to resist injecting his tax proposal with provisions pressed for by corporations. "Karl was the one who said, 'No, let's send this up exactly as it is,' " one prominent Republican official with close ties to the administration said.
It was Mr. Rove who intervened and persuaded Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican and an important player on health care issues, to back off from taking part in a news conference he had scheduled to announce a compromise he had developed on a patients' bill of rights. It was Mr. Rove and not Nicholas E. Calio, the White House Congressional liaison, who ran the strategy session at the White House on the matter.
Denying that he strong-armed Mr. Norwood, Mr. Rove said: "You can't squeeze Charlie Norwood. He is a person of enormous strength."
Mr. Rove, who inherited his office from Hillary Rodham Clinton, does not usually sit; he operates standing, from a tall reading desk. And his reach extends far beyond the White House.
He has become the administration's bridge to conservatives, economic and religious. He made calls assuring influential conservatives that Mr. Bush was not about to abandon John Ashcroft when his nomination as attorney general was under fire. He was involved in the effort to appease conservatives with Mr. Bush's executive order on abortion on his first full working day in the White House.
And he moved fast in helping create the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, an office that is an emblem of the compassionate conservative political philosophy that Mr. Rove, as much as anyone else, brought to Mr. Bush's attention years ago.
When Mr. Cheney had to cancel as the dinner speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday night, Mr. Rove agreed to step in.
"He didn't need to do it, because he's moving this weekend from Texas," said David A. Keene, the group's chairman. "He said he'd cancel his trip to Texas and be there because he thought it was important enough. Rove's role has been to really lock in the support that Bush, in the eyes of most conservatives, earned during the campaign." (Mr. Rove said that it did not make sense for him to fly to Austin when much of his house had already been packed.)
As part of his broader political portfolio, Mr. Rove essentially controls the Republican National Committee. It was at his behest that Mr. Bush installed Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia as the party chairman.
"Karl called and said, 'We think it would be a good thing to do if you'd like to do it,' " Mr. Gilmore recalled. "I presume that the idea sounded like a good one to Karl Rove or it probably wouldn't have occurred."
Republicans who know Mr. Rove said he has tried to make himself indispensable by being well informed and thinking ahead. His approach is to come to the table so prepared, and with so many suggestions, that he ends up having an imprint. Michael K. Deaver, who was President Ronald Reagan's image consultant, said Mr. Rove began seeking his advice two years ago on matters like "the importance of television and visuals."
White House officials said he planned the first days of the administration by assigning each of six staff members to research one of the past six presidents' first 100 days: how many news conferences they held, how many foreign trips they took, how many domestic trips they took. Each person produced a 10-page report, collected into a book Mr. Rove brought to the initial meeting on the first week of the Bush presidency.
The question about Mr. Rove, who is sometimes seen as an almost Pygmalion-like figure in Mr. Bush's life, is whether he can remain as powerful in an arena where he is competing more for the president's time -- and where his new strategic office has much potential but is undefined.
Mr. Rove sees the president just about every day, but not as instantaneously as during the campaign. "I'm impressed by how precious the president's time is," he said.
Asked about the danger that Mr. Rove and other aides will collide, Mr. Calio said, "You have to be careful. Inevitably, I think, we'll step on each other's toes -- but not maliciously."
A Republican operative who knows Mr. Rove well added, "There are enough checks and balances over there right now with seasoned Washington hands that he can't run roughshod and be the Austin cowboy." 
Yet while Mr. Rove usually tries to maintain a humble profile, at times he does not succeed. Some Bush advisers said that another side of Mr. Rove surfaced and he committed a subtle breach of Bush-world etiquette at an election post-mortem at the University of Pennsylvania last weekend, when he took responsibility -- and credit -- for many of the candidate's moves.
Mr. Rove also took the opportunity to flash his often disarming humor. He teased other Bush and Gore campaign officials there for getting paid -- and said he was bound by ethics rules. "You can't accept an honorarium," he said. "You can't accept expenses. You've got to pay for the transportation yourself. So I'm here, unlike the rest of your presenters, having paid every single nickel."
Just a few days earlier, as he relaxed with his wife, Darby, at the Oval Room, Mr. Rove savored how far he had come. Working in the White House, he said, was "awe-inspiring and humbling at the same time." Sometimes, Mr. Rove said, he thinks, "I'm going to wake up from a nap and MSNBC will be on and there will be another ruling from the Florida Supreme Court!"

HEADLINE: A Decade Beyond the Gulf War 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Soon after the 1991 Persian Gulf war came to an end, senior aides to President George Bush predicted that Saddam Hussein would be overthrown within six months. A decade later, much of the old Bush national security team is back in power -- and still trying to fashion a plan to contain the ambitions of the Iraqi leader. 
 The American and British air strikes carried out Friday against radar installations and antiaircraft sites near Baghdad will reduce the growing risk to pilots who patrol the southern no-flight zone. 
 And they also send the message that the administration of George W. Bush is determined to keep the pressure on Iraq -- even as Washington ponders its options. Since Iraq fired more surface-to-air missiles in January at American and British patrols than in all of last year, officials here say a riposte was necessary. 
But the Friday air strikes do not decisively change the military situation in the Persian Gulf or provide a guide for how the new Bush administration hopes finally to dispense with the man whose survival has haunted Washington for years.
The United States has been reasonably successful in containing Iraqi power. But it has yet to figure out how to oust Mr. Hussein, or compel him to allow unfettered United Nations weapons inspections. The latest high-tech air strikes are more of a signal than a strategy. 
President Bush and his aides are, of course, just at the beginning, still hammering out a new and, they say, more muscular Iraqi policy. There are no easy answers. 
Economic sanctions are already in place and could no doubt be more strictly enforced. But it will take considerable lobbying by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell just to maintain them in the face of France, Russia, Middle Eastern and Asian states who see business in Baghdad.
The new Bush administration seems to be pinning much of its hope on the Iraqi opposition, which will soon receive $29 million in aid. So far, the opposition has not amounted to much. No one in the American political or military establishment has the appetite for another war with Saddam Hussein that might settle things once and for all.
That leaves air strikes, already a well-tried option. In 1998, for example, the United States and Britain carried out a four-day raid, after United Nations weapons inspectors withdrew from Iraq in the face of Iraqi intransigence.
Standing alongside President Vicente Fox of Mexico on Friday, Mr. Bush called the air strike routine. In fact the attack, which involved two dozen strike aircraft firing missiles at targets close to Baghdad and approved at the highest levels of the American and British governments after careful planning, was anything but routine. But, with no quick fixes for its Iraq problem, the Bush administration is evidently wary of raising expectations at home or anxieties among nervous allies abroad.
"Operations such as the one last night would not be needed if Saddam stopped attacking us," Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said today. "But as long as he does, I will continue to take the steps necessary to protect our forces and to prevent Saddam from once again wreaking havoc, suffering and death." 
For now, Mr. Hussein may not even be America's most dangerous foe. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born extremist who is the FBI's most wanted terrorist suspect, has in recent years struck with more deadly effect at American interests, orchestrating the August 1998 bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa, and is suspected of being behind the bombing last October of the destroyer Cole in Yemen.
Saddam Hussein, in contrast, is confined within his country, visibly defiant, seemingly determined to preserve some modicum of Iraq's programs for developing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons -- and apparently interested in shooting down an American or British pilot. 
That Mr. Hussein has held onto power for so long is a testimony to the ruthless way in which he runs Iraqi society. While the first Bush administration never explicitly set his ouster as an objective in the 1991 conflict, American military planners did what they could to loosen his grip on power. American warplanes and missiles struck his bunkers, intelligence services and political apparatus in the hope that his rule would be shattered. But he hung on without major internal challenges.
In one of history's perhaps more curious twists, the senior Mr. Bush's administration relaxed the military pressure against Mr. Hussein at a time when it was in the best position to squeeze the Iraqi leader.
Concerned in 1991 that the American military would be portrayed by the media as piling on in a one-sided rout, the Bush administration halted the ground war at 100 hours, a move that allowed much of the Republican Guard in Iraq, the most effective and loyal force in Mr. Hussein's military, to escape.
Nor did the Bush administration rush to impose a no-flight zone in southern Iraq when Shiite rebels were attacked by Iraqi helicopters in the wake of the gulf war. The senior Mr. Bush did not declare a southern no-flight zone until August 1992, some 18 months after the end of the war. 
Officials in that administration later explained that they were initially wary of establishing an air-exclusion zone in the south to parallel the one they set up in northern Iraq in 1991 to protect the Kurds. A second no-flight zone, officials initially worried, might entangle the United States in an Iraqi civil war or encourage the breakup of Iraq, which Bush strategists saw as a counterweight to Iran.
Having put the world on notice that it has the will to keep the pressure on Iraq, the new Bush team faces the task of explaining its broader strategy, particularly when General Powell visits the Middle East later this month.
President Bush, however, is not the only one to make Iraq the target of his first major military action. President Clinton's first military strike was also against Iraq: a June 1993 attack in which 23 cruise missiles were fired at an intelligence headquarters in Baghdad.
Mr. Clinton ordered the strike in retaliation for an assassination attempt against George W. Bush's father, which Mr. Hussein was accused of sponsoring. General Powell is familiar with that attack as well. He was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time and delivered the Pentagon briefing on the raid.

HEADLINE: Pardon Is Trouble for Clinton Library 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
It seems fitting somehow. Bill Clinton's presidential library, which will be charged with telling the story of a presidency compromised by self-infliction, is now itself caught in a storm created by Mr. Clinton's own hand.
 Because of the last-minute pardon granted by Mr. Clinton to Marc Rich, and the subsequent revelation that Mr. Rich's former wife, Denise Rich, contributed $450,000 toward building the $200 million complex here, the library's fund-raising practices are now at the center of a Congressional investigation. 
 On Tuesday, the House Committee on Government Reform, led by Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, subpoenaed records of all contributions and pledges of more than $5,000 to the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation. The foundation, the fund-raising arm for the library that is led by Mr. Clinton's longtime friend Skip Rutherford, has until noon on Thursday to respond.
The Congressional demand presents the foundation with a lose-lose proposition. 
If it responds to the subpoena, it would break its pledge to contributors who were guaranteed anonymity unless they chose to publicize their gifts. Some, Mr. Rutherford said, prefer anonymity because they are publicity shy, while some want to avoid solicitation by other groups.
By revealing its donors, the foundation would set a precedent that could make anonymous donors think twice before opening their checkbooks to all manner of charities. And it would set off inquiries by Congressional Republicans and journalists, who would scrutinize the foundation's records for evidence that donors were granted presidential favors.
But if the foundation refused to comply, it could be cited for contempt of Congress and drawn into a lengthy court battle. And the foundation would create an impression that it and Mr. Clinton had something to hide.
Mr. Rutherford, the volunteer president of the board, is clearly exasperated by the choice facing the foundation, which has among its board members Terry McAuliffe, the newly elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Ann Jordan, the wife of Mr. Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. Now, Mr. Rutherford can only joke about the former president's propensity for complicating the lives of his friends.
"Given my over-25-year friendship with him, why would I expect it to be easy?" he asked in an interview. "It's like the movie 'Jaws.' Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water." 
The Congressional subpoena is not the only headache afflicting the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Center. It is the subject of two lawsuits, each challenging the City of Little Rock's role in buying and clearing the land for the center, on 27.7 acres of dilapidated riverfront. 
One lawsuit challenges the city's decision to finance the $16.5 million land deal with revenue bonds, which did not require a referendum, and to pay off the bonds with fees from the city zoo and golf course. The other objects to the city's use of its eminent domain powers to condemn land needed for the library project. The city won both cases in the lower courts but both are being appealed to the state Supreme Court.
Mr. Rutherford also heard plenty of grumbling from Arkansans when it was revealed last week that the library foundation was planning to spend $300,000 to subsidize the $738,700 taxpayer expense of renting a New York office for Mr. Clinton in Carnegie Hall Tower.
Mr. Rutherford argued that because Mr. Clinton would be based in New York, it was appropriate for the foundation to help him conduct its work there. That did not go down easily at home.
"When you hear about it from your wife, your children and people at the Central High School ballgame, you realize it was an issue that people have concerns about," he said.
Mr. Rutherford said he hoped that Mr. Clinton's decision to seek less expensive office space in Harlem would make foundation money unnecessary. As a prominent public relations executive in Little Rock, Mr. Rutherford has constructed an interesting spin about the travails of Mr. Clinton and the library project: they will be good for business.
"Controversy for presidential libraries is a gold mine," he told a Chamber of Commerce leadership forum today. "It's the dull libraries that have trouble," he said.
One of his listeners could not resist a dry comeback: "You must be pretty happy." 
With nearly 77 million pages of documents, 75,000 artifacts and 1.8 million photographs, the Clinton library will house the largest collection of any presidential archive. And given the foundation's $200 million fund-raising goal, it probably will be the most expensive of the country's 12 presidential libraries.
Mr. Rutherford declined today to discuss the size and number of donations to the foundation or to say how much of the fund-raising goal had been pledged. He said the foundation's troubles had not yet hurt fund-raising, and speculated that they might encourage Clinton loyalists to give even more.
An estimated $100 million is to be spent on the library, a bridgelike structure designed by James Stewart Polshek to extend over the banks of the Arkansas River. The design includes a 5,000-square-foot penthouse for the Clintons.
The rest of the money could be used to create an endowment, landscape a surrounding park, rehabilitate a railroad bridge, help establish a school of public service affiliated with the University of Arkansas and create a retreat out of a house in Hot Springs that once belonged to Mr. Clinton's uncle.
City leaders expect the library to anchor a vibrant River Market district that is already attracting galleries and restaurants. They estimate its direct economic impact at $12 million a year and say that the planned library has already lured several significant developments to downtown.
Depending on the resolution of the lawsuits, ground could be broken late this year, with the center's opening projected for 2004. About 625 tons of archival material were flown from Washington to Little Rock on eight C-5 transport planes between November and late January, said David Alsobrook, an experienced presidential archivist who is directing the processing of the Clinton materials. The records are being stored in a former Oldsmobile dealership that has been converted into a temporary archive. 
Boxes holding the documents are stacked 10-high in secure, climate-controlled rooms. One room is crowded with crates bearing gifts to Mr. Clinton, including 14,000 books. Mr. Alsobrook has put a sampling of the gifts on display, including a mother-of-pearl rendition of "The Last Supper" given by Yasir Arafat and a mosaic of Rome's Colosseum given by Pope John Paul II. Then there is the dancing Elvis Presley telephone, donor unidentified. 
By federal law, none of the records will be open to researchers for five years, except for records relating to the failed Clinton health care proposal that have already been made available. The full processing of the papers will not be completed for generations. 
"It won't be in my lifetime," Mr. Alsobrook said, "and some of the younger archivists who just started will be retired from the government by the time it's finished. We've never had this much material."

HEADLINE: Writers Strike May Not Be Inevitable 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The Writers Guild of America has been sequestered for four weeks in talks with the major studios and television networks, allowing a gradual, creeping sense of optimism to build in Hollywood that perhaps, just perhaps, a settlement may yet be reached to forestall long-dreaded dual strikes this summer by the industry's writers and actors.
 Initially, John Wells, the guild's president, said that the writers would only negotiate for two weeks, unless significant progress was being made. Without such progress, he said, talks would be halted until closer to the expiration of the contract with producers on May 1. 
 Under a news blackout, few concrete details have emerged. But now that the talks have extended into a third week and a fourth, a strike which many had come to see as a fait accompli has begun to lose some of its air of inevitability. 
Some of those involved in the talks late this week began to rain -- ever so lightly -- on that parade, putting out the word that while progress was being made, the gap between the two sides remained huge.
"I hear they're putting on a good face, but they're making no significant progress," said Mark Gordon, the producer of "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Patriot." "A lot of people are going to get hurt very badly in this thing. The trickle-down effect will be unbelievable."
Of course, there was no way to know how much of this nouvelle pessimism was a sincere attempt to dampen expectations and how much the usual brand of brinkmanship that inevitably flows out of labor talks as they approach a climax.
The two sides exchanged proposals on some of the key economic issues in the strike last week and decided to spend the three-day holiday weekend studying them before meeting on Tuesday, in separate caucus groups, to discuss their reactions.
A strike by the 11,000 members of the guild, especially if followed by a walkout of the 135,000 actors affiliated with the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, would almost certainly cause large cutbacks throughout the entertainment industry as production on new films and television programs ground to a halt. 
The Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation estimates that more than a quarter-million people work in the entertainment industry in Southern California, but that figure does not account for the other businesses, like restaurants that cater to those Hollywood workers.
Studio officials said last week that recent estimates by the development corporation of a strike's impact -- about $250 million a week in direct impact and $257 million in additional, indirect impact -- were pretty much on the money, if not conservative.
Film production has been proceeding at a frantic pace for six months, with actors and crews ricocheting from one project to another.
"What happened is that the writers guild managed to convince everyone that they were serious this time about going out on strike," said one studio executive. "So for the first time, everyone got organized and got ready for it. And now the producers are trying to make it clear that they're serious about weathering a strike, too."
The contract talks between the writers guild, which represents most of Hollywood's screen and television writers, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios and networks, began on Jan. 22 at the guild's glass-lined offices overlooking the farmers' market here.
The talks have been split into two groups, one discussing economic issues and the other so-called creative rights issues.
Writers, who have increasingly chafed under what they see as their second-class status in the filmmaking world, have demanded such concessions as a guarantee that they will be intimately included in the making of their films, including visits to the sets. They also want significant cutbacks in the use of the "film by" credit, which originally was meant to go to the most accomplished, veteran directors but in recent years has gone to untested first-timers as well. 
People with knowledge of what has been discussed in the talks, from both sides, say that compromises on these issues have been discussed.
One was to change contract language to make clear that writers are automatically invited to visit a film's set unless specifically not invited by the studio
Another was to grandfather the "film by" credit so that any director who has thus far received one would continue to do so, but future directors would need to meet some set criteria, like winning an Oscar or racking up a sizable total at the box-office, before joining the club.
While such creative-rights issues -- with their whiff of Hollywood ego run amok -- have dominated much of the early discussion about the talks, most believe that, in the end, the economic issues will be decisive.
The crux appears to be residuals, the money paid to writers for subsequent use of their films or television programs, whether in reruns, on videocassette and DVD, on pay television, in foreign markets or on the Internet.
Part of the issue is the wide array of formulas for determining different types of residuals -- five for motion pictures and seven for television, and that does not include the Internet, for which there is no residual formula as yet.
Concerning sale of material to foreign countries, for instance, the formula, negotiated when foreign sales were relatively minuscule, involves a series of payments based on a percentage of the minimum salary in the writer's guild contract. Now, after years of explosive growth in foreign sales, the guild wants a larger share of the additional revenues.
In videocassettes and DVD's, the guild wants higher residuals reflecting lowered manufacturing costs.
Studio officials say such demands fail to account for the increasing costs of producing movies, which have made the film business riskier than ever and have collapsed profit margins. The added money from those foreign markets and DVD's is needed to bolster sagging margins, they contend.
If the talks falter, attention will shift immediately to the actors' negotiations. The Screen Actors Guild's contract with the studios and networks runs out on June 30, but the union has yet to begin its negotiations, or even to choose its lead negotiator.

HEADLINE: Patents; 
In health emergencies, Brazil allows the copying of drugs, to the dismay of American companies.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand; Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
COUNTLESS pharmacies serve the nearly 20 million people living in this enormous city, including a chain called Drogeria Sao Paulo that features 24-hour franchises nestled next to all-night gas stations. Inside one of those drug stores on Vincenzo Rao Street, a large red and white sign hanging from the ceiling declares: "We have generics. Look at our list." An arrow points down to a six-page list printed from a Web site and propped on a counter display. 
 Generic drugs are crucial to the many poor and working class people in this urban sprawl, and the list is meant to help them find what they need. It provides the generic names of drugs, their corresponding brand name and identity of the original manufacturer, the name of the Brazilian pharmaceutical producing the generic, and whether it is generally dispensed at a hospital or pharmacy. 
 Here, however, the pharmacist and his assistant dispense generic drugs without asking for a prescription, and at a fraction of what the same brand-name medicine might cost in the United States.
There was a time when the drugs would probably have been outright knock-offs of American or European medications. Before 1996, drugs could not be patented in Brazil, so local manufacturers were free to replicate them. Even now, patent law in Brazil covers only those drugs invented since May 1997.
But Brazilian law now gives inventors exclusive rights for 20 years, protects drug inventions still in the development pipeline and brings Brazil into line with the World Trade Organization treaty called TRIPS, or Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, a requirement for all W.T.O. members before 2006. And it settles most of a long-running dispute with the United States that at one point looked like it might lead to sanctions against Brazil.
But five years after the Brazilian law was enacted, irritations between the United States and Brazil persist. It is a continuation of the struggle between Western pharmaceutical companies and public health advocates over who has the right to produce and market life-saving drugs. And AIDS has sharpened the point of this battle in countries like Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa.
The 1996 Brazilian law says that to maintain a patent, an owner must make use of his technology in Brazil, and it makes clear that importing a product into the country is not enough to satisfy this requirement. American pharmaceutical companies complain that the requirement violates the W.T.O. treaty, and they have asked the trade body to intervene. They have also asked that Brazil be placed on a United States government watch list that is usually a first step toward sanctions.
To make matters worse for the giant American drug makers, in 1999 Brazil's president decreed that his government could license patents in case of a national emergency. Other countries, including the United States, have such a government-decree provision; in the United States it is often used in antitrust cases, when the courts order a company to share its technology to break up a monopoly.
The Brazilian decree has been exercised to ensure affordable access to AIDS medications. American companies object to the decree because it requires patent holders to turn over the secrets of their inventions if an emergency is declared to government officials and local manufacturers which might then produce the drugs.
American drug companies already lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year to product knock-offs and patent infringement. And they do not want to make piracy any easier. They also say only 3 of 10 new drugs prove successful, and the cost of developing all 10 are such that they cannot drop prices on the few that hit big. Instead, they have to earn back the costs of research, which the industry puts at $500 million per new drug, as well as the cost of marketing and lobbying, while leaving something for profits. 
Patents confer on those companies the right to charge whatever they choose for drugs they spent so much time and money to develop. But critics complain that they charge too much for crucial drugs and leave millions of sick people in poorer nations without medications. Intense international pressure in recent years had led to plans to give away doses of drugs to poor nations, and set up funds to purchase AIDS medicines and develop new ones.
Brazil, the largest market for American drugs in South America, is hardly a wild outpost of intellectual property. The country has had a patent law since 1809, when it became the fourth nation to adopt such legislation, and that law became part of Brazil's Constitution in 1824. But Brazilian patent law has always differed from United States law. In the early 1800's, patent applications could be rejected because the inventions were considered too complicated for laborers in Brazil's then overwhelmingly slave work force.
Brazilian patent law is based on the first-to-file principal, meaning whoever first applies for a patent will be its owner if it is granted. The United States operates on the first-to-invent rule, awarding patents only to the proven original inventor. Unlike American patent law, Brazilian patent law does not allow patents for inventions based on laws of nature or biological material, mathematical theories or works of art. And unlike United States law, it also excludes commercial or financial schemes, computer programs, the presentation of information, medical or surgical methods, the human genome, or rules of games. 
Brazilian law also allows authorities to reject a valid invention if it is morally offensive, or violates customs, public order or public health. The latter may be the central issue in what remains of the intellectual property battle between Brazil and the United States. 
The Brazilian law says a national emergency might arise from a threat to the public's health or nutrition, the environment, or the country's social, economic or technological development. American pharmaceutical makers say that leaves the door open for Brazil to decide that high drug prices are a "public interest" issue, and use that as a basis for awarding patent licenses.
And they are unhappy about the part of the 1999 decree that states that a patent owner must "transmit the necessary and sufficient information for the effective reproduction of the protected object, and other technical and commercial aspects applicable to the case."
In defending the decree, Brazil has only to point to its successful AIDS treatment program, in which the government has made generic medications available free of charge to anyone who is H.I.V.-positive. The ambitious program has made Brazil a showcase in the fight against AIDS and a model for countries. It has driven down both drug prices and deaths from AIDS. 
But the program's success has been possible only because of the very laws that American drug companies fear most: Brazil began copying expensive AIDS drugs patented abroad before 1997, when its new law went into effect. And declaring a national health emergency, it has been licensing AIDS drug patents awarded since then to government laboratories, which make generics for the free drug program.

HEADLINE: Some Hard Lessons For Online Grocer 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: FOSTER CITY, Calif. 

 BODY:
For anyone setting out to revolutionize the grocery business using the Internet, here's a tip, courtesy of Webvan, which has spent $1 billion so far trying to do just that.
 Do not bother putting a 100-foot-long computerized lazy susan in the freezer case, even though it can let one person load 8,000 types of items into one order without taking a step. At 20 degrees below zero, the thing turns so slowly that you are better off having workers jog through the freezer with shopping carts pulling items off shelves. 
 Here is another of Webvan's hard-earned lessons. If you figure your revolution will cost $2.5 billion, better get all the money up front. No matter how hot investors are for the idea one day, there is no telling when their pockets will be as tough to open as a frozen turkey. 
With the $1.2 billion it has raised, Webvan is the second-biggest online retailing bet after Amazon.com. But delivering groceries right to the kitchen counter is far more complex than sending books out by U.P.S. And Webvan, as the only major player still standing in the online supermarket field, is finding out there is a lot to learn when you are trying to change everything about the grocery business -- an entrenched bricks-and-mortar industry that earns razor-thin margins on half a trillion dollars year in sales. 
Debugging the mechanical devices and the computers that run them has been hard enough. But even harder has been changing consumer grocery-shopping behavior.
In San Francisco, the company's first market, 6.5 percent of the area's households have ordered from Webvan. That is great for the first year and half, but more than half never placed a second order. The system is so expensive to run that the company says it needs annual sales in the region of more than $125 million a year to break even, and so far it has reached only two-thirds of that.
Webvan's biggest problem, though, is that it is going to run out of money before it has time to see if it can solve the others. With operations in 10 cities, the company has been burning through $100 million in cash a quarter, and it only has $212 million left. Webvan missed its key goal of turning a profit in its first market, San Francisco, by the end of September 2000. And the investors are not going to put up any more cash until it does.
"If you had asked me two years ago, does this dot-com thing make any sense, I would have said, no, the bubble will burst," said George Shaheen, who left his $4-million-a-year job running Andersen Consulting, now known as Accenture, to become chief executive of Webvan in 1999. "But I didn't have any idea of the blood bath that would ensue."
But analysts say Webvan, based in this Silicon Valley city, has been tripped up as much by its own grandiosity as by the market. It bet on a highly complex and expensive automated distribution system. And it set out to enter 26 cities long before it had proved that its model worked.
"They needed to operate in one market, get their model perfect and show they could have a positive cash flow," said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. "No one has ever gone public with a national rollout with zero markets performing to plan."
Suddenly, all of the grandiosity is gone from Webvan. Its programmers are no longer developing the kitchen of the future and are just trying to build electronic coupon systems that can increase sales in the present. It has long abandoned plans to enter 26 cities in three years, and now will not even open the $35 million warehouses it has already built in Glen Burnie, Md., and North Bergen, N.J. With these pullbacks and several rounds of layoffs, if everything goes according to the company's plan, it will end the year with $1 million in the bank.
But that may not be enough. Webvan's shares are trading for 34 cents each, down 99 percent from their high, valuing the company at less than the cash it has in the bank. Nasdaq has moved to suspend trading in Webvan shares, as it does for all companies with stocks consistently below $1. But Webvan figures that if it cannot improve its business improve enough so that its shares rebound, the delisting will be the least of its problems.
Indeed, if Webvan fails, it will be far and away the biggest financial disaster the Internet has yet seen. Investors, including Benchmark Capital, Sequoia Capital, Goldman, Sachs and CBS, pumped $793 million into Webvan. Another equally prestigious group put $430 million into HomeGrocer, the Seattle-based rival Webvan bought last year.
What is amazing in retrospect is that all that money was invested with almost no research into whether consumers would want its service. Its founder, Louis Borders, the reclusive mathematician who had started the bookstore chain that bears his name, focused exclusively on building the complex inventory management and distribution system.
Mr. Borders believed simply, said Mr. Shaheen, that "if we build it they will come." (Mr. Borders, who resigned last week from Webvan's board, declined requests for comment.)
There certainly were examples of people who had already tried to build online grocery delivery services. In every case, very few customers came.
Kroger, for example, ran an online shopping service in Columbus, Ohio, for five years with the long-struggling Internet company Peapod. "We had a core group of customers that loved it, but so few of them you could know them all on a first-name basis," said Rodney McMullen, Kroger's executive vice president for strategy. "A lot more customers tell you they want to use it than actually use it. It turns out that customers enjoy shopping and in any case they aren't good enough at planning to shop on the Internet." 
But Mr. Borders was convinced he could do what predecessors could not by offering more items at lower prices with far better service. Most significant, Webvan promised to arrive within 30 minutes of its promised time while Peapod and others specified only a two-hour delivery window.
Mr. Borders found support for his idea from David Beirne, a headhunter turned venture capitalist with Benchmark Capital, the brash Silicon Valley firm that had backed eBay, the online auction company. Mr. Beirne was a leading advocate of the "go big or go home" philosophy of Internet investing. And even now Mr. Beirne defends Webvan's breakneck pace.
"It's easy to say, 'Man, you could have done a few less markets,' " he said last week. "But there was a Catch-22. There was a unique opportunity to raise a huge amount of capital in the public market so we could build a business far faster than Sam Walton rolled out Wal-Mart. But to raise the money, you had to get above the noise level, build a brand name and make big promises to investors."
What was more, he said, the company feared that if it did not move first, competitors would outrun it. Indeed, in addition to the struggling grocery pioneers, Peopod and Streamline in Boston, Amazon.com and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the prestigious venture firm, were backing HomeGrocer.
This created an arms race mentality on both sides.
"We had every investment banker and financial commentator pushing us to go further and faster than we were really comfortable," said J. Terrence Drayton, the founder of HomeGrocer. "They assured us that money was available in unending supply."
Last summer, as the market for Internet stocks began to slide, HomeGrocer agreed to be bought by Webvan.
The competition now looks much tamer, as several Web-based food delivery services have folded, including Streamline, Shoplink and Urban Fetch. Peapod has been transformed to the online affiliate of the store chains controlled by the Dutch company Royal Ahold. Most of the major supermarket chains have tiny pilot delivery projects that they do not intend to expand any time soon.
To some of HomeGrocer's backers, its sale was a frustrating turn of events because its model -- which relied on cheaper, less automated warehouses -- appears to be more in line with the realities of the market.
"We were bigger, doing better in the marketplace and were a lot closer to being profitable," said one of HomeGrocer's early investors, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "But Webvan spoiled it by telling such a big story to Wall Street. Now the business is on the verge of going away."
Webvan executives say that in retrospect HomeGrocer's design for $10 million warehouses was smarter than its $35 million wonders.
"If I were going to start over again, I would go with an infrastructure that would allow us to serve a market and add features as it grows," said Robert Swan, Webvan's president. 
But the company has little time for recriminations and has to run as much business as possible through its existing operations.
In San Francisco, for example, the warehouse was built to handle 8,000 orders a day, which would be more than 3 percent of the region's total grocery sales. To break even in 15 months according to plan, the company needed 3,300 orders a day. The average order size and average profit margin have been higher than the company expected, so it only needs 3,000 orders to break even. But as of the end of last year, it was only handling 2,150 daily orders.
Webvan has cut costs by imposing a $4.95 delivery fee on orders under $75. And it now will only promise an hour-long range of delivery times. (That is still giving consumers too good a deal, say Webvan's rivals at traditional supermarket chains.)
It is capitalizing on underutilized daytime capacity by going after the office market, delivering lunch platters and stationery supplies.
And most of all, Webvan must convince its existing customers, who only order 1.8 times a calendar quarter, to shop with it more often. It is stepping up its e-mail marketing, especially at its core audience -- busy mothers with children. And it is adding the products those customers want most. (In California, that means organic produce.)
Even though Webvan's prices matched its local rivals, some customers did not feel they were getting a good deal because the company did not accept coupons, and it did not offer the large economy packs of diapers and paper towels. (They took up too much space in the automated warehouse system.) As space is not Webvan's problem now, it has added lots of economy packages and a new electronic coupons system, too.
Relying on all this, a new ad campaign, a new loyalty reward program and perhaps no small measure of hope, Webvan has now told investors it will break even in San Francisco in the third quarter and in Los Angeles (HomeGrocer's biggest market) by the end of the year.
After looking for money last year, Webvan's board has decided to wait to see if the company can hit its revised profitability targets before seeking a new infusion. There is more than a little brinkmanship in this approach. But board members argue that letting the gas tank run almost to empty is both prudent and a great way to focus the company on efficiency.
"You either prove the model works, or you don't prove it," said James Barksdale, the former Netscape chief executive who had backed HomeGrocer and joined the Webvan board after its acquisition. "Necessity is the mother of invention."
This year's inventions must work flawlessly because it is too frigid to learn from any more mistakes.
"If we break even in two of our major markets, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be quality financing available to us," Mr. Shaheen said. "If we don't, I don't think the future is very bright. There is not a lot of forgiveness left."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: METS NOTEBOOK; 
Shades of 2000, Wilpon Has High Expectations

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon was having a very good day. His golden retriever, Lefty, was chasing a ball around a practice field. Judy, his wife, and Sandy Koufax, his best friend for the past 50 years, were here. His manager and general manager are locked into new contracts and his team is the National League champion.
 So Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, decided to do it again. For the second year in a row, he said he expected the Mets to win the pennant. 
 "We start every year with high expectations," Wilpon said today. "I don't think I could have stood here and said we would expect to be in the World Series in '80 or '81. But this year, yeah, I think that our expectation is that we play well enough to get into the World Series."
The reality of the game, Wilpon said, is that things change during a season and impact trades are usually made. But after an off-season in which the Mets failed to make a high-profile addition, Wilpon said he still believed the current team could get back to the World Series.
"I think our team is good enough now to compete and be the National League winner," he said.
Wilpon -- who pointed out the need for a left-handed No. 3 hitter but said the Giants' Barry Bonds is "not even on our radar screen" -- said he was surprised the Mets had not landed a premier player after pursuing so many this winter. But, Wilpon said, the team did everything it could while staying fiscally responsible.
"We didn't have a chance for some of the guys, because they had a predetermined preference to be elsewhere," Wilpon said, referring specifically to the left-hander Mike Hampton, who left the Mets to sign with Colorado.
Wilpon said the Mets were still discussing their stadium proposal with city officials and he was hopeful of reaching an agreement during Rudolph W. Giuliani's tenure as mayor. And while the plan of his co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, to refurbish Shea Stadium instead is "a valid thought," Wilpon said, "you can't renovate it so it is economically viable."

Words of Wisdom
Sandy Koufax, the Hall of Fame Dodgers pitcher, who sometimes visits the Mets' camp, gave a lengthy tutorial to the new Mets right-hander Rick Croushore. Koufax worked alongside the Mets' new pitching coach, Charlie Hough, a friend and a former Dodger.
"There's a best way to throw, and there's another way to pitch," Koufax said. "The best way to throw isn't always the best way to pitch. You can make a guy throw better, but all of a sudden, the ball's straight and he can't get anybody out. You've got to work with a guy's strengths."
Koufax said the strike zone was never very high. "I've never really seen the strike zone change as much as everyone talks about it," he said. "I think pitchers have always had the outside corner. You take away the outside corner, it's going to be an ugly thing."

Shinjo Is Impressive
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine saw outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo take batting practice for the first time today, and he liked what he saw.
"The ball jumps off his bat and seems to carry to the fences very easily," Valentine said. "It's a very easy swing."
Another reserve outfielder, the veteran Darren Bragg, also reported today. Bragg, who is from Waterbury, Conn., wore No. 56 for most of his career in honor of the former football Giants great Lawrence Taylor, but he dropped it because of Taylor's legal problems. Now, hoping to reverse his luck after a dismal year with Colorado, Bragg is wearing No. 56 again.

Off to a Good Start
The Mets raised ticket prices this year, but they set a record today for the first day of ticket sales. The team sold 105,000 individual game tickets and announced that the three-game series with the Yankees in June is sold out.

HEADLINE: City in a Mouse's Pocket Tries to Move Beyond Its Small World 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Perhaps nowhere more than in this playground city has an economy so successfully been built on making people believe in make-believe. Now, however, it is the computer wizardry and engineering brainpower behind all those laser shows and thrill rides that the city wants to show off.
 Orlando, a place where people think Disney, not digital, is trying to diversify beyond tourism into the high-technology industry. Partly, the city fears that a slowing economy could cut ticket sales at its theme parks. Partly, there is a general sense among local officials and economic development experts that the city has long been too reliant on the lower-paying jobs of the service sector. And some people are simply tired of the Mickey Mouse jokes whenever they mention microchips. 
 At a recent trade show, executives from Digital Owl, an Orlando company that designs Web pages and electronic security technology for online book publishers, found themselves answering questions not so much about what they operate as where.
"We had people coming up to our booth and saying, 'You guys are from where?' " said Matt Gomez, the marketing communications director at Digital Owl. "Next, they'd say, 'Are you owned by Disney?' So we have to get around that."
To do just that on a broader scale, the city and surrounding Orange County have developed a strategy to strengthen the economic base here with high-skilled, high-wage jobs that they hope to create by attracting more technology businesses. As part of the strategy, the city dispatched some of its high-technology success stories to road shows intended to attract heads of venture capital firms who usually visit the city only on vacation. Orlando also gives tax breaks and other incentives to technology companies that move or expand here. And the Economic Development Commission of Mid-Florida, a partnership of government and business, has committed $17.5 million to marketing the city's technology base and vastly expanding it.
The goal is to add more than 18,000 mostly technology-related jobs over the next four years and to increase by $1.35 billion the amount of payroll local companies generate. One reason is that service jobs in Orlando's hotels, theme parks and tourist shops may be plentiful, but for most of the last decade have not necessarily been profitable, according to Commerce Department figures and local experts on economic development. In that time, per capita income in Orlando grew by 4.2 percent, lagging slightly behind the 4.6 percent national average, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
"We grew dramatically but at a high preponderance of service-sector jobs," said Darrell Kelley, president of the Economic Development Commission, which represents four counties in central Florida. "We need to do a better job of creating high-value jobs, which is analogous with high tech." 
There have been some takers already. Milcom Technologies, a sort of incubator for high-tech startups, has created nine such companies in Orlando in its three years in business, and those firms now collectively employ more than 350 people. 
In 1995, Cirent Semiconductor, Orlando's crown jewel of high-tech, invested more than $700 million to expand and created 700 new jobs. And Digital Owl and a handful of other homegrown upstarts are beginning to secure venture capital from companies that once overlooked Florida.
Ask any adult here not wearing mouse ears and he will say that part of Orlando's problem is the good job it does of hiding its technology.
"If people come and are wowed by my technology, then they wouldn't be wowed by my shows," said Marc Watson, a Universal Studios creative director. "But the entertainment industry draws people to Orlando because we are using the most compelling technology we have."
The challenge now is to build on Orlando's existing technology base, according to a recent study of the technology industry here commissioned by the city and county. "Though Metro Orlando may be one of the most highly marketed regions in the world," the study concluded, "the current message is not targeted to high-tech companies."
To be sure, the city is in a position to do some name-dropping. It is home to the defense giant Lockheed Martin Electronics and Missiles and has businesses that develop products and services for industries like wireless communications, microelectronics and aerospace.
"I don't think people realize how deep high-tech goes here," said Kirstie Chadwick, chief executive of Digital Owl. "Disney has done their magic and overshadowed it."
Even Orlando's biggest advocates acknowledge that for the high-tech industry, moving out of the shadow will not be easy. One concern, some say, is that tourism will always command the bulk of the local resources.
"Local leaders seem to be willing to support tourism but less willing to support the high-tech industry," said Rick Foglesong, a political science professor at Rollins College here.
While the county has given $24 million in tax breaks and other financial incentives to high-tech firms in the last five years, it committed a combined $103 million for two highway interchange projects to support new Disney and Universal Studios attractions, Mr. Foglesong said. 
Those behind the diversification say the criticism is unfair, noting that Disney is the county's largest taxpayer and that the entertainment industry employs most of the workers here and pumps $19.7 billion annually into the economy, compared with $8.7 billion from technology.
"I believe the leadership in metro Orlando supports both industries and realizes the importance of diversifying our economy," Mayor Glenda Hood said. "Tourism relies heavily on technology. The two fit together nicely."
City officials and promoters resent any hint of an us-against-them mentality in envisioning a city dominated by both tourism and high tech.
"You cannot build a community by tearing down any economic sector of the community, certainly not your largest economic sector," said Bill Peeper, president of the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
"This to me is a logical evolution of a community that does not want to sit on its laurels," Mr. Peeper said. "If we were so content just to be a tourism destination, I'd be worried."

HEADLINE: Beneath New Surface, an Undertow 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Vivian Cabey stood on the stone porch of 60 West 129th Street, collecting her breath and her children after a bruising day at work. On this fall night, darkness had reached the block before she had, and ominous shadows played around her.
 Like Stygian guides, young men flitted in and out of the building with crackheads in tow. Mrs. Cabey barked that she would beat them or call the police. They kowtowed -- "You know we respect you more than anyone on the block, Mrs. Cabey" -- but the traffic continued. 
 Inside the building, graffiti had been lathered on. The cold had settled in the halls as if it had nowhere else to go. The stairwells were lightless. Up through seven stories, abandoned apartments were strewn with rubble and the detritus of a hundred house parties. In one empty room a child's decals still clung to the walls. For Mrs. Cabey, her children and grandchildren, this building was home. 
It had been so for seven years, more than two without heat or hot water. As Mrs. Cabey prepared for her third winter of plugging in electric heaters, the building was making her ever more nervous. The block on which the building sat, 129th Street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues in Harlem, gnawed at her even more. Over the years, its darker side, its underworld, had ensnared her children.
She could see, from where she stood, construction workers restoring the block's buildings. She could see white people moving in. She could see a new army of workers forged by stricter welfare laws, could see the signs trumpeting the block association's revival. 
So many signs of change -- but in Mrs. Cabey's life, there had barely been change at all. Her family, like many here, lived with, and was shaped by, the same circumstances that had long straitened lives on the block: a thriving drug trade, weak schools, early motherhood and the struggles of a single mother to care and provide for her children.
She saw the block as it still was at night, full of action and danger. She saw it as it had been when The New York Times last chronicled life on 129th Street, in 1994, when its troubles loomed large. 
In the years since, 17 buildings on the block have been rehabilitated. Shrinking welfare rolls and the expanding economy have sent dozens more residents into the work force. The falloff in the crack trade and new policing tactics have reduced violent crime. The high prices of real estate elsewhere in Manhattan, and conscious social planning, have brought black lawyers, white artists, African entrepreneurs and more to 129th Street, economically and racially integrating a block that had been almost all black, and mostly poor. 
But, like Mrs. Cabey, many on the block have felt unaffected. What is newly in sight, be it the property for sale or the $3.25 latte at the Starbucks on 125th Street, is not necessarily within reach. The setting has been transformed, but a core within remains unaltered, proof that it is easier to transform buildings than lives.
That is partly because the roots of those lives were planted decades ago, when the poorly educated children and grandchildren of slaves and sharecroppers came north, crowding into housing that quickly became substandard, and finding limitations on where they could live and work. They earned little, suffered health problems and passed those legacies, along with educational deficits, on to subsequent generations. 
By the time the poor of Harlem had the freedom to live or work where they chose, many no longer had the wherewithal. Ghetto life was made bearable by diversions that could be debilitating, from playing the numbers to drinking to, later, using drugs.
With its solid wall of tenements, 129th Street had always been different from the brownstone-lined blocks around it. It was more populous, and it was poorer. Residents of the tenements called their homes "the city"; the row houses and town houses down the block were labeled "the suburbs," a world apart. Now they are a class apart, filled with new homeowners and most of the whites on the block.
In the "city," struggle remains a constant, and that was where Mrs. Cabey was living. She was born in Harlem 54 years ago, and gave birth to 14 children. She has worked in food services at Harlem Hospital Center since 1968. Before his death in 1991, her husband watched the children. Since then, the children have watched one another.
Her children, she said, were all good kids -- Charlene a poet, Triesha a comic, Dionne a dreamer, Crystal a fighter, Fred his mother's right hand man, Iesha, at 9, the baby. But the years since 1994 have not been good for their prospects.
As crime statistics fell, three of her sons were incarcerated for drug-related crimes. As policymakers vowed that limiting welfare benefits would change the family structure of the urban poor, daughter after daughter became young mothers, usually with minimal support from the fathers. As residents rising in the information economy moved onto the block, child after child left or fell behind in school.
To Mrs. Cabey, then, 129th Street was still a wild place, which is why she dismissed the talk of a changing Harlem. The white men talking about real estate deals at Starbucks believed Harlem was a place rife with opportunity. She agreed. Too much opportunity, she said, referring to the block's web of temptations. Too much wrong opportunity.

A Paycheck Away From Disaster
If the future offered little on 129th Street in 1994, it did promise security, however measly. A young woman with a child and no means of support could pass safely from living with parents to living on welfare. 
Back then, Nadine Allen epitomized what it meant to be young on the block. Interviewed by The Times at 20, she was already world weary. Friends were dying violently. She had dropped out of school and given birth. With few skills, she seemed destined to follow her mother and many neighbors into welfare dependency. If she did not get off 129th Street, she said then, she would die. 
She did not think that six years on, it would be work that was killing her. 
In 1995, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani put into place the Work Experience Program, which required welfare recipients to work for their benefits. Ms. Allen's mother, Frances Weldon, embraced the program, saying it got her off the couch and back into the workforce. She became a payroll clerk at a home health care agency. Ms. Allen equated being forced to work for less than city wages to slavery, and left the rolls. Now she had to make a living.
For more than two years, she has done market research surveys at the Manhattan Phone Center, parsing the fine points of teas with consumers for $7.25 an hour, buying furniture with tax credits she got for working. The job bored her silly. "I'm dying slowly down there," she said, sighing.
In an era in which policymakers have proclaimed the end of welfare as we know it, the transforming powers of work -- the notion that any job, however menial, gives a life structure and meaning -- are being earnestly preached. 
But for Ms. Allen, the future stretched before her as bleakly as a shift at the phone center. She moved off 129th Street to a housing project, only to watch the murders stop and the block improve. She still had dreams of getting a high school equivalency and a law degree, but no plans to realize them. She prayed to win the lottery or "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." 
Her son's father was in prison for abusing her, and in the heat of summer, she swore she would have no more children. By fall, she was pregnant with twins. And her mother, who had said that returning to work had turned her life around, has not worked in months, citing high blood pressure.
Many 129th Street residents, meanwhile, are learning that whatever the psychic benefits of getting a paycheck, the earnings, usually under $20,000 a year, may not be enough to live on. Most still get government help with housing, and sometimes food. Those who do not, live on the edge.
In March, disinclined to work for just a welfare check, a 47-year-old resident of 129th Street named Yvonne answered an ad for a home health care agency, paid $150 for a training course, and believed that she was on her way. She worked for two patients, and much of the time was elated not to be depending on government.
But then one summer week her paycheck got lost in the mail. She was earning $5.25 an hour, 27 hours a week, and paying $442 in rent. That left just over $100 a month for Con Edison, food and subway fare. Without her check, she could not get to work. Pride forestalled asking neighbors for help (or allowing her full name in print).
So she parked herself on her building's cold front step, unlighted cigarette in hand, and waited for a friend to bring a few dollars. She watched children race down the block to see a fight, watched the flirting and the double Dutch and the sport utility vehicles go by with tinted windows rolled down, the drivers wanting to be seen and not seen. She heard the calls of "raise up," a warning passed down the block like a baton, as a police car turned onto 129th Street. 
By 11 p.m., the cigarette was still unlighted and her friend had not come. The next morning, she made a new friend: a loan shark, whom she must repay $8 for every $5 borrowed. By fall, she had a second job.
And just as former welfare recipients are learning to live on fragile, marginal jobs, another safety net is vanishing. The city, which had become the absentee and often negligent landlord of hundreds of Harlem properties, and which had taken a famously lax approach to rent collection, is putting those buildings back into private hands. The landlords taking over are less forgiving. Evictions are becoming more common. And for some residents of 129th Street, a toehold lost in Manhattan's housing market is almost impossible to regain. When it became clear that Rosenell Gladden, 39, a child care worker, could no longer live with relatives on 129th Street, she could not find even a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for less than $900 a month. She and her daughter moved to the Bronx, joining the stream of economic refugees flowing north.

A Rub Between Old and New
The restored buildings on 129th Street -- ensconced lights, terrazzo floors -- glow with promise. New people, glowing with promise themselves, have helped fill them. Terrence Booth, 25, who moved from Florida to a corporate job and into the block's nicest building, describes New York as a place where you can move up if you want.
Mary Powell cannot move across the street. She applied twice to the developer the city picked to restore seven buildings on this block and screen their tenants. She never even got an interview. As she walks her building's garish orange hallways and climbs its decrepit stairs, she wonders why none of the fairy dust sprinkled over Harlem has landed on her.
She sees some whites, Mr. Booth among them, moving into the new buildings. Why them, she wonders.
She has cooked at the KFC outlet on 125th Street for six years. Despite raises, she still earns less than $7 an hour. She lives with the little inconveniences of poverty -- the $1 perfume, the apartment with no closet. The bigger ones are harder to swallow: an apartment so small that only three of her children can live with her, the other two stowed with her mother blocks away.
For her, every opportunity has a cost. She could take a better-paying supervisory position. But who would watch her children after school? As it was, she had to take the twins, now 8, to KFC with her after summer camp ended, lest she work just to pay a baby sitter. She could get health insurance, but that would savage her paycheck. She could get government help with her rent, but only if she entered a homeless shelter first. 
At 38 and single with five children and no high school diploma, she has concluded, "You ain't going to make it nowhere."
Of the block's many divides, the gap between the old and new economies, between outdated or nonexistent skills and high-skill jobs, may be the hardest to overcome. New residents like Mr. Booth work with numbers and computers, the new economy's brick and mortar. Many long-term residents lack high school educations. Some impoverished mothers here, terrified by that gap, have begun leasing computers for their children. The literal brick-and-mortar jobs seem out of reach, too. Harlem is the site of more construction than at any point since perhaps the boom that built it. And yet everyone, including the contractors doing the hiring, agree that the explosion is employing few Harlem residents. Only 50 percent of Central Harlem's men were in the labor force as of 1999, compared with 70 percent citywide, and more than 16 percent were unemployed, nearly three times the citywide rate.
At 7:30 one morning, as a rehabilitation crew puts the finishing touches on 47 West 129th, Kevin Evans is nearby beginning a day of scrounging odd jobs. A resident hires him for a few dollars to sweep the crab legs and beer bottles from the night before.
The construction jobs across the street might as well be across the country. Mr. Evans believes the jobs are off limits because they are union and he is not, and he does not cross the street to find out. 
In fact, most of the residential rehab work being done in Harlem is not union work, according to Thomas J. Metallo, the president of Great American Construction, which has worked on 129th Street. And yet most of their subcontractors and employees are not Harlem residents. 
Some contractors bring their own labor. Others prefer Mexicans or others who tend to work for less. And contractors say that many Harlem residents lack the necessary skills, or a work ethic, or both. Day to day, they can be used as laborers, perhaps, earning $8 to $10 an hour, but little else. 
"Everyone walks in off the street and says they want a job, but unfortunately we can't give everyone a job," one contractor, Doug Timmons, told a community board committee one night. "Unfortunately, we're not in a position to train." 
Most of the contractors are also not local; city officials say they have struggled to find Harlem contractors with the resources for large projects.
The new businesses in Harlem, meanwhile, are hiring local residents, but mostly for low-end jobs. At another neighborhood meeting, representatives of Harlem's new Old Navy, owned by the national chain, said that they could fill only 5 of 20 managerial positions with Harlem residents. 
Even Terrance Washington, a military recruiter living on the block, is struggling to find candidates with high school diplomas. 
An economic boom, and yet persistent unemployment and unemployability -- on 129th Street, the combination furthers a streak of nativism. It is voiced in the suspicion that the block's Africans are getting special government help to start businesses, or in the rumor that the Arabs who run the corner stores, but do not employ local residents, are abetting terrorists.
And changes in welfare are creating a growing gender gap of sorts. Women raising children alone must head into the labor market, and on 129th Street they have done so successfully. Men are more likely to face rejection -- racism, prison records -- or bristle at low wages. 
Since 1993, the number of Central Harlem women in the labor force has grown to more than 23,000 from 16,408. The number of men in the workforce -- 18,519 -- has barely inched upward. And so on the block, a colony of men is being left back. With manhood and livelihood at stake, they sometimes turn to the employment agency where work remains guaranteed.

Dealing and Reality
The oranges had gone stale in the window long ago. Soda suppliers never seemed to come to restock. Yet the traffic at the little store on 129th Street was unceasing. 
One Friday afternoon, that traffic came to include beefy police narcotics officers. They brought out Redman, the popular proprietor, and, the police say, a purveyor of marijuana. They put him in a van and searched his polished blue BMW as several of his daughters watched. 
"Somebody snitched," a man on the street said. 
"Somebody always snitches," the woman next to him said. And then, as the store was closed for the weekend: "That's great. They're closing the kids' candy store."
In 1994, drugs were woven into the fabric of life on this block. They still are, in the use of marijuana, packed in a Dutchmaster cigar, as the ghetto version of Prozac, or the continuing crack trade.
The reputation of 129th Street as one of Harlem's notorious drug markets has lingered. People come to the block to sell as well as to buy. Young Bronx men arrive for their shifts in livery cabs. Of the 90 arrests for drug sales on the block over one year, only 17 defendants actually lived there, according to law enforcement figures.
Some sellers are addicts, put out like bait to hand off the drugs, and then, if caught, to do the time. But some are young men who come out to "pitch" because they grew up in households where younger siblings would go without new school clothes unless drug money paid for them, and because they grew up watching older males do the same.
They also live in an era of heightened material expectations. "In Manhattan they say you have to be making $70,000 a year to live," one young man says in explaining why his friends have chosen the drug trade. "Who's got that?" 
But given that the profits from a night's hustling have diminished, thanks to police pressure and a shrinking crack market -- "I don't even think they're making Timberland money," one veteran of the game says -- the draw is more than cash. Nagi Davis, 29, a former dealer living on the block, offers one explanation as he considers the younger versions of himself: "I didn't sell drugs for the money. I sold it for the rush."
And for young men from broken families, the streets also offer peers who will watch your back in a way perhaps your parents never did. Kenny, 18, grew up in Brooklyn's Brownsville Houses. When he was 14, his grandmother, retiring after 33 years of working, retired from raising him, too. His mother, an addict, was not an option. He found little love at his father's. He says, with quiet bitterness, "I didn't ask to be born." 
Kenny landed with an aunt on 129th Street, and found a family of sorts on the block. His crew formed a home-grown rap label, naming it Famo, for "family." One by one, Famo's members, ages 17 to 25, have been arrested for hustling drugs.
They see rap as their way off the streets, but it also romanticizes life there. Young hustlers literally converse in the lyrics of rappers like Beanie Sigel ("My young bucks hugging the block, stop putting your drugs in your socks, you make it easy for the cops, they hook to that stash in the trash").
They served their time without complaint, saying they understood that the police had to meet their quotas and that they were easy prey. They are not all wrong. One narcotics officer who works the area describes continuing pressure from superiors to keep arrests up, even as the drug trade shrinks. They are grabbing "everyone for anything," he says.
For Kenny, six months in jail soured him on hustling. "It was rough," he said. "It taught me a lesson." But it also prompted him to drop out of school, steepening his climb off the streets.
This block knows well the price of success in the war on drugs. Dozens of its young men are cycling through the criminal justice system. Many leave school, although some emerge from prison with high school equivalency degrees. Many leave sons and daughters behind, fraying already weak family ties. All emerge with criminal records that may shadow them for years. 
For "Black" -- a street name is all he offers -- a 20-year-old who works around 129th Street, a criminal record becomes one more plank in the mental box convincing him there is nothing but the streets. The son of a security guard, motherless for years, he already has a felony drug conviction. He does not like the streets, is not truly mean enough.
"I like money, I like money," he often says. He also confesses he would like a normal job.
His plan is to just stay on the streets till he gets "set." But ask him what set means and he cannot articulate a plan beyond tomorrow. The one career he covets, firefighter, is impossible because of his record. Jobs for these young men become nothing more than something to keep them out of the cold and out of the way of the police way for a while. 
"Where you going?" Rachel Tew, a mentor to many young people on the block, asks a young man. 
"Job interview," he says. 
"Like that?" she asks, pointing to baggy jeans and leather jacket.
"It's just KFC," he says. "I just need something to keep me off the streets." 
The future does not exist.
The numbers suggest how heavy the past weighs on many people in this neighborhood. As of last November, 794 adults in the 32nd Precinct were on parole. (In the 20th Precinct, on the Upper West Side, 79 were.) In the 10027 ZIP code, which contains West 129th Street, 722 adults were on probation (compared with 92 in the 10023 ZIP code on the Upper West Side). For many black men and women, criminal histories have effectively closed off the already shrinking avenue of government employment, which helped build the black middle class. 
Deborah Wynns Williams, 41, a former addict trying to shed welfare, was kicked out of a nursing training program two days before graduation because of a shoplifting misdemeanor in her past. (She became a security guard.) Nagi Davis, trying to satisfy work requirements of his conditional release from prison, was fired from the Gap after his work-release supervisor called to confirm his employment, thus revealing the lie that enabled him to get the job. "Would you have hired me if I told you the truth?" he asked the manager who let him go.
Venetia Leak, 41, has no record, but she feels the stranglehold of the past nonetheless. She shed a crack addiction and got a job as a counselor at an organization that works with the homeless. Three years ago she moved from Brooklyn to a rehabilitated building on 129th Street -- a building where she had, in the 1980's, smoked crack. 
Her older son, now 23, works for the American Stock Exchange, earning more than his mother. But her younger son, now 19, dropped out of school and has been arrested and charged with participating in the block's drug trade.
She looks at him and wonders whether his young age at her addiction's onset made the difference. He was 5 when he went into foster care with her mother.
"I don't say the schools failed my son," she says softly. "I don't say I failed my son. I don't know what happened." 
It is easy to fall into the drug trade here, and with crack still almost as available as toothpaste is downtown, it is easy to fall prey to it. A woman says she went back on crack because she was fighting with her sister and facing financial trouble and didn't know how to deal with either. The block made it easy. Now she is off crack and back on the 50-cent beers. 
Bridget G. Brennan, the city's special narcotics prosecutor, says 129th Street shows what law enforcement can and cannot do. It can eliminate dealers as role models by driving home the consequences, and it can drive the drug trade so deep underground that the quality of the neighborhood improves.
"Are we ever going to eliminate the problem of addiction?" she asks. "I don't think that's possible."
And even the battle for quality of life can yield tenuous victories. Redman's store is briefly shut and he is sentenced to community service. He performs it cheerfully ("that highway needed cleaning") and the store reopens. A crack dealer who worked the middle of the block is arrested for the third time in 13 months, and sent away for several years. Soon after, another young man works his spot early in the morning, pulling his stash from a van with a "DARE to Keep Kids Off Drugs" bumper sticker.

Dads and Deadbeats
In the fall, Kenny, the young man from Famo, gets a job at a movie theater, flashing his winning smile from a uniform instead of the hooded sweatshirt he wears on the street. Of all the things that pushed him into a legal job, the most powerful is yet to come. His 19-year-old girlfriend is pregnant. In a life that has been short on good news, the prospect of fatherhood brings delight, and a sense of responsibility. "I've got to step up my game," he says.
The block -- even Famo itself -- is full of similar young men, teenage fathers wanting not to imitate what they call deadbeat fathers. Yet after the initial rush of love for a newborn, girlfriends tend to become "my baby's mother," and the relationships often become more strained. The women complain that the men cheat, or get locked up. 
On 129th Street, births to young parents are largely accepted as natural. "I had my first kid at 13, so I couldn't down them," Vivian Cabey says of her children's teenage pregnancies. "I just did what I had to do."
Policymakers believed that welfare had eliminated any inducements for marriage, but welfare reform has so far not changed that. Before, women had welfare checks. Now, they have jobs. Either way, many continue to carry their families. 
There are families headed by men on the block, and for some children the impact is clear. Jahmell Barreto, 17, hangs out and rides his bike with the rest of the young men on the block. But he is in school, wants college, and stands apart from his peers, mostly because his father orders him to. "My pops," he says, "was strict." 
And then there is Kenny, who would have welcomed some benevolent strictness. A few months after starting at the theater, he misses work one time too many, and no longer has the job. Five days later, he is arrested, charged with selling crack to an undercover officer in his building. 
Some on the block call the drug trade its own addiction. 
"I told him to stay off the streets" until his child was born, one of Famo's members says. "I said I would help him out -- give him money. We're family." 
But family cannot help him now. No one can post the $5,000 bail. Kenny pleads guilty to a felony, his second, and gets six months in the jail he hates. With luck, he will be out for his child's birth.

Cops and Exalted Robbers
At 1:30 a.m. one Saturday, a female security guard just off work -- and newly off welfare -- collects her son, 9, from the block. A woman leaving a bar collects her 13-year-old daughter, who listens to her mother's slurred words and says, "I don't need to tell you what you sound like." As a group of women unwind at a party upstairs, their children play among drug dealers and speeding cars. 
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, the block is de facto baby sitter -- for mothers overworked and overwhelmed, laid low with depression or high on drugs; for grandmothers weary from two generations of raising children. 
That children can be entrusted to the block testifies to the abundance of love here, the protective eyes of neighbors, godmothers, aunts and hustlers who keep children safe and make sure that strangers are watched. But it also means that some children grow up in a world of their own making, informed by adult knowledge but devoid of adult structure.
More than 100 children under 14 live on this block. Weather permitting, they shuttle up and down in packs. There is nowhere else to go. Children's games and language reveal childhood's evanescence. Five boys, ages 8 to 11, play cops and robbers. In their game, it is better to be the robber than the cop. The robbers tie up the cops, after discovering their "wire" (represented by a key chain) and deliver bullets to their heads and mouths with a pop gun. Childhood's innocence makes a brief appearance as they wrestle -- "hey, no real hitting" -- and then the robbers break into a hip-shimmying dance of "---- Tha Police."
Girls as young as 8 tease each other about "giving up the buns" to boys and selling drugs. When the superintendent shoos Tiquana Jeter, 15, off her stoop, she says, "What are we, in the shelter?"
Aware of the pressures, some mothers keep their children indoors. There are "street kids" and "house kids," says Gwen Hill, a mother of six who so fears the block's influence that she briefly sent one daughter to live with relatives in Florida.
And those pressures outlast adolescence. The years of poverty and neglect on 129th Street created a sustaining solidarity. Feeling the world was against them, residents of 129th Street united against the world -- against the police and white culture. Strivers were identified with that outside culture, and thus rejected. 
But the block's strong sense of community, a durable asset, has its own clutches. Mental habits deeply formed -- the casual acceptance and even expectation of failure, the mocking of success, the pride in dysfunction -- can survive even with the new residents and buildings. 
So when Lloyd Estridge, a bright 18-year-old determined to go to college, encounters registration trouble, he gives up quickly and returns to the block to hang out. No one pushes him back out. Months later, he gets a temporary stock job, then returns to hanging out. 
And one legacy of years of isolation is that dramas can be magnified into life-or-death soap operas. With everyone in everyone else's business, everybody he-saiding and she-saiding, the overcrowded place can resemble a giant high school. The fights and arguments -- physical, verbal, between men, between girls -- serve to avenge slights, vent desperation and demonstrate power on the block, if not beyond.
Ask Yvette Harrell, a struggling single mother, why there are so many fights, and she says, "Because people around here are miserable." Then she gestures at the "suburbs" and says, "Except for those people down there."

Trouble at School
Thirty-four years ago, Ned O'Gorman founded the Children's Storefront School to serve the Harlem children he thought were being failed by the school system. Today, he educates a racially diverse clutch of toddlers in a preschool, the Ricardo Frazier O'Gorman Library and School, on 129th between Fifth and Lenox. 
From its cheerful interior, where yellow paint brightens the windowsills and Chinese characters hang on the wall, he looks out on 129th Street and sees how little has changed. In the midst of new buildings and redevelopment efforts, he sees what he calls "the tribes of the unschooled." He sees families shredded through generations. And he sees schools incapable of mending the damage.
The block's closest public high school is the Program for Pregnant and Parenting Teens. The closest elementary school is Community School 133, at 130th and Fifth, which made the news last year because drug-addled prostitutes prowled the sidewalk across the street. In 1999, only 35 percent of its students read at or above grade level. 
And so it is hard to find, among the better-off new residents on the block, anyone whose child is enrolled at C.S. 133, or even in the same school district. Patricia Johnson, a market research analyst, says, "I think the only kids who go there are the ones who really have to." 
So when Councilman Bill Perkins says that he sees the schools as stalling Harlem's second renaissance, and that maybe the influx of active, educated parents will "demand that the system be more accountable, more effective," he is so far hoping in vain. 
The division is not just between old and new, middle-class and poor. Any parent on the block with a modicum of time, money or will power is trying to improve his child's educational prospects. Those who succeed wear their achievement like a marker of good motherhood. 
Vivian Cabey, meanwhile, barely has time to get her children and grandchildren enrolled in and outfitted for school. It is all she can do to cook and clean after work.
And so in an economy that demands educational attainment to move up, the Cabeys, like many children on this block, are sliding. Most of the older ones dropped out. Crystal, 12, repeated the fourth grade; she blames having three teachers in one year. Dionne, 13, is repeating the seventh. No surprise, says their mother, who sees the schools as violent places.

'Thank God. I'm Off the Block.'
Vivian Cabey thought her life was impervious to the flux in Harlem. Then she was upended by it. The city decided to transfer her ghoulish building, in tax arrears by millions of dollars, to a new owner. It needed her and the other tenants out. So after long averting its eyes from her building's conditions, the city called just before Thanksgiving to say that in six days her family was being moved to a city-owned building six blocks away. 
"You can't do that to a working person," she kept saying of the short notice, but she packed. The family shared a laughter-filled last meal at 60 West, Mrs. Cabey swatting roaches as she sorted clothes. A son called from jail. Mrs. Cabey counted down his remaining sentence. "Twenty-one days," she told him, "21 days."
Outside the building, Tiquana Jeter exercised some ghetto logic. "I guess they won't be able to sell drugs anymore," she said of the young men who had used 60 West for cover. "What are they going to do -- go sell on the corner and get arrested?"
Inside, Mrs. Cabey contemplated a future with hot water, and without 129th Street. 
"Thank God," she said. "I'm off the block."
But if the outcome seemed for the good, the lesson of her removal, for a block already worried about displacement, was unsettling. Change could be arbitrary. It could sweep away families and history.
It could, too, sweep away the city's best-laid plans.
A few weeks after the Cabeys were moved, the owners of 60 West paid the city $1.6 million and reclaimed the building. "We were going to walk away," one of them, Zvi Kaufman, said. "At the last minute we realized property values had gone up so much we could pay $1.6 million." 
They were now after a "big piece of Harlem," said his partner, Samuel Kairy. "Everybody and their mother wants to live in Manhattan." 
On the new 129th Street, property is power. The owners promptly handed steep rent increases to the building's ground-floor stores, including Majester's Fish and Chips, at 129th and Lenox Avenue since 1976. Their workers began dragging the furniture of vacated families from the building's interior. The men from the block who regularly gathered by the building huddled in the cold and watched.
Six blocks away, the Cabeys unpacked. Mrs. Cabey returned to work. And the day after the move, her children, missing the block, were back playing on 129th Street.

An American Block
Six years after profiling life on West 129th Street in Harlem, the Times found a transformed block.

Mets Consider Switching Sites Of Spring Camp

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 18 

 BODY:
The utility bills in St. Lucie County include fliers for Mets' spring training tickets. When Papa John's delivers a pizza, it includes a coupon for $1 off tickets. The new Friendly's down the street from Thomas J. White Stadium sells Mets ice cream cakes. New banners hailing the team decorate the town's main strip.
 In its 14th year of playing host to the Mets' training camp, this sleepy town on Florida's Treasure Coast is making a serious effort to remain Mets Country. If the Mets decide to leave for West Palm Beach when their lease expires after 2002, it might become Cleveland Indians territory, but Port St. Lucie and St. Lucie County are trying to keep what they have. 
 "Whether it's West Palm Beach or someone else trying to attract the Mets, they will have a fight on their hands," said St. Lucie County Administrator Doug Anderson, "because we're giving it everything we have this year."
The Mets have told St. Lucie County officials that they want to decide on their future spring home by the late summer or early fall, and the county understands. "This is our last chance to make a good impression," said Sonya Smith, the county's public information officer.
Of the 20 teams that train in Florida, only the Mets, Indians, Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Devil Rays have leases that expire within three years. The Orioles, who train in Fort Lauderdale, and the Mets have told West Palm Beach officials that they would be interested in sharing a facility there. The Indians may leave Winter Haven, and Anderson said Port St. Lucie is hoping to speak with their representatives to make a presentation.
But Port St. Lucie mostly wants to keep the Mets, whom they attracted from St. Petersburg in 1988. The Mets all but sold out 7,347-seat Thomas J. White Stadium the first few years, but attendance dipped when the team's performance declined and the novelty wore off.
The Mets averaged about 4,700 fans per game here last year, and they told St. Lucie County that the games must attract an average of 5,500 fans this season. If they don't, and West Palm Beach is able to provide funds for a new facility, the Mets will be much more likely to move.
Dave Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business and legal affairs, said the gap between the highest-grossing spring training site and the lowest is about $2 million. With so much at stake, he said, the Mets have to consider all options.
"This is going to be a decision that is most likely going to be determined by the financial implications of what the alternatives are," Howard said.
West Palm Beach, one hour to the south and without a team since the Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos left in 1998, is the most attractive alternative. It hopes to follow a trend established by Jupiter, Fla., Tucson and Peoria, Ariz., by building a two-team facility, for $45 million.
Palm Beach officials are pushing for legislation that would enable a referendum in September on a sales tax to help finance the project, which would be completed in time for spring training in 2003. The main stadium would be two miles from the practice facilities, which the Mets and Orioles would share.
Al Zucaro, the president of West Palm Beach's City Commission, said baseball would help the city develop its urban center. He estimated that each team that trains in a city brings about $24 million to that region.
Zucaro, who met with Howard and the Mets' chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, in New York last fall, said the attraction to the Mets is obvious. "The fact of the matter is, this is a New York marketplace down here," Zucaro said.
The Mets' co-owner, Fred Wilpon, said today that while the team could stay in Port St. Lucie, its Florida fan base is centered to the south. "This is where the people are, in this corridor," Wilpon said.
Still, Howard said, he recognizes the efforts St. Lucie is making this spring. The Mets have not promised to stay in St. Lucie if the attendance goals are met, but Howard believes the county is promoting the team better than ever. If the Mets still cannot draw 5,500 per game -- especially after a pennant-winning season -- a move might be logical.
That would be a blow to Port St. Lucie, a town whose growth is reflected in new restaurants, a 14-screen cinema under construction and a community football and soccer stadium going up across from Thomas J. White Stadium.
"Besides the economic impact, it's now part of our identity, and in addition to that it gives our community a lot of national publicity, which you can't buy," Anderson said.
Over the last three years, the county has spent $1.4 million on improvements to the facility, which cost $11 million to build.

HEADLINE: State Subpoenas Records Of Bronx Community Group 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
The New York State attorney general's office has subpoenaed the financial records of the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association to determine whether there are grounds for a civil or criminal case against the agency, a nonprofit organization that owns or manages dozens of buildings in the South Bronx.
 The agency, which was once seen as a model for grass-roots neighborhood redevelopment, has struggled in recent years, and some former employees and board members have expressed concern about its management practices. 
 The subpoena, which was served on Banana Kelly last month and a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, demanded that its executives turn over everything from canceled checks to minutes of board meetings to itemized travel expenses for employees. One law enforcement official said it was not the first request for financial records. 
Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, would say only that the subpoena was "part of an ongoing request for information."
Tenants in the South Bronx buildings Banana Kelly owns and manages have long complained of neglect. And critics with knowledge of the group's workings have described a chaotically run organization in which the board of directors rarely met, large fees were paid to consultants, and records were poorly kept.
The chairwoman of the agency's board, Yolanda Rivera, has also run the agency, an unusual arrangement for a nonprofit organization, and another board member briefly served as president. Ms. Rivera's compensation -- she has alternated being paid as a staff member and as a consultant -- has also raised questions among former executives.
The attorney general's subpoena asks for documents from Jan. 1, 1995, to the present. In addition to all financial records, it makes a number of other demands.
It asks for all minutes of meetings of Banana Kelly's board or other management committees; the group's bylaws; the identities and terms of office of all board members since 1995; and any board members employed by Banana Kelly as staff members, consultants or contractors. 
The subpoena asks for documents identifying any corporate affiliates, and correspondence with government agencies about compliance with grant or contract requirements. It asks for independent audit reports, and documentation of lawyer, accountant and consultant fees, including fees paid to officers, directors or key employees. The group has also been ordered to turn over its tax returns, documentation of compensation for key employees and an itemization of all travel expenses paid by Banana Kelly or any of its affiliates.
Further, the attorney general has required that the agency itemize certain expenses listed on a 1998 financial statement, including $173,000 for miscellaneous expenses and $102,000 in stipends. Finally, the subpoena asks for copies of written complaints from the public about Banana Kelly, and responses to them.
The investigation would appear to be the latest blow for a group that once received national, and even international, acclaim. It was founded in the late 1970's by a small group of Bronx residents who wanted to fight the fear and arson that were destroying their neighborhood. They rehabilitated a few buildings on their block, and gradually expanded to manage dozens of buildings, mostly for low-income and formerly homeless tenants, and provide social services. 
Ms. Rivera took control of the agency in 1991. She did not respond to a message left at the office yesterday seeking comment.
In recent months, Banana Kelly has clearly been looking for help. Last month, Ms. Rivera agreed to turn over the management of many of the agency's 41 buildings to another Bronx nonprofit firm, Promesa Inc. But last week, she announced that she was pulling back from the plan. Separately, 14 of Banana Kelly's other buildings, which it owns in partnership with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit organization, are being turned over to an outside manager.

HEADLINE: IN LAYOFF PLANS, REALITY IS OFTEN LESS SEVERE IN U.S. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Dell Computer and Nortel Networks are the latest to announce plans to lay off thousands of employees, joining companies like DaimlerChrysler, Lucent Technologies, Sara Lee and Whirlpool. But in many cases, only a fraction as many Americans will soon find themselves unemployed.
 For all the fear that these announcements generate, the reality behind each company's move is often more complicated than a single headline number suggests. 
 More than half of the 7,000 cuts planned at Sara Lee, for instance, will occur in other countries, the company says. Of the 26,000 layoffs that DaimlerChrysler announced last month, the 12,000 hourly Chrysler workers subject to layoffs in the United States will continue to receive 95 percent of their pay, because of a clause in the company's contract with the United Auto Workers. At least a third of the 16,000 jobs to be eliminated at Lucent will still exist -- as parts of other companies. 
"When a company announces 5,000 layoffs," said Patrick Carey, an economist who studies job cuts for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "sometimes 5,000 people aren't being laid off."
Even in difficult times, many analysts say, a torrent of layoff announcements can overstate the economy's problems. Despite the attention companies attracted last month with their announcements of plans to eliminate about 140,000 jobs, American businesses managed to add a net total of more than 200,000 employees in January, according to the Labor Department's payroll survey. The unemployment rate therefore rose slightly, to 4.2 percent, during the month from 4 percent in December, as more people entered the work force.
As the economy's growth has slowed, investors expect managers to restore profit gains quickly, and cheer the announcement of major cost cuts and layoffs. Companies are therefore more apt to highlight their layoffs. Many companies, pressured by Wall Street, have recently decided that moderate cuts in overtime or a reduction in the number of part-time employees are no longer enough.
But over the last seven years, there has been little apparent relationship between the number of announced layoffs across corporate America and the unemployment rate, a recent study by Lehman Brothers found. When the number of announced layoffs -- as tracked since 1993 by Challenger Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm in Chicago -- rose, unemployment actually tended to decline, though the relationship was not strong enough to be significant, Lehman said.
To be sure, the number of job losses has risen in recent weeks, based on government data on unemployment-insurance claims. And some of the recent cuts have consisted almost entirely of quickly imposed mass layoffs, forcing thousands of workers to hunt for new jobs. 
J. C. Penney said last month that it would close 47 stores and rapidly eliminate 5,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 1,700 jobs by the end of April. Gateway has already notified most of the 3,000 people who will lose their jobs as part of a cost-cutting campaign.
Last week, Nortel announced that it would cut 10,000 jobs; Goodyear announced 7,200 layoffs and Dell, 1,000.
Week in and week out, in boom times or recessions, anywhere from 250,000 to 400,000 Americans a week typically file new claims for unemployment insurance after involuntarily losing their jobs. Yet nearly every week, even more people than that are hired by companies across the country.
A single corporate layoff of a few thousand workers, likely to be spread over a few weeks to many months, has a minimal effect on the total of job losses in an economy where more than 130 million people go to work every day. Even a dozen such announcements will not cause a spike in unemployment.
Except in the midst of a severe downturn, the many new jobs the economy is constantly creating almost always outnumber old ones being destroyed. This is often true even within many companies themselves. 
"The ignored parts of these announcements are that companies are hiring while they're doing it," said Eric Rolfe Greenberg, the director of management studies at the American Management Association, a nonprofit group in New York that holds corporate training seminars. "Companies are increasingly hiring and firing at the same time."
Often, the layoff announcements are not quite what they seem. On Dec. 13, Whirlpool executives said they planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs, or about one-tenth of the work force. The number made it into newspaper headlines across the country and was included in Challenger's layoff total for December, which set what was then a record of 133,713.
The 6,000 number is not inaccurate, but when the company laid out the details of its first round of cuts last month, it became clear that their effect on the American economy would not be so direct. Of the first 2,000 cuts, 1,000 would come in Brazil and about 650 in Asia and Europe. Of the 400 North Americans losing their jobs, the company said, about half would be workers in their 50's and 60's who accept early retirement packages. 
"When companies reduce work force levels, a lot of the reduction comes in the form of attrition and early retirement -- a lot more than people expect," said Susan N. Houseman, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Such cuts do affect the economy, because the jobs no longer exist for others to fill. Yet attrition does not cause nearly as much pain as do permanent layoffs, which can severely disrupt families and lower workers' incomes for years.
Lucent's Jan. 24 announcement was even more confusing. The company said its work force would decline by 16,000 people, to about 90,000, as a result of a new round of cuts. Ten thousand jobs are disappearing, mostly through layoffs in the early months of this year. The other 6,000 jobs -- at plants in Columbus, Ohio, and Oklahoma City -- will still exist, though as part of companies that will be buying the plants from Lucent.
Still, 16,000 was the number of job cuts reported in several daily newspapers from New York to Chicago to San Francisco, and it appeared again on Tuesday night on ABC's "Nightline." Challenger also used the larger number in its January layoff total, which surpassed December's and set a record of 142,208.
Companies have little incentive to correct misperceptions because large job cuts appeal to investors and Wall Street analysts looking for signs of aggressive cost-cutting. And because investors tend to dismiss the importance of infrequent write-offs, or one-time reductions in reported earnings, when evaluating a company's results, executives are encouraged to lump any and all losses and cost-cutting measures into one big announcement.
Within a company, remaining employees tended to care more about how executives informed laid-off workers and what kind of severance packages were offered than about the number they read in internal memorandums or the press, said Jerry Roemisch, the president of Roemisch Consulting, a firm in Austin, Tex., that advises companies on mergers.
Still, the latest round of cuts, because they have been widely publicized when the economy has clearly faltered, does add to economic worries. 
Whirlpool employees at a plant outside Nashville, for instance, have significantly reduced costs in recent years and have received no indication that the plant is being considered for job cuts, said Jim R. Romines, a trucker at the plant and an International Brotherhood of Boilermakers official. Yet workers have begun speculating that their factory could be on the next list.
As Tom Chastain, another local union official, added, "The workers, to a man, are anxious about all these announcements."
The nervousness has also spread beyond people who work for companies making cuts, analysts say. In January, an index of consumer confidence posted its steepest drop in 10 years, largely because people expect the economy to be worse off in six months than it is today, according to the Conference Board, a research group in New York that surveys people about their attitude toward the economy.
The gap between people's opinion about the current climate and their expectations for the future was wider than it had ever been in the 34 years the Conference Board has conducted its poll. 
The difference, in part, reflects the contrast between the decent wage gains and still solid labor market of today and the fears for the future raised by the latest series of layoff announcements, analysts say. It also suggests that the announcements have a psychological effect far beyond their immediate circle.
"Bad news about the economy does influence consumers' spending," said Joseph Abate, the Lehman Brothers economist who studied job cuts. "It does tend to put a damper on their willingness to borrow."

For many online companies, customer service is hardly a priority. Just try to find a phone number.

BYLINE:  By Susan Stellin 

 BODY:
ANYONE who signs up to use PayPal, an Internet payment service that has become popular among users of auction sites, must provide it with a lot of personal data: name, telephone, address, e-mail and credit card or banking information.
 So far, more than six million people have registered to use the service. But for all that PayPal knows about its customers, it is remarkably guarded about its own contact information. 
 There is no street address, phone number or e-mail address listed among the contact information on PayPal's Web site -- just a post office box in Palo Alto, Calif., and a form to submit a question electronically. PayPal does not even have a phone number available through directory assistance. (There is a phone number for customer service on the site, but it takes some dedicated digging to find it.) 
As it happens, the Better Business Bureau of Santa Clara County recently rated PayPal's customer service unsatisfactory, in part because of complaints that the company is slow to respond to customer inquiries. But PayPal is certainly not the only site that has made it more than a little challenging for customers to reach a representative, or even locate contact information.
These days, "don't call us" seems to be the prevailing attitude among companies that do business online. Many require customers to fill out electronic forms to contact a representative, but rarely do they offer a phone number. And they tend to bury direct e-mail links -- if they publish them at all -- deep within their Web sites.
Companies say these forms improve customer service by sorting and directing inquiries to the appropriate department and trying to answer common questions more quickly by first referring customers to an online help section. But they are also motivated by the bottom line: providing phone support is expensive, so Internet companies under mounting pressure to achieve profitability are adopting more economical automated systems. Critics say customers may be the losers.
"None of these companies want to be e-mailed anymore," said Denton Taylor, a PayPal user who recently tried to alert it about an online scam that was aimed at its members. He was frustrated by PayPal's lack of contact information.
Reid Hoffman, PayPal's executive vice president for business development, said it was working with the Better Business Bureau to improve its rating and was planning to open a second customer service center to handle the approximately 17,000 inquiries it received each day. Although the electronic form is the primary way customers can contact PayPal, he said, members also receive an e-mail address for customer service when they register, and a phone number is on credit card statements.
Industrywide, there is little data about how much contact information companies publish online. But researchers at the Nielsen Norman Group, a consulting firm focused on the usability of Web sites, recently examined the sites of Fortune 50 companies to gauge whether it was possible to find a physical mailing address and a general telephone number.
Acknowledging that the sample was small, Jakob Nielsen, a principal at the firm, said his researchers were able to find an address at slightly more than half the sites and a phone number at just under two-thirds of them -- a pattern he said did not surprise him. 
"What surprised me maybe was the percentages," Mr. Nielsen said. "That for half of these companies you can't even find the information at all."
Even popular commercial Web sites are not much more revealing. For example, eBay lists only a street address in San Jose, Calif., on its contact information page; a search through dozens of other pages did not turn up a phone number or an e-mail address for customer service. 
EBay does offer an electronic form that customers can fill out to submit a question, but it is difficult to find and can be tedious to complete. 
Likewise, Yahoo -- which does provide a street address, phone number and fax number two clicks from its home page -- does not list any company e-mail addresses for customer support. Instead, Yahoo refers visitors to its help section, which tries to answer frequently asked questions before inquiring, "Is this enough information?" Visitors who click the "no" button are presented with a form to submit a question.
One Internet company that so far has not embraced electronic forms is Amazon.com, which provides customers with a list of e-mail contacts accessible through a link on its company information page. Bill Curry, a spokesman, said Amazon tries to minimize contacts with customer service through features that allow customers to track their orders, check their accounts and find out shipping rates and other information. But the site still offers e-mail addresses, he said, because that is how most customers prefer to communicate with Amazon.
"Personally, I think forms you associate with things like the Department of Motor Vehicles and the I.R.S.," Mr. Curry said. "And a great shopping experience -- I don't know if that calls for a form." Even so, Mr. Curry said Amazon was exploring whether forms could be adopted in a "customer-friendly way."
As for whether there are any federal regulations governing the disclosure of company contact information -- either online or offline -- "the short answer is no, there are not," said Eric London, spokesman for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. "But that doesn't mean we don't think it's a good idea for businesses to adopt some of the guidelines put out by organizations like the Better Business Bureau," he added.
Last year, the Better Business Bureau Online released a code of online business practices, which the organization's 9,000 members must adopt by September to maintain the bureau's reliability seal.
The code stipulates that a member's Web site should publish the company's legal name; the name under which it conducts business; a physical address; an online method of contact (like e-mail); a point of contact responsible for customer inquiries; and a telephone number, "unless to do so would be disruptive to the operation of the business given its size and resources" -- in which case, the company must have a working phone that is listed in directory assistance.
Elizabeth Blumenfeld, director of policy and business strategy for the Better Business Bureau Online, said it had spent considerable time on this issue as it solicited feedback from businesses, government representatives and consumer groups to develop the code.
"The challenge is that a lot of businesses, particularly those that are not brick and click, but just click, feel that if you have to post a phone number or an address, then you're defeating the purpose of being on the Internet," Ms. Blumenfeld said.
It is not yet clear where a fair balance lies between the interests of consumers who need to contact the companies they do business with online and the abilities of companies to keep up with multiplying customer service requests.
But in an industry that gathers increasing amounts of information about its customers, it may no longer be a viable option for a company to use technology to effectively hide.

Napster Is Stirring Debate on Art and Ethics

BYLINE:  By CLEA SIMON 

 BODY:
The legal issues may still be in play, and the technical outcome is anyone's guess. But in a forum on the Napster controversy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last week, it was the ethical issues that took center stage. 
 "Why is Napster so interesting? Why is it so difficult?" These were the opening queries posed by Eric Scheirer, an analyst with Forrester Research, speaking to the small colloquium in Cambridge, Mass. 
 The audience was largely drawn from the M.I.T. faculty and the university's Media Lab. Napster is a music-trading Web site that acts as an index to the music libraries on users' personal computers. In a lively give and take with the group, Mr. Scheirer said that Napster had raised arguments about art and ownership that had not traditionally been part of the public discourse.
"Napster is pushing on these questions as we try to articulate the role of art," said Mr. Scheirer, who holds a Ph.D. from the M.I.T. Media Lab. He said one in four American adults had downloaded music by one means or another, making the Napster issue "a cultural phenomenon." 
For Mr. Scheirer, Napster raises four big questions: What is the appropriate relationship between the artist and fan base? Is the capitalist model the right model for creating art? What is copyright for? And what is art for in a consumer society?
Citing the band Metallica, which filed one of the first suits against Napster, he said many of the group's fans had rallied against what he called Metallica Inc., the profit-oriented business side of the heavy metal group.
He said disputes raised by digital technologies like Napster would force American society to clarify its definition of copyright. The traditional European notion, he said, considered art an inalienable part of the artist. In the United States, he said, the strict constitutional interpretation is that copyright exists to encourage continued creation.
But the more popular American understanding, he added, is that copyright exists for a more pragmatic reason: so that creators can be paid. CLEA SIMON

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Like a market epicenter, Nortel Networks' decline jolts the shares of its suppliers as well.

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero 

 BODY:
LATE last year, Nortel Networks was confident enough of its standing in the communications equipment industry to rent a plane that circled over a factory operated by its troubled rival, Lucent Technologies, with a banner reading, "Are your options losing altitude?" 
 But now that Nortel's stock has crashed to earth, aftershocks are being felt in portions of the equipment industry that act as suppliers to companies like Nortel. 
 On Friday, investors hammered Nortel's shares after the company announced late on Thursday that it would report a loss in the first quarter and cut 10,000 jobs because of slower sales in the United States. Nortel's stock plunged 32 percent on Friday, to $20, leaving its share price nearly 78 percent lower than its high of $89 just six months ago. 
Because Nortel has long been considered a gauge of the general health of the communications industry, the company's problems have put analysts on alert. "We had sensed sectoral weakness in the first quarter, but we did not expect Nortel to see this much weakness and lack of visibility," said Thomas Astle, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
On Friday, tremors spread throughout Nortel's supply chain, knocking the share prices of several companies to their lowest levels in a year.
Shares in JDS Uniphase, a large producer of fiber optic components, fell 21 percent, to $35.81, while shares in Corning, the maker of optical fiber and glass panels, declined 21 percent, to $33. Nortel accounts for about 15 percent of JDS Uniphase's overall sales and 15 percent of Corning's photonics business. (Photonics are products that harness light at a microscopic level to make communications networks more efficient.) Corning said on Friday that its photonics sales should grow 50 percent this year, down from previous estimates of 75 to 90 percent.
Besides large companies like JDS Uniphase and Corning, Nortel's quake also caused smaller suppliers to shudder. Shares in the Avanex Corporation, which makes fiber optic based products known as photonic processors, fell 17 percent, to $35.94, Allied Fiber Optic Products' stock fell 13.3 percent, to $11.06, and shares in the Finisar Corporation declined 16 percent, to $20.
Much of the alarm has to do with Nortel's suggestion that communications carriers, especially in the United States, are slowing their purchases of equipment this year. Relatively old-fashioned equipment like circuit switches, which direct traffic on voice networks, is particularly vulnerable. But it also appears that carriers are spending less than expected on fiber optic equipment to prepare networks for huge amounts of Internet traffic.
This should come as no surprise, because of the bankruptcies and other difficulties at some new communications companies in recent months. But Nortel's warning has stunned analysts, many of whom had previously offered rosy estimates of 30 percent growth for such products this year. With problems at Nortel and Lucent, though, analysts are expecting the market to expand only 15 percent or less in 2001. Although that might look like healthy growth on the surface, it illustrates how concern over a slowing economy is leading communications companies to be much more conservative now than they were a year ago.
"The fear of an economic downturn is feeding on itself," said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. "What we should really be worried about is whether this fear, and not real economic conditions, is making companies more cautious."
Nortel's troubles could affect the finances of JDS Uniphase in at least one other significant way. On Feb. 6, Nortel agreed to acquire a fiber optic components factory in Switzerland from JDS Uniphase in a stock deal valued at about $2 billion.
For JDS, the Swiss factory deal was a way to meet regulators' conditions for its acquisition of the fiber optics equipment maker SDL Inc. Officials at the Justice Department had expressed concern that, without the factory sale, JDS and SDL would dominate the market for the tiny pump lasers used in fiber networks. 
But with last week's decline in Nortel's stock price, the shares used to pay JDS Uniphase for the facility are now worth about a third less, or roughly $1.3 billion, according to Epoch Partners. There are no signs, however, that the deal will be renegotiated.
Compared with Nortel's main rival, Lucent, which consistently warned investors quarter by quarter over the last year that it would fall short of revenue and earnings estimates, Nortel shocked its shareholders last week. Even so, analysts are cautioning investors not to let their displeasure with Nortel contaminate their views of the entire communications equipment industry.
"The entire sector shouldn't be painted with the same brush," said Mark Langley, an analyst with Epoch Partners. "There are companies out there that compete with Nortel or that provide different products that could end up better positioned."
Such companies may include the Ciena Corporation and Tellabs, which make products that allow carriers to use bandwidth more efficiently instead of spending more to expand bandwidth capacity. Ciena, in particular, impressed investors last week by raising its sales estimates for the months ahead. 
Even Ciena, however, could not escape the market's aftershocks on Friday. The company's shares tumbled 7 percent, to close at $82.63.

 In a survey of the nation's largest foundations, to be published this week in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, 79 of the 142 foundations included said they expected their giving to remain flat or drop this year -- and slightly more than half said their assets had shrunk over the last year. 
 And there are scattered hints of troubles throughout the charitable world: some nonprofit organizations, like the Children's Aid Society, have had a substantial drop in donors in that time. Others, particularly those depending on dot-com fortunes, found that stock gains they expected were evaporating. In Texas, where the Austin Entrepreneurs Foundation holds stock from start-up companies, only 2 of the 12 companies that were expected to go public last year actually did so, while several corporate supporters went out of business. 
Over the second half of last year, there was a 2.7 percent decline in the Philanthropic Giving Index, a kind of consumer-confidence index compiled by Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy, based on surveys of executives of nonprofit organizations. 
In recent years charitable giving has reached new highs, and many organizations, from the American Heart Association to the American Friends Service Committee to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, say they have not yet felt any sign of the weakened economy. 
But the decline in foundation assets may herald widespread trouble. Foundation giving almost tripled over the last decade, to $20 billion -- support that is especially crucial to nonprofit organizations in lean economic times, when individual and corporate donations dry up. 
But several prominent foundations lost a substantial share of their asset value over the last year, the Chronicle survey said. With the shakeout in technology stocks, for example, the assets of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, in Los Altos, Calif. -- invested almost entirely in the stock of Hewlett-Packard and its spinoff, Agilent -- dropped 25 percent, to $9.8 billion. 
But at least for this year, Packard is not cutting its grant budget, said George Vera, the treasurer. "If there is a prolonged bear market, we'd have to make some changes," he said, "but what we hope is that over time we will even out the peaks and valleys." 
Packard was not the only high-tech foundation to be hit hard last year: the assets of the Paul G. Allen Charitable Foundation dropped 39 percent, to $58 million. 
Other foundations where assets declined by more than 10 percent last year include the Annenberg Foundation in St. David's, a suburb of Philadelphia; the Annie E. Casey Foundation in Baltimore; the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee; the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich.; the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in Chicago; the Libra Foundation in Portland, Me.; and the George Gund Foundation in Cleveland. 
Over all, the median decline of the biggest foundations' assets was only 0.3 percent. But that decline would have been far steeper without the success of the nation's two largest foundations: William H. Gates made a $5 billion donation to his foundation, which has $21 billion in assets, and the Lilly Endowment's $15 billion grew on the success of Eli Lilly & Company stock. 
Private foundations are required to spend at least 5 percent of their assets, and most stay close to that level to keep from using up their money. Eventually, fewer assets translate into fewer dollars in grants. But because the tax laws allow for averaging over several years, foundations need not slash programs the year after their assets shrink. Still, some are already reducing spending.
At the Spencer Foundation in Chicago, for example, where assets dropped to about $500 million in December from about $600 million a year earlier, this year's budget for new grants is $22 million, less than half the $49 million in grants approved in 2000. 
"It's not as drastic as it sounds," said Ines Milne, the treasurer. "It's just that last year was such a big year for us. Before that, we'd never approved more than $30 million in grants in a single year. Most of our grants are multiyear, so we'll be paying them out over the next seven years. As for approving new grants, we're coming back down, gradually, to try for a soft landing, while we watch the market." 
Other charities, too, are watching the market anxiously, as they prepare next year's budgets. 
"We're feeling what is happening in the economy," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society. "We haven't suffered a dollar loss yet, but there was a definite drop-off, about 12 percent, in the number of donors over the last year. We get 60 percent of our contributions in December and the first week of January, and that was where the big hurt was. When you have a drop-off in donors, it doesn't bode well for the future. We're now doing budget planning for the next fiscal year, and we're thinking unrestricted giving may be down 5 percent, but we're hoping to make up for it in the giving to specific programs." 
At America's Second Harvest in Chicago, a spokeswoman, Sue Hofer, said that while giving levels were "on track" last year, a few donors told the food bank that they were postponing their year-end gifts because of market conditions. 
Even groups that enjoyed increased giving last year remained alert to signs of a downturn. "We did very well last year," said Andrew Ackerman, executive director of the Children's Museum of Manhattan. "The only place we're beginning to notice any concern is in selling tables for our spring benefit April 29. One company that usually gives said they're not sure about buying a table because they're announcing layoffs." 
And many pledges based on soaring stock values have become, at best, tentative. 
On March 16, at the annual Washington Business Philanthropy summit, Michael J. Saylor, the chief executive of the Virginia software company MicroStrategy, announced with great fanfare that he was pledging $100 million to create a free online university. Four days later, the company restated its earnings for the previous two years and the stock plunged, from a high of $333 a share to around $10.
So for the time being, a spokesman said, Mr. Saylor is "very focused on MicroStrategy." Mr. Saylor said recently that he remained committed to the project, and planned to sell off his stock over the next few years and finance the university. 
The relationship between philanthropy and economic circumstances has always been a close one. In the 1975 recession, for example, foundation giving dropped 28 percent, and it did not recover for a decade.

HEADLINE: Signs of Uneasiness in Seoul Over Change at White House 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
As President Kim Dae Jung prepares to visit Washington early next month for a summit meeting with President Bush, signs of uneasiness have been multiplying here about a possible change in direction in Washington's policy toward the divided Korean Peninsula. 
 In its final weeks, the Clinton administration made a major push to normalize relations with North Korea, and many in this country felt that life for both of the Koreas was about to take a dramatic turn, with new business opportunities and, most important, a much more secure peace. 
 But the Clinton team's diplomatic push fell short. And the change of administrations in Washington has left people here anxiously holding their breath to see if momentum for detente with North Korea created by a landmark meeting between leaders of North and South Korea last June will now be sustained or lost. 
In a statement issued Friday that seemed directed, at least in part, at the Bush administration, Mr. Kim pointedly noted that the successes of diplomacy last year toward Pyongyang "owe a lot to Seoul's bilateral cooperation with Tokyo and Washington," and he urged that "policy coordination" between the three capitals should be strengthened. 
The South Korean government has been pleased with some of the early statements from the Bush administration. Recently, for example, the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Washington was "very mindful of the work that had been done," in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, "and looked forward to moving forward from there."
But many of Mr. Bush's senior diplomatic and security advisers have in the recent past advocated policies toward North Korea that contrast sharply with the strategy of the last administration. In private, South Korean officials have expressed alarm that the Bush administration is rushing ahead with plans to develop a missile shield before seriously testing North Korea's willingness to abandon its long- and medium-range missile programs.
North Korea's development of medium- and long-range missiles has commonly been cited as the leading justification for the Bush administration's antimissile program. 
South Korean officials have also expressed concern that Washington will not seek to engage North Korea on other issues, and moreover, that the new administration will try to discourage South Korea from providing increasing amounts of economic aid to the North.
"The position that the administration's people have taken is that the United States has been too eager," said Selig S. Harrison, an expert in Korean affairs at the Century Foundation, in Washington. "I don't think that they are going to create any kind of provocation with North Korea. They are sensitive to the arguments of Seoul that say that we are on the firing lines here. Please be careful." 
Mr. Harrison said many in the administration believe that North Korea will eventually collapse economically. 
That is a prospect, however, that clearly frightens South Korea, which fears a devastating economic impact from the breakdown of the North's economy. Recent news agency photos from Pyongyang alarmed many here with images of crude graffiti denouncing the government of Kim Jong Il over the starvation of millions of his people. 
South Korean officials have worked hard recently to counter the argument that they are being too generous in providing aid to North Korea under President Kim's so-called Sunshine Policy, a criticism heard both from some circles in Washington and from opposition quarters in Seoul.
"The most important element of inter-Korean relations is that there is no more war," said President Kim's spokesman, Park Joon Young, in a news conference this week. "And that outweighs considerations of whether we give more or take more. Peace is the most important thing."
Hoping to influence the new administration on North Korea, South Korea secretly dispatched its intelligence chief to Washington recently, following the foreign minister by only two days as part of a series of high-level briefings.
In a briefing this week, a senior South Korean official said that while international aid had eased food shortages in the North recently, that country's energy crisis has grown increasingly dire, recently compelling the South to offer coal supplies.
"Half of the power they generate is lost because of old, corroded cables buried underground," said the official, who declined to be identified. "Kim Jong Il was shown recently visiting a cosmetics factory with a group of officials all wearing heavy parkas indoors. I ask you, can you produce cosmetics in a factory that is freezing? In South Korea we have no choice; we must do what we can to help."

HEADLINE: Testing the Limits of the Western Dream 

BYLINE:  By Patricia Nelson Limerick and Charles Scoggin; Patricia Nelson Limerick, a professor of history, and Charles Scoggin are on the board of directors of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
As we write, we are sitting in paradise. To our west, the Front Range of the Rockies looks like a Bierstadt painting. If you want your soul to soar, this is the direction to look in. New snow has put the contours of the mountains in high relief. Once on the ground, Rocky Mountain snow almost always skips the familiar East Cost stage of blackened, sludgy heap, instead graciously melting under the bright sunlight. No wonder everyone wants to join us.
 For those, like us, who have spent any time studying the development of the West, the before-and-after contrasts between the West of 10 years ago and the West of today reawaken old temptations to bemoan the pace of change in the region. All the new housing developments, all the new high-tech companies, all the new shopping centers, all the cars on the Boulder Turnpike and along I-70. Why is it getting so crowded? Can the land sustain it? 
 Between 1990 and 1999, Colorado's population grew by 30.6 percent, adding one million people. Nevada grew by 66 percent. New York, by contrast, grew by a mere 5.5 percent. This change in demographics will bring about a shift in political power. New York may lose two Congressional seats, and Colorado and Nevada will likely each pick up one.
But this population growth has already brought us some other advantages. The shopping is better; the food is certainly better; we now have an abundant and accessible supply of world-class gourmet coffee. And the entrepreneurial energy of new companies has introduced a renewed sense of possibility and optimism to the region. The West as a setting and a theme in novels, poems, memoirs, historical writing and visual art is enjoying a resurgence. There may even be an end soon to the regional inferiority complex that has long burdened the West. (The fact that both presidential candidates wore cowboy boots has not been not lost on us.) 
Is any of this news? The westward movement -- of those driven by dreams, hopes and ambitions toward a land of magnificent scenery and open views -- is one of the nation's oldest stories. A century ago the census found almost exactly the same growth rate for the State of Colorado as the 2000 census: 31 percent from 1890 to 1900.
Throughout the 1890's, though they were a time of economic misery for many, the westward migration was, in the words of demographic historian Walter Nugent, "not rapid, but steady and endemic." The historian Frederick Jackson Turner's declaration in 1893 that the frontier was gone, and with it "the first period of American history," was proving to be decidedly premature. The conviction that the West offered health and self-improving recreational adventure, so central to the current population movement, was coming into play. The region became a haven for those suffering from tuberculosis and other ailments.
Then, as now, the growth in the percentage of the population that was foreign-born was putting ideals of equality and opportunity to the test. In 1879, the California Constitution was amended to forbid California corporations from employing Chinese workers and to allow towns to segregate Chinese immigrants into certain neighborhoods. In 1882, egged on by white workers in Western states concerned about losing their jobs, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United States. And in 1913 the California Legislature passed the Alien Land Law, aimed at Japanese-Americans, which prohibited aliens from acquiring, possessing or inheriting real property.
In addition to these manmade limits, there were other barriers to settlement in the West. In many of the homesteaders' settlements, retreat rapidly followed advance as farmers found that much of the land could not support conventional small family farms. Over the course of the early 20th century, farms were claimed, worked and abandoned across the Great Plains and through the high altitudes of Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
Indeed, the history of the West is characterized by cycles of boom and bust. Metal mining -- of gold, silver, copper and molybdenum -- has risen and plunged with changes in the technology of mining. The oil and gas industry has seen similar changes, with a spectacular plunge in the early 1980's. Will today's Western boom continue the pattern?
Recent migration to the West has, in many ways, rested on the nation's prosperity. Many have been drawn by new, technology-based industries, which have been central to the current economic boom. If the national economy slips, the current growth in the West seems likely to slip with it. And then there is water: its limits, despite the water projects that have supported growth so far, have long been a subject of regional denial. Tree ring records make it clear that this region has been subject, in the past, to multidecade droughts, droughts that make the duration of the Dust Bowl look short. Much of our landscape does still look like a picture postcard. But a few years of drought, and we could all find ourselves abandoning the scenery and competing for the moving trucks.
Still, many here in the West are finding it hard to resist the impulse to tell our million new neighbors that the door should have been shut before they came through it, and certainly should be shut now. Initiatives like California's Proposition 187, which denied public services to the children of illegal immigrants (it was later mostly dismantled in court), signal the persistence of the urge to blame immigrants in times when the native-born feel crowded. Meanwhile, the regional fights over grazing on public lands, agricultural water transfers, fire management and mining grow more intense, heightened by the growing population. 
But our fellow Westerners should take heed: The debate over how we live in a region founded on the idea of the expanding frontier must include the voices of the millions who, driven by a latter-day version of that dream, have now made their homes among us.

HEADLINE: Fresh Dynasties Sprout in Post-Soviet Lands as Democratic Succession Withers 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan 

 BODY:
The demise of President Heydar A. Aliyev, 77 years old and a survivor of major heart surgery, is so nearly unthinkable in this former Soviet republic, which he has dominated for most of the last three decades, that the local press refers to it only as Event X.
 What Mr. Aliyev wants after Event X seems increasingly clear: his only son, Ilham, 39, deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's state oil company, should inherit his father's political throne. 
 This model of monarchy seems increasingly to be taking hold in the former Soviet lands, republics that have often become the personal fiefs of rulers who mostly were part of the Soviet system.
In many ways the autocracies are an outgrowth of the Soviet era, when regional leaders were chosen in Moscow and few people took an active role in politics. Now the leaders argue that more time is needed to build the democratic institutions necessary for stability and smooth transitions of power. 
Others criticize the absence of mature opposition voices and legitimate heirs after a decade of transition that has brought little gain for many residents of the Caucasus and Central Asia. 
Indeed, there is a widespread sense of being dispossessed as citizens who have grown increasingly impoverished watch leaders, their families and cronies prosper.
"You don't see any signs of accommodation with the rest of society, and you get more and more frustrated with the leaders as time goes on," Martha Brill Olcott, an expert on the region at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
The prospect of instability or violence when one of the current leaders leaves office also raises the prospect of intervention by Russia, which is already reasserting its influence and could argue that it needs to act to restore order.
"Where do they draw the line when it comes to independence?" asked a senior adviser to one of the region's presidents.
The only leader in the region who has tried to train a post-Soviet generation of politicians is President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia, who is 73.
He took that course only after making his share of unsavory alliances at home and with Russia to beat back three civil wars that arose in the 1990's out of his country's deep ethnic divisions.
Those divisions continue, making succession more complicated. One of the few people identified by diplomats as a possible challenger to Mr. Shevardnadze, for instance, is Aslan Abashidze, the autocratic leader of the semiautonomous region of Adjaria on Georgia's Black Sea coast.
Already Mr. Shevardnadze has dodged several assassination attempts. Economic woes and endemic corruption are mounting, leaving his government deeply unpopular. 
On the other side of the Caspian Sea, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan retains a strong grip on power as the prospect of oil riches increases. The mercurial Mr. Nazarbayev, 60, frequently shuffles cabinet members to keep potential rivals at bay, and last year Parliament granted him immunity from prosecution for life.
Mr. Nazarbayev's eldest daughter, Dariga, 37, who owns a media empire, is mentioned most often as a potential successor, along with her husband, Rakhat Aliyev, head of the country's internal security apparatus. 
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan was once the most promising democracy among the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia, but the government's repression of political opponents and the re-election of President Askar Akayev, 56, in October have drawn rebukes from monitors and human rights groups.
The United States, once a champion of Mr. Akayev, criticized Kyrgyzstan in January after Felix Kulov, a former vice president and popular opposition leader, was sentenced to seven years for abuse of office after a closed-door trial by a military court. He was acquitted of the same charges in August.
"After studying this case for some nine months, I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution, trial and sentence were all politically manipulated," Scott Horton, a lawyer in New York and president of the International League for Human Rights, said in an interview. "You could hardly imagine stronger evidence of judicial misconduct."
In Uzbekistan, human rights advocates and diplomats say President Islam A. Karimov exercises a degree of control unusual even in this authoritarian region, keeping a tight leash on rivals within the political elite and using mass arrests to suppress opponents.
A Swiss company, Romak S.A., discovered the extent of his control when it shipped $10 million worth of wheat to Uzbekistan. The contract was signed by the agriculture minister and the wheat was delivered, but people involved in the transaction said Mr. Karimov had refused to authorize payment because he had not approved the deal.
Romak won a court judgment in Britain, but Uzbekistan has refused to honor it, saying it had fulfilled the contract by paying a local company.
In February 1999, Mr. Karimov, 63, was the target of an assassination attempt blamed by the government on Islamic militants. Diplomats in Tashkent said it might have been the work of opponents within the establishment who saw no legitimate way to challenge Mr. Karimov.
"I look for a bodyguard bullet there," Ms. Olcott of the Carnegie Endowment said. "He will always be under risk of assassination."
President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan, 61 and, like Mr. Aliyev and Mr. Shevardnadze, a former Soviet Politburo member, also exhibits no sign of giving up power willingly, though he said Sunday that he would not run for re-election in 2010. Two years ago, Mr. Niyazov was declared president for life and is the focus of a personality cult unrivaled since the days of Stalin.
A 75-foot gilded statue of him stands in the main square in the capital, Ashgabat, rotating so that it always faces the sun. Three new monuments dedicated to the man who calls himself Turkmenbashi, or father of the Turkmen people, were erected in January.
The issue of succession would seem to be most pressing for Mr. Aliyev, in Azerbaijan. He is the oldest of the region's leaders and underwent heart surgery in 1999.
His hospitalization while visiting the United States last fall led to a near-panic in Baku after rumors spread that he had died. People began to horde food and hole up in their apartments, remembering the chaos of civil war that followed independence in 1991.
Mr. Aliyev, the longtime leader of Soviet Azerbaijan and president of the independent republic since 1993, has insisted that he will seek another five-year term in 2003 and presents a vigorous image in the frequent televised broadcasts of his state appearances.
But aides say his unrelenting schedule leaves Mr. Aliyev weary at the end of most days, creating the possibility that he will not run in two years.
Unlike other countries in the region, Azerbaijan has a legitimate political opposition, though its latitude is restricted and parliamentary elections last November were criticized by Western monitors.
"This is a false democracy, and the president is very willing to put power in the hands of his son," Sardar Jalaloglu, general secretary of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, said in an interview.
Still, the opposition press regularly criticizes government officials as corrupt and castigates the president's son as a playboy who is unprepared to run the country, freedoms unavailable in most other countries in the region.
Efforts have been under way to groom Ilham Aliyev to succeed his father. Business executives and diplomats in Azerbaijan maintain that such a succession is the best hope to keep the country in the Western sphere of influence and protect billions of dollars in foreign investment in its rich energy resources.
"If Ilham's succession does not come to pass, it is no clearer here than anywhere else in the former Soviet Union what will happen," a Western diplomat said.
People who have dealt with the younger Mr. Aliyev say he appears to be well versed in the energy business as an executive of the state oil company, but they said he has occasionally expressed reluctance about becoming president. He has also not faced the adversity he would encounter running a country where people earn an average of $1,600 a year and hostilities could arise on any of its borders.
No opposition figure has emerged to challenge the president, but his son could face rivals from within the political establishment, diplomats and business leaders said. 
Chief among them is Ramiz Mehdiyev, the head of the president's executive staff and the likely choice of the former Soviet bureaucrats within Azerbaijan.
The younger Mr. Aliyev will go to Washington this spring for speeches orchestrated to portray him as a worthy successor and to demonstrate to skeptics that he does want the presidency. 
A member of a faction of younger, Western-oriented technocrats that has formed around him said planning was quietly under way to develop a message of continuity and progress for him to deliver once Event X occurs.

Where the Middle Class Shops Like the Upper

BYLINE:  By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
He stood in a line, three deep. "If they're going to take my money they should be a little faster about it before I change my mind," said Richard Turrin, a wry smile cutting across his chiseled face. Actually, Mr. Turrin, a "blissfully unemployed" investment banker, didn't give a hoot about waiting forever to buy merchandise at the first day of Barneys Warehouse Sale, a twice-a-year "New York institution," as he put it.
 As Mr. Turrin, a 39-year-old Gramercy Park resident, advanced toward a cash register, he was joined by his girlfriend, Katie Van Egmond, a journalist visiting from Melbourne, Australia, who had found a lime green sweater for her father back home. She caressed her beau's find, a brown Hugo Boss mid-thigh coat, made of leather as soft as flan, and laughed. "Richard is relieving himself of a thousand dollars for this bargain," she said. He gave her a sheepish look, then smiled. 
 There were more than a few smiles in evidence at the sale, which began Thursday (while Fashion Week was in full swing) and continues until March 4 at 255 West 17th Street in Manhattan. The good humor might seem surprising, given the frenzied nature of the hunt and the lack of amenities (no dressing rooms or chairs). 
"For Americans, shopping is a recreational outlet," Ms. Van Egmond said. "There's an urgency in seizing their bargains. I'm afraid I've lived a very sheltered background in that regard."
The sale, a New York event since the early 70's, brought out a pastiche of the city's colors and social classes, from Upper East Side doyennes to office workers from the boroughs. Patrons of every ilk pounced on purses and pumps by Prada. They fought over fashions by Armani, Isaac Mizrahi and Geoffrey Beene. And of course, the fashion cognoscenti coddled clothing featuring the Barneys New York store label as well as the Barney's Co-op brand. All merchandise, including a small number of houseware goods, was 50 percent to 80 percent off, said Jessica Taubas, a company spokeswoman. 
To make room for the racks, Barneys temporarily closes its Co-op store, which features younger designers and wide aisles, and cedes the space for the sale. Barneys, with eight stores in America, is known for its spartan civilization. But its warehouse sale is decidedly uncivilized. 
In the women's department, a sprawling open area with exposed pipes and wires, there were a smattering of men. That didn't prevent a woman in her 30's from stripping down to her bra to try on a sweater she later discarded. A woman of ample girth wearing black cotton panties was trying on several pairs of pants.
In a steady assembly line operation, cashiers rang up the goods and stuffed brown bags. One customer was caught in the crossfire. "Good Lord, she stapled the finger," said a young man as he stepped away from the cash register, examining his hand. 
Curt Weber, 28, a Crown Heights, Brooklyn, resident who works at a fashion photo production house, waited patiently in line to pay in the men's department, where the word is that shoppers are more parasitic than those in the women's section. "At least no one grabbed anything out of my hands, but they came close to it," he said, laughing.
Nearby, Ron Sharkey, a 41-year-old administrator at a Manhattan high school, said he rarely shops at Barneys but has purchased at the warehouse sale before. "I usually shop at Marshalls and Century 21," said Mr. Sharkey, who lives a few blocks from the warehouse in Chelsea. He showed off $200 Barneys New York shoes marked down to $99; $140 Turbo hiking boots marked down to $39, and a $120 Barneys New York cotton shirt marked down to $47.
Kendra Brown, a 29-year-old art teacher from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, found an abundance of designer bargains, including three sweaters, four shirts, a dress and a skirt. Ms. Brown, a designer-fashion aficianado, wore Betsy Johnson jeans, a Steven Allen bracelet, and carried an Etienne Aigner handbag. "I'm getting good deals, but I wish they had a better system," she said, glancing at a line for the cashiers that snaked around the corner.
Jill Bebar, a journalist in her 30's, bought an orange corduroy skirt with the Co-op label and two pairs of pantyhose by Barneys New York. She's a warehouse sale regular. "I don't mind that there is no dressing room," she said. "I always find good deals. I might come back."

Inflation Risks Are Still Seen for Euro Zone

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
A member of the European Central Bank council, Ernst Welteke, said today that inflationary risks in the 12-nation euro zone, though reduced, were still present, suggesting that he remained skeptical about lowering interest rates.
 "Risks for price stability have diminished, but they haven't disappeared," Mr. 
Welteke, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said in a speech. He cited increased food prices because of fears about mad cow disease in several European Union countries and a recent jump in oil prices. 
 The European Central Bank last raised its benchmark rate a quarter point, to 4.75 percent, on Oct. 5 -- the seventh increase since November 1999. The central bank's 18-member governing council convenes to set rates on March 1.
Most analysts say the bank's next move will be to cut rates, as growth in the euro region is slowing and the annual inflation rate declined in December to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent in November. The bank has set an inflation ceiling of 2 percent.
Still, the bank has indicated that for now it will wait before lowering rates, as it wants to gauge how much the euro zone will be affected by a slowdown in the American economy.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks Ease Their Recent Volatility 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
With Wall Street closed in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday, foreign financial markets were fairly quiet yesterday -- moving in subdued patterns of the sort of volatility that governed trading last week.
 Markets in Asia generally slid, especially in Taiwan, with its heavy dependence on technology issues. European markets were off slightly over all, as telecommunications stocks continued lower amid worries about debt, while old economy stalwarts like steel, oil and chemicals showed modest strength. 
 A surprise earnings warning on Thursday by Nortel Networks, the world's leading supplier of fiber optic equipment to telecommunications companies, had effects elsewhere. Nortel's warning had driven down Nasdaq stocks 5 percent on Friday.
Patrick Shields, an analyst with BNP Paribas, said, "Last week's technology stock performance on both sides of the Atlantic suggests that there is still downside risk, and that the market still has an appetite for bad news."
Nortel's French rival Alcatel fell 3.4 percent yesterday, among the sharpest declines of in a European blue-chip stock. France Telecom fell 1.6 percent to a new low for the year. The Vodafone Group of Britain shed 3.1 percent, reaching a two-year low on reports that its planned sale of Infostrada, an Italian subsidiary, was in jeopardy. But Deutsche Telekom rose from two-year lows on hopes that it would sell assets.
And Nortel itself improved in Toronto trading more than 5 percent, with buying by bargain-hunting investors helping it recoup a small part of the 33 percent decline it suffered Friday. The benchmark Toronto index rose 0.79 percent for the day.
Among old economy issues, news that Usinor of France would merge with two rivals to create the world's largest steelmaker, and the prospect that industry overproduction might ease as a result, gave a lift to rivals like Corus, which gained 5.7 percent, and Thyssen Krupp, up 3.9 percent.
In currency dealings, the euro rose nearly 1 percent against the dollar and the yen after the Group of Seven leading industrial nations lent weight at a weekend conference to expectations that European economies would grow faster than the United States or Japan this year.

HEADLINE: For Cardinal-to-Be, a Busy Day in Rome 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
On his first day here, Archbishop Edward M. Egan encountered only one hitch today in his preparations to become one of 44 new cardinals on Wednesday. The red ceremonial robes that he had ordered turned out to be a few inches too long and had to be sent back to the tailor.
 The rest of his day was a smooth if somewhat hurried round of press interviews and visits to old haunts, from the seminary where he was ordained and later taught, to Vatican offices and to the Holy Roman Rota, the church court where he once was a judge. He had a pasta and roast veal lunch at the Villa Stritch, the Vatican residence for American priests where he lived for 14 years before being made an auxiliary bishop of New York in 1985. 
 Archbishop Egan, 68, said he did not find that former Vatican colleagues were treating him more deferentially since he was named a cardinal. "I've been here a long time. I really became an Italian, and I think they kind of think of me as a friend," he said. Nor has he been smothered with his new title of respect, "your eminence." Archbishop Egan said, "they haven't started that yet."
Yet the process is well under way. On Wednesday, Pope John Paul II will crown 44 new cardinals with the red zucchetto (skullcap, or "beanie" as Archbishop Egan described it early in his New York tenure) and red biretta, a four-cornered hat.
Two other Americans, Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington, and the Rev. Avery Dulles, a theologian at Fordham University, were also named. The record number of new nominations raises the number of cardinals eligible to vote in a conclave for a new pope to 135, well above the limit of 120 set by Pope Paul VI. 
Rome is already teeming with cardinal-designates and their entourages from all over the world, and bracing itself for limousines, dinners, receptions and streams of official delegations. Consistories, or ceremonial gatherings of cardinals, traditionally combine solemn religious pageantry with festive celebration. 
Lindy Boggs, 84, the former Louisiana congresswoman and outgoing United States ambassador to the Holy See, will hold a reception for the three new American cardinals and described the weeklong round of ceremonies and parties as "a cross between a Washington inaugural and the debutante season in New Orleans." 
Some 850 people are expected to fly in from New York to witness Archbishop Egan's elevation, and by some standards, his is a modest delegation. Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, an Italian Vatican official, has invited 5,000 guests from his hometown, Carinaro, to Wednesday's ceremony. 
As early as last Friday, switchboard operators at Santa Marta, the hotel-like residence inside the Vatican where many cardinals are staying, were entangled in high-powered calls. "Eminence, his excellency is calling. Your excellency, his eminence is on the line."
Archbishop Egan, who will have dinners for special guests on both Friday and Saturday nights, because no hotel ballroom in Rome is large enough to fit all 850 in one sitting, said he intended to keep down costs. "If I have seemed to not be overdoing it, it is because, as I see it, I am here as a servant to the 413 parishes of New York." He described his hospitality plans as "pretty much standard operation," adding, "We haven't added anything or embellished, but I think we are doing rather nicely with what is usually done." 
When in Rome for a consistory, cardinals usually stay in Vatican housing, or at church residences around the city. Archbishop McCarrick is staying at the Pontifical North American College, a seminary for American priests. Father Dulles is staying at the main residence of his Jesuit order. Archbishop Egan is staying at the five-star hotel Crowne Plaza Rome-Minerva, but not at the expense of New York parishioners -- the hotel's chairman is an old friend of Archbishop Egan's, and offers him free rooms when he is in town.
One reason for the pared-down approach is that when he took over the New York Archdiocese after Cardinal John O'Connor's death last May, Archbishop Egan inherited a huge deficit. He declined to disclose the sum. 
"We have very, very serious deficits to face. We'll face them and take care of them," he said, after explaining that he had decided to close John A. Coleman, a Catholic high school in Ulster County, because of its $800,000 deficit and shrinking enrollment. "It is not the first time I've had to face this kind of thing, and I will face them again. It is not something that cannot be handled, but it is very significant and has to be attended to seriously." 
It was partly his fiscal track record in Bridgeport, Conn., where he consolidated and closed economically failing schools and parishes and also proved himself as a deft fund-raiser, that prompted the pope to put him in charge of New York. Archbishop Egan allowed that he and Cardinal O'Connor were "very different," but praised his predecessor, saying, "I hope I can be half as good." 
Archbishop Egan credited New Yorkers with his elevation to cardinal. "I think the archdiocese sees itself as honored by this event; that's exactly the proper way to see it," he said. "Cardinals choose the pope, the successor of Peter, and I think everybody likes the idea that their particular religious leader would be involved in the choice. It is an honor, and people treat you in a very loving way, but really, the honor is to the archdiocese." 
But he said he felt a new sense of responsibility as cardinal. "As a person who has been given this particular honor, I can safely say that the obligation to do it well has become more obvious, more compelling."

HEADLINE: CHANGE STIRS HOPE FOR LEGAL STATUS AMONG IMMIGRANTS 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO, N.Y., Feb. 18 

 BODY:
An obscure change in immigration law passed in the waning days of the Clinton administration could lead to legal status for as many as half-a-million illegal immigrants, but it could also lead to disappointment for millions more who have misinterpreted the change as a general amnesty. 
 The crucial part of the law temporarily reinstates a provision, in effect from 1994 to 1998, that allows illegal immigrants with certain family relationships or with the backing of some employers to petition for legal status without having to go to the American consulate in their home countries. That is significant because most illegal immigrants are prohibited re-entry -- for anywhere from 3 to 10 years -- if they leave the country, dissuading those who might otherwise legalize their status. 
 The change in the law also establishes a four-month window for qualified immigrants to file the extensive paperwork necessary for the petitions. The challenge now facing those who meet the requirements of the change is finding scrupulous legal advice and a willing sponsor by the April 30 deadline. 
That task has been made much more difficult as the nation's illegal immigrants -- 5 million to 6 million, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates -- hear of the legislation in the ethnic news media, misunderstand it to be a general amnesty and then herd into hastily scheduled community meetings to find out who qualifies and what they must do by the deadline. The confusion is compounded by advertisements from lawyers and non-lawyers alike in the ethnic press, from East New York to East Los Angeles. The ads, in boldface type, and containing multiple exclamation marks, trumpet "Immigration Amnesty Alert!!" or "This Could Be Your Last Chance!"
In its advisories, the I.N.S. also uses boldface, underscored type to emphasize that the law -- clause 245(i), which was intended as a mere tweak in a huge budget bill passed last December -- is "not amnesty for all persons unlawfully in the United States," like the broad federal amnesty of 1986. Of the 700,000 people -- most of them Latinos -- who could move toward permanent residency and citizenship under this law, I.N.S. officials estimate that anywhere from 200,000 to 500,000 of those will benefit from clause 245(i).
To clarify the law, and to protect immigrants from fly-by-night promises, advocacy groups, legal service agencies and religious organizations have been scrambling to organize informational seminars. A sampling of those who have run these forums suggests crowds beyond anyone's expectations and expectations among those attending that bear little relation to reality.
This northern Westchester town, a magnet for Latino day laborers, is one such place. The other night at the Mount Kisco Elementary School, dozens of men in denim jackets and dirty work boots dashed to the front of the lunchroom, shouting questions and grasping for business cards from Philip E. Berns, an immigration lawyer who had just spent two hours explaining the technicalities of 245(i).
A janitor had started mopping the floor and stacking the folding chairs, but the immigrants were oblivious, nearly trampling Mr. Berns in the rush to ask follow-up questions. "They come to me totally desesperado," Mr. Berns said, slipping from one language to the other as he described the hopelessness of his potential clients. "It is muy, muy dificil."
Mr. Berns said this was the 20th of his presentations in northern Westchester and Connecticut at churches, technical schools, Head Start programs and even a commercial bakery. His office telephone has been ringing nonstop, his secretary is hoarse and his waiting room is full of people without appointments. 
The forum for immigrants here in Mount Kisco, and another down the hall in English for interested employers, were put together by Carla Rediker, a bilingual social worker, who plans additional sessions in Ossining, Peeksill and Brewster. Catholic Charities, in New York City, with six attorneys and nine paralegals, is running seminars every Thursday at its headquarters on First Avenue in Manhattan, and is sending the equivalent of circuit-riders elsewhere. The New York Immigration Coalition, with help from the borough presidents, has similar sessions scheduled in the Bronx and Queens. 
Most everyone who has run a forum reports huge crowds and widespread misinformation. At the Southside Community Mission in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, for example, 1,000 people showed up at 9 a.m. for an 11:30 meeting last month. At a subsequent meeting, Sister Peggy Walsh, who leads the immigration project, set up 30 folding chairs, had to add 20 more and let the 25 latecomers stand. But of the 75 immigrants who came, Sister Walsh said, only 3 had qualifying family members. 
Mario Russell, director of immigrant services at Catholic Charities, reports similar ignorance of the law, which says legal permanent residents can petition for spouses and unmarried children, for example, but not for parents or siblings, as citizens can.
The Southside Mission, like virtually all nonprofit agencies in the region, is handling only family petitions, which are generally cut-and-dried. Partly because of the extensive involvement required of employers, labor certifications, as the employment petitions are known, are complicated and often ambiguous. Catholic Charities tried to take on employment cases, along with family petitions, using one part-time labor lawyer. The available appointments filled within days. 
"At a time like this lack of legal services is thrown into high relief," said Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigrant Coalition, who warns immigrants to avoid "notarios" -- which means "lawyer" in Latin America but notary here -- as well as the travel and real estate agents who often take on multiple roles in Latino neighborhoods. 
In New York City, with an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants, there are only 30 immigration lawyers working at nonprofit agencies, Ms. McHugh said, adding that the ratio is even worse in the suburbs. The nonprofit agencies charge $200 to $1,000 to process a petition, Ms. McHugh said. Private lawyers, surveys show, charge about $2,000 for a family petition and $3,000 to $7,000 for a labor certification.
Experts agree that clause 245(i) is a more promising tool for those with qualifying relatives than it is for those with employers who may be reluctant to tackle the onerous paperwork or take on the risk, however remote, of being sanctioned by the I.N.S. or the Department of Labor for hiring illegal workers.
Just a birth certificate establishes a family connection to someone who is generally enthusiastic about petitioning. But employment cases, for unskilled and semiskilled laborers, are messy. There must be proof, via concerted advertising, that there are no Americans available for the job. 
The position must be full time and at the prevailing wage, which means union scale in certain building trades, far more than what most illegal immigrants command. Then the job much be matched to another job that is listed in a two-volume Department of Labor compendium to determine its skill classification. Skilled jobs, like computer programmers or auto mechanics, have more visa slots and thus shorter waiting periods. 
The documentation must come from the employer. A landscaper from Armonk, daunted by the seminar here, said he had one employee, out of dozens, he would apply for. Mr. Russell at Catholic Charities said the landscapers and construction workers in the suburbs had the worst chance because most employers considered them replaceable "commodities." The best chance, he said, would be a small business, like a florist or a deli, where the worker and boss had a "committed personal relationship." 
Close ties brought several women with trusted household help to the employers' seminar in Mount Kisco. They were told by Michael J. Boyle, a private lawyer who does labor certifications, that the wait for a visa for a nanny was now 10 years with the backlog of applications growing. A groan rose in the room. 
But all is not lost, Mr. Boyle told the crowd. A family with sufficient resources and a certain set of needs could label the job of nanny as cook, which has virtually no waiting list. Or an employer might petition for a nanny and meet the April 30 deadline, thus giving a valued employee the ability to transfer the petition to a more favorable category, say spouse, if during the years of waiting the employee married a legal resident. 
Experts say it is possible to submit a family petition without legal help, but not a labor certification. Mr. Boyle said there were rare employers willing to pay the expenses, usually wealthy professional families living in affluent areas like Westchester or Fairfield Counties, whose households might founder without the hired help.
Upgrading a job is perfectly legal, assuming an employer can prove need and pay the prevailing wage, an I.N.S. spokesman, Bill Strassberger, said. Also legal is using an immediate petition as a place-holder. If the hypothetical nanny who later married a legal resident had not filed before April 30, Mr. Strassberger noted, she would have to go to a foreign country after her marriage to apply and would be denied re-entry for 10 years. Thus the urgency to file a petition.
"My job is to make a way when there is no way," Mr. Berns said. "I can't imagine a case that is absolutely, guaranteed a failure. Long-shot applications are very different than bogus ones. Unless the economy goes sour and people are lined up to cut lawns and burp babies."

HEADLINE: Wildlife and Derricks Coexist But the Question Is the Cost 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: VENICE, La., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
At the mouth of the Mississippi, at Louisiana's far southern tip, a marsh that is home to alligators, herons, egrets, ospreys, spoonbills and more than 200 other species has since 1935 enjoyed protected status as the Delta National Wildlife Refuge.
 For nearly all of that time, the wildlife has shared its watery quarters with oil and gas wells, pipelines and pumping stations built by energy companies, which have also dredged countless canals, almost always acting with federal permission. 
 The cohabitation is not altogether unusual. From Alaska to North Dakota to Louisiana, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service permits oil and gas exploration or production at 29 of its 530 refuges, even though habitat conservation is supposed to be the agency's primary mission. Out of sight to all but wildlife, oil workers and the rare outsider, the infrastructure includes some 1,400 wells. 
But now, with the Bush administration considering other federal sanctuaries, notably the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, as sources of new energy supplies, questions about what has and has not worked in places like the Delta refuge have suddenly become a focus of both interest and contention.
"I'm not saying that what's happened in Louisiana has been perfect, because nothing in life is perfect," said Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is among a handful in his party to support drilling in the Arctic refuge. "But with all the oil that's at stake in Alaska, it's time to take a look."
But environmentalists and others opposed to drilling in the Arctic refuge say the record of oil and gas developments at other refuges should, at best, be regarded as an unfortunate exception. Even if it is subtle, they argue, the harm inflicted in refuges in Louisiana and elsewhere will be long-lasting, and not worth the short-term economic gain of exploiting nonrenewable oil resources. The Arctic tundra may be even more sensitive to an industrial footprint, conservationists say.
"By definition, a wildlife refuge is a special place -- it's a place that wildlife need," said Noah Matson, refuge program manager for Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group. "So why damage it by oil and gas activity that, one way or another, is bound to be harmful?" 
Accessible only by boat, 10 miles from the nearest port, the 400,000-acre Delta refuge may be the clearest example of the coexistence that people like Mr. Breaux argue can prudently proceed in the Arctic.
"I guess if you want primitive, this is the place to come," said David Patterson, production supervisor for the Jetta Production Company, whose employees work seven days and seven off, operating from an industrial island in the marsh that is linked by pipeline to 64 wells.
Jetta and Texaco operate some 78 oil and gas wells in the refuge, making the operation the largest at any wildlife refuge in the lower 48 states.
Under these companies and Jetta's predecessor, the Chevron Corporation, there have been a number of small oil and gas spills here in the last 10 years, during which a concerted effort at environmental recordkeeping began. wildlife service officials describe several as having been significant, killing vegetation and affecting 40 to 80 acres of marsh. But the agency says there was no indication of harm to wildlife. 
That record is roughly comparable with those of other refuges where oil and gas activity is under way, with no major spills or widespread death of wildlife in recent memory, wildlife service officials say. Still, at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, oil and gas exploration has led to evidence of PCB contamination, these officials said, while at the D'Arbonne refuge in northern Louisiana, the use of improper equipment was linked to mercury contamination in the late 1980's.
At the D'Arbonne refuge and others in the South, environmental problems arise when drilling brings to the surface saltwater that is not part of the natural habitat. And in the Delta refuge and others along the Gulf Coast, the dredging of canals has contributed to the loss of wetlands.
Over all, cautioned Jim Kurth, deputy director of the national wildlife refuge system at the wildlife service, "we don't have a fair sense systemwide of the impact of oil and gas drilling in the refuges." 
But energy industry officials say what is known about the record should demonstrate that energy exploration and wildlife can coexist.
"I think you can do your operations in a way that protects what a wildlife refuge is designed to protect and, in some cases, enhance it," Elliott Laws, Texaco's president for safety, health and the environment, said in a telephone interview, describing the lessons he said his company had learned since drilling its first well in the Delta refuge in 1941.
As Mr. Bush's allies, including Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who heads the Energy Committee, have been eager to point out, at least one environmental group, the Audubon Society, has appeared to condone drilling on wildlife refuges. Until 1999, the group permitted oil and gas production on a private refuge it owns on the Louisiana coast. The society has been a vocal opponent of new drilling in the Arctic refuge, but its officials have insisted that the two stances are not incompatible, on grounds that it had decided long ago to end the energy operation as soon as a lease expired.
"It's something we did, and it's why we have the position we do in Alaska," John Bianchi, an Audubon spokesman, said.
By law, national wildlife refuges enjoy a level of protection that may be second only to areas set aside by Congress as wilderness areas, off limits to all but hikers and pack horses. While national forests and most other federal land is set aside for varied purposes that include logging, mining and drilling, and national parks and monuments must be accessible to the public, refuges are supposed to permit only activity compatible with protecting wildlife.
But until about a decade ago, the rules governing refuges, first imposed in 1966, have sometimes been honored in the breach, with little effort made to determine whether operations like those in the Delta refuge were harming animal habitat. Even now, records are spotty, leaving the actual effect debatable. 
In a survey of wildlife service managers by the agency in 1991 and 1992, a substantial number described oil and gas operations at their refuges as incompatible with wildlife protection. But in many cases, federal officials say, nothing can be legally done to halt the energy operations, because the subsurface rights are in private hands.
In most cases, when the federal government owns the mineral rights to land beneath the refuges, it no longer offers them for lease. But an exception is made when, as with many of the Delta wells, the government concludes that it has an obligation to taxpayers to extract the oil and gas because otherwise, a neighboring drilling operation on nonfederal land would be able to do so first.
"If you ask, Is a refuge better off with or without oil and gas development, I'd say probably without," said Dan Ashe, chief of the national wildlife system for the wildlife service. 
The Arctic refuge is a special case -- and not just because of the sheer volume of oil estimated to lie beneath, which at 5 billion to 19 billion acres ranks as the largest single discovery in the United States.
The refuge has been off limits to drilling, as part of a compromise reached in 1981. But Congress holds the power to authorize the start of oil development on 1.8 million acres along the coast, and Mr. Bush has said he will push for just such a vote as part of what he says is a broad effort to reduce dependence on foreign oil.
In the Senate, Mr. Murkowski is expected to introduce his own proposal in the next 10 days, as a rough draft for a Bush plan that is not expected until April. And opponents have begun to gear up for a fight about whether it is possible, as Mr. Bush has asserted, for drilling in the Arctic refuge to proceed "in an environmentally sensitive way."
At the refuge in Louisiana, wildlife managers say, oil companies have been quick to report even the smallest spill and willing to shift pipelines and even drilling sites to meet environmental concerns.
In the last 10 years, said James O. Harris, supervisory biologist for the federal refuges in southeast Louisiana, the wildlife service has collected about $1 million in fees from the oil companies to mitigate damage in the Delta refuge. That, Mr. Harris said, has been enough to help the agency recover more than 1,000 acres in wetlands, or 10 times the amount lost to energy operations in the period.
"There were times when you had spills when you wish they weren't there," Mr. Harris said of the oil companies from his office in New Orleans. "But because of their presence there, we've been able to do some restoration projects that we might not have been able to do." 
Still, Jim Graham, until recently the wildlife biologist at the Delta refuge, said that as cooperative as relations were, he could never quite escape the feeling that the oil companies did not belong.
"You have a pristine area, like a refuge out there, and then you have these structures," Mr. Graham said. "They may not be doing any harm to the refuge, but you're putting an object into the area that's foreign to it."

Earnhardt's Death Turns Nascar Talk to Safety

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 19 

 BODY:
In the moments after Dale Earnhardt hit the wall Sunday, a voice in his headset, crackling with static and rising concern, said: "You O.K., Dale? Talk to us, talk to us."
 But there was no answer. Crumpled in his famed No. 3 black Goodwrench Chevrolet, the Intimidator, bleeding from his ears, nose and mouth, was probably already dead. As red tow trucks and white ambulances swarmed around the black car, the voice on Earnhardt's radio frequency, also heard by thousands at the track with race radios, seemed to quiver with panic. "Talk to us, Dale." 
 Talk to us, Dale. In the coming days, the 49-year-old Earnhardt's sudden, sickening death in the Daytona 500 will be used to attack, justify or obscure some of the problems Nascar is facing in a new season in which network television is supposed to make stock car racing mainstream entertainment. Those problems include rising costs in a sagging economy, the equitable distribution of television money, and keeping teams competitive when some owners are financed by petroleum corporations and others by the family gas station. Safety issues, a constant Nascar concern, have become controversial as some older drivers, including Earnhardt, have refused to adopt new devices. 
Typically, Earnhardt died the way he always drove, with a bold move to hold his position and protect the lead of his son and protege, Dale Jr., as they entered the last turn of the last lap of the Daytona 500, stock car racing's premier event. His death leaves a hole in the heart of a sport as close and insular as a traveling carnival.
Nascar scenarios that are not about new rules or money are usually about sons and brothers. Lineage is very important in a sport still controlled by the family of the man, Bill France, who organized it. And so, the story lines were about bloodlines. For starters, Michael Waltrip, kid brother of the retired champion Darrell, would finally win a race. Ward Burton would slingshot out of the shadow of his brother Jeff. Kyle Petty, son of the King, Richard, would find strength after the death of his teenage son, Adam, last May. And the Dale Earnhardts would drive each other to glory; Junior would find maturity, Senior rejuvenation. 
For about 375 miles yesterday, those story lines took shape and promised a season of absorbing speed opera. Ward Burton, in one of the 10 new Dodges, led the Daytona 500 for 53 laps. Kyle Petty was not a factor in the race, but his own new Dodge was running well enough to give hope for future races. And for the 200,000 fans in gorgeous weather here and millions more watching Fox's telecast, the signature event of this new national pastime was a thriller. Fourteen drivers would change the lead 49 times -- 40 more than last year -- before the race ended.
But it was too thrilling for the gearhead cognoscenti. They were already murmuring along pit road that Nascar, which tinkers with its universe the way crews tweak a car, had gone too far. New rules designed to "manage competition" had created a dangerous situation in which cars ran too close together without the horsepower to surge out of harm's way. It had created what one of the sport's best chroniclers, Monte Dutton, calls "the world's fastest and most dangerous game of chess." One spasm in a bunched pack would cause a pile-up accident. Of course, as drivers say with more wryness than resentment, "our fans sure do love their wrecks."
"Our fans," a group portrayed as whale-bellied, beer-sucking, weekend Confederates, really comprises a rainbow of American sports fans. The 200,000 spectators at Daytona (an estimated 167,000 in the stands, thousands more in the vast infield encampments), included many executives (some even in suits) of the hundreds of sponsors, associate sponsors and clients in this most commercialized of sports. There are many multigenerational family groups who travel to several races a year. There are hard-core gearheads who keep up to date on gossip and wind-tunnel tests in weekly newspapers like The Winston Cup Scene and on Web sites like jayski.com. And there are yuppies, frat boys, good ol' boys and girls, and those tattooed, shady-looking young people who come to races to party hearty. 
They enjoy the races in two basic ways: with the assistance of the favored beer, Budweiser, or certain plants and chemicals, they view the 200-lap, three-hour race as a streaming video of color and sound, a "trip"; or with the assistance of a radio scanning the conversations between driver and crew, they can get so deep into the race they squirm to avoid hitting the wall.
When the fans got their beloved wreck on the 174th lap, it was Mark Martin who brought his totaled car to the grass with a laconic, "Guys, we're done." Robby Gordon, Ward Burton and Tony Stewart got tangled up, setting off the 18-car wreck. Amazingly, Stewart was the only one with injuries, and they were minor. 
There was relief as the race restarted sixteen minutes later. Lightning had struck. The damage was mostly financial. But would Nascar take the lesson?
Lectures on restrictor plates and aerodynamic packages tend to draw yawns outside the grease pits, but they are critical to understanding the sociology. Fans do not want to see a boat race, a follow-the-leader for three hours. They want at least the illusion that in any given race, any car has a chance to win.
On a two-and-a-half-mile superspeedway like Dayona, restricting horsepower with plates between the carburetor and intake manifold reduces speed; imagine running with your mouth and one nostril closed. Then strips of metal called spoilers to limit or redirect air flow further equalize the cars. Typically, spoilers are reconfigured and the holes in the restrictor plates are changed as the season progresses; the Nascar rule book, they say, if it even exists, is written in pencil. And now, with a $2.6 billion television contract, the stakes are even higher, increasing the pressure to assure exciting, competitive races. 
When the race resumed, it was even more exciting. Waltrip and Dale Jr. were both dueling for the lead and driving nose to tail on the straightaways to take advantage of the "dirty air" that lets two cars together go faster than one alone. Waltrip and Dale Jr. were also friends and teammates on Dale Sr.'s racing team. Earlier in the race, the elder Earnhardt -- he hated Senior and liked being called Big E -- had aggressively blocked other cars from passing his son and Waltrip. 
But on the last turn of the last lap under the fluttering white flag, Big E was also making a move for himself, trying to hold his position. For years we will see how he died, losing control of his car after it made contact with Sterling Marlin's, then spinning up toward the wall at more than 180 miles an hour. Touched by Ken Schrader's car, No. 3 then slammed head-on into the concrete.
Because of Waltrip's sentimental victory and the assumption that old Ironhead was indestructible, it was awhile before the seriousness of Earnhardt's crash became apparent from the emergency swarm and the silence on the radio to the frantic "Talk to us, Dale."
And now there will be talk again of death, a fact of racing life. The close-knit stock car community tends to deal with it through fatalism and evangelical Christianity (Nascar has its own circuit riding preacher) and to avoid dealing with it through denial. 
Last week, in an interview with George Michael on his Sports Machine show, Richard Petty was asked about the death of his grandson Adam. He said that one could die in a crash on the drive to the track. Darrell Waltrip agreed, but added that there were procedures and devices that could help avoid serious injuries and death. That will be the poles of the coming discussion.
Could Big E have been saved? There will be debate over so-called soft walls that can absorb impact, and about safety devices, which Nascar promotes, often to the resistance of older drivers. Earnhardt, would not wear a helmet that fully protected his face or the HANS (Head and Neck Support) device that keeps the head from snapping forward in a potentially lethal whiplash that severs the spine. Kyle Petty promotes the device; his son died of an injury to the base of his skull. Earnhardt suffered such an injury as well as part of the blunt force head trauma that killed him. The director of emergency medical services at Daytona said there was no way of knowing whether a HANS device would have saved Earnhardt's life. Still, this could be Nascar's opportunity to mandate such protection.
In that way, Dale may yet talk to us.

HEADLINE: Our Soldiers Didn't Volunteer for Poverty 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was encouraged by your Feb. 15 editorial about improving the "economic status and living conditions" in the armed forces. I recently left active duty, and have experienced firsthand the difficulties of making ends meet while in the service. 
We who serve tend not to attract attention to the difficulties we face at home; in fact, were I still in uniform, I would not write this letter. 
 Pay and benefits are important for the retention of highly qualified and difficult-to-replace personnel. But dignity and morale are even greater incentives to serve a full military career. No one goes into military service with the idea that it will bring wealth; choosing to serve means accepting sacrifices and compromises to meet mission requirements. It shouldn't mean actual poverty and loss of dignity. These conditions are a cancer on morale and have been key factors in the continuing exodus from military service.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Answer to 'Hybrid' Cars; 
Cheaper Than Japan Models, But Far Less Fuel Efficient

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Japanese automakers have led the way in selling "hybrid" cars, which have improved fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions by running on either gasoline or electricity. But the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, on the American market for a year, are costly to produce and sold in limited numbers at a loss. So Detroit is trying a middle ground.
 American automakers will offer some "full hybrids," capable of running on battery power alone at low speeds, but are putting their main focus on electrically assisted gasoline engines. Such engines, which cost little more than conventional engines but use a less ambitious technology than some environmentalists want, will become an option or standard equipment on dozens of models in coming years. 
 General Motors and Ford executives say they expect to offer various levels of electrically assisted engines at least as an option on most models, though in some cases it may take a decade or more. Other automakers are more cautious, but with G.M. and Ford together accounting for half the American market, their rivals are likely to follow suit. 
G.M. is "committed to being an absolute leader in putting that kind of technology in our vehicles across the board -- not each and every vehicle, because we still have customers that want to make choices, but having that option across the board," said Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman.
Despite a preference for full hybrids, environmentalists are mainly pleased by automakers' latest ideas. They are particularly surprised given that federal fuel-economy standards have been virtually unchanged since the late 1980's, and say the planned hybrids and voluntary pledges by G.M. and Ford to improve the gas mileage of sport utilities show that the industry is changing its ways.
"If you'd asked me what I'd have expected at the beginning of the Clinton administration, it would have been governmental action followed by a response from automakers," said Daniel Becker, energy director at the Sierra Club. "What we have is government inaction and a response by automakers to pressure from a number of sources," notably environmentalists, consumers, foreign automakers and the media. 
Auto executives say most of the vehicles are likely to be less fuel-efficient than the lightweight Insight coupe and Prius sedan, which get 48 to 65 miles a gallon. That high mileage, however, partly reflects their small, light bodies. Compared with gasoline-only models, Ford estimates that Detroit's more modest new hybrids can improve fuel economy by 10 to 20 percent, while the more ambitious designs, like those in the Insight and Prius, will gain up to 60 percent.
The new approach will be to install electrical systems that are of lower voltage than for full hybrids and are recharged by the brakes. These will allow cars' gasoline engines to turn off automatically when a vehicle stops and turn on instantly when the driver's foot touches the accelerator, improving fuel economy and reducing emissions.
Auto executives say lower-voltage hybrids offer many of the advantages of full hybrids at a small fraction of the cost. "It'll probably improve fuel economy -- the downside is it doesn't improve fuel efficiency as much as a higher-voltage system," said Lawrence J. Oswald, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for hybrid electric vehicles.
The new systems will also be able to run water pumps, power steering and heaters with less energy than is now required, and to provide extra acceleration when needed.
But in contrast to the Insight's 144-volt system and the Prius's 274-volt system, the smaller systems, with 42 volts, are not powerful enough to provide much help in actually turning the wheels. Vehicles with these systems are becoming known as "minihybrids" or "mild hybrids."
The degree of fuel-efficiency improvement from adding a 42-volt system depends on how many of a car's functions are redesigned to run on electrical energy. A full-hybrid vehicle, like the Ford Escape sport utility, which will go on sale in 2003, offers the biggest gain.
Most big automakers say they plan to offer some full hybrids along with many minihybrids. Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler have announced plans in recent months to sell full-hybrid sport utilities by 2004. G.M. plans to sell some full-hybrid pickups and midsize cars then, too.
Ford said in early January that it would begin installing 42-volt systems in 2004 on many Ford Explorers, the nation's best-selling family vehicles. Many other automakers have been working for several years on similar vehicles, though they have yet to commit themselves to mass production.
The 42-volt systems should add only $1,000 to $1,500 to a vehicle's price, much less than for a higher-voltage system, Mr. Oswald said. Consumers should be willing to pay extra because electrically assisted engines, aside from getting better mileage, have better acceleration and can heat a car faster on cold days, several auto executives said.
G.M. built a prototype of a full-hybrid midsize car a year ago that got 80 miles to the gallon, but found the effort enormously expensive. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, said that for cost reasons, most hybrids "will be mild hybrids rather than enormously technology-changing hybrids."
Standard & Poor's DRI, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., estimates that 42-volt vehicles will account for at least 30 percent of sales in North America, Europe and Japan by 2010 -- a short time by industry standards. Full hybrids will account for an additional 5 percent of the market in industrialized countries, predicted Philip Gott of DRI.
Automakers' interest in hybrid technology increased greatly after Ford vowed last summer to improve the average fuel economy of its sport utilities by 25 percent, and G.M. countered that no matter what Ford did, it would do more. "The war between G.M. and Ford over whose S.U.V.'s are more efficient is feeding right into that -- S.U.V.'s and pickups will be first" to get hybrid technology, Mr. Gott said.
Adding hybrid technology is one of the few fuel-efficiency improvements that can be made without redesigning a vehicle. This is becoming a real option now because many automakers, with research heavily subsidized by the Clinton administration, have finally mastered the complex computer controls needed to coordinate electric and mechanical power.
Hybrids do not need to be plugged in overnight for recharging, the biggest drawback of electric cars. The batteries in hybrids are recharged partly by the engines and partly by "regenerative" braking: a third of the energy from slowing the car is turned into electricity. 
Much higher-voltage systems, like those found in the Insight and Prius, allow engineers to install electric motors that can actually propel the vehicle from a standing start to 20 or 30 miles an hour. Then gasoline engines, which are more efficient at higher speeds, kick in. The addition of powerful electric motors means that automakers can use smaller, lighter, more efficient engines, considerably improving fuel economy.
The electric motors in higher-voltage systems can also be used to propel the front wheels while the gasoline engine propels the rear wheels, or vice versa, providing all-wheel drive without the complexity, weight and expense of current four-wheel-drive systems.
Mr. Becker and other environmentalists said that while they welcomed any hybrids, they still had concerns. They prefer higher-voltage hybrids, and they want automakers to use all the extra battery power to improve gas mileage. Automakers instead plan to use some of the electricity for videocassette players, dashboard computers and other accessories, and to improve acceleration.
Michael Tamor, Ford's manager of vehicle electronics research, said accessories like dashboard computers draw little current, so most new energy will go to improving fuel economy. But manufacturers, he said, may also put three-prong electrical outlets in back seats.
If people start plugging in hair dryers, portable televisions or even portable washing machines, the engine must work harder to recharge the battery. "The energy has to come from somewhere," he said.
Outlets will probably not be installed in front seats, to discourage people from plugging in devices that might distract them while they drive, Mr. Tamor said. But he acknowledged that some motorists might try to plug hair dryers in the back seat and then stretch the cord up to the front. 
American manufacturers are most interested in offering hybrids for gas-guzzling sport utilities, rather than selling the high-mileage small cars preferred by many environmentalists. Mr. Becker said manufacturers were too interested in preserving the social acceptability of sport utilities. The full-hybrid Dodge Durango, for example, will get 18 miles a gallon when it goes on sale in 2004, DaimlerChrysler says. That is better than the 15 for a conventional Durango, but it is still worse than a typical large car or minivan, to say nothing of a subcompact.
The Insight gets 61 miles to the gallon in the city and 68 on the highway mainly because it weighs even less than a Chevrolet Metro.
As electric systems become more sophisticated, they have begun to mystify auto executives with mechanical backgrounds -- to say nothing of executives with finance and marketing backgrounds. Ronald Zarrella, a marketer who is now president of G.M.'s North American operations, said that when G.M.'s automotive strategy board was given a two-hour briefing recently on 42-volt systems, "it was at a level that while we all understood the philosophy and objectives, few of us understood the technical dissertation."
Auto executives say they are responding to a market dominated by affluent consumers who want big vehicles with lots of power. "Customers don't care about fuel economy, and they hardly care about emissions," Mr. Oswald of DaimlerChrysler said.
Full hybrids have initially appealed to drivers who like new technology and care about the environment, said Steve Sturm, Toyota's vice president for marketing.
Robert Ward, a retired career consultant and engineer who worked in the 1940's and 1950's on engine valves for cars and aircraft, said he bought an Insight partly because he liked the car but also to save energy.
"I think it's marvelous, but I also think we as a people need to have something that uses energy more efficiently," said Mr. Ward, who is 82 and lives in Portola Valley, Calif.
Mr. Pearce of G.M. said the auto industry was nonetheless concerned about emissions of both global-warming and smog-causing gases. "We know that our product impacts air quality; the solution has to be high-volume, most-efficient vehicles across the board," he said.
But small improvements in the fuel economy of the least-efficient vehicles can do more to reduce the nation's total fuel consumption than seemingly larger improvements for already efficient vehicles, Mr. Pearce pointed out.
If a sport utility with a conventional engine gets 15 miles a gallon, it needs 40 gallons for a 600-mile trip. Improving that to 20 miles a gallon will mean only 30 gallons are needed, saving 10 gallons.
By contrast, if a midsize car's mileage is improved to 40 from 25, its gas consumption on the same trip will fall to 15 gallons from 24, saving just nine gallons.
"The best surrogate for emissions," Mr. Pearce said, "is how much fossil fuel you burn."

HEADLINE: Court Papers Depict Scheme In Drug Billing 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
As Congress debates whether Medicare should be expanded to cover all prescription drugs, prosecutors have laid out evidence in court of how one drug company used the federal health care program and private insurers to make indirect payments to doctors who prescribed its drug.
 Prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Boston have charged a urologist with conspiring with a drug maker, identified in court filings as Company X, to receive excessive payments from Medicare, which investigators said were indirect kickbacks and bribes for writing prescriptions for Lupron, a drug used to treat prostate cancer. 
 Lupron is sold by TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a joint venture of Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., and Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan 
Details of the drug company's prolonged involvement appear in court documents filed by the government against the urologist, Dr. Joseph Spinella, of Bristol, Conn. 
One person close to the case said prosecutors were negotiating a settlement with TAP to resolve accusations that it had illegally used the Medicare system to help hundreds of doctors profit from prescribing Lupron. The person said the company might be required to pay penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Federal prosecutors and executives at TAP declined to comment on the case.
Under federal law, it is a crime to bill the government, patients or others for free drug samples. It is also a crime to pay kickbacks, bribes or rebates to doctors to induce them to prescribe a drug that Medicare pays for.
The system of helping doctors profit by prescribing Lupron has helped spawn a black market for the drug. In January, the United States attorney's office in Connecticut filed charges against two Florida doctors who ordered excess supplies of Lupron and then resold them at higher prices in other states, according to court papers. The two urologists have agreed to forfeit $1.1 million to the federal government.
Lawyers watching the case involving TAP said that it and a similar case involving the Bayer Corporation are the first of what would most likely be many more cases aimed at marketing tactics used by the pharmaceutical industry to have doctors prescribe their drugs.
"I think there is tremendous concern about the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical companies," said Kathleen McDermott, a former federal prosecutor who works at the law firm of Blank Rome Comisky & McCauley in Baltimore. "I think you'll see many more investigations of those relationships."
Already, federal and state officials are investigating whether other drug companies may have used the Medicare and Medicaid programs to help doctors get excessive government reimbursements for certain drugs.
Last month, Bayer agreed to pay $14 million to settle charges that it had caused doctors and hospitals to submit inflated claims for prescription drugs used by Medicaid patients.
Last fall, after an 18-month investigation, the House Commerce Committee concluded that many drug companies were behind similar excessive claims because they publicly reported an average wholesale price for their drugs that was much higher than the price they actually charged doctors and pharmacies.
Both the Medicare program, which covers seniors, and the Medicaid program, which covers the poor, have long reimbursed health care providers based on a percentage of the average wholesale price. When drug companies charge doctors far less than the average wholesale price to buy the drug, the doctors can profit from each prescription they write.
The system has been repeatedly criticized over the years, but the rules have not been changed. And many doctors and other health care providers say that the high reimbursements for prescription drugs are justified because Medicare and Medicaid do not adequately cover the other costs of patient care.
But with Lupron, federal prosecutors said the drug maker allowed hundreds of doctors to profit when they prescribed the drug.
According to the case filed in December against Dr. Spinella, a drug maker identified as Company X "deliberately and intentionally" charged doctors prices that were substantially less than the average wholesale price. While prosecutors did not identify Company X by name, they said it "sold and provided the drug Lupron to urologists across the country." TAP is the only company that sells Lupron. 
Prosecutors said the company told Dr. Spinella to bill the government the average wholesale price for Lupron rather than the lower amount it charged him.
Prosecutors said the company also gave Dr. Spinella free samples of Lupron, which he then charged to Medicare as if he had paid for them, netting thousands of dollars.
"It was Company X's objective, in part," court papers said, "to use the Medicare program as its checkbook for the indirect payment of kickbacks and bribes to physicians like Joseph Spinella."
Dr. Spinella, who declined to comment, is charged with conspiring with the drug company to receive kickbacks. His lawyer, George C. McMahon, said Dr. Spinella was working with prosecutors "to straighten this out."
Early last year, another urologist, Dr. Rodney Mannion of Michigan City, Ind., was charged with conspiring to bill insurance companies for free samples of Lupron that he had received from TAP. Dr. Mannion pleaded guilty in April and is awaiting sentencing.
In November, prosecutors made a similar charge against Dr. Jacob Zamstein, a urologist in Bloomfield, Conn. Dr. Zamstein did not return phone calls. Dr. Mannion referred calls to his lawyer, who did not return several messages.
Michael A. Pretl, general counsel for the American Urological Association, said federal investigators looking into the marketing of Lupron have asked to see the financial records over the last two years of at least 100 urologists. Most of the doctors have not received further inquiries from investigators, Mr. Pretl said.
Medicare now pays for only a limited number of prescription drugs, but Congress is discussing proposals that would expand Medicare to cover most prescription drugs. Many of those drugs are injectible medicines for cancer patients that are given in a doctor's office. Medicare also covers vaccines like those for influenza or hepatitis B. In 1999, doctors and other providers billed Medicare $620 million for prescriptions of Lupron. Medicare paid 80 percent of that amount, while patients or insurance companies paid the rest.
Lupron is not the only drug available to treat prostate cancer. For the last decade, TAP has been in a marketing battle with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, which makes Zoladex. Lupron is preferred by many prostate cancer patients because it is less painful when injected, but Lupron is more expensive than Zoladex.
In the case against Dr. Spinella, prosecutors said that the drug company referred to the additional Medicare reimbursements that doctors could make by prescribing Lupron as its "Return to Practice" program, and referred to the inflated government reimbursements as money going to the doctor from the company's "checkbook."
According to court papers, the company manipulated the average wholesale price so that doctors would receive more money from Medicare by prescribing Lupron than they could by prescribing Zoladex. 
In August 1995, prosecutors said, an employee of Dr. Spinella told the drug company that the doctor had switched 26 of his patients to Zoladex from Lupron. A drug comany employee then left Dr. Spinella with a document that described how the doctor could earn as much as $7,000 in extra Medicare reimbursements by prescribing Lupron rather than Zoladex, court papers said.
In October 1995, Dr. Spinella told the company that he understood he could earn a greater profit by prescribing Lupron, but that he also wanted free samples of Lupron. A month later, Dr. Spinella told the company that he had 30 patients on Zoladex and that for each free monthly dose of Lupron that he received, he would switch one patient back to Lupron. The average wholesale price for a monthly dose of Lupron in 1995 was almost $500, according to court papers.
Prosecutors said Dr. Spinella and the company "knew, understood and expected" that the doctor would then bill Medicare and patients for those free samples and that those payments "would be a kickback and bribe" paid in exchange for the doctor's business.
Prosecutors said that Dr. Spinella received 30 free doses in late November and early December 1995, and that he later received $15,000 in reimbursements for those samples.

Powell's First Memo

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Wouldn't it be interesting if Secretary of State Colin Powell sent the following memo to President Bush? 
 Dear Mr. President: I'm glad you decided to bomb Iraq to re-establish our deterrence there, but we shouldn't let these fireworks fool us into believing that we have a sustainable Iraq policy. We do not. Right now we're getting the worst of all worlds -- we're being blamed and isolated in the Arab world for something that we're not even succeeding at doing -- either toppling Saddam or inspecting his weapons facilities. It's time for a radical new approach. We need to remember that while getting rid of Saddam is our preference, rendering him harmless to his neighbors -- in a way that does not isolate us in the region -- is our strategic interest. 
 I'm off soon to the Middle East and I would like your permission to explore a whole new approach to Iraq. I would declare the following: The U.S. is ready to resume full diplomatic relations with Iraq, and to lift economic sanctions, under three conditions: First, that all U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq will be resumed -- but with a twist. All the weapons inspectors will be from the United States and the United States alone -- no Russians, no French, no Indians, nobody else. Our strategic interest is to ensure that Iraq cannot develop and is not developing weapons of mass destruction, and we will not entrust anyone else with that mission. We have to do it ourselves, and we have to do it as long as is necessary to ensure that Iraq remains free of nuclear weapons and delivery systems. So we're offering U.S. relations for U.S. inspections.
Second, Iraq, and the U.N., would have to agree to a ban on all sales of major weapons and dual-use items to Iraq, with the U.S. again free to use its inspectors to ensure compliance. Third, Saddam would have to continue abiding by limitations on his troop movements, either north or south, and if he violates any of these conditions the sanctions and bombing would resume. If he agrees, Iraq would be welcomed back into the family of nations.
What are the advantages of this approach? To begin with, we put the onus on Saddam instead of on ourselves. The message to the Iraqi people and to the Arab street is that the U.S. is not out to get rid of an Arab leader, however evil, it is not out to starve the Iraqi people, and it is not out to isolate Iraq forever. It is out to guarantee that Iraq cannot threaten its neighbors or global stability, and if Iraq meets that test it can end its isolation and even have relations with America, which is what the Iraqis really want.
Moreover, we put the onus on our Arab allies. They will no longer be able to escape bringing pressure on Yasir Arafat, or more openly cooperating on peace, by hiding behind the excuse that because we're always bombing Iraq their publics won't let them work with us on Israel. Right now our Arab allies are drifting away from us and Israel and toward Iraq. This policy would create a magnet to pull Iraq toward our Arab friends and Israel, something Ariel Sharon would love.
Finally, nothing, Mr. President, and I mean nothing, could change the strategic landscape in the Mideast more than bringing Iraq back into the equation, with diplomatic relations with the U.S. The hard-liners in Iran would be terrified and more isolated than ever. Syria would be much more willing to cooperate with us. And the Russians and the French would go nuts, because they want the sanctions on Iraq to just crumble, and for Iraq to continue having no relations with us, so their oil companies and exporters will have Iraq all to themselves.
In sum, Mr. President, this approach would make clear to everyone that your foreign policy isn't just a clone of your father's -- but that it will be hard-headed, imaginative and capable of overcoming the contradictions in our Middle East policies that have plagued us for a decade. If Saddam accepts this proposal, it would give us the best means possible to control Iraq's military capabilities. And if Saddam rejects this proposal, it would give us the best reason possible for further isolating him instead of ourselves.
Sure, some of your advisers will tell you it makes us look weak, but no one is going to accuse an administration with me, Dick Cheney and a president named Bush of being weak on Iraq. And even if anyone does, we still have time to blame it all on Bill Clinton.
Looking forward to your reaction. 
Colin

Mergers in Australia Stir A Debate Over Competition

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Caught between the competing pressures of global consolidation and energetic antitrust enforcement, many Australian companies are coming to the uncomfortable realization that they may have become both too big to merge and too small not to. 
 Australia is a prosperous and attractive market, but with a population of 20 million people and an economy roughly half the size of California's, successful companies in many industries here can run out of room to grow at home before they have reached a globally competitive scale. 
 The usual alternative for such companies is a cross-border merger, but those are problematic in Australia. Its sprawling land mass and geographic isolation limit the pool of plausible partners and potential savings from a merger. 
And having home-grown businesses move their headquarters overseas or be swallowed by foreign owners is becoming a political sore point.
The prime minister, John Howard, said last week in a television appearance that he was determined to ensure that Australia "doesn't become a branch-office economy."
These factors are leaving companies here increasingly unable either to buy or to find a buyer, domestic or foreign, who can pass political and antitrust muster.
"It's a direct conflict of globalization and sovereignty," said Chris Mackay, head of corporate finance at UBS Warburg in Sydney.
Australia's banking industry, for instance, is dominated by four institutions, which together control 75 percent of the market. The government has told them that they may not merge with one another. Yet even putting all four together into one bank would yield an institution smaller than HSBC.
The story is similar with airlines, (two major national carriers), grocery retailing (three big companies), steel (three), iron ore (two) and others. "It is a dilemma," said Robert L. Joss, dean of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, who headed Australia's sixth-largest company, the Westpac Banking Corporation, from 1993 to 1999. "How do you avoid creating a cozy situation?"
Allan Fels, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, tries to prevent cozy situations, and he takes an activist approach to the job -- as when the commission ruled last month that neither Qantas Airways nor Ansett Australia, which is a unit of Air New Zealand, the two national airlines, could buy Hazelton Airlines, a regional carrier they both wanted.
Geoff Dixon, who takes over as the chief executive of Qantas next month, criticized the decision and dropped the bid. "The A.C.C.C.'s apparent view that a multiplicity of competitors be available in all sectors of the Australian market, regardless of financial viability, is disturbing," Mr. Dixon said. "Particularly in view of the rationalization and consolidation taking place in the global aviation industry."
Hazelton's management wanted the company to be taken over because, without a deal, "competitive pressures, government policies and capital requirements will further restrict the growth of Hazelton and limit its ability to be a strong and viable competitor," said the airline's chairman, Stan Quinlivan. 
Ansett Australia has continued accumulating commitments from Hazelton shareholders despite the commission's ruling, but there is no assurance that a revised takeover plan will be approved. 
If it is not? "There is a real chance that Hazelton will die," said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, a research firm and consultancy in Australia. And given global consolidation, Mr. Dixon of Qantas said, Australia's carriers risk being "relegated to cottage-industry status." 
Regulators do not accept that assessment. "Every applicant for a merger cites globalization arguments," Mr. Fels said. "As a matter of fact, I've never not heard it."
The commission is far from reflexively antimerger. It has blocked only 25 deals of 500 examined the last three years, and its guidelines favor consolidation in some cases, such as when imports hold a substantial share of the Australian market for a product. 
Yet the commission stops some deals before they are even put together. As Cable and Wireless tries to sell C & W Optus, its Australian telecommunications unit, it received strong interest from Vodafone Pacific, a unit of the Vodafone Group of Britain. But because Vodafone is already No. 3 in the Australian cellular market with 19 percent, Mr. Fels weighed in quickly with a declaration that combining it with Optus, which is No. 2 with 33 percent, would "raise serious problems."
Vodafone responded with a proposal earlier this month to buy Optus and immediately resell a chunk of its mobile phone business and other assets to Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd., reducing Vodafone's ultimate share to about 40 percent and preserving a substantial third presence in the market. Regulators are reviewing the proposal.
Mr. Fels also moved to pre-empt any possibility that the country's biggest supermarket retailers, Coles Myer Ltd. and Woolworths, which is unrelated to the former United States company of the same name, might bid for stakes in the third-biggest, Franklins, which is struggling financially and is widely expected to be sold by its parent, Dairy Farm International Holdings of Hong Kong.
Because Coles Myer and Woolworths together have 70 percent of the market, Mr. Fels has said in interviews that the commission would have "great difficulty" letting either one get a share of Franklins. 
Mr. Fels wields the commission's power with considerable autonomy because he enjoys political support from both major parties in Australia -- first appointed in 1995 by a Labor government and given another term in office last year by the current conservative coalition government. Fear of a backlash among voters has helped align politicians with the commission on issues like bank mergers, which are unpopular. 
Left with little choice, the four big banks have so far found ways to grow and cut costs without merging with each other. They have created joint ventures to share some back-office functions, and have expanded overseas, where the National Australia Bank Ltd., for instance, now gets nearly half its revenue. 
The commission, too, has done some adapting to new realities, Mr. Fels said, and it is not wholly unresponsive to arguments that in some industries, Australia may no longer be big enough for as many viable competitors as in the past. "The real job of the regulator," Mr. Fels said, "is to try to distinguish between the valid and the invalid claims."

HEADLINE: Air Traffic Paralysis 

 BODY:
The nation's air traffic congestion can no longer be thought of as merely an annoyance, or a nettlesome transportation issue. It is a growing economic ill as well, and the Bush administration ought to address it as such. Instead of seeking to cut the Federal Aviation Administration's 2002 budget by some $568 million, as proposed by the Office of Management and Budget, President Bush should develop a comprehensive long-term strategy to meet the growing demand for air travel. Thinking of ways to speed up the development of new satellite navigation systems and the building of new runways at major airports would be a good start. 
 What any frequent flier could guess from experience is now official. Last year was the worst on record for flight delays. More than a quarter of all flights nationwide were delayed. The airport with the most delays was New York's La Guardia. 
 An analysis performed by the Department of Transportation for The Times shows that half of the 100 most frequently canceled or severely delayed flights last year were scheduled to land at or take off from La Guardia. That includes 7 of the top 10. Newark claimed two of the remaining three, meaning 9 of the 10 most delayed flights nationwide inconvenienced New York area travelers.
La Guardia is a microcosm of the crisis confronting the nation's aviation system. The system's existing infrastructure is incapable of meeting the burgeoning demand for air travel. That is certainly the case at La Guardia, with its limited runways and terminal areas. 
Yet last year Congress lifted a longstanding curb on further growth at La Guardia to encourage service to new markets, and some 400 daily flights were added. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey rightly prodded the Federal Aviation Administration to intervene, and cut that number to a more manageable level. As a result, La Guardia is expected to be slightly more tolerable this year. The Port Authority and the F.A.A. can further ameliorate matters by urging airlines to be more realistic in scheduling flights and by creating market incentives to shift some flights to off-peak hours.
There is no short-term relief in sight for the overall system, as Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, the lone Democrat in the Bush cabinet, warned in his confirmation hearings last month. Barring a prolonged recession, the demand for air travel should continue to explode. Last year 655 million passengers boarded a flight, some 200 million more than in 1991, and the number is expected to surpass a billion in this decade. 
Mr. Mineta is a proponent of speeding up the building of new runways and of enhancing the air traffic control system. But he will accomplish little if President Bush decides not to make this a budgetary priority.

HEADLINE: National Park Status Sought For Paterson Waterfall Site 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., Feb. 19 

 BODY:
New Jersey's two United States senators and one of its House members opened a campaign today to create a national park around the Great Falls, Paterson's landmark and the essence of its birth as a major manufacturing center after the Revolutionary War.
 "You're standing on hallowed ground; it's precious land," Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a former mayor of Paterson, told about 50 preservationists and local government officials as the falls in the background tumbled 77 feet into a gorge. The group was clustered on a promenade beneath a statue of Alexander Hamilton, who founded Paterson in 1792 on the dream of harnessing the falls' power for industry. 
 Senator Robert G. Torricelli said that Hamilton's vision led to the Industrial Revolution, likening its historical importance to Thomas Jefferson's vision of Washington as a cradle of democracy. Designating the falls as a national park would create a "window into America's industrial past," Mr. Torricelli said.
New Jersey's other senator, Jon S. Corzine, was not there but released a statement saying he hoped the campaign for a park would produce the best way to "create living history" of the community's technological and social innovation in the 1800's.
The three lawmakers have introduced legislation that would require the federal Interior Department to explore the suitability of the Great Falls for a national park. Designation as a park, they said, could lead to millions of dollar in federal money to speed restoration of old factories that decades ago hummed with the production of silk fabrics, locomotives and Colt revolvers.
They said they also envisioned restaurants, museums and other attractions for schoolchildren and tourists near the site. Designation as a park would also provide badly needed full-time staffing for the site by the National Park Service, they said.
The Interior Department declared the Great Falls and about 118 acres around it a national historic landmark in 1976. Nine years earlier, the department dedicated the falls as a natural landmark. During the 1990's, the federal government provided about $7 million for renovation of old factories and construction of pathways and bridges for visitors. 
Senators Torricelli and Corzine and Representative Pascrell, who was mayor of Paterson from 1990 to 1996, said they hoped their legislation would bring millions of dollars more and quicken the pace of revival.
Mr. Pascrell suggested that Paterson's current leaders were less than enthusiastic about working with the Interior Department and about providing local money to help with the renovations the federal government financed in the 1990's.
"My goal is to create a partnership between Paterson and the National Park Service," Mr. Pascrell said. "I'm confident the City of Paterson is up to the task."
Paterson's mayor, Martin Barnes, who attended today's ceremony, said he endorsed the idea that a national park would be good for Paterson's economy.
"We will give everything we can possibly give," Mr. Barnes said, "because it's the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut News for Mr. Bush 

 BODY:
For a while, President Bush's proposal for a $1.6 trillion tax cut seemed to be immune to the rules of legislative reality. Republicans who wanted to make it bigger seemed to outnumber Democrats wanting to cut it back. Last week, however, Mr. Bush got some sobering news from a leader of his own party, Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee. He reported to the White House that critics of the tax cut had begun making headway even among Republicans with the argument that it is too big, unfair and unlikely to help the economy. We have been urging Democrats to stick together and fight the tax cuts. Today we urge moderate Republicans to listen to the tough appraisal of their own party colleagues. 
 It is Mr. Domenici's job to count votes in the Senate and to count numbers in the budget. The word he carried to the White House was that Senators Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Jim Jeffords of Vermont had defected from the Republican camp and decided not to support the tax cut as it is now constituted. On top of these Republicans, Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine, George Voinovich of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have expressed varying degrees of dismay about the tax cut's cost and its reliance on surpluses that may not materialize. Waiting in the wings is Senator John McCain, who appears ready to revive his presidential campaign opposition to the Bush proposal. In a Senate evenly divided between the two parties, these Republican misgivings are balanced so far by the premature defection of only one Democrat, Zell Miller of Georgia. 
 Mr. Bush was said to have replied to Mr. Domenici that he hoped to persuade doubting senators that the tax cut was affordable when he unveiled his own budget projections at the end of this month. But the betting among many experts is that his budget will, if anything, do the opposite. The administration has signaled that it will not project any increase in the size of the surplus, but that it will show increases in aid for education and defense. In other spending areas, the budget director, Mitchell Daniels, has publicly advocated a return to some kind of budget caps to rein in spending. The administration wants to put a stop to the increases in discretionary federal spending that it estimates have averaged 6 percent over the last few years. 
What that means is that the administration will almost certainly come in with budget cuts in some areas that it considers peripheral to its agenda. On Capitol Hill, the heads of appropriations committees can already be heard complaining that Congress might have to impose budget ceilings in the spring to help pay for the tax cut. Such spending cuts -- for example, in key areas like housing, transportation and the environment -- would make it clearer than ever that the Bush tax-cut proposals are too costly because they use up the federal surpluses for a giveaway to the wealthy.
The Democrats finally presented a counterproposal last week on using the 10-year surplus of more than $2 trillion generated outside Medicare and Social Security. They would tap a third of it for tax cuts, a third for extra spending and a third to pay down the debt. The Democrats' proposal for a tax cut is more than double what Vice President Al Gore was willing to embrace in the recent hard-fought election campaign. It is testimony to the hard political reality that with White House pressure, a sizable surplus and a possibly sagging economy, some tax cuts are inevitable. But the Democrats' proposal sounds to us like a reasonable starting point.
We have argued that the tax cut is too weighted to the wealthy, and that Congress must as a first priority rewrite its provisions to make sure that its benefits go at least as much to the working class and middle class as the wealthy. Right now the proposal heaps its bounty on the very people who have benefited the most from the economic gains of recent years, and it has badly shortchanged nearly half the taxpaying population at the lower end of the scale. But if the tax cut is not scaled back in size altogether, it runs the risk of leaving no extra money for other purposes, even those like defense and education where the administration says it wants to increase spending. The numbers demonstrating the inequity of the tax cut are likely to become even more clear in the weeks to come, and Republicans who ignore them risk a bare-bones budget and booming deficits.

HEADLINE: BUSH V. GORE: A special report.; 
Election Case a Test and a Trauma for Justices

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The last time the justices of the Supreme Court appeared together in public was at the inauguration of President George W. Bush, their presence on the platform providing the starkest reminder possible of the court's extraordinary role in deciding the outcome of the 2000 election.
 In recess since that wintry afternoon, the court as an institution has been all but invisible. But the justices themselves have been busy. Across the court's ideological spectrum, in ways both subtle and direct, they have been reaching out to reassure the public -- and perhaps each other -- that all is well at the court despite the bitter words spoken and deep divisions revealed by the 5-to-4 vote in Bush v. Gore. 
 From Justice Stephen G. Breyer's remark to a law school audience in Lawrence, Kan., that the explanation for the decision "isn't ideology and it isn't politics" to Justice Antonin Scalia's comment to law students in San Diego that "if you can't disagree without hating each other, you better find another profession other than the law," the justices are behaving almost like survivors of a natural disaster who need to talk about what happened in order to regain their footing and move on. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, speaking at the University of Melbourne Law School in Australia, in no way receded from her view that the decision was seriously misguided. But both for her foreign audience and for the domestic one to which the court's press office distributed her text, she offered a measured and nuanced account of the context in which the election controversy reached the court and of the belief among respected opinion leaders that a national crisis required the court's intervention.
As the justices have made their rounds of law school forums and civic events, their eagerness to discuss the court's current mood has not, unsurprisingly, been matched by a willingness to reveal the internal deliberations over the 20-day period in which the court received, accepted and decided the Bush legal team's two appeals from consecutive rulings of the Florida Supreme Court.
The justices regard the deliberations of "the conference" -- the nine meeting alone behind closed doors -- as close to sacrosanct. They met privately, without even their law clerks present, three times on the election cases, and details of those conversations remain private. Consequently, any effort to construct a narrative of those 20 days encounters substantial gaps and intriguing unanswered questions.
Nonetheless, it has been possible through reporting at the court and a close rereading of the court's opinions during the period to gain fresh insight into some central moments in the all-consuming event. It was a drama that from the beginning generated more internal conflict than was generally known and that ended with the exhausted justices working into the night, drawing their window blinds against the penetrating glare of the television satellite trucks that ringed the court as the country waited to learn whether the 2000 presidential election was finally over.
In their public remarks, justices from across the divide of the decision have sent a twofold message: first, that the court was engaged in an appropriately judicial act rather than an illegitimately political one (significantly, this message was delivered by the Bush v. Gore dissenters); and second, that despite their sharp disagreement, the justices can still get along and their institutional bond remains strong. Indeed, not three weeks after the Dec. 12 decision, Justice Scalia and his wife, Maureen, joined Justice Ginsburg and her husband, Martin, for a New Year's Eve dinner, a tradition the two ideologically opposite justices have maintained for years.
The imperative of moving on to the next case is a powerful one at the court, and there is little doubt as the court reconvenes Tuesday that the justices' view is on the cases that lie ahead rather than on the trauma they are working to put behind them.
But 10 weeks after Bush v. Gore, the full extent of that trauma, both for the court and for the justices as individuals, is nonetheless coming into some focus.
Throughout the period, events moved so quickly that only in retrospect have some elements become clear; for example, that the opaque unanimous opinion by which the court decided the first appeal was intended as a considerably sharper warning to the Florida Supreme Court than its mild language and bland tone suggested. 
And it is also obvious now that there was a general misreading of the justices' initial decision in the first appeal to discard the Bush legal team's equal-protection challenge to the Florida recount. That claim, based on the argument that a partial recount in only four counties violated the 14th Amendment by weighting some votes more than others, was then still pending in a companion case before a federal appeals court. The justices' decision to delete the equal-protection issue from the first Bush appeal reflected a conclusion that the question was not yet ripe for review rather than that it was uninteresting or irrelevant.
In fact, during the argument in the second case, two of the justices who eventually dissented, Justice Breyer and Justice David H. Souter, became close allies and tried to build a strategy for rescuing the recount based on the expressed equal-protection concerns of one justice, Anthony M. Kennedy. But Justice Kennedy instead became the co-author of the majority decision that rejected further counting.
Whether Justices Breyer and Souter ever had a realistic chance of turning the outcome around, and how close they might have come, remain unanswered questions. While the Gore lawyers had hoped to sway both Justice Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, two Stanford graduates who often find themselves allies on the more moderate end of the court's dominant conservative wing, it appears that Justice O'Connor did not waver in her position against recounts.
While it is already fading into a single seamless blur, the Supreme Court's involvement in the election proceeded in a series of discrete steps. There were two separate cases. The first, Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, was an appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's decision to order a 12-day extension for certifying the results of recounts in four counties. It was argued on Dec. 1 and decided three days later with a unanimous decision that told the Florida court to do a better job of explaining its rationale for the extension.
The second case, Bush v. Gore, was an appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's decision ordering a statewide recount of the "undervotes," ballots that machines had read as indicating no presidential choice. Argued on Dec. 11, it was decided late the next night by a 5-to-4 decision declaring that the lack of uniform standards for counting the votes made the recount unconstitutional. 
The majority said there was no time to send the case back for a better recount because it was already Dec. 12, the date set by federal election law by which electors had to be chosen if their right to cast their state's electoral votes was to be immune from challenge. With the dissenters arguing vainly that the only deadline that mattered was the Dec. 18 date for casting electoral votes, and with Vice President Al Gore trailing by a few hundred votes, the contest for Florida's decisive 25 electoral votes was over.
Based on the best available information, and in some instances on a new reading of the court's published opinions in light of that information, what follows is a chronological account of how the Supreme Court came to decide the presidential election.

Opening the Floodgate
When the court announced on the day after Thanksgiving that it would hear the first Bush appeal, surprising nearly all who had assumed the justices would do their best to stay away from a politically charged case that appeared completely grounded in state law, there was considerable speculation about what lay behind the decision. The announcement was unsigned and gave no indication of the vote. The votes of four justices are required to accept a case. There was no way to tell whether the court was divided on the wisdom of granting the case or whether perhaps the court as a whole, sensing that the problem in Florida might be spinning out of control, had concluded that it was prudent to intervene sooner rather than later.
It is now known that the court was sharply split. The move to hear the case, driven by the justices who eventually ruled in Mr. Bush's favor, foreshadowed and helped shape the later division on the court, a division that the intervening unanimous decision papered over even more thinly than it appeared to at the time.
While the Bush team did not bring the case to the court until Nov. 22, the justices were hardly oblivious to what was taking place in Florida. The state-court struggle over the partial recount and its timetable had already spilled over into federal court, where the Bush lawyers had raised objections based on the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. That drew the justices' attention by positioning the dispute as one of constitutional dimension, and therefore potentially within the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, as opposed to a state-law question of the procedures for conducting a recount, an issue that would remain the province of the Florida court system.
As the federal case moved quickly up the judicial ladder, one justice who watched with particular interest was Justice Kennedy. As circuit justice for the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, he has administrative responsibility for emergency cases reaching the court from federal and state courts in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
Named to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 to fill a seat left open by the failure of Robert H. Bork's nomination, Justice Kennedy occupies a central and somewhat ambiguous position on the court. Despite Justice Kennedy's strong opposition to policies that take race into account in redistricting or public contracting, his votes to reaffirm the right to abortion and to strike down an anti-gay provision of the Colorado Constitution have nonetheless made him an object of suspicion among conservatives.
In the court's previous term, Justice Kennedy had written the majority opinion in a Hawaii case that raised equal-protection concerns about a special-election system there. The equal-protection argument in the Bush team's federal case caught Justice Kennedy's attention.
As it happened, appeals in both the federal and state cases reached the court simultaneously on Thanksgiving eve. But the federal case was procedurally unattractive because the appeals court had not yet ruled. The Bush lawyers were asking the justices to skip over the appeals court and address the refusal of a federal district judge in Miami, Donald M. Middlebrooks, to stop the recount. Although the Supreme Court has the authority to intervene at this stage, it rarely does.
The state case, by contrast, was ripe for review. The Florida Supreme Court had issued a definitive ruling the day before to extend the certification deadline by 12 days so that the recounts sought by the Gore team in four counties could be completed. That unanimous decision by a state court the justices knew well for its liberal leanings struck some justices as a partisan effort to manipulate the rules in order to bring about a Gore victory.
The justices who became the dissenters in Bush v. Gore assumed the court would stay away from the Florida election. They were startled to learn from a memorandum that circulated shortly before the justices met on the day after Thanksgiving to discuss the appeals that the votes were there to take the state court case. The eventual dissenters' objections were unavailing, and the discussion turned to which issues the court was prepared to consider.
The appeal from the state court decision also included an equal-protection claim, although as something of an afterthought compared with the central role for equal protection in the federal case. The main questions in the appeal were, first, the meaning and enforceability of a federal law offering a state's electors a "safe harbor" from later challenge if they are chosen by procedures in effect before Election Day; and second, whether the state court's decision extending the vote-counting deadline had unconstitutionally supplanted the role of the Legislature.
Despite their interest in the equal-protection issue, the justices decided to excise it in order to allow the federal appeals court to consider it in the more fully developed context of the federal case. The federal appeal, in turn, was denied "without prejudice," a signal that the disposition was essentially procedural and an invitation to the Bush lawyers to present the question again later.
In retrospect, it is tempting to conclude that the initial fateful decision to hear the first case made the eventual outcome all but inevitable, that a narrow majority had set the court on a path from which there was no other logical exit unless the Florida Supreme Court itself backed down. That view is held in some quarters at the court, but it is not the only view; like much about the election cases, even in the simplest narrative form, perspectives differ and considerable ambiguity remains.

A Winner With a Grievance
In any event, even as the court braced itself for the Dec. 1 argument in the first case, the picture on the ground in Florida was changing rapidly. The extended recount period ended on Nov. 26 with Mr. Bush still ahead. The Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, declared him the winner, leaving him in an odd position as a Supreme Court appellant. As a practical matter, Mr. Bush could claim no injury from the decision he was appealing. Under Florida election law, the "protest" phase for challenging the vote count was now over. One question obviously on the justices' minds during the first argument was whether the case still mattered.
The argument itself did not dispel the doubts about the appeal's continued relevance, a fact that may have made it easier for the court to reach a compromise in the form of the unsigned six-page opinion issued midmorning on Monday, Dec. 4. The ruling vacated the Florida Supreme Court's Nov. 21 decision and instructed the state court to demonstrate it had taken proper account of certain statutory and constitutional provisions governing federal elections.

Decoding a 9-to-0 Ruling
Opacity may have been the price of unanimity; in retrospect, it is clear there was a rather strong message contained within the cryptic opinion and that the court's queries to the Florida justices reflected more than an abstract interest in the outcome. But the pace of events in Florida was such that some justices who retained strong doubts about whether the court should be in the case at all could at least take cold comfort from the growing assumption that the election would be over before the case could come back to haunt the Supreme Court again.
That assumption appeared to be validated when, within hours, Judge N. Sanders Sauls of the state circuit court in Tallahassee issued a sweeping rejection of Mr. Gore's challenge to Mr. Bush's certified victory. But late in the week, the Florida Supreme Court weighed in again, not only reversing Judge Sauls but also ordering a statewide recount of the undervotes to begin the next day.
The breadth of that decision was startling, and even some justices who eventually ruled that the recount should go forward were momentarily taken aback. To the eventual majority, the decision was not only startling, but wrong. As Justice O'Connor was to indicate by her questions from the bench, it appeared that the state court had willfully ignored a clear warning to reverse course. She is a tough and active questioner, a stickler for procedure who does not hide her displeasure when she suspects a lawyer, or a lower court, of cutting corners. A former majority leader of the Arizona State Senate, Justice O'Connor, a Republican, is the only current justice to have held elective office.
Within hours of the state court's ruling on Friday, Dec. 8, the Bush team had filed both an appeal and a request for a stay of the imminent recount. The endgame had begun, and tightly packed into the next four days would come moments of high drama and emotion.
The eventual dissenters expected the court to hear the appeal swiftly, but the decision to stop the recount in the meantime came as a shock. The tension and anger that the court had managed to contain under a veneer of civility erupted for all to see. There were now, openly, two sides, and the vote was 5 to 4. 
The pace of events, already scarcely believable by the Supreme Court's stately standards, was to become amazingly compressed: state court decision Friday afternoon; Supreme Court appeal filed Friday night; case accepted Saturday; briefs due Sunday; argument Monday; decision Tuesday. No one had seen anything like it. By the time three New York University Law School professors arrived at the court on Tuesday morning to interview law clerks for teaching positions, complete exhaustion had set in, and some clerks who had not canceled their long-scheduled appointments slept through them.
The justices met early on Saturday to consider the stay application and the appeal. The recount had just begun in Florida, but it was soon clear that the majority at the court had the votes to stop it. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, along with Justices Scalia, Kennedy, O'Connor, and Clarence Thomas, all voted to grant the stay.
On the other side was Justice John Paul Stevens, the senior associate justice and, at 80, the oldest member of the court. A Republican, named to the court by President Gerald Ford, he had become in many respects the most liberal justice and, on his side of the court, the most outspoken. Justices Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg voted with him. 
Like Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, a former attorney general and state supreme court justice from New Hampshire, was a lifelong Republican who found that his party's center of gravity had shifted uncomfortably to his right. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, President Bill Clinton's two appointments, were judicial moderates, both former law professors and federal appeals court judges whose instincts were to search for compromise rather than confrontation.
But there was to be no compromise at this point. Justice Stevens wrote a sharp three-paragraph dissent from the stay. The majority had "acted unwisely" to "stop the counting of legal votes," Justice Stevens said. The other three signed the dissent.
While a published dissent from an order like a stay is unusual, this one had the effect of goading Justice Scalia into doing something even more unusual, publishing a defense of the stay. The recount had to be stopped because it threatened "irreparable harm" to Mr. Bush, Justice Scalia said, "by casting a cloud on what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election." 
No one on Justice Scalia's side signed his opinion; some questioned the wisdom of publishing it and further revealing the court's internal conflict. If any one justice was to have made such a public statement, Justice Scalia, who relishes intellectual combat and has never been known to pull punches, was certainly the most likely candidate.
The absence of other signatures on the Scalia opinion made him appear to be the driving force behind the court's action, but that was not the case. Although his role was less visible, Chief Justice Rehnquist took an active part from the beginning in shaping the court's response to the events in Florida. Approaching his 29th anniversary on the court, with nearly 15 years as chief justice, he runs the court with a firm hand and views stepping up to the big cases as part of his institutional responsibility. But in the end, he tried and ultimately failed to speak for the court in this case.
Following the vote on the stay, the dissenters were shaken and demoralized, fearful that the court, having so narrowly dodged a bullet by managing to turn out a unanimous opinion the previous weekend, was about to do itself great harm. The court is not a place where people casually drop in to one another's offices to chat, but the dissenters reached out to one another for moral support. A consolation was that Justice Scalia had taken the bait of the Stevens dissent, perhaps giving the public a warning of what now seemed an inevitable outcome.

A Rationale for Mistrust
With the case set for argument, each side faced a challenge. For the dissenters, the question was whether there was any strategy by which they could split the majority and get the recount going again. For the majority, the deep mistrust they shared of the Florida Supreme Court's motives was not matched by an agreed-upon view of where exactly, as a legal matter, the state court had gone wrong. The majority had a conclusion in search of a rationale.
The equal-protection issue was before the court again, but it had evolved into something new. The question was no longer whether it was constitutional to recount votes in some counties and not others, but whether it was constitutional to count votes by standards that differed from county to county. This evolution gave Justice Breyer something to work with. If a lack of uniform standards was the problem, the solution was obvious: establish a standard, or instruct the Florida court to set one, and start counting.
During the argument on Monday morning, it was evident that Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Souter, was offering this option in an effort to sway Justice Kennedy and perhaps Justice O'Connor. Both had expressed some uncertainty about the other legal theories behind the Bush appeal. But they gave no indication during the argument of being receptive to Justice Breyer's approach. The question was whether the Florida Supreme Court could be trusted to supervise a recount under any circumstances. It appears that for Justice O'Connor, the answer was decidedly no. Justice Kennedy came more slowly and ambivalently to the same conclusion. There would be no more counting.
Even if Justice Kennedy had been open to Justice Breyer's persuasion, it is not clear what would have happened next. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens did not agree that the recount as ordered by the Florida court posed a problem of constitutional dimension. For them, therefore, there was no need for a remand or for new standards. Whether to join a compromise that took such a need as its starting premise was a decision they ultimately did not have to confront because the compromise did not gel.

'Loser Is Perfectly Clear'
Although the outcome was clear by Monday night, the justices' work was not done. Justice Stevens drafted a dissenting opinion whose bitter words became the most widely quoted language from any of the opinions. The majority's position "can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land," he wrote, adding: "Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law." Justice Stevens left Washington for his second home, in South Florida, as he had long planned for the year-end recess that was supposed to be under way.
Justices Breyer and Ginsburg signed the Stevens dissent while each offering an individual view as well. (While Justice Ginsburg's opinion drew considerable notice for its omission of the adverb "respectfully" from the closing "I dissent," that was a choice, it was pointed out, that she frequently made for economy of style rather than to convey a particular level of anger.) 
Justice Souter did not sign. He wrote his own dissent and also signed the major portion of the Ginsburg and Breyer dissents. While Justice Souter's writing style can be convoluted, in this instance it was so direct as to be almost conversational, his anger controlled but his extreme disappointment evident. "I write separately only to say how straightforward the issues before us really are," he said.
Photographs taken later of the justices as they drove out of the building's underground garage showed Justices Scalia and Breyer looking grim but determined, while Justice Souter looked hollow-eyed and ashen.
Throughout the building, justices worked into the night. The Supreme Court building is constructed around four interior courtyards, with the chambers arrayed around the outer perimeter, facing the street. The bright lights from the television networks' satellite trucks, mounted on high poles, shone into the justices' windows. Some found the harsh light unnerving, while to others, the public spotlight seemed somehow appropriate, given the gravity of the public's business being conducted inside. Supreme Court police officers made their rounds, advising justices and law clerks to draw the blinds in case someone tried to take pictures through the windows.

Majority but Not a Monolith
On the majority side, Chief Justice Rehnquist circulated an opinion that had the support of Justices Scalia and Thomas. It said that in ordering the recount, the Florida Supreme Court had unconstitutionally displaced a role reserved for the state legislature and had ignored the Florida Legislature's desire to give the state's electors the benefit of the "safe harbor" against later challenge on the floor of Congress that federal law offered to slates of electors chosen by Dec. 12. (While 20 states failed to meet the Dec. 12 deadline for submitting slates of electors without any jeopardizing their votes in the Electoral College, the outcome of the election in those states was not disputed. In Florida, by contrast, Republican legislative leaders had announced plans for a special session to choose the Legislature's own slate of Bush electors.)
But although intended as a majority opinion, the chief justice's opinion failed to get the support of Justices Kennedy and O'Connor. They drafted their own opinion, concluding that the standardless recount violated the guarantee of equal protection. Their opinion later caused some confusion by its reference to "seven justices of the court" who "agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount." That was true, but it was also beside the point, because by then the only question was whether there was a remedy for those problems, in the form of a restructured but continuing recount. On that question, the vote remained 5 to 4.

A Singular Case
It is not clear from the face of the Kennedy-O'Connor opinion, labeled only "per curiam," or "by the court," what disagreement they had with the Rehnquist opinion. In the first argument, Justice Kennedy had questioned whether the safe-harbor provision was legally enforceable. 
For Justice O'Connor, the broadly worded Rehnquist opinion may have violated her rule that the court should decide cases on the most narrow ground possible. The holding of the per curiam was as narrow as possible, "limited to the present circumstances," it said.
In order to permit the majority to speak with one voice, the chief justice and his two allies joined the Kennedy-O'Connor opinion. In language that was perhaps the result of negotiations between the majority's two factions, the opinion contained an unusual declaration that the principle it established was in effect a ticket for this train only.
"Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances," the opinion said, adding with considerable understatement, "for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities." 
The outcome was clearly one of convenience rather than the opening shot in a Rehnquist court equal-protection revolution. In fact, the most telling measure of whether the court has really put the election trauma behind it may be whether any dissenter is sly or mischievous enough to cite Bush v. Gore to bolster an equal-protection argument in a future case.

To the Editor:
 Re "Business Students Do an About-Face" (Business Day, Feb. 14): While immediate career prospects for business school students are undoubtedly different this year from last year, a closer look suggests that the long-range ambitions of my colleagues have remained steady. 
 Almost universally, my classmates and I hope to establish and contribute to organizations that create meaningful, lasting improvements in people's lives. 
This motivation has endured throughout the recent economic uncertainty.
Only a fraction of students from each class historically remain at their initial employers in the four years after graduation. Consequently, as we contemplate the potential contours of our careers, we strive to ensure that our thinking reflects timelines best measured in decades, not months.

HEADLINE: Goliath Shrimp (Gigantic Flavor, Too) 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
THEY stare up from the plate at Esca, a seafood restaurant in the theater district, like baleful prehistoric monsters, long feelers projecting forward under eyes the size of gray capers, their legs gathered and curled around their fleshy bodies, braised fennel strewn across the top. Their size is striking, as big as the arc made by the thumb and middle finger and as thick as a fat carrot. 
 Yes, these are shrimp, and not merely jumbo shrimp, as the quaint old oxymoron goes. They are "Chernobyl shrimp," as David Pasternack, the chef at Esca, gleefully puts it, the biggest of the jumbo, served with fearsome heads intact, and they are the outer limit of the giant shrimp that have been adorning plates all over New York. 
 At Aquagrill in SoHo, the huge shrimp arrive in a tender embrace over earthy cranberry beans and a sweet carrot sauce. At Smith Street Kitchen in Brooklyn, they rear up out of a bowl of bouillabaisse like breaching right whales getting ready to sound. At Oceana in Midtown, they are served in bouillabaisse as well as in a sliced spring roll, their tails spilling out of the wrappers like the ends of footlong hot dogs. 
"Attack of the Giant Shrimp" may sound like an awful B movie, but these monsters are winning raves from chefs. Not only are they big, appealing to the American propensity for size, but they taste great, full of the briny, shrimpy quality lacking in many of their lesser siblings.
"I'm always trying to get large shrimp," said Rick Moonen, the chef at Oceana. "It's that whole thing, bigger is better."
Until just a few years ago, shrimp distributors reserved their head-on shrimp for the European market, thinking that Americans would be repelled by them. Then one company started to sell the head-on shrimp to a few Portuguese restaurants seven or eight years ago, and they slowly began to show up in other sorts of restaurants, until they took off about two years ago.
The objects of chefs' shrimply affections are most often head-on Pacific white shrimp, technically Penaeus vannamei, caught wild off Guatemala and sold under the Maya brand name. For perspective, ordinary headless shrimp that are sold as "large" are 31 to 35 to the pound. Those called "jumbo" are sold 21 to 25 to the pound, while "super colossals" are fewer than 12 to the pound. The Maya head-on shrimp are about 5 to 10 to the pound, and occasionally even under 5 to the pound.
"They are almost the size of lobsters," Mr. Pasternack said. "People have a fascination with size, but they are also one of the great products on the market."
Flavor, of course, is the bottom line, and chefs seem almost unanimously to feel that those shrimp have the elusive qualities of taste and texture that they require. One reason is doubtless the head, which contains the tomalley, or liver, and the surrounding fat, which is packed with flavor. "The flavor is great," said Jeremy Marshall, the chef and co-owner of Aquagrill. "You can take the head off and suck it like a crayfish, and you get all that juicy, creamy flavor." 
While thoughts of sucking shrimp heads may inspire fantasies of T-shirts, beers and hunting camps in the Cajun bayous, it does seem to pose an icky obstacle to fastidious New Yorkers. Indeed, cursory observation suggests that New Yorkers spend more time pushing shrimp heads around on a plate than sucking on them.
"We can pop off the heads if it's a problem, but people can appreciate that there's more flavor," said Michael Brack, the lead chef and an owner at Smith Street Kitchen, who considers shrimp-head sucking in his dining room "a little overenthusiastic."
Whatever objections diners may have to sucking heads, though, they are embracing the shrimp with their eyes wide open.
"The consumption of large head-on shrimp has increased fivefold in a period of two years," said Richard Martin, an owner of Wild Edibles, a seafood wholesaler. "I think every chef in New York City knows what head-on Maya shrimp are now."
Mr. Martin remembers eating head-on shrimp all the time in Brittany, where he grew up, but says that Americans have shied away from seafood with heads. "It's work on the plate," he said. "It's like eating whole fish, which were practically nonexistent in restaurants five years ago."
The giant head-on shrimp were also practically nonexistent five years ago, when Val's Ocean Pacific, a Brooklyn wholesaler, started distributing them in the New York area. "At first a head-on shrimp like that was a hard sell, but a few Italian restaurants started using them and others picked up on it," said Val Ricca, the owner.
The Ladex Corporation in Miami has actually been importing and distributing Maya shrimp of all sizes in New York for 30 years, but always the headless variety, said Ralph Bru, the chief operating officer.
"About seven or eight years ago we started selling the head-on shrimp in New York for specialty markets, like Portuguese restaurants, and we started doing really well," Mr. Bru said. "And we've really seen a boom in the last two or three years."
The question of whether to serve shrimp with the heads is rarely up to a chef. Almost all shrimp are beheaded at sea after they are caught or harvested, and before they are frozen for shipping. A small percentage, regardless of size, are sold with heads on, like sweet, delicate Maine shrimp, but of the large ones, the Maya shrimp dominate the head-on market.
Some restaurants continue to prefer headless shrimp, as long as they are big. Estiatorio Milos on West 55th Street uses Bee Gee shrimp, which are caught off the coast of Guyana. They are almost as big as the Maya, though headless, and served surrounding a brochette of scallops like the twin C's in a giant Chanel logo. Mr. Moonen at Oceana is experimenting with the head-off spot prawn from EcoFish, which he says is shorter but fatter than the Maya.
While diners may prefer bigger shrimp for the same reason they prize tank-like S.U.V.'s, chefs say the extreme size makes them easier to cook and better to eat.
"They're really meaty, and you really get a mouthful, the full flavor of the shrimp," said Mr. Pasternack, the chef at Esca. "They're more difficult to overcook, they're so large." He said the huge shrimp are best in quick preparations like grilling and searing, and are especially good marinated.
Most of the giant shrimp are caught wild, which has more to do with economics than the preference of chefs. Despite the demand, shrimp farmers are reluctant to cultivate big shrimp, since the smaller sizes are far more profitable, said Dixie Blake, of Ocean Garden Products in San Diego, the country's largest wholesaler of shrimp. They prefer to harvest shrimp four to six months old, though shrimp don't reach full size until about a year. Some farmed shrimp do reach epic proportions, like Asian tiger shrimp, but many chefs disdain the watery texture of those shrimp, which they say directly affects the taste. While the head-on shrimp are getting easier to find on restaurant menus, they are elusive in the retail market. The retail branch of Wild Edibles in Grand Central Market carries them for $21 to $25 a pound, but very few other fish shops do, although some will take special orders. 
"The typical American shoppers," said Mr. Ricca of Val's, "don't want to mess with the shell, much less the head."

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Passengers Face Delays, As Well As Labor Woes

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY; The Business Travel Column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
As if last summer's record delays and cancellations weren't bad enough for business travelers, there's apocalyptic talk these days that the air-transportion system is now flying into what Aviation Week magazine last month described as the potential "Perfect Storm."
 As delays continue piling up, serious labor disputes -- involving pilots, mechanics, and flight attendants -- are threatening to hamper flight schedules, and perhaps raise costs and fares, at four major airlines: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines. Several smaller carriers are also involved in tense talks with their unions. 
 Though more disruptions are possible this spring, widespread strikes are uncertain. A federal law, predicated on the importance of airlines and railroads to the national economy, gives the president power to sidetrack walkouts by ordering a cooling-off period and mediation. 
"I don't think there're going to be any strikes," at least before early summer, said Joe Brancatelli, a frequent critic of the airlines whose consumer reports on the Biztravel .com Web site are widely consulted by business travelers.
Mr. Brancatelli and others suggest, however, that a pivotal point may lie ahead for the relationship among airline management, labor and government -- especially if the White House treatens to use emergency powers to sidetrack strikes as it did earlier this month with mechanics at Northwest. 
If the federal government can block airline-union strikes with the argument that they imperil the economy, why can't the government also tell airlines that "you can't keep scheduling flights any time you want" because the resulting gridlock in the skies is also "bad for the economy?" Mr. Brancatelli asked.
The question is pertinent because reducing the total number of flights out of major airports and requiring flights to be spread out to hours that business travelers consider inconvenient are widely regarded as being among the few immediately workable solutions to put any dent at all in the flight-delay crisis.
For many years, suggestions that airlines reduce flights, perhaps by using bigger planes, or that airports put stricter limits on scheduling flights at peak traffic hours, were anathema to the business-travel industry, said Kevin P. Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a trade and lobbying group. 
But last summer's delays fiasco had profound effects, as the morale of traveling employees plummeted and corporate travel-managers calculated the lost productivity costs of delays and cancellations. As a consequence, these hard attitudes about liberal scheduling flexibility appear to be softening, Mr. Mitchell said.
"The longer and more disruptive" the trip, "the more we lose in productivity," one travel manager from a large corporation wrote in response to a survey Mr. Mitchell's group recently conducted to assess attitudes about the crisis and how to fix it. 
The most striking response from the survey of 65 large companies whose employees travel frequently, Mr. Mitchell said, was a willingness to accept less-frequent scheduling -- a kind of flight rationing -- in return for more dependable service.
"We can deal with fewer choices if the performance is actually reliable; what's important is the assurance that we get reliably from Point A to point B," Mr. Mitchell said in characterizing most responses. 
Since the summer, he said, corporate travel managers have been getting an earful from outraged employees. "It used to be sort of stylish to say, 'Well, these road warriors, they're under stress,' " but they manage it with soldierly pride, he said. But last summer, business-travel headaches became a major "work-home life issue," among traveling employees who said, " 'Enough is enough,' " he said.
In response, he added, "Corporations are saying, 'This is now way over the top. If necessary, we will go for reliability over frequency to bring sanity back into the system.' "
The survey also indicated a growing corporate demand for commercial flights from smaller secondary airports, some of which have excess slot capacity and are actually more convenient for employees, Mr. Mitchell said. Airlines want to protect their dominance and investments in major hubs, he said.
He said that corporations themselves, while readjusting some of their attitudes, were also sending strong signals to the airlines and to government, as well as to employees, that the current situation can't continue without a serious general effort to find some ways to alleviate it. 
"Everybody's on notice," he said.

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Press Bounces Back From Military Rule 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria 

 BODY:
Freshly hired reporters were typing away on a recent morning, sitting before shiny blue-and-red computers, as editors huddled nearby. At the end of the day, they would put out another issue of The Anchor, one of several new newspapers in the newly democratic Nigeria.
 Even in this still uncluttered newsroom, however, there were reminders of the old Nigeria, where newspapers and military dictators fought a singularly fierce battle over the future of the country, home to one in six Africans and possibly the continent's most swashbuckling press. 
 As the editors' meeting ended, the op-ed editor came out, hobbling. The publisher, Adewale Adeeyo, caught sight of him, and explained that he had been imprisoned under military rule. "He was a normal-walking man before," Mr. Adeeyo said. 
The deputy editor in chief, Niran Malaolu, came by, prompting the publisher to say, "And look at him!" Mr. Malaolu, 40, had lost part of his vision and hearing after 16 months in prison. 
Scarred but undaunted, Nigeria's newspapers have emerged triumphant with the handover to the civilian government of President Olusegun Obasanjo in May 1999. At least 5 new newspapers have joined about 15 other major dailies on newsstands in the last year, sealing the victory of a vibrant culture over military repression and securing Nigeria's standing as West Africa's news media capital.
Across Africa, newspapers are easily cowed before military regimes far less brutal than the old Nigeria's. Here, the press acted first as the opponents of colonial and then military rule; now, increasingly, newspapers are the watchdogs of a very messy democracy.
But the press also underscores the deep, perhaps irreconcilable, schisms in this country. Almost all newspapers are based in Lagos, the New York City of Nigeria, and are owned and staffed by people from the largely Christian and relatively well-educated south. In the Muslim north, where illiteracy is widespread but where military power has long rested, the Lagos-based press is held in deep suspicion.
And so while newspapers go unsold in northern cities, they are a vital part of the Lagos streetscape. Hawkers weave in and out of mile-long traffic jams with newspapers folded over one arm. At newsstands, readers with enough money buy their newspapers, while those with less means are allowed to glance at headlines free of charge, to pay 4 cents to read two newspapers, or to pay 8 cents to read as many as they want.
This kind of readership exists in almost no other African country, where newspapers are often dismissed as propaganda from government or the opposition.
Nigeria's newspapers are far from perfect, though, with their weaknesses often as glaring as their strengths.
Several months ago, The Post Express reported that a worker for Shell Oil had been swallowed alive by a python while working in the swamps of the Niger Delta. A fuller story went on breathlessly about the dangers of that particular species of snake. None of it, the paper admitted later, actually happened. 
Still, because of their role in denouncing the military dictatorship, Nigeria's newspaper reporters and editors often speak with idealism and zeal. "I think the press has a role to play in recreating this nation," said Mr. Malaolu, the deputy editor in chief of The Anchor, which started publishing on Jan. 1. "For the nation to survive, there is a need for a responsible press."
Mr. Malaolu was arrested in December 1997 after speaking to an official at the American Embassy and though sentenced to 15 years for treason was released in March 1999. He said he kept sane by composing more than 60 poems. 
He was luckier than many others. Dele Giwa, for example, the editor of the weekly Newswatch, was killed in 1986 by an exploding parcel bomb reportedly bearing the coat of arms of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The military ruler at the time, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, has so far refused to appear before a human rights panel investigating the case.
But it was under Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military ruler from 1993 to 1998, that the repression reached its peak. Journalists began practicing "guerrilla journalism" -- publishing their newspapers at different printing plants each night, sometimes succeeding in producing just enough pages to put their defiance in writing.
General Abacha responded by simply shutting down several newspapers. He even made Alex Ibru, the owner of the nation's most respected paper, The Guardian, his interior minister. When that did not mute its coverage, he shut it down and let it reopen only after it apologized for its coverage. Still dissatisfied, General Abacha tried to have Mr. Ibru assassinated.
Since the change to civilian rule, press freedom has greatly improved, though problems remain. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says that security forces attacked reporters in several instances in Nigeria last year. They also invaded the offices of the International Press Center and of This Day, a daily that had linked an official to past graft. 
Nevertheless, Nigeria has seen a boom in new newspapers in the last year: The Comet, The Financial Standard, The National Interest, The Anchor and The Daily Trust. Even the state newspaper, The Daily Times, has improved.
"Before, the goal of newspapers was to fight against the military, and journalism, facts even, were often secondary," said Ide Eguabor, editor in chief of The National Interest, a daily. "Now we must change. We must get back to the basics of journalism. We must get away from political motives. Our newspapers must be allowed to mature."
While the editors and publishers of the new newspapers remain coy about their financial backers, they emphasize they are not interested in politics, but rather in good journalism that will transcend the country's deep divides. 
The campaigning by the press against past military regimes, which were dominated by Muslims from the north, has fostered the view of many northerners that southern newspapers were inherently biased.
Farouk Lawan, who is a former chairman of the House of Representatives' ethics committee and is from the northern state of Kano, said many newspapers still mischaracterized certain issues, such as the spread of Islamic law, or Shariah, in the north. But he added that coverage had improved in general. 
"There seems to be a deliberate effort by the new newspapers to move away from the biases of the past," Mr. Lawan said.
In the past, the north itself has had only one daily, The New Nigerian, which survived only because it was state-owned. But the most popular privately owned publication, The Weekly Trust, became a daily in January.
Kabiru A. Yusuf, the editor in chief of The Daily Trust, whose office is in Abuja, said that democracy had created a market for a privately owned daily in the north, despite the inherent difficulties.
"Even if you are a liberal person from the north, our owners, all 19 of them, are Muslims," Mr. Yusuf said. "On an issue like Shariah, they don't understand why we would want to balance our coverage by including an opinion piece from a southerner. Their reaction would be, 'Why not let the papers in the south print that rubbish?' "
Whether north or south, the papers remain highly focused on politics, ignoring stories that affect ordinary Nigerians. Newspaper industry officials say that is because the economy's collapse has made newspapers affordable only to the rich. 
Two decades ago, the circulation of the state-owned Sunday Daily Times reached a quarter of a million. Today, the combined circulation of all major dailies is said to be between 200,000 and 300,000 each day in a country of 120 million people. 
"In the early '80's, professionals could still buy four or five newspapers a day," said Olatunji Dare, a former editor of The Guardian who fled to the United States in the mid-1990's and now teaches journalism at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill. "Now they can't even afford one." The Guardian, for example, costs about 65 cents -- a day's wage for many Nigerians.
Money, or the lack of it, can also undermine ethics for a reporter who earns about $100 a month -- with paychecks often in arrears. Mr. Lawan, the House member, estimated that perhaps 40 percent of journalists accept gifts or money.
Indeed, gift giving is so widely practiced that at the end of a recent interview, Kano's deputy governor, Abullahi Umar Ganduje, asked this reporter if he wanted some gasoline, given the gas shortage in Kano. "We have plenty of fuel," he said. "We also have diesel."
For publishers, too, the lines are often blurred. Most newspapers are printed in Lagos and flown to other cities, often arriving a day or two late. But three of the new newspapers have begun printing at the same press in Abuja, making delivery easier.
That press is considered the most technologically advanced in the country. Its owner? General Babangida, the former military ruler and possibly Nigeria's most powerful and richest man. 
Mr. Adeeyo, The Anchor's publisher, shrugged. "He has the best printing press in Nigeria and it's well run. What can you do?"

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate; 
Hotel Occupancy Rate Hit Record Level Last Year

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Last year was a boom time for New York's hotel industry, with the occupancy rate at a record 84.6 percent, up 3.1 percent from the previous year, according to figures compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. The cost of a night in a hotel increased even more sharply, 7.3 percent, to an average of $220.86.
 But the occupancy rate slipped 2.3 percent for the fourth quarter of the year, declining to 83.5 percent, according to the firm. And hotels are reporting that there appears to be a hesitancy on the part of corporate travel planners, who may be unsure about their budgets for 2001. 
 "Group bookings that were done six months in advance recently are now being booked more like two to three months in advance, which makes it more difficult for hotels to plan staffing levels," said Cheryl Boyer, a financial analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers. She said that if corporations responded to a slowing economy by reducing travel budgets, occupancy rates might fall further and the relentless upward movement of daily rates might slow or halt.
Michael Fishbin, a partner in the hospitality practice at Ernst & Young, another accounting and consulting firm, said he, too, had noticed a change in the pace of bookings, but attributed it to a shift in strategy by hotel managers. He said that last year hotels were so full that many hotel managers declined to book advance groups at reduced rates, because they were confident of renting all their rooms at the posted rate.
Now, he said, these managers are more inclined to accept the certainty of advance bookings, because they are not sure there will be enough walk-in traffic.
"Last year the city sold out so much, that managers were very aggressive in their rate management," Mr. Fishbin said. "They were less interested in groups six months out because they could fill the rooms at higher transient rates. This year, the larger convention hotels are more interested in buying these groups."
Both analysts said that even if occupancy rates slipped a bit this year, the decline would be from historic heights and that the hotel business in the city was expected to remain healthy unless the national economy went into a tailspin. "We hit dizzying heights in 2000 with occupancy," said Ms. Boyer, who noted that an 85 percent rate was considered within the industry as virtually full.
And if a letup in demand prevents hotel operators from raising room rates as much as in recent years, last year's average was well above the national average of $84.99. 
Because rooms have been filled and rates rising, developers have been rushing to complete hotel projects, both new construction and renovations. According to a count by Ernst & Young, 11 new hotels with a total of 3,387 rooms opened in Manhattan last year.
The new properties produced scarcely a ripple in the market. "The supply of rooms increased 2.5 percent in 2000, but the demand increased 5.7 percent, so they were easily absorbed," Ms. Boyer said. This year, five hotels, totaling 1,434 rooms, are scheduled to open, including two Ritz-Carltons, one each in Battery Park City and on Central Park South.
Occupancy rates increased strongly in the first three quarters of last year, but began to tail off in the fourth, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The rate dropped 4.6 percent in October from the same month in 1999 and was down 2.6 percent in November. The rate in December was down 0.8 percent over the previous year, and the average rate for the quarter was down 2.3 percent.
This decline in occupancy notwithstanding, the average daily room rate increased in each of the three months, and was up 6.9 percent for the quarter, at $259.39 a night.
The demand for rooms in the luxury segment of the market increased 7.8 percent last year, and the average room rate was up 6.6 percent to $323.22 a night. Demand for hotels in the next economic segment down from luxury was up 9.4 percent with the average room rate up 6.5 percent to $226.75. Midprice hotels experienced growth of 2.7 percent, and the average room rate went up 9.8 percent to $158.31.

HEADLINE: Beijing Is Given an Olympian Burnish 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
"It's nice to meet you." 
"Restroom." 
 "I can speak a little English." 
 "Bye! Hope to see you again."
The 50 taxi drivers recited in unison on the fifth and final day of their crash course in English, which is intended to familiarize them with 100 simple phrases as part of Beijing's effort to be named the host for the 2008 Olympics. 
After their sessions at the Beijing Traffic Bureau, each driver is expected to teach at least 100 colleagues. How much the average driver will master is unclear, but the earnestness of the quest for the Olympics cannot be questioned.
The city has been in a nervous state, preparing for the important visit this week of 17 inspectors from the International Olympic Committee who will stack up Beijing against Paris, Osaka, Toronto and Istanbul before the selection is announced, on July 13.
The effort to bring the Olympics to Beijing is seen here as a test of China's arrival as a world power, and the city has done just about everything it can to improve its chances. Mayor Liu Qi was up before dawn today, greeting arriving inspectors at the airport and assuring them, "We are ready." 
The city, known for congestion and smog, has already begun costly efforts to build new roads and subways, reduce pollution and plant grass. Over the last several days, metal street dividers were scrubbed and owners were told to wash their cars. Today some construction was halted to reduce dust. 
The freeway from the airport is lined with "New Beijing -- Great Olympics" banners and potted plastic flowers. As usual during sensitive events, the streets have been cleared of beggars and vendors, with some taken to detention centers and others frightened off.
But some things remain beyond official control: Human rights concerns have been thrust to prominence by the government's harsh crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement and the persistent protests by believers.
Trying to promote a new image of Beijing as a fun-filled and relaxed city, officials have announced plans to use Tiananmen Square, the vast political plaza under the gaze of Mao's portrait, for beach volleyball and triathlon races in 2008. But five people, apparently Falun Gong members, sullied the square last month by trying to immolate themselves. Today, to head off incidents, the square was sealed off.
City officials say it would be unfair to deny Beijing the Olympics because of human rights issues. They note that the Olympics went ahead in Atlanta in 1996 despite the violent United States government attack in 1993 on Branch Davidians in Texas, and they say the games will promote progress in human rights here, as well as in the economy and the environment.
"Beijing will surely emerge as a world-class metropolis by 2008," Mayor Liu told the delegates. 
The chief of the delegation, Hein Verbruggen, indicated that his team, at least, would not judge the city based on human rights. "The executive committee has taken the decision that this is a purely sport and technical evaluation committee, and any kind of political considerations are left up to the individual members" of the I.O.C., which will make the final decision, he said. 
Criticism of China's violent repression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 was a factor in Beijing's narrow loss to Sydney for the 2000 Olympic Games, a loss that still rankles. 
To reduce the opportunities for bribery or other improper influences, the I.O.C. members themselves are not allowed to visit candidate cities, a rule that has caused concern because at least half the members have never seen Beijing.
Certainly, Beijing's drivers and other service workers are being asked to do their share to make the city more hospitable, and they seem to be taking up the challenge.
"Our goal is to have 40 percent of taxi and bus drivers and subway workers able to exchange a few words with foreigners by next summer," said Ding Huaitang, a senior Traffic Bureau official. "And we expect that some model drivers will be able to engage in basic communication."
Many drivers are trying hard, some even playing English tapes as they drive. They dream not of bigger tips but of providing better service, insisted Zhou Yong, an official supervising the English program. He said drivers are instructed not to accept tips, though in the past, because of their lack of English, some may not have known how to refuse them.
"I read that in Paris the driver will chase you if you don't leave a tip," Mr. Zhou said with a smile. "It's not that way in Beijing."

HEADLINE: For the Megagrowth Family, Daimler to Offer a Bigger-Than-S.U.V. 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
With sport utility vehicles becoming bigger and bigger, perhaps it was inevitable: Freightliner, the nation's biggest maker of 18-wheelers, plans to start selling a four-wheel-drive vehicle that dwarfs even the largest family vehicles on the road.
 Based on a German military transport, the vehicle, called the Unimog, makes even the Hummer look petite. It is 9 feet 7 inches tall, nearly the height of a basketball net and almost three feet taller than the tallest sport utility. Its front seat, mounted six feet high, is reached by a three-step ladder. 
 The Unimog is 20 feet long, more than a foot longer than the Ford Excursion, the longest sport utility on the market now. And it is nearly two feet wider than a typical car and 3.5 inches wider than even a Hummer, a General Motors vehicle based on an American military transport. The Unimog is so wide that, by federal regulation, it must carry truck marker lights across the top of the front and back. 
Most remarkable is the Unimog's weight: 12,500 pounds. That is more than two Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicles or four Toyota Camry sedans. The company says the vehicle gets about 10 miles to the gallon of diesel fuel, less even than the most fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles and pickups.
"You don't need roads," says the cover of the Unimog sales brochure, "when you can make your own."
The vehicle will sell for a base price of $84,000. Freightliner will start taking orders for the Unimog in October, with manufacturing to begin in January, said Bruce Barnes, the Unimog marketing manager at Freightliner, which is owned by DaimlerChrysler A.G. Freightliner will sell the Unimog mainly in suburban markets, regardless of region.
The company's initial sales goals are modest. Freightliner hopes to sell 1,000 a year at first, with just 250 going to individuals -- affluent off-road enthusiasts and people who simply like to drive noticeable vehicles. "Even in Scottsdale, Ariz.," Mr. Barnes said, "moms will want to take it to the grocery store. It's a head-turning vehicle."
The rest will go to fire departments and businesses that plan to adapt them for civic and commercial use. But if the vehicle is a success, production can be increased, Mr. Barnes said.
Ford tried to allay initial public concerns about the Excursion's size three years ago by saying that it was mainly for businesses. But it has since built mostly luxury versions, selling them to prosperous families.
The introduction of the German-built Unimog marks an international escalation of the American highway arms race. A year ago, General Motors acquired the rights to the Hummer, a civilian version of the military's Humvee. G.M. said last summer that it would set up its first new division since Saturn to design and market Hummers of various dimensions and prices, with the goal of increasing sales to as many as 150,000 a year from 1,000 then.
Mr. Barnes said Freightliner did not plan to sell anywhere near that many Unimogs, because the company wants to establish a reputation for off-road performance that might suffer if smaller, less expensive models were introduced. 
Freightliner describes the Unimog as an off-road vehicle, but it is not a true sport utility. The $84,000 base version of the vehicle will somewhat resemble a pickup truck with enormous front and side windows to help drivers see the traffic below.
Customers may equip vehicles with a covered pickup-truck bed and jump seats, and many other options are available, Mr. Barnes said. "Leather interior, G.P.S. navigation systems and high-end stereo systems are all available -- just in case you'd like to spoil yourself," the Unimog brochure says. Walnut interior trim, "mood lights" and even a vertical exhaust pipe, just like the exhausts on real 18-wheelers, are also optional.
DaimlerChrysler will build Unimogs for the American civilian market at a factory in Gaggenau, Germany, about 50 miles west of Stuttgart near the French border, that has been making Unimogs for German military forces and farmers for 51 years. Unimog is short for "universal motor gerat," which Freightliner translates as "universal engine-driven apparatus."
The Unimog is far larger than Chrysler's largest sport utility, the Dodge Durango. "We could carry a couple Durangos," Mr. Barnes said.
Retail sales of Unimogs have been weak in Germany. "There were really very few vehicles being sold, for totally crazy people who wanted it," said Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive, who coincidentally ran DaimlerChrysler's commercial vehicle operations until November.
The Unimog to be sold in the United States is considerably larger than models long sold in Germany, and will have four cup holders in the doors to help Americans quench their thirst while driving. 
Unimogs will be sold and serviced by the 400 Freightliner dealers that handle the company's 18-wheelers.
Freightliner offered the first Unimog to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor who made the Hummer famous by using it as his personal vehicle. But the truck maker never received a response and now plans to promote the Unimog through off-road driving clubs and possibly with ads in magazines for sport utility vehicle enthusiasts, Mr. Barnes said. The company has already released a promotional brochure advertising the Unimog as "tough, rugged and eminently civilized."
"Wanting to conquer the great outdoors is simply not a good reason to give up leather and air-conditioning," says the brochure, which also has a diagram of a Unimog labeled "Here's what S.U.V.'s and other so-called four-by-fours will see as you drive by."
Freightliner is a little defensive about the width of the new, larger Unimog, contending that it is still suitable for urban driving.
"It's highly maneuverable and at seven feet wide, it still fits in standard parking spaces," the sales brochure says, reading like most sport utility brochures and showing a Unimog driving past an office tower.
The Unimog is, in fact, 7 feet 6 inches wide when measured at the tires, with the cab 7 feet wide, Mr. Barnes said.
The Unimog is exempt from most federal safety, air pollution and fuel economy regulations because it exceeds the weight cutoffs for such rules. It will meet federal air pollution standards for medium-duty trucks -- standards that are much more lenient than those for cars.
Freightliner is studying whether the Unimog can meet the more stringent rules that California has set for the sale of trucks there.
The Unimog has a 52-gallon tank; diesel tends to produce better fuel economy than gasoline. The vehicle can reach 68 miles an hour on the highway -- but will not be allowed on some roads and bridges, particularly in the New York area, because it exceeds weight and height limits. 
New York State used to bar the registration of large trucks like the Unimog as family vehicles, but changed its rules last year after heavy lobbying by the auto industry. State and federal regulations only require commercial drivers' licenses for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds when fully loaded; the Unimog weighs 26,000 pounds with maximum payload, so the license is not needed.
A few older Unimogs are already on the road in the United States, having been brought from Europe by collectors. Dr. James Molloy III, a family doctor in Sheridan, Ore., said he commuted 13 miles daily to his clinic in his 1963 Unimog and sometimes used it to reach remote areas of national forests during camping trips.
"I parallel-park my truck in downtown Portland and Seattle frequently," he said, adding that a Unimog seemed "a much sturdier platform than the Hummer ever would be."

HEADLINE: Finding Site, Not Cash, Slows Schools 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
At Public School 112 in Long Island City, half a class of fifth graders, about 15 students, regularly meets in what used to be the boys' locker room. Their coats hang from hooks for the showers, still covered in industrial yellow tile.
 Elsewhere in the school, a speech therapist meets with children in a former plumbing closet, which they have to leave whenever pipes get clogged in the boys' bathroom next door and maintenance workers need access to the valves still in the closet. 
 "Hope we can survive till June, in this crowded little room," reads a sign outside a stuffed special education classroom. 
"We're short 27,000 seats today in Queens," said Terri Thomson, the borough's representative on the Board of Education, who has rattled off the dread statistics so many times that her voice has lost most emotion.
"The projections for the next five years have us short 42,000 seats. We have 10,000 high school students who take six periods of classes instead of the state-mandated seven every day because there is not enough room in the buildings." 
In short, she concluded, "we are in a crisis."
The problem in building schools is not money. Quite the contrary. Last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani advanced $359 million in school construction money from future years to the current year, effectively moving up the construction of seven new schools and five additions -- 11 of them in Queens and one in the Bronx.
The problem, rather, is finding the sites for the buildings. Three elementary schools in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens, and three high schools in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens scheduled to begin design and construction two years ago have yet to hit the drawing board because the Board of Education has had trouble placing them.
Five additional elementary schools -- two in Queens and one each in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island -- that were to get under way last year or this year have been similarly delayed. Together, the 11 schools would hold seats for 7,200 students.
"In a robust economy, there are plenty of other people who want the same sites we do," said Patricia Zedalis, chief executive of the board's division of school facilities, which is responsible for finding places to put new schools. 
Certainly, the Board of Education has found and secured many new sites. Blueprints are now being drawn up for 26 school buildings, which will provide more than 21,000 new seats by the fall of 2004. Twelve more schools, with 9,259 planned seats, are under construction.
"I think we're being much more successful than many of us anticipated" in finding sites, Ms. Zedalis said.
But with every new building planned, an array of problems confronts officials. Pieces of property often come with big problems. Some housed manufacturing plants that left behind costly environmental problems, while others are in industrial districts that are far from residential neighborhoods and might be dangerous for children to walk to and from.
Rare are sites like a 30-acre plot near the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, close by the intersection of the Grand Central and Cross Island Parkways. Two primary schools and one high school, together serving almost 2,900 students, are planned for the property, which will still have 10 acres left for ball fields and other facilities.
And then there are the neighbors, some of whom seem to object whenever a new school is proposed. Most famously, dozens of residents of Maspeth, Queens, showed up at a City Council hearing last year to object to a school proposed for the site of a former grocery store on Grand Avenue at 72nd Place. Those objecting most loudly said they, like the property's owner, would rather have a Staples office supply store built there.
Usually, the objections of neighborhood residents are simpler. In Ozone Park, Queens, residents were not completely opposed to Intermediate School 137, a 1,675-seat school under construction at Rockaway Boulevard and 98th Street, near Aqueduct Racetrack; rather, they were angered in part because the school is being built on former Con Edison land that used to be ball fields for the Little League teams from Ozone Park and Richmond Hill. 
New schools also bring teachers who drive cars to work and who need places to put them, usually in areas that are already short of parking. School buses, which are used even at community elementary schools to transport handicapped children or those who do not live within walking distance of the school, tie up traffic on narrow streets in residential neighborhoods. They also add to congestion during the morning rush. 
Patricia Dolan, president of the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association, which has opposed the construction of Public School 499, a 534-seat elementary and intermediate school on the campus of Queens College, said her neighborhood already had four elementary schools, more than needed to accommodate local students. 
"They are filled to capacity because children are bused into them from other sections of the borough," she said. 
The effect of building new schools can often be more easily quantified. Businesses can be displaced, residents asked to move, property taken over. The School Construction Authority says that 7 of every 10 sites where new schools are built have to be acquired through eminent domain proceedings, in which a court gives the Board of Education control of private property and sets compensation for the owner.
Even then, the acquired properties might not be as large as the School Construction Authority would like. Howard Wilson, chairman of the authority's board, recently asked the staffs of the Board of Education and the construction authority to consider making offers to owners of property next to potential school sites to see whether they might want to sell their homes, knowing that a new school was going to be put next door.
Another problem with eminent domain proceedings is the rancor they leave behind. 
"It's not a very popular thing to do," said Milo E. Riverso, chief executive of the School Construction Authority. 
"Property often has certain sentimental value. Some people are not going to be satisfied with any compensation because of the disruption in their life."

HEADLINE: Chinese Fiber-Optic Work Linked to Raided Iraqi Sites 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Chinese workers were helping the Iraqi military build a fiber-optic network linked to radar stations and other targets attacked by American and British warplanes last week, defense and intelligence officials said today, raising a new challenge for the Bush administration just as it is communicating for the first time with the Chinese leadership.
 The Chinese assistance, which was first reported over the weekend by The Washington Post, apparently violated United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, officials said today. It was part of what American officials have described as furtive efforts by the Iraqis to evade sanctions and rebuild their military. 
 Administration officials said that the bombing in Baghdad on Friday night was timed to avoid injuries to the workers. That is an especially sensitive subject in the Pentagon after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. Three Chinese were killed, and despite the insistence of the United States that the incident was an accident, diplomatic relations were set back by months. 
China's seeming involvement in military programs in Iraq raises diplomatic difficulties for the Bush administration, which was hesitant today to discuss China's role in the fiber-optic project.
President Bush had his first exchange of letters with President Jiang Zemin last week, a general exchange that apparently contained no reference to the project in Iraq. Mr. Bush has been seeking to establish a personal relationship with Mr. Jiang gradually before tackling the usual array of differences, on issues like human rights and arms exports.
Now that slow start may not be possible. The State Department said today that it was sending an official inquiry to the Chinese government about the presence of workers at the site.
"We are obviously concerned about reports that the Chinese have provided assistance to the Iraqis," a State Department spokesman, Philip T. Reeker, said. "We have asked the Chinese government to look into it and are awaiting their response."
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said today that it had no knowledge of the project.
An administration official said that reports of cooperation with Iraq in telecommunications were raised with China in the last days of the Clinton administration. At that time, too, China denied any involvement.
Other government officials noted today that in one recent case, in which a Chinese company was providing test equipment to the Iraqi military, it was impossible to determine whether these sales were taking place with the knowledge of Chinese officials.
China has worked in Iraq before, helping build a number of major projects, like bridges, before the 1991 gulf war.
It is not clear whether the fiber-optic network is commercial in nature, if it was specifically designed for the military, or if it is being used for both purposes, what the military calls a "dual use" technology.
"We do have some indication the Chinese were building a fiber-optic network," a defense official said today, declining to discuss details of the work. "They could claim it has some dual use, but it's pretty clear it was connected" to the radar sites struck last Friday.
A United Nations official said today that Chinese companies had been allowed to provide services in a variety of contracts approved as part of the "oil for food" program.
That program, begun as a way to allow imports of food, medicines and other items to meet civilian needs, has expanded in recent years to include construction projects and the rebuilding of Iraq's electrical grid.
However, any work that aided Iraq's military would be a clear violation of the sanctions rules.
The committee that reviews the contracts permitted under the "oil for food" program has put on hold three telecommunications projects, but those involve two French companies and a Russian one.
Today, four days after the strikes, Pentagon officials declined to discuss the success of the attacks except in the broadest terms. But one official said the strikes had only mixed results, representing something of a disappointment.
The attack resulted in "only moderate disruption" of Iraq's air defenses, the official said.
Over the weekend, Iraqi forces again fired antiaircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles at patrols in the southern "no flight" zone, but the American and British aircraft did not respond.
The Pentagon's spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, said that the strikes were intended to weaken Iraq's ability to threaten the patrols, but that Iraq was expected to rebuild its defenses, as it has in the past.
"The targets were the radars, and the command, control and communication nodes that controlled and integrated the air defense system," he said. "We think we had an impact on that. Is it permanent? No. But we think we had an impact on that."

When Yoshiro Mori was chosen by a secretive conclave of governing party leaders 10 months ago to become prime minister after Keizo Obuchi's death, Mr. Mori was thought to be a safe interim choice to lead the government.
 What has followed has been a roller coaster ride full of gaffes and spills for the Liberal Democratic Party. Members say that all this might have provided grist for a good political comedy if it were not for the fact that the party's grip on power is now in serious doubt. 
 The latest -- and many feel most egregious -- of Mr. Mori's political blunders was to continue playing golf for nearly two hours after he received word that an American submarine had hit a Japanese fishing-school vessel off Hawaii and that nine people were missing. 
Since then, approval ratings for Mr. Mori have fallen to the lowest ever for a prime minister -- 5.4 percent in one television poll, and 9 percent in one by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. On Monday, the party elder most responsible for Mr. Mori's selection, Hiromu Nonaka, said that the prime minister should "prioritize the people's peace of mind," which in the muffled language of Japanese politics was widely interpreted as a call to resign.
Japanese prime ministers have typically enjoyed little executive-style muscle, but one power that they do have -- and Mr. Mori is exercising it with unaccustomed zest -- is to cling to office against all manner of calls for a resignation.
"What I must accomplish at any cost is to revive the economy," Mr. Mori told Parliament on Monday. He also cited work to be done in "educational reform and the advancement of information and technology."
In fact, almost no one expects that he will be around long enough to do much, if any, of this. Political analysts say a state of grace may be granted to pass a new budget, which must be done by early next month, but beyond that, few expect Mr. Mori to be able to survive.
Mr. Mori's own party has no mechanism for the removal of a prime minister for reasons of lack of popularity. But if the coalition parties desert him, the government will fall and new elections will have to be organized.
A senior member of the New Komeito Party, the Liberal Democrats' largest coalition partner, told the Yomiuri Shimbun that the momentum exists to force Mr. Mori's resignation. "We now have to decide how to make it honorable," the official said.
Mr. Mori's 10 months in office have followed an unusually hapless rhythm of roughly one major political blunder per month. The streak began in June during memorial services for Mr. Obuchi, who was felled suddenly by a stroke. Of all the national and international figures present, the new prime minister alone seemed not to know how to perform a customary deep bow.
Soon afterward, Mr. Mori called Japan a "divine country," a statement that had troubling echoes for many of militarism and imperial rule. Then, he was embarrassingly put on the defensive by news reports that he had been arrested at a brothel while in college. There have also been persistent reports that the prime minister has mob ties, and a magazine has printed photos of him drinking with a known member of the criminal syndicates.
Later, it was reported that Mr. Mori surprised the British prime minister, Tony Blair, with the unusual suggestion that North Korea could be persuaded to release several Japanese people it was believed to have kidnapped if only there were an agreement to pretend to find the missing people in a third country.
Three of Mr. Mori's hand-picked ministers, meanwhile, have been forced to resign because of scandals.
In one of those scandals, a government-sponsored program to recruit temporary workers from other Asian countries began bribing senior officials in order to gain support for its expansion. One of the accused officials, Fukushiro Nukaga, Mr. Mori's minister for economics and fiscal policy, resigned last month.
The other scandal was a Foreign Ministry travel office corruption case in which it was recently revealed that a midlevel official in charge of making overseas travel arrangements for officials, including the prime minister, had falsely billed the government for nearly $5 million.
This may have been the more costly scandal for the governing party, because it appears to have knocked the foreign minister, Yohei Kono, out of contention for the prime minister's job.
That leaves the Liberal Democrats, who have ruled almost without interruption since 1955, with few appealing choices to replace Mr. Mori.
"The most clear-cut characteristic of the current political situation is that the Liberal Democratic Party, which has enjoyed a very strong hold on power over the last several decades, is declining," said Minoru Morita, a political analyst. "With Mori, their electoral base is collapsing."

PERSON: Stanley Kramer 

HEADLINE: Stanley Kramer, Filmmaker With Social Bent, Dies at 87 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
Stanley Kramer, the producer and director of socially groundbreaking films like "The Defiant Ones" and "Judgment at Nuremberg" and one of Hollywood's most respected filmmakers in the late 1950's and early 60's, died on Monday in Woodland Hills, a section of Los Angeles. He was 87.
 Mr. Kramer never liked being described as a "message filmmaker," but that was the tag that stuck to him throughout his long career. He retained this reputation even in the 60's and 70's, when many of his films faltered at the box office and changing tastes persuaded a new generation of critics, weaned on the French new wave and the auteur theory, to view his work as sentimental and simplistic. 
 Mr. Kramer, who had been living at the Motion Picture Home, a retirement community for those who had worked in the movie industry, died of complications from pneumonia, said his wife of 35 years, Karen Sharpe Kramer. 
He began as a passionate Wunderkind, an independent producer eager to shake up the status quo with a string of socially conscious films in the early 1950's that raised many of the issues, like racial inequality and juvenile delinquency, that mainstream film companies were often too timid to explore.
For instance, his acclaimed "High Noon" (1952), though a western, was actually a thinly veiled attack on the anti-Communist purges of the McCarthy era. He was also known for being economical, shooting polished-looking films on a budget only a fraction the size of that of most major films.
In 1949 "Home of the Brave" explored racial intolerance in the context of a war film. "Champion," released the same year, was about destructive and unbridled ambition, personified in the film by Kirk Douglas as a doomed prizefighter. In 1950 "The Men," a tragic drama about wounded war veterans, introduced Marlon Brando to the screen. "The Wild One," also with Mr. Brando, in 1954, was the first biker film and among the first to deal with juvenile delinquency, themes that spawned dozens of imitations.
"I firmly believe that the independent producer today can select material which will return vitality to the motion picture industry," Mr. Kramer wrote in 1949. "I think people are completely fed up with the pattern. The independent has simply got to destroy that pattern. If our industry is to flourish, we must break away from formula thinking."
In 1951 Mr. Kramer moved inside the studio gates with a production deal at Columbia Pictures, fleeing two years later in revulsion to return to independent filmmaking and to direct his own films. 
He reached his zenith as a Columbia producer with the classic "High Noon," which starred Gary Cooper as an embattled hero. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called it "Stanley Kramer's brilliant and electric production," giving the producer top billing over the film's director, Fred Zinneman.

Taking the Director's Chair
Initially, Mr. Kramer faltered as a director. His first effort, "Not as a Stranger," was viewed as a fairly ordinary romantic drama about the tribulations of a young doctor, played by Robert Mitchum. And the second, "The Pride and the Passion," was a big-screen epic that was more famous for its on-set squabbles than its plot, which was described as "Pride without Passion" in the Times headline that accompanied the review.
Soon, though, Mr. Kramer returned to tough themes and social issues and regained his footing, insisting on making movies that daringly raised the sensitive subjects that a prosperous postwar America frequently preferred to ignore.
He was often asked why he gravitated to socially conscious stories, and usually he pointed to his coming of age during the early years of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. But just as often, he ducked the question.
"Well, I suppose the best answer is that emotionally I am drawn to these subjects," he told The Times Magazine in 1961. "To determine why, I'd have to examine my whole youth." He broke off, then added: "But we won't go into that now. Nor have I ever bothered to give it any deep or prolonged thought."
But it is there, the dominant thread that runs through his entire career.
In 1958 "The Defiant Ones" raised questions of racism and intolerance in the story of a pair of escaped convicts, one black (Sidney Poitier) and one white (Tony Curtis), who were chained together on the run. 
In "On the Beach" in 1959, he was among the first mainstream directors to explore openly and bleakly the notion of nuclear holocaust. And "Inherit the Wind," released the next year, remains Hollywood's most influential exploration of America's enduring social fault line over the issue of teaching evolution. 
In 1961 "Judgment at Nuremberg" was about the tendency of many in the postwar era to forget Nazi atrocities in the drive to battle Communism and get on with business. 
In his Times Magazine profile of Mr. Kramer, Crowther wrote: "Newsmen and film critics from all over the world will assemble with German brass and bigwigs in West Berlin to witness the world premiere of 'Judgment at Nuremberg.' They will be in attendance at something more than the gala opening of a film: They will be spectators at another performance of Mr. Kramer's celebrated act of placing his head in the mouth of a lion."
Although Mr. Kramer chafed at being labeled, he never denied that he was always trying to make what he called a "strong film," a goal that often put him at odds with studio chiefs and backers who wanted him to soften his message.
"I take a very reluctant and conservative view on what a single film can do in affecting our lives," he told an interviewer in 1960. "I don't make films to stir the world. I am not conscious of a responsibility to society or even to my own social consciousness when I make a film. My motivation can be as simple as saying, gee, this would make an exciting picture."
By the early 60's, though, Mr. Kramer said that he felt the need to prove that he could make a movie that was neither socially conscious nor serious. In fact, if anything, "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" was socially disruptive and goofy, the story of a group of over-the-top comic characters driven to slapstick insanity in a race for hidden loot. It was his biggest box office hit, with a cast that included Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters and Ethel Merman.
The film world was changing, though. The rise of foreign language films, popularized by directors like Vittorio de Sica, Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman, blended into the ascent of the French new wave in the early 60's, spearheaded by new voices like those of Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard.
At the same time, the French-inspired auteur theory, which held that the director was the prime creative voice on a film and that those directors with distinctive voices throughout their body of work were the greatest artists, turned critics and audiences away from journeymen like Mr. Kramer.
Most of his final films failed with critics and at the box office. In 1965 "Ship of Fools" drew some Oscar nominations but was blasted by many critics as pretentious. "The Secret of Santa Vittoria" (1969), "R.P.M." (1970), "Bless the Beasts and Children" (1971) and other later efforts were almost all labeled sentimental and middlebrow. At this time, when Mr. Kramer tried to raise social issues, he was often criticized as preachy. 
His 1977 assassination thriller, "The Domino Principle," drew scathing reviews. The Times critic Vincent Canby described it as "without doubt the definitive work to date in that growing body of screen literature devoted to instructing us in how to make a suspense film totally devoid of tension, intelligence, excitement, imagination, wit, reality and surprise."
"Like the prose in many how-to manuals," he continued, "it is complicated without being informative, and it's also rigorously humdrum."

60's Turmoil Shakes a Career
Mr. Kramer also seemed unsure how to respond to the social turbulence of the 60's, when many of the issues that he had been a pioneer in exploring suddenly exploded on the social stage. The campus drama "R.P.M.," which tried to capture the mood of discontent on college campuses in the 60's, fell flat. The film, Canby wrote in his Times review, "is about one of the gut questions of our time."
"Should Ann-Margret," he explained, "a graduate student in sociology, continue to sleep with Anthony Quinn, her bleeding-heart liberal of a professor, after he becomes acting college president and sends the pigs in to clear out the administration building?"
In a 1991 interview Mr. Kramer acknowledged that some of his films, particularly those involving racism, were "oversimplified." This approach was necessary, he said, to make the stories more palatable to mainstream white audiences.
But for the most part, he stuck to his guns. In a three-hour two-part examination of his career broadcast on ABC in 1975, he defended his work vigorously.
Mr. Kramer was also frequently critical of some of the directors who emerged in the 60's, describing some of them as con artists who were trying to put one over on a credulous audience.
"The put-on leads to the adoration of technique," Mr. Kramer wrote in 1968. "The nouvelle vague, the neo-realists and the angry young men have opened the gates to interrupted dialogue, mismatching, jump cuts, super-imposures, split screens and the camera as primary weapon in the director's bag. Technique covers a multitude of sins."
The only respite from such criticism in his final years as a director came in 1967, with "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," a film in which he recaptured some of the glory of his heyday. Though many critics found the film, about an interracial romance, overly simple and pitched to mainstream sensibilities -- it starred Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier -- it was a smashing success, nominated for 10 Oscars and the winner of two (for Ms. Hepburn's lead performance and William Rose's original screenplay).
Mr. Kramer complained in the 60's that the rise of foreign voices and the growing youth culture had changed the artistic landscape from what it had been in his own youth. No longer, he said, were writers or filmmakers interested in creating the Great American Novel or the great American film, or indeed with exploring what it meant to be American.
"The reason has to do with the purposeful widening of the generation gap, the desire of the young to move as far as possible from the common denominators they and we have known," he wrote. "The student of cinema wants to be Godard, not William Wyler or George Stevens or John Ford."
Mr. Kramer was nominated for nine Academy Awards -- six as a producer and three as a director -- though he never won one. He was given the Irving G. Thalberg Award for distinguished contribution to filmmaking at the Oscar ceremonies in 1962. And the New York Film Critics Circle chose him as best director of 1958 for "The Defiant Ones."

A Hero to His Actors
Mr. Kramer, however, was always popular with actors, working with some of the top stars of the era, including Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire, Spencer Tracy, Fredric March, Gene Kelly, Sophia Loren, Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Vivien Leigh, Mr. Brando and Mr. Douglas.
Part of the reason was Mr. Kramer's well-known success in helping his actors to win Oscars -- including ones for Gary Cooper in "High Noon," Jose Ferrer in "Cyrano de Bergerac," Maximilian Schell in "Judgment at Nuremberg" and Ms. Hepburn in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."
His last film, "The Runner Stumbles," about a romance between an older priest (Dick Van Dyke) and a younger nun (Kathleen Quinlan) earned him some of the most scathing reviews of his career in 1979. "Heaven help anyone who tries to take this story at face value," wrote Janet Maslin in The Times.
Not long after, Mr. Kramer announced that he had had enough and was abandoning Hollywood for Seattle. "We chose Seattle because my wife read somewhere in a consumer magazine that it was the ideal American city," he said.
Stanley Earl Kramer was born in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, the only child of a divorced mother who worked as a secretary for Paramount. His grandmother, a Polish-Jewish immigrant, had the largest hand in raising him. 
Besides a mother at Paramount, the young Mr. Kramer also had an uncle in the movie business, who worked in distribution for Universal Pictures. But as a boy, he said, he never really dreamed of Hollywood, aiming instead for a career in law.
A precocious teenager, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School at 15 and attended New York University as an undergraduate, where he earned a degree in business administration. The turning point in his life came in 1933, at the height of the Depression, when his articles for a university magazine won him a job as a junior writer at 20th Century Fox, earning $70 a week.
For the next 14 years, Mr. Kramer bounced around the movie business in Hollywood. He was a set dresser and film cutter at MGM, a writer and researcher for Columbia, a writer for Republic and an associate producer with Loew-Lewin.
Just as he was about to form his own independent production company, Pearl Harbor took the United States into World War II and he was drafted, eventually making training films for the Army Signal Corps in Astoria, Queens. 
"Hollywood is like a boardwalk," Mr. Kramer told an interviewer. "You're always looking for a loose board to stick your head up through, and there are about 60 guys waiting to hit you."

Seeking Big Films, Small Egos
Not until after the war, in 1947, were Mr. Kramer and two partners, the writer Carl Foreman and a film sales veteran, George Glass, able to have his first movie produced, a low-budget adaptation of a Ring Lardner story called "So This Is New York."
Mr. Kramer never looked back. He kept a sign above his desk that read: "Please God, make the pictures big and the heads small."
Finding investors in places like a Midwestern department store and a lettuce-growers syndicate, Mr. Kramer financed one film after another in the early 50's. "I'm a bit of a shill artist," he told an interviewer.
By the mid-50's, his reputation for frugality and his successes had won him a deal at Columbia Pictures. He chafed under the studio strictures, he later said, producing films that never made as much money as the studio wanted nor roiled the waters as much as he desired. 
"The Caine Mutiny" in 1954 is a case in point: It is justly celebrated for its performances, particularly that of Humphrey Bogart as the paranoid Captain Queeg, but managed to erase from Herman Wouk's best-selling novel the central emotional thread of Jewish persecution by the Nazis.
It was in 1980 that Mr. Kramer retired from filmmaking and moved to Seattle, where he wrote and taught at the University of Washington and Bellevue Community College. In 1987, however, the new head of Columbia Pictures, the British producer David Puttnam, invited Mr. Kramer to develop new film projects for the studio. 
"I decided that somewhere between the films on outer space and Sylvester Stallone, there is a place for me," Mr. Kramer said at the time. "I was always associated with films that had an opinion. I don't believe films change anyone's mind, but I was spawned during the Roosevelt era, a time of great change, and I still believe in trying to get people to think. I'm very excited about being a participating mule again -- that's mule, with a kick."
Mr. Puttnam's tenure at Columbia was short-lived, however, and Mr. Kramer's deal with the studio resulted in no new films.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Kramer is survived by a son, Larry, and three daughters, Katharine, Jennifer and Casey, whom he named after one of his heroes, Casey Stengel.
"A motion picture has a strange chemistry that you can't explain," Mr. Kramer once said. "How do you explain how every once in a while an absolute conclave of idiots will come together and make a film that's just wonderful, while a group of talented people will turn out something that's nothing? Maybe it just depends on the roll of the dice."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Teenage Drug Use Higher in U.S. Than in Europe 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
American teenagers are far more likely than their European peers to use marijuana and other illicit drugs, but European teenagers are more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, according to a study of 31 nations.
 The study, released yesterday at a meeting of the World Health Organization in Stockholm, compared the results of 1999 surveys answered anonymously by 14,000 10th-grade students in the United States and 95,000 10th-grade students in 30 European countries. 
 Among the European students, 37 percent had smoked at least one cigarette in the previous 30 days, compared with 26 percent in the United States. Sixty-one percent of the European 10th graders had consumed alcohol in the previous 30 days, compared with 40 percent of the students in the United States. 
Forty-one percent of 10th graders in the United States had tried marijuana, compared with 17 percent of those in Europe. And 23 percent of the students in the United States had used other illicit drugs, compared with 6 percent of Europeans.
Researchers said that the study, the first to make such broad comparisons, would help them and policy makers determine the effects of culture and other factors on drug use.
"We tend to think within national boundaries," said Thor Bjarnason, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Albany and a co-author of the report, the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs. "If you're having a war on drugs, one measure is within a comparative perspective. If drug use is increasing at a slower rate in your country, that could be a victory."
The study was developed by the Council of Europe, an intergovernmental organization focused on social and economic issues, with the help of researchers at the University of Michigan's "Monitoring the Future" project, which has surveyed students on a variety of issues for 26 years and is considered the most reliable barometer of student drug-use trends. The European survey was designed in such a way so the two could be accurately compared. 
Dr. Bjarnason called the differences in illicit drug use "very striking."
"That's one in four students in this country," he said. "Even in the European countries with the highest rates, it's only one in 10."
Yet while a smaller percentage of European students used illicit drugs, that percentage rose from 1995 to 1999, particularly in former Eastern-bloc countries.
By contrast, much drug use in the United States has declined or held steady -- with the exception of Ecstasy use, which has risen sharply.
Researchers offered little analysis to explain the differences. That, they said, would come in the second phase of the study.
But, they noted, the widespread use of marijuana and other illicit drugs began in the United States and spread to Europe so it might be that Europeans simply follow the American trend. 
Others cited the more relaxed rules governing alcohol and cigarette use in many European nations, as well as other cultural differences.
Researchers said they were particularly interested in the survey results of marijuana use in the Netherlands, known for its relatively permissive drug laws.
While marijuana use was relatively widespread there -- 28 percent of 10th graders had tried it, compared with the European average of 17 percent -- four other European countries, Ireland, France, the Czech Republic, and Britain, had higher rates, as did the United States.

HEADLINE: Lines That Divide, Ties That Bind 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
One hundred preachers are on 100 Harlem corners, and Michelle Ramirez is on hers: Fifth Avenue and West 129th Street. She positions her microphone, aims her voice at the tenement opposite, and opens fire. 
 "Drugs, drink can't take away the pain you have inside," she bellows. 
 The four young hustlers swigging Hennessey and sharing a fat blunt on the building's front steps scowl. They curse. And they continue allowing soiled men and women clutching small bills to pass inside to buy crack. 
That drugs are being sold from this building is the worst-kept secret on the block. The tenants know it. The police know it. And Michelle Ramirez, 28, a born-again Christian who lives on 129th Street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues, knows it, too. So when her church dispatches preachers one Saturday throughout Harlem for Operation Spiritual Thunder, she thunders at the young men, "Every time you're selling drugs, you're killing a whole family." 
"Wrong," they sing out, in a perverted call and response. "Wrong."
She presses on. "Why are we acting like all black people can do is smoke weed, drink beer, and listen to rap music all day?"
"She is really getting on my nerves." The voice belongs to a young man who gives his name as Pimp Daddy Corn Chips, and gives his story: One mother, five children, one room, so you can't even breathe. Stomachs hurting, doors slamming, welfare cut to the bone. "She going to put a plate on my table?" he asks, nodding toward Ms. Ramirez. 
One of his friends, Caveman, stalks across the street. "You judging us?" 
"If you all are taking this offensive, that's on you," she answers. 
He returns to the steps and succumbs to nostalgia. "Back in the day, she couldn't do this."
Back in the day, Ms. Ramirez, a black singer and student raised in Greenwich Village, would not have been paying $572 for a studio apartment on this block, let alone challenging its dealers. 
The fact that she is says a lot about how far this block has come since 1994, when The New York Times chronicled life, then bleak and ominous, here. Buildings have been rehabilitated, violent crime reduced. New tenants have come by the dozens. 
But that the young men still see Ms. Ramirez as an interloper, that they feel as angry at her words as she does at their actions, says how far the block has to go. Not just because drugs are still being sold here, although that troubles residents old and new. But because this block's now dizzyingly diverse populace must negotiate a whole new series of relationships -- across class lines, racial and national divides, cultural experiences, and personal trajectories.
Those relationships are playing out across Harlem, where a vast amount of vacant housing means that perhaps 40,000 new residents could be absorbed without displacing anyone. So far, then, Harlem has largely defied the familiar gentrification process, in which newer, or lighter, or wealthier arrivals push out the locals. For now, they must learn to live together.
On 129th Street, longtime residents must learn how to live among whites for the first time. The white owner of an art gallery must learn how to be an asset, not a threat. African-Americans and Africans and Hispanics must find what common ground they share. And blacks who share nothing but skin color must build a community.
For Michelle Ramirez and others, it is partly a battle over what being black means, what Harlem is, and who it is for. For the old-timers, who have spent decades nostalgically remembering what Harlem was, it is a realization that Harlem finally is changing -- but not changing back. Something new is being born.

Renovating Buildings, Not People
First came the letters.
Posted on the door of 35-37 West 129th Street, they warned tenants not to sit on the stoops. Doing so, the new management company warned, attracted "undesirables." 
The tenants sat anyway, as they always had. The stoops were urban versions of Southern porches, places for sharing meals and watching children, taking on new beaus and tearing apart old ones.
Then came the spikes. 
No number of swinging children could dislodge the spikes, attached to guard rails implanted on the stoops. No amount of green paint could camouflage their hostility. No small detail said more about how this Harlem block was changing. 
New buildings have brought new rules, many imposed by Gregory Pascal, the entrepreneur to whom the city has given seven buildings on this block to renovate, manage, and eventually own. As he and some new residents see it, the front of a building is for coming and going. 
There are the culture wars of the elites and the culture wars of the streets. As middle-class habits take root here, newcomers and property owners are reclaiming private spaces -- posting "No Loitering" signs on brownstones all over -- and imposing new rules on public spaces. 
Longtime residents welcome the renovation of old buildings. The enforcement of new behavior is a different story. 
"These tenants have been sitting on that stoop for 20, 30, 40 years," a young woman says one night in an indignant aria. "Because you renovated the building you think you're going to renovate the people, too?" 
The sitters move to the buildings with still-open stoops.

Creating the Hamptons in Harlem
"I been there already -- I been down -- but I don't need to smoke, drink, 'cause he fills me up," Michelle Ramirez had told the young men on the corner. A few years ago, Ms. Ramirez was a punk singer prowling the East Village in black leather and doing her own share of drugging. 
She has since found Jesus, but is still trying to find her place. Musically, she resists categorization, singing what she calls spiritual folk. As the daughter of a mixed-race mother, she fights racism from blacks and whites. And she is trying to reconcile the romance of historical Harlem with the reality outside her window. 
Like many young blacks, Michelle Ramirez was drawn here partly by Harlem's cultural heritage. She moved into a studio with high ceilings and stained-glass windows, filled it with plants and religious art -- and found herself looking out on a ghetto where children played around lines of crack buyers. There's nothing up here, she says, except the drugs. "How are you supposed to have hope if there's nothing around?" 
Last spring, she started praying for the block. Soon after, the crack lines disappeared, although the drugs have not. Harlem, though, is inspiring her after all. She looks out her window, and sees people putting art to poverty. Being born poor and black, she says, means making the best of it. The street can become home if it has to. A dollar is stretched farther than it has any right to go. You barbecue on a raggedy little grill, and you think it's the Hamptons. 
"They make their Hamptons," she says. "That's what I like about Harlem."

A Great White Influx?
The owner of Ms. Ramirez's building is a Swedish-born artist named Lars Westvind who lives one block north on historic Astor Row. He owns three adjoining row houses on 129th Street, and he has stocked them with European and American whites, along with some black tenants. 
His rents -- $450 for one room, $1,500 for an apartment in a 130th Street brownstone -- boggle many Harlem minds. They effectively shut out most longtime residents. 
Mr. Westvind believes in free enterprise's consequences. He says of those wanting to keep Harlem black, "I think that's pretty strange, to tell you the truth."
But in Harlem, not to see color can be provocative in itself. When Mr. Westvind purchased one of the 129th Street buildings, he received threats and a 4 a.m. smoke bomb in his mailbox. It was bad, one of his neighbors, Juanita Washington, says, "but not as bad as what would happen to a black person moving into a white neighborhood."
At one meeting on his block, neighbors expressed concern to his artist wife, Gulsen Calik, first about her lush, untamed front yard ("it's not an eyesore, but it's different," said one woman) and then about her husband's rents. They spoke with a frankness born of friendship. 
Miss Washington, a 40-year resident of 130th Street, said that when developers come in and see a mix of ethnicities and tenures, they "should do as the city does, as the state does, as the federal government does -- have a happy medium, high rents, low rents, so people who have been here can afford to stay in the community." 
Ms. Calik (pronounced CHEL-ick), in turn, wondered why the neighbors didn't see the value Mr. Westvind's rehabilitations brought. The buildings had been largely abandoned. Nor, she said, does the law allow them to displace those paying low rents. 
"Don't just talk about people coming in -- white versus black, rich versus poor -- you put blinders on," she said. "People are trying to make a buck, but who isn't? If you live by other values, good for you. But recognize the value in a renovation."

New Images, Framed by Suspicion
One warm morning, a white man, pale as the moon, sweeps 129th Street's sidewalk. It is a startling image, and one that was not, initially, well received here. But the night before, a group of bored children had shattered glass in front of Mr. Westvind's three row houses with their painterly trim. In the morning, it fell to Didier Catoliquot, Parisian photographer in his previous life, Harlem superintendent in this one, to clean up. 
Mr. Catoliquot (pronounced KAH-toe-lee-koh) is 46. He followed a girl to New York, and fell in love with the city. He rented a room from Mr. Westvind, then began working for him, "changing completely" his life. 
This job is temporary, a means of adaptation. "You cannot enjoy your life if you think you will clean the street for all your life," he says, sounding much like the block's women now working for their welfare.
He likes the block's residents. He knows the children in the street have nowhere else to play. But he does not want to sweep up their glass. The week before, he told them to go away. They burned his garbage. He would not speak to their parents, though. His English is not good enough. And, he says, his skin is the wrong color.
Gulsun Erbil, a Turkish artist, opened Gallery X in 1998 in one of Mr. Westvind's buildings, where she also lives. She has a dream of a Harlem Biennale in 2002, but finds that the color of her skin sometimes mutes the enthusiasm toward her project. 
"They should look at it not like I'm a white woman," she says. "They shouldn't put me down." 
She does not see herself as an activist, but she welcomes anyone to her openings. The children come, for the art or for the free food. 
"Do you think exposure changes people?" asks Pat Simon, who runs a community office on the block for the Abyssinian Development Corporation, the nonprofit organization that has helped redevelop the area, as she observes one opening. 
To Ms. Erbil and others, the answer is yes. "If white people do things here it has benefit," says Franz Vila, an artist exhibiting last summer. "It contributes to the lives of these black kids. White people don't need this gallery. They have galleries in SoHo." 
Few adults on the block come to the gallery, however. The mothers, Ms. Erbil concludes, do not want art. 
For some on the block, it is not about not wanting art, but about needing so many other things. "How does it help the community?" says Rachel Tew, a longtime resident, of the gallery. "It doesn't bring jobs."
The block's Southern intonations and the palette of pigmentation transport Fred Mitchell back to his Mississippi childhood. He is 77 and white, an Abstract Expressionist artist and an accomplished raconteur. But his connections on the block seem few, even after some three years here. After a racially tinged encounter with a neighbor, he has kept to himself. His motto now toward his neighbors: like ships in the night. 
In 1930, James Weldon Johnson wrote that Harlem was, unlike most black ghettos consigned to cities' borders, at the "heart of Manhattan." For that reason, he warned, it would probably not last as a black area. 
For Mr. Mitchell, such change is the natural order of things. The photographer Alfred Stieglitz said to him that he had seen seven different New Yorks out his window. Harlem itself was once Irish, Jewish, German. 
"This is New York," Mr. Mitchell says. "Change sweeps across whole parts."

'Holding On to What We Have'
For many blacks on this block, veteran or new, Harlem's integration cannot be brushed off as just another turn of history. The place means too much.
Janice Anderson is a deeply religious retiree with a vivid feel for language and a youthful glow. She has 30 years on the block. She welcomes the new faces, the new attitudes. She loves the redone town houses, and their "sophisticated air." 
But she has mixed feelings about the "prospectors," the whites walking through her neighborhood, looking property over as if it were theirs for the taking. She watches them taking "before" pictures of buildings. By now she knows there will be an after. 
Nowadays, she says, Harlem "seems to just pop open like a popover" -- an image both comforting and threatening. "There's only but one ethnic group that's always lived here," Ms. Anderson says. "Now there's another."
She was used to the Chinese, with their restaurants and laundries. But she had never before lived among white people. They can become neighbors, she says, if change comes gradually. She grips her fists. "We are holding on to what we have."

A Melting Pot, Stirred
Each Sunday morning, in a one-story brick building on 129th Street, black and white converge. The whites do not live in Harlem; the blacks do. Religion unites them.
The Harlem branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints started three years ago, first meeting at Sylvia's Restaurant on Lenox Avenue. It now draws 40 to 60 members a week. And so two years ago, the church bought property on 129th Street from the Jehovah's Witnesses. 
This church seems an unlikely place for building bridges, and not just because the Mormon Church was long seen as a white bastion. The Mormon religion is a patriarchal culture, with well-defined roles for men and women. Many families joining the church here are largely without men. 
And yet that is partly how the bridge is being built. Use the church, one white member urged during a Sunday lesson on what it means to be a Latter-day Saint woman, explicitly addressing the struggles of single mothers. Invite its men -- the priests, the elders, the home teachers -- to come to your home, talk to your children.
Their discussion touches, in a deep way, on the generational nature of the relations between men and women in Harlem: fatherless young men grow up believing women can do everything on their own, then as adults believe they are not needed and fade away. That reality -- strong women, absent men -- is inscribed even in the neighborhood's new face. The building and block associations developing around 129th Street are, in most cases, the work of women.
Black and white is not the only new interchange on 129th Street. Hispanics, too, are settling in growing numbers in central Harlem, and on this block.
One family, Puerto Rican transplants from Brooklyn, moved into one of Mr. Pascal's buildings but was gone within months. Local stores did not stock the food of the islands. The Catholic churches did not offer Spanish Masses. Then a son was beaten by youths apparently coveting his Cincinnati Reds cap. The family fled to New Jersey. 
Urania Muniz, who with her husband, Huascar Pimentel, and two daughters moved to 129th Street from Queens, has come to love it, finding a friendly sense of community she had never before experienced. She does not like the drug dealing, but she confesses that as she returns home late at night, the dealers make her feel safe. "They're thugs," she says. "But they look out for me."
Then there are the dozens of West Africans, the first major foreign presence here since Caribbeans arrived in force during the Harlem Renaissance. Then, there was outright hostility between Caribbeans and African-Americans. Today, the disdain, elitism and resentment are controlled, but present nonetheless.
Ibrahima Diop, an import-export entrepreneur from Senegal who lives on the block when he is in New York, paints his neighbors with a broad brush. Black New York, he says, is about drugs, alcohol and prostitution. Blacks don't work or educate their children. They have four children from four different fathers. He knows this from his neighborhood and what he reads in the newspapers. 
Some residents of the block believe the Africans think they are superior. The young people call Aminata Kone, 17, an "African queen" because she does not socialize with them even as they themselves say the Africans' food smells and that they do not bathe. 
But connections are spun. Rachel Tew persuades Oley Sarr, a mother of three from Gambia, to enroll her gregarious children in the block's summer camp so that they will learn to socialize with African-American children. By winter, the little boy belts rap tunes as he skips, without fear, down the block.
Ralph Acosta, who sits near the corner of 129th and Lenox every day, greeting everyone who walks by, confronts the block's African women, who from shyness or rudeness are ignoring him. 
"I'm the mayor of the block," he tells them. "If you can't say hello, get on the boat and go back to Africa." They start saying giggling hellos, and more. 
When Amadou Bah, a 73-year-old Liberian refugee settled on 129th Street, is hospitalized, Mr. Acosta watches Mr. Bah's 1-year-old baby so Mariama Bah can visit with her husband. When Mr. Acosta moves to a new apartment on the block, his first guests are the Bahs, who live on a few hundred dollars each month, and who ravenously devour his string beans and stew.

Changing the Mind
Sharlon Dean does little socializing on this block. She enters her brownstone apartment, shuts the door, and revels in the light and air and possibility of her backyard. It makes her feel she is not in Harlem, and Harlem -- as it exists on her block -- is somewhere she does not want to be. 
She came for the easy commute and cheap rent, but found herself right back in what she was fleeing. She is 31, black, and was raised in the projects. She lived briefly in a homeless shelter as a child. 
But she recently got her bachelor's degree from City College. She works for the city, monitoring domestic violence shelters, and is aiming at law school. She has cultivated a taste for greenleaf lettuce, rather than the iceberg she was raised on. She flips through the dictionary to self-educate. 
This block, with its enduring street life, its drugs, does not comport with the life she is building. She turns the corner and gets depressed.
She is a student of signs. On the subway, she observes that the black men lack wedding rings. "How," she asks, "can we commit to making the block better if we can't even commit to being in a relationship?" 
Sometimes, she says, it is hard being black if being black means living the life she sees around her. Sometimes, though, her anger melts to sympathy. How can people be different when they were never told they could be more? "Often I think can I do this? Am I smart enough? It wasn't instilled in me." 
Still, she hopes soon there will be enough new people to force the block into line. "I got to see some serious change out there to feel change up here" -- she points at her head -- "in the membrane."

Life in the Streets
Each afternoon, except when the cold becomes too cruel, a group of men, brown-bagged beers in hand, scratchy boombox providing the soundtrack, sit in front of the well-trafficked little stores near Lenox Avenue. A routine image captures much: how this block's residents have become family, how they cope with crowded living spaces and cramped lives by coming to the street, where laughter, action and air are guaranteed.
For people who grew up here, the block, and all its dramas, have been a life, not just a place to live. They know the lore of each building, remember the birthweights of babies, play off one another's crackling wit.
The scene provides moments of unexpected sweetness, as when a car stereo cranks out a Brook Benton song and a couple, maybe high on more than life, but maybe not, starts dancing and grooving together on the sidewalk, him clapping, her smiling so widely it is as if she has the sun in her mouth.
The scene, too, presents contradictions: a man who spends his afternoons drinking to excess rises at 2:30 a.m., 365 days a year, Christmas included, to sweep sidewalks and deliver newspapers. 
And as the day wanes, particularly in summer, the old block asserts itself, creating unbelievable noise. 129th Street has always been a magnet -- an addiction, one woman says, a place where something is always happening. At night, it can coalesce in what feels like a film set -- dozens of people looking for action on a well-lighted street with prettified buildings and young trees, hanging until the early hours. 
For some on the block, who have pulled themselves up from addiction or crime, the scene is threatening. For some of the new people, the "endless noise" is irritating enough that they contemplate moving off the block. For others, it is insulting. 
Quietly, anonymously, black police officers -- almost all from another Harlem precinct -- have settled here, mostly in Mr. Pascal's buildings. And they have a few quality-of-life complaints. 
For one officer, children who disrespect his property by leaning on his car are a minor irritant. The drug deals he regularly watches from his window are galling.
Like most frustrated citizens he looks to the 32nd Precinct. In a year on the block, he says, while narcotics units have been active, "I can count on one hand the number of sector cars I've seen drive through." He has never seen an officer walk the block. 
One night, Officer Eric Josey went to a meeting between residents of West 130th Street and the 32nd Precinct, to speak for the officers living in the neighborhood.
He had already made the bold move of sending a letter to the 32nd Precinct commander -- and a copy to the chief of department -- saying that the precinct needed to do better. "The officers in my precinct didn't appreciate it," he says. 
In polite terms, he repeats it at the meeting: the precinct must increase the pressure, particularly on 129th Street. He wants a strengthened undercover narcotics presence, and a heavy quality-of-life crackdown by uniformed officers. "There has to be a shake-up on that block," he says. 
Officer Josey does not dispute that the block is better. But how it was before is not a litmus test for how it is now, he says. The people who hang out, stubbornly, purposefully, must be dealt with. It is harsh, he says, "but maybe there's a certain regime of people that has to be relocated."

'I Like a Working Man'
Each day, around 6 p.m., the man in the suit, a small boy dangling from his hand, rounds the corner onto 129th street. He weaves through the block's building cacophony, its budding party. He does not break stride until he hits 35-37 West 129th Street. 
Milton Brown is home. 
The women outside sometimes make jokes -- "Ooh, I like a working man. Want me to come up and rub your back?" The jokes suggest to him that a new working ethos is developing. It is hard to gauge how much Mr. Brown's mere presence may shape his neighbors' lives. His ability and willingness to help them find jobs -- he is an employment specialist for those moving from welfare to work -- surely could.
Economic integration is a core strategy for nonprofits and policy makers these days. In economically mixed neighborhoods, the thinking goes, the poor will have role models to inspire and instruct them. 129th Street is like a petri dish now; the mix is here. And a few years of experience suggest that coexistence may make a difference, but real interaction would mean more. 
Loretta Jeter, a mother of five on welfare and trying to figure out her future, says she doesn't even know what the new people in her building -- Mr. Brown's building -- do. 
"The new people aren't sociable," Nadine Allen, who grew up on the block, says. "We had a lot of community participation when the community wasn't so nice."
But moments of contact do occur, the beginnings of change that may take years to ripen. When Urania Muniz first arrived, she wondered whether she could influence the block's children. She now thinks it is possible. When she works late, the children comment that she works hard. "I have to pay my bills," she explains. "I like to buy nice things." She gets at least one youth hanging on the block into a computer training course at City College. 
In a sense, the new people here are reinforcements for old-timers who tried for years to fight the hopelessness and peer pressure that dragged down the young. Rachel Tew, on the block for 22 years, retired from the Board of Education, serves as an unofficial employment agency and den mother. She lectures Fred Cabey, out of school at 17, to get his working papers. When she suggests a job at a McDonald's on 125th Street, and he says he does not know if it is taking applications, she goes and finds out. He no longer has an excuse.
"Fred could do a lot of things," she says. "He's a gifted little kid. But he's stagnating, like all of us."
The resources that have infused this block since 1994 are a start toward breaking that stagnation. Some, like a youth council that helped find children summer jobs, have come from the community office placed on the block by the Abyssinian Development Corporation. But some resources have come from new residents. A photographer taught the block's youngsters how a camera could transform their neighborhood's prosaic landmarks into glossy poetry. Mr. Brown, a single father to 7-year-old Justin, one fall afternoon took 13 children to a free showing of "Pokemon 2000" movie at the Apollo Theater, simply to get them off the block.

Meetings, and Mediation
It didn't take long for the residents of Mr. Brown's building to realize that their renovated home was stacked like a layered dip. The first two floors are mostly elderly residents; the next two, working people; the top two, "fixed income" or those on welfare, most of whom are veterans of the block.
Almost all of them are black. Many have similar backgrounds. But they think and live differently. Now they must live together. 
There are adjustments. Mr. Brown's suit drew looks at first. As a 30-year-old black woman with no children, Terra Lambright, a mortgage consultant, is unusual here. When she first moved in, she heard some neighbors saying so. She got attitude for working. She was accused of talking white. 
She, in turn, flinched at the way longtime residents in her building regularly leave their doors open. Then her mother, who lived in Harlem long ago, told her that open doors were a tradition even then; it was how the family made some of its best friends. 
Ms. Lambright makes friends, too. Her neighbors, in fact, become a family in a city where she, like many ambitious young migrants, is essentially on her own. When she returned from a long business trip, one neighbor, Frances H., held a welcome-home fish fry. When Ms. Lambright travels, Frances calls her regularly to provide comfort and a link to home. And when they walk the neighborhood together, Ms. Lambright marvels that Frances, 47, on the block since age 12, knows "everybody" anywhere near 129th Street (although she would rather be known by only a first name herself). 
When Danielle Cato, 31, moved in, she heard her neighbors saying "the new people better understand what we're like." She set them straight. She was born in Harlem and raised on 131st Street. She is a single mother and was once on welfare. 
But she put herself through school, earning a master's in social work at Fordham University. Her family owns homes in Harlem, and she plans to also. She knew this block from her childhood, and was reluctant to come. She forbids her daughter to go to the store alone. 
But she needed cheap rent, and squeaking in under the low income limit, she pays $525 for a three bedroom. "Even though I'm part of the 'working crew' here, I'm still poor," she says. "Working poor." 
Believing that she could change her building, if not her block, she joined with other tenants to start a building association. Its first meetings were chaotic and cantankerous. There was yelling -- about Mr. Pascal, the stoops and the superintendent's barking dog.
To the tenants, Ms. Cato defended Mr. Pascal, telling them that unless they maintain the building better, they cannot make demands of him. She tried to teach them how to get what they want. "You can't yell at Pascal," she said at one meeting. "He doesn't know how to handle that." 
And Ms. Cato defended the tenants to him. She chewed Mr. Pascal out for being condescending to the tenants he has labeled as "bad." "I don't like his tone," she says.
The continual littering in the building's halls made Ms. Cato crazy. She established a children's tenant council to help maintain the building. Pumped up by the responsibility, the children, for a time, swept and mopped with glee, knocking on her door at midnight to point out gleaming stairways. 
She has tried to find jobs for the block's teenagers, and tries to get them to understand how the police think so that they can stay safe. She worries about her neighbors who have not worked before, about what will happen to them if rents rise and welfare benefits are cut off. Life is hard on her, and she's been working for years.
She will not stay on this block, she says. But she will not turn her back on it while she is here.

Private Wars, and Scars
Not long after Michelle Ramirez's preaching stint, her prayers appeared to be answered. The four young men disappeared from the corner. The crackheads came, but encountered the equivalent of a gone fishin' sign -- no one working. About a dozen of them, middle-aged men and women, gathered in a desperate knot, banging on the building's door.
Soon enough, though, business resumed. The hustlers were in place early in the morning on the first day of school, saluting children in new backpacks and uniforms, and checking out their mothers. 
But their days appear to be numbered. Narcotics units, responding partly to complaints from the officers on the block, are bearing down. One officer says they will drive the trade from the block, although they know it will just go elsewhere. 
And in the fall, the city decided to turn the building over to Mr. Pascal. It was not the first building in which he confronted drug dealers. In another, two blocks away, a dealer angry that the superintendent would not let him use a vacant apartment shot the super in the head. Mr. Pascal and his other superintendents shipped the body back to Honduras. "He paid the ultimate price for the neighborhood to come back," Mr. Pascal says. "I am going to win -- for him. I'm not going to give up because there are people who want to live decent." 
Some, however, are giving up. The Kones, one of the African families who had come to 129th Street because it was no longer a violent place, plan to move to escape the drug dealing in their building's hallway. 
In the same building, a resident who asked the dealers to leave was stabbed in the face. The head of the drug crew offered to pay his medical bills if he would not press charges. Among neighbors, far from police eyes -- these are the private wars being waged.

Contradictory Visions
A young man, just turned 15, out of school and already working the streets, complains about the renovations on the block as he smokes a joint. "They're cutting off all the alleys so we got nowhere to run" when the police jump out, he says. "They should bring the vacant lots back."
Of all the challenges on 129th Street, one of the greatest is how to reconcile contradictory visions of the same place. 
So when the block's new association met, it set a goal: "to create relations with the veterans so they feel comfortable with the new people." Its first step was to have residents vote the block a name. 129th Street, once known as "the problem block," is now "Strutter's Row."
The second plan was a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Janice Wilson, who had helped restart the association, persuaded local stores to donate food and jazz musicians to play. Pamela Gartrell, an arts teacher with three years on the block, volunteered to forge a children's hip-hop troupe. Each Saturday they rehearsed, feet flying and hearts pumping to the sounds of Destiny's Child. Ms. Gartrell tried to instill professionalism along with the fancy footwork: "You cannot just roll up when you want to."
On Dec. 9, the day of the tree-lighting, 129th Street feels electric. In Gallery X, it looks as if a crate of art supplies has exploded, as Ms. Erbil, Ms. Gartrell and others help the children make ornaments. The hip-hop posse rehearses one last time, Ms. Gartrell pushing hard: "You are the 129th Street dancers -- it's time to act like it."
Janice Anderson, the longtime resident, puts garlands on the block's tree guards. Mr. Pascal's superintendents string white lights on every tree and bush in the gathering darkness. Even Sharlon Dean is dazzled.
The city-donated tree is placed in a once-vacant lot, now a verdant plot named the Harlem Village Green. Sonja Manly, another new resident, hangs ornaments against a backdrop of four still-empty buildings. From one comes the sound of scraping, preparation for renovation. From the street comes the smell of marijuana -- the young men lining the block's south side getting high as heaven. 
The temperature is under 30, the crowd over 200. "The block looks good," Ralph Acosta says from a sidewalk chair. "The block looks very good." 
Councilman Bill Perkins toasts the revival of 129th Street's housing and spirit. He celebrates the young in attendance, saying, "There was a time when it looked like we were not going to have any more young people on this block." As if in affirmation, the children dance better than they have ever rehearsed. 
The crowd counts down: "Ten, nine, eight . . . " the shouted voices soaring above the empty buildings. The switch is pulled, the tree comes on, colored lights glowing in the night. 
This block is like a hologram, and in January it will show its darker side. The 12-year-old son of Zoila White, a five-year resident of the block, accidentally wounds his sister, 7, with a gun he finds in his mother's drawer. In her bedroom, the police say, officers find more than 100 vials of crack. 
The children are taken. The mother, a woman with a decade of nursing home work and no criminal history, who had boasted of keeping her children off the block and in the house, is jailed. The other mothers shake their heads knowingly. For all the change, for all the hope rising in the air, 129th Street can still pull you down. 
But for tonight, the shivering residents hover as if the cold can freeze this moment of promise in time. When the crowd disperses, and two young men begin a profanity-laden argument, Rachel Tew cuts them off.
"Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! You can't be using that language. You see what we're trying to do here." 
From the darkness and toward the marvelous light.

To the Editor:
 Pamela S. Falk ("Easing Up at the Border," Op-Ed, Feb. 15) recommends a mass amnesty for Mexicans illegally residing in the United States, implying that it is "the right thing to do, both economically and morally." Yes, a steady supply of cheap foreign labor financially benefits some businesses. 
And providing the world's desperately poor with the opportunity to move to our high-consumption society feels morally right to many people. 
But no debate on an amnesty is complete without reference to a new Immigration and Naturalization Service study showing that amnesties encourage illegal immigration. And a Gallup Poll this month indicated that only 5 percent of respondents were "very satisfied" with current immigration policy.

HEADLINE: Management: Discarded Dreams Of Dot-ComRejects; 
Growing Indignation Results From Recent Brusque Dismissals

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
They are young, smart and bitter. They are the victims of the recent wave of layoffs in the high-technology industry, and many of them cannot believe how clumsy their former employers were in delivering the bad news.
 Patrick Mannion learned his fate on Dec. 20 when he returned with his wife from a two-week honeymoon in Hawaii to their home in Montclair, N.J. The pink slip telling him his job was eliminated days earlier was waiting for him in a FedEx envelope sent by Organic Inc., an Internet consultant in San Francisco. 
 "For someone who had been with the company for two and a half years, getting a notice just five days before Christmas after having just spent several thousand dollars of my own money was a bittersweet experience," said Mr. Mannion, a creative director for Organic, one of 270 of over 1,200 to lose their jobs. "My wife was absolutely crushed." 
Mr. Mannion said he had recently turned down a lucrative offer from a competitor before he was dismissed. But now, with dot-com jobs scarce, he has decided to do freelance work. An Organic spokeswoman said the company had not made the decision to lay off people lightly and acknowledged that employees "may feel pain or anger as a result."
Companies have always let employees go in hard times, but Internet start-ups that only one year ago could not hire fast enough now have a special problem, employment lawyers and job consultants say. The people in charge are themselves often young and inexperienced in the art of management, they say, and are so used to devoting all their energies to relieving the stresses and strains of fast growth that they do not know how to cope with decline gracefully.
As a result, they can be insensitive to workers and even ignorant of their legal obligations to them. The result is a growing tide of indignation that threatens to tarnish the reputations of some companies and put others in legal predicaments, labor lawyers say. Already, court filings by aggrieved workers and settlements with their former employers are increasing sharply, they say, and the number of lawsuits is expected to grow. "Since around the first of November, we have been receiving maybe two or three times as many calls we did during the good economic times," said Mark Rudy, an employment lawyer with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & True in San Francisco who handles plaintiff claims. "There is a lot of frustration and anger."
Most people who contact him do not have a case that would hold up in court, though, he added.
Much of the problem results from the seat-of-the-pants management mind-set that worked well in the Internet boom of the 1990's but that can be a disaster when applied to the sticky task of dismissing people. "Sometimes, we get a call from companies that say, 'We're doing this layoff tomorrow. Is there anything you want to tell me?' That's kind of scary," said Raymond Hixson, an employment lawyer with Fenwick & West in Palo Alto, Calif., which focuses on high-technology.
Sometimes, it is less the abruptness of the layoffs than the seeming crassness of their bosses that infuriates departing workers. Just ask Marlinda McPhail, 30, of San Francisco who lost her job at Wheelhouse, a consulting company, along with 10 percent of her colleagues in early January. As she and another victim were packing up their belongings in their office, Ms. McPhail recalled, people who had escaped the downsizing started streaming in.
It turned out that management had called a meeting in their office to discuss the layoffs. "I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me,' " she said. She stormed out, leaving her computer, wallet and bag behind. "They're just idiots," said Ms. McPhail, who remains unemployed.
Paul McNulty, Wheelhouse's vice president for marketing, said, "If someone feels they weren't treated with respect, we apologize for that."
Or take Collaborative Media, a San Francisco company that runs an online product review site, Etown. The company announced on Valentine's Day that it would lay off all of its 101 employees, because financing from a major investor had been cut off. Not only were employees surprised by the abrupt notice and lack of severance pay, they also were not paid for the last week and a half they worked there.
"People feel as if they have been betrayed, that they have been lied to and that the company used them," said Tim Lefkowicz, former vice president for business and corporate development, who also missed his last paycheck.
The company has referred employees who say they have not been paid for hours worked over the last two weeks to the investor, Best Buy. Workers say that they plan to appeal to the state labor commissioner. Robert Heiblim, former chief executive of Collaborative Media, said the company had little choice. "We couldn't touch the assets and we couldn't pay the employees," he said.
What rankles many who suddenly find themselves on the unemployment rolls is the way their once-highflying employers apparently hide the truth of their financial straits. David Wadler was laid off without severance pay and almost no warning by an online entertainment start-up in New York City in early December when it suddenly announced that it had run out of money.
"It was literally like getting smacked in the face," said Mr. Wadler, 26, who is still unemployed. "It was like getting dumped."
When push comes to shove, even the longest-serving employees find they can be let go. It happened to Lorraine Cheu when SpotLife.com, a San Francisco site that helps consumers broadcast videos on the Internet, dismissed her with 25 percent of its staff in January. "I was employee No. 1 right after the founders," she said. "I felt like we were cattle led off to the slaughter," she added. Ms. Cheu, who has not yet found another job, said she held off signing a severance agreement that would relinquish her right to take legal action "to kind of make them sweat."
Like other casualties of the dot-come meltdown, Ms. Cheu has vented her anger on a Web site -- in her case, her own -- and says she has gotten a sympathetic response from readers.
SpotLife declined to comment.
Venting -- not litigation -- is probably the most realistic response for most laid off employees. After all, to get the best severance package possible, many of them agree in writing not to sue. And besides, employment contracts in the high-technology industry generally give employers discretion to dismiss employees at will.
"Americans instinctively believe that they can only be fired for doing something wrong, or not performing," said Bill Quackenbush, a labor lawyer in San Mateo, Calif., who represents plaintiffs. "One of the hardest parts of my job is explaining to people that they don't have a legal claim because of the at-will clause."
Even so, lawyers say high-technology start-ups will be vulnerable litigation targets for a variety of factors: their freewheeling culture that sometimes resulted in a skirting of workplace laws, the high levels of shattered expectations and the intelligence and drive of the aggrieved ex-workers. "They tend to bring a more aggressive litigation response than in a less educated blue-collar work force," said Victor Schachter, who heads the employment group at Fenwick & West.
That is what Juliana Rubenstein did. She was a former vice president at HSX Holding Inc., parent of Hollywood Stock Exchange, in West Hollywood, Calif., a market for trading shares of celebrities, movies and music using a virtual currency.
Mrs. Rubenstein filed a complaint last fall with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing charging her former employer with wrongful termination, retaliation and pregnancy discrimination. According to suit, Mrs. Rubenstein was told by executives in September that she was selected for a December layoff because there was no way to guarantee that she would ever return to work following her pregnancy leave. Subsequently, she filed a civil action in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing the company of discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act.
Despite her strong performance reviews, the company said it made sense to lay her off, and offered to give her a severance package. Days after she faxed a copy of a complaint that she had filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing to the human resources department at HSX Holdings, Mrs. Rubenstein said the company dismissed her and withdrew its severance package.
HSX said it could not comment on pending litigation except to say it would vigorously defend itself.
Another company that finds itself in legal trouble these days is Walker Digital, a cousin company to Priceline.com in Stamford, Conn., that handles inventions and patents. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Walker Digital told employees that it would be laying off a substantial number of them the very next day.
"The week before they told us to pack our bags, they were telling us things were great," said Kari O'Toole, an administrative assistant who was one of those who lost her job. "They didn't even give us a full last paycheck. They paid you up to the minute you worked. The employees were left without severance pay, and only were belatedly paid for their unused vacation days."
As it turns out, Walker Digital may have acted too rashly. In January, Connecticut's attorney general charged it with violating a federal law that requires companies above a certain size to give 60 days' advance notice of a plant closing or mass layoff. Walker Digital contends that it was exempt from the law because it was seeking financing. "We feel the lawsuit is without merit," said Kevin Goldman, a spokesman for Walker Digital.
Ms. O'Toole is still job-hunting, and the experience has left her dispirited. "It's terrible out there," she said. "You can't trust any one."

HEADLINE: Net Profits Rise 4.5% at Wal-Mart, but Crumble at Home Depot 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit rose the smallest amount in almost five years, while Home Depot said its earnings fell as the slowing economy prompted consumers to spend less.
 Net income at Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 4.5 percent, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 1996. Home Depot, the home-improvement chain, said net income dropped 20 percent. 
 Net income at Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., rose to $2 billion, or 45 cents a share, compared with $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Sales in the period ended Jan. 31 rose 10 percent, to $56.6 billion, from $51.4 billion.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 44 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Wal-Mart's supercenters, warehouse-size stores with full grocery departments, drove its fourth-quarter results. Selling food helps protect Wal-Mart from weakening demand for other goods.
Food sales rose 32 percent in the quarter. At stores open at least a year, the supercenters grew at twice the rate of Wal-Mart's discount stores, it said. Nonfood sales also rose a larger percentage at supercenters than at discount stores.
Net income at Home Depot, based in Atlanta, fell to $465 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $578 million, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Jan. 28 rose 14 percent, to $10.46 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year were unchanged.
Lumber prices fell to an eight-year low last quarter, reducing sales, Home Depot said. It had cut fourth-quarter profit estimates twice since October because of falling prices for building materials. Its earnings met analysts' reduced forecast, according to First Call.
Both chains said they expected to meet first-quarter earnings forecasts.
Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, Thomas Schoewe, said first-quarter profit would be in line with the 32 cents a share forecast by analysts. Same-store sales will rise 3 to 5 percent, he said. Earnings will rise by a single-digit percentage rate in the first half and increase to a double-digit pace in the second half, Mr. Schoewe said.
"Many retailers expect the first half to be challenging," said Asma Usmani, an analyst at Edward Jones & Company. "This time last year, many of the retailers were reporting strong earnings, so they're up against some tough numbers."
Home Depot said its first-quarter profit would meet the 26 cents a share estimated by Wall Street; sales at stores open at least a year will be unchanged or drop slightly, Carol Tome, senior vice president for finance, said in a conference call.
Home Depot plans to open 200 stores this year, down from the 225 it planned on as of last month.
Wal-Mart rose $1.04, to $53.40; Home Depot rose $1.09, to $44.09.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Technology Shares Lead Market Lower

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Technology stocks fell sharply yesterday, leading the market lower, as investors tried to adjust to the economic slowdown.
 From the faltering market for technology stocks to weakening commodities prices, market strategists said that the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve were not yet stimulating a strong recovery. 
"Assumptions about a recovery are now being challenged," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. The stock market's retreat from January's highs "makes it look a whole lot more like just another failed rally," he said. 
Led by a sell-off in Intel, the Nasdaq composite index fell 107.03 points, or 4.4 percent, to 2,318.35. The Nasdaq is now less than 27 points above where it closed on Jan. 2, when it plunged 7.2 percent to its low for this year. The next day, the Federal Reserve made the first of its two cuts in interest rates of half a percentage point each in a bid to revive the economy.
Shares of Intel fell $2.94, to $31.44, after an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney said a recovery in the semiconductor industry did not appear that likely in the second half of the year. The company also announced a cost-cutting plan yesterday. 
"We're facing challenging economic times," said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, in a telephone interview.
Wall Street analysts agreed with that sentiment, predicting other companies would continue to feel the strain. Shares of three technology companies -- PMC-Sierra, Applied Micro Circuits and JDS Uniphase -- fell sharply after Arnab Chandra, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, reduced his projections for their profits. PMC-Sierra dropped $7.88, to $44.63; Applied Micro lost $5.75, to $38.06; and JDS fell $1.44, to $34.31.
Other market gauges also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 22.59 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,278.94, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 68.94 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,730.88.
Shares of some retailers gained. Wal-Mart reported earnings yesterday that slightly exceeded Wall Street's forecasts; its shares gained $1.04, to $53.40. Home Depot, posted earnings that met lowered expectations; its stock rose $1.09, to $44.09. But Wal-Mart's sales at its stores open a year or more grew more slowly than its overall revenue, and Home Depot's comparable-store sales fell, indicating the results were produced by cost savings and not by strong consumer spending.
"We have not yet seen the impact of interest rate cuts in our sales," said Robert Nardelli, chief executive of Home Depot, told analysts during a conference call. --------------------

Treasury Prices Decline
By The Associated Press
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 , to a price of 99 8/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.10 percent from 5.09 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 , to 98 7/32 . The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.45 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:

Intel Plans Broad Measures to Cut Costs

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Intel today announced a wide range of cost-saving measures, including delayed raises for employees, but not layoffs, intended to counter a slowing economy.
 Intel, the world's largest chip maker, said it hoped to save "hundreds of millions of dollars" without having to scale back spending on research and development, an area it is counting on to stay ahead of its competitors. 
 Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., intends to postpone many of its employees' pay increases until the fall, place strict limits on new hiring and gradually reduce its work force through attrition, said Robert Manetta, a spokesman. Less than 10 percent of Intel's work force is typically lost to attrition each year. 
The cutbacks also include a 30 percent drop in "discretionary spending," which includes employee travel, training programs and overtime. Finally, Mr. Manetta said, Intel will delay its effort to provide each of its employees with a free personal computer and Internet access until 2002.
The company said it was standing by its estimates, announced last month, that revenues will decline 10 to 15 percent this quarter.
Intel posted a memorandum outlining the cost-reduction measures on its internal Web site this morning. In an interview, Mr. Manetta said the plans included no layoffs.
"This is in response to the uncertain economic conditions that we're seeing worldwide," Mr. Manetta said.
Shares of Intel closed down $2.94, at $31.44 today, and slipped another 6 cents in trading after the market had closed.
Mr. Manetta also said the board would soon consider a proposal to grant new stock options to employees whose option prices are more expensive than the market value, a condition known as being underwater.
Intel joins the growing list of technology companies tightening their belts as their business markets, booming only a year ago, grow increasingly uncertain. Last week, Applied Materials, which sells chip-making equipment to companies like Intel, said it had hired fewer temporary workers, lowered salaries 10 percent for top management, postponed pay-raises and asked employees to take five days off this quarter.
Mr. Manetta said Intel remained committed to spending more money than ever on improving its products. Last month, Intel executives said they would increase capital spending this year to $7.5 billion from $6.7 billion, and spend $4.3 billion on research and development, compared with $3.9 billion last year. 
Research and development is crucial to Intel's hopes of fending off Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta, which design chips for a much narrower range of products. Chris Chaney, a vice president with A. G. Edwards who covers semiconductors, said Intel must heavily outspend its competitors because it produces chips for not only PC's but cellular phones and other wireless devices.
"You really don't want to fall behind in technology just because sales are slowing down temporarily," Mr. Chaney said.
Makers of PC's and chips have said they expect the market to improve in the second half of the year. But Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that outlook may be overly optimistic. Calling the fundamentals "truly awful," he predicted a need for continued price declines and reduced profits.
"We believe estimates will continue to come down sharply in coming months," he wrote in a research report, "as the market realizes there will be no material recovery in the second half."
As if to punctuate the slowdown, PC Data, a market research firm in Reston, Va., released figures today that showed a sharp decline in retail PC sales. In January, the company said, unit sales of desktop PC's fell 26 percent from January 2000. Revenues fell 28 percent.
"You can't get around the black cloud," said Stephen Baker, vice president for technology products for PC Data. "When that's going to turn around, I don't think anybody has any visibility into that now."
But the report did find a few glimmers of hope. Sales of midrange machines, priced between $1,000 and $1,500, increased from 15 percent of total sales to 32 percent of total sales, suggesting that consumers were willing to spend more on machines. Only 63.5 percent of the PC's sold for less than $1,000, the lowest percentage since February 1999.

Fowl Play

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
One hears that George W. Bush likes to give people nicknames. So I hereby propose that he himself be known as Chicken Little. After all, he has been running around saying "The sky is falling! Hurry up and pass my tax cut!" And that of course means that we should dub Dick Cheney, who has been the administration's point man for economic pessimism, Chicken Big Time.
 With one exception, the economic data don't support such gloomy views. The unemployment rate has ticked up slightly, but it is still lower than anyone would have thought possible only a few years ago -- and in much of the country labor markets remain tight. Business payrolls actually expanded faster from November through January than they did in the previous three months. 
 Meanwhile, though the growth in consumer spending and business investment has slowed, there has been no collapse. Housing starts are actually up. Manufacturing output did fall sharply in the last few months of 2000, but this was mainly the result of inventory effects: companies produced too much in the face of slowing demand, found that they had accumulated excess inventories, and temporarily slashed production in order to clear their warehouses. Production of most manufactures stabilized last month, and unless demand takes another fall should soon recover.
The one really negative piece of economic news is that consumer confidence has plunged, to an extent that is hard to understand given the still relatively good news about jobs. Why should consumers suddenly have become so pessimistic?
One answer is that people are worried because of the fall in tech stocks -- even though broader stock indices like the S.&P. 500 have not fallen by anything like as much.
Another answer is that the headlines have been much worse than the reality. In today's greed-is-good business world, companies announcing layoffs don't try to soften the blow; they exaggerate the damage to impress financial markets with their tough-mindedness. As this newspaper pointed out on Monday, behind those huge announced job cuts you often find quite modest actual job losses. 
There is also, arguably, the CNBC effect. The media, and especially news channels that have to keep people watching all day, thrive on hype. Whatever is happening, good or bad, gets blown out of proportion. Remember the panic a few years ago about downsizing? I didn't think so. When the economy was on its way up, the media hyped its successes; now they hype the alleged recession.
Last but perhaps not least among causes of the consumer funk is the administration's own determined pessimism. Mr. Bush has a bully pulpit, and he is using it to preach economic alarm. This adds powerfully to the chorus of doomsaying. And when it comes to short-term economics, believing can sometimes make it so. 
There's no mystery about why the administration is so eager to pronounce the economy flat on its back -- Mr. Bush wants to use fear of recession to bully Congress into rushing through his tax cut, without worrying about little details like whether it would actually help, or whether we can actually afford it. But it's still a remarkable departure from the usual principles of economic policy. Has there ever before been a case of a U.S. administration deliberately undermining confidence for the sake of political advantage?
The closest parallel I can think of is the policy, early in the last administration, of talking down the dollar in order to put pressure on Japan. That policy was widely condemned -- though few would go as far as Lawrence Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, who has suggested that the weak-dollar rhetoric of 1993-1994 was a major cause of the Asian crisis that began in 1997. Still, I agree that a policy of talking down the dollar to put pressure on a foreign government was irresponsible. How much worse, then, is a policy of talking down the U.S. economy to put pressure on our own legislature? 
And turnabout is surely fair play. Having blamed efforts by his predecessors to "manipulate the dollar for domestic political purposes" for a global financial crisis, Mr. Lindsey surely cannot complain if the efforts of his own colleagues to worsen economic perceptions come in for criticism -- especially if this administration succeeds in getting the recession it apparently wants.

HEADLINE: Blair Seeking To Ease Tension On Iraq Strikes 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
As he prepared to become the first European leader to visit President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain offered today to revive his role in the Clinton administration as the bridge between the United States and Europe. It was not the easiest of times to send the message.
 Mr. Blair plans to leave for Canada and the United States on Wednesday, just days after British and American warplanes bombed targets in Iraq in raids supposed to enforce no-flight zones in force since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. But the bombings last Friday drove a wedge between Britain and its European allies and raised protests in the British Parliament that a decade of sanctions against Iraq had punished the Iraqi people, rather than their avowed target, the government of Saddam Hussein. 
 In an interview with American correspondents tonight, Mr. Blair defended the hawkish stance of Britain and the United States, but indicated that he and Mr. Bush would discuss a revision of the sanctions that were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
"What we are doing on Iraq is absolutely essential," Mr. Blair said, listing the Iraqi leader's killing of his own Kurdish citizens, his 1980-88 war with Iran and his invasion of Kuwait as evidence that Mr. Hussein is "probably the most dangerous ruler at the present time anywhere in the world."
"In the longer term we need to look at a better sanctions and inspection regime," Mr. Blair said, referring to Western demands that Iraq submit itself once again to weapons inspections, which it halted in 1998. He did not elaborate, but other officials said Britain wanted to refine the sanctions in some way that would deflect European and Arab criticism that the trade restrictions have been catastrophic for ordinary Iraqis.
Mr. Blair, for his part, blamed what he called Mr. Hussein's refusal to spend authorized oil revenues on food and medicine for the hardships of the Iraqi people.
"The truth is that while Saddam remains there, things will not get better for them," Mr. Blair said. "And what we cannot do is allow him to threaten the stability of his neighbors and the rest of the world."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: MARKET PLACE; 
Puts and Calls: Mixed Signals On Direction Of the Market

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The pros are confident, but the amateurs are scared. Unfortunately, this is one area where the amateurs seem to have a better forecasting record.
 The subject of disagreement is the near-term prospects for the stock market, as reflected in options trading. When traders are bearish, the volume of put options rises relative to that of call options. And when traders are bullish, they buy more call options. 
 At the moment, however, the options market is sending off radically different signs -- signs that indicate professional money managers are confident that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, can prevent major damage to either the economy or the stock market. Individual investors appear to be much more nervous.
Those positions are the reverse of what they were for much of the 1990's bull market, during which professionals often became jittery but the market was helped through weak spots by individual investors who saw declines as buying opportunities.
The varying attitudes can be seen in options trading. The market for options on stock indexes -- a market used more by money managers -- shows general bullishness. But the market for options on individual stocks -- used more by individual investors -- shows more bearishness.
At the moment, the nervousness of individual investors looks to be more in tune with the market. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.4 percent yesterday, to 2,318.35. It is now less than 27 points above the low it reached on Jan. 2, the day before the Fed surprised the market by cutting interest rates and sending the Nasdaq up 328 points, or 14.2 percent. Now almost all of that gain has vanished, although the Fed cut rates again in January and there is talk it might make another cut before its next meeting on March 20.
"Right now, it appears that professional investors are very complacent," said Philip J. Roth, a technical analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Their attitude is, 'The damage has been done, let's prepare for the recovery.' "
Index options, Mr. Roth said, are used primarily by portfolio managers and other professional traders who move in or out of the options market based on their need to protect entire portfolios. A money manager who fears an abrupt slide in prices can protect his portfolio by buying a put option, while one who thinks the market is likely to move up quickly can put cash to work rapidly by buying a call option.
On the other hand, options on individual stocks are more often used by individual investors seeking to protect themselves from falls in individual stocks, or looking for profits from a quick rise in a share price. While the put-call ratio on individual stock options has come down some since the end of last year, when it was at its highest average in a couple of years, it is still high by historical standards.
Mr. Roth surmised that many individual investors have been burned by technology investments and are more interested than they usually are in seeking the protection offered by the purchase of puts.
Figures for the put-call ratio can bounce around sharply from day to day, which is why technical analysts use moving averages to smooth out the data. The patterns identified above show up in both the 30- and 50-day moving averages.
Presumably because professionals are much more likely to use hedging techniques, index options tend to get more put activity than do options on individual stocks, so the ratio on options is always higher. But those who follow the figures say the trends, not the absolute levels, are the important indicators to watch.
Traditionally, the put-call ratio has been viewed as a contrary indicator, meaning that if investors were buying a lot of puts, it was viewed as an indication that bearishness had reached an extreme and the market might soon rally. Mr. Roth said he thinks a market bottom is not likely to come until there is bearishness shown in both put-call ratios. 
Much of the rise from 1995 through 1998, Mr. Roth said, showed relatively high put-call ratios for index options, an indication that professionals doubted that the rise was real. 
In late 1999 and early 2000, the Nasdaq composite soared to records that many professionals found hard to believe, rising 88 percent from Oct. 19, 1999, when it closed at 2,688.18, through March 10, 2000, when it peaked at 5,048.62.
For much of that time, the put-call ratio on index options was rising, as money managers found it hard to believe the move was real. The 50-day moving average rose to a peak on Jan. 27, and then came down during the final six weeks of the rise.
Options activity on individual stocks showed relatively little put activity during that period, as individuals showed no fear. They were right for the rise, but were slow to seek protection when the debacle began. Since then, the trend has been to seek more protection from puts as confidence in the market has weakened.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Close to Deal to Move Into Tower on Alexander's Site 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
After more than 26 months of often tortuous negotiations with a developer, Bloomberg L.P., the giant financial information and media company, said yesterday that it was close to signing a deal for a proposed 70-story tower on the site of the old Alexander's department store at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.
 Under the terms of the deal, Bloomberg would move its headquarters and more than 2,000 employees from Park Avenue and 59th Street to the 1.3 million-square-foot skyscraper. The company would occupy about half the space, building studios for digital television and radio programs. The upper floors of the nearly 900-foot-tall building would contain about 200 condominiums, and the basement and first and second floors would have retail space. Cesar Pelli and his son Rafael are designing it. 
 The department store was a dark and gloomy presence at the intersection for much of the 1990's. Vornado Realty Trust, which controls the site, demolished the six-story department store more than a year ago. 
"We're in the final stages," said Paul F. Darrah, director of real estate for Bloomberg. "I think Cesar Pelli is designing a signature piece of architecture for Bloomberg's occupancy."
Michael Bloomberg, the chairman of Bloomberg, is considering seeking the Republican nomination for mayor this year. Late last year, his company obtained $14.4 million in tax breaks to stay in the city. Mr. Bloomberg may forgo the incentive package, a company executive said, to avoid criticism.
In 1998, Bloomberg sought about 350,000 square feet in the tower Vornado was planning. But it was no easy matter negotiating with the chairman of Vornado, Steven Roth, who wanted a building with a luxury hotel, condominiums and a limited amount of office space.
In the meantime, Bloomberg kept growing, to the point that it became clear that it would need more space. Late last year, Mr. Roth failed to strike a deal with a hotelier at the same time Bloomberg told the developer that it needed as much as 700,000 square feet. Out went the hotel. The tower as now designed would include about 900,000 square feet of office space.
But that meant that Vornado would have to dismantle and reconfigure some of the foundations it had already poured, at a cost of millions.
In response to critics, Mr. Roth often said his property grew in value every day he delayed. Now that the economy is slowing down, real estate executives said, Bloomberg is pulling the project out of a hole.
Bloomberg declined yesterday to discuss the financial aspects of its deal. But one executive who had been briefed on the terms said that when all was said and done, Bloomberg might pay as much as $90 a square foot in rent, rivaling some of the most expensive space in Manhattan.
"Roth dumped many of the costs on Bloomberg," one executive said. "He just passed through the cost of every redesign."

HEADLINE: Looking Tough on Iraq 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "U.S. and British Jets Strike Air-Defense Centers in Iraq" (front page, Feb. 17):
 The United States has lost the legal high ground that allowed it to build the Persian Gulf war coalition. 
While Iraq withholds information about its weapons programs and threatens neighbors, the United States supports economic warfare against Iraqi civilians, and grants itself permission to patrol and bomb Iraq at will. Consequently, the members of the 1990's coalition now often oppose American policy. 
 President Bush has promised to deliver us from the previous administration's mess. But by ignoring international law and allies in the belief that complex international problems can be solved by looking tough, Mr. Bush plays Saddam Hussein's game.

HEADLINE: We Can Afford a Much Bigger Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By Jack Kemp; Jack Kemp is a co-director of Empower America.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Circumstances have changed dramatically since President Bush first proposed his tax cut last year. The economy has slowed down, with recession a distinct possibility. But in the long term, official budget surplus projections have risen from $3 trillion to almost $6 trillion. 
 In fact, if the Congressional Budget Office were not using overly pessimistic assumptions about revenue growth, surplus projections would actually be about one-third larger, or more than $8 trillion over the coming decade. The additional $2 trillion of surplus revenue would therefore easily accommodate a substantial expansion of the tax rate reductions currently under consideration. Quite simply, the federal government is awash in surpluses and will remain so even after President Bush's tax cut, barring a major economic contraction. It would not be unreasonable for Mr. Bush to seek tax rate reductions twice the size of what he has proposed. 
 The Bush administration has done a marvelous job of presenting the arguments for the president's proposal. But by locking itself into a $1.6 trillion reduction and devoting a large amount of the surpluses to debt retirement, the administration has fallen behind the curve as circumstances have changed.
Even if one has confidence that Congress will devote every penny of the additional surpluses to debt retirement, which I do not, it will run out of debt to retire even faster than already projected. Then within a very few years we would confront the highly undesirable situation of the government having to invest those surpluses in private assets, i.e., the stock market. That is why Alan Greenspan told Congress a crash course to retire the national debt is not the best fiscal policy for the nation.
Contrary to misconceptions on Capitol Hill among both parties, rushing to retire the national debt will not lower interest rates (they are higher today than they were in 1993 when deficits were around 4 percent of gross domestic product). Neither will debt reduction increase national savings. Debt retirement does not strengthen Social Security. Debt reduction does not promote economic growth. Economic growth reduces the burden of debt. (Although the debt held by the public rose from $2.4 trillion in 1990 to $3.6 trillion in 1999, the debt burden on the economy actually fell from 42.4 percent of gross domestic product to 41.9 percent because the economy grew faster than the debt during the same period.) And, high tax rates do not promote growth; they stifle it.
The president's political capital for tax cuts may now be as high as it will get. He needs to invest it in a push for broader and deeper tax reductions and reforms. Waiting will only make it harder for him to achieve comprehensive simplification of our confusing and counterproductive tax code.
Of course, I recognize the constraints and political uncertainties a new president faces, and I would not second-guess Mr. Bush's decision to deliver on the tax cut plan he made during his campaign before reaching for more.
However, I believe it is essential for him to send the nation an unambiguous signal in his upcoming address to Congress that this year's tax cut is just the first step to rate reductions each year from here on out.
I hope the president pledges to make fundamental tax reform and simplification a keystone of his administration. That means creating a system that applies a low tax rate on all taxpayers, protects taxpayer rights and stops collection abuses, ends the multiple taxation of saving and investment, and imposes rules to ensure substantial consensus before taxes are raised by Congress.
Tax reform is never easy, but it will be easier now than later -- and better for the economy. Finally, a reminder to my Republican friends in Congress: Don't negotiate with yourselves. You'll lose!

HEADLINE: Arts in America; 
A Struggle to Be Seen

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Although Tulane University has one of the country's finest collections of African-American art, most of it languishes unseen in a locked storeroom.
 "All the major players are represented here, but our one exhibition room isn't big enough to show even a fraction of what we have," said Mora J. Beauchamp-Byrd, the curator of the collection at Tulane's Amistad Research Center. "This work deserves to be seen and appreciated, and it's really very frustrating that we don't have the space to show it." 
 Across town, the Black Arts National Diaspora Museum houses another rich collection. But during one recent week the museum was closed much of the time, with grates on the door and windows and apparently no one inside. 
"That's because we're on the first floor in a bad neighborhood, and we have treasures," said Jeannette Hodge, the museum's director. The museum also lacks the staff and resources that would allow it to remain open as regularly as she would like.
In the historic Treme neighborhood, near the French Quarter, government urban renewal funds were used several years ago to buy four 19th-century wooden buildings that are now home to the New Orleans African-American Museum of Art, Culture and History. But the museum has little parking and no bus turnaround space and is not in a well-traveled area. Its budget is so small that there are only three professional staff members. 
An hour's drive from New Orleans, near Gonzales, La., an old plantation town, a woman named Kathe Hambrick has opened a one-room museum dedicated to the history of African slavery in the United States. Ms. Hambrick has great plans, but at the moment she relies on student volunteers and an annual budget of just $100,000.
The challenges facing these institutions reflect those at African-American museums across the country. Even in New Orleans, which has an extraordinarily rich African-American tradition and where the majority of the population is black, such museums are struggling.
Nonetheless, there are far more museums concentrating on African-American culture and history than there were a few decades ago. As recently as 1970 only a handful existed across the country. Today there are hundreds. Some, like the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History in Detroit and the African-American Museum in Dallas, are run by highly qualified administrators and have big ambitions. Many others face a host of obstacles as they seek to evolve from modest semiprofessional institutions into serious and broadly appealing ones.
"It's not so easy," said Lowery Sims, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. "We're the only African-American museum that is accredited by the American Association of Museums. Other institutions that want to get to that level need to have a certain quality of collection, good storage facilities and staff to deal with the collection, bring in exhibitions on a regular basis and raise money. 
"We also have the advantage of an institutional structure and a strong board of directors. You need that to rise out of the situation where it's an individual who decides the fate of the museum."
Many curators at African-American museums combine art and history, saying that much of the black experience can be told through the visual arts.
"When a group of people cannot preserve their history in books for one reason or another, they use oral history and art," said Antoinette Wright, director of the DuSable Museum of African-American History in Chicago. "The African tradition of recorded history is completely bound up with the visual arts, and we haven't moved away from that."
Ms. Wright said that the DuSable Museum, like many other African-American institutions, considered its mission to be social as well as educational.
"In the face of so much negativity, our people, especially young people, need to see positive images," she said. "We get kids in here who have been told all their lives that they're going to wind up in prison. When they see our exhibit of African-American inventors, they leave with an 'I can' spirit. That helps them move away from distorted images that were created for us."
"This whole museum movement really just started in the early 1990's, and it's a thrill to see that more and more cities are deciding that they want something like this." she continued. "We're just beginning to record our history. I'm looking forward to the day when we'll have the resources and the public interest that's been devoted to Holocaust museums. Then we'll really be able to preserve and convey our experience as a people."
The DuSable Museum has an annual budget of $2.7 million. That is among the highest of any African-American museum, but it pales before the budgets of major national museums. This year, for example, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's in Washington is $55.7 million, more than half of which comes from federal funds.
Although curators at African-American museums say that many of their appeals to wealthy blacks fall on deaf ears, some celebrities do contribute. Among those who have donated to various museums are Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Bill Cosby and Billy Dee Williams, himself a painter.
Curators also complain about a lack of corporate support, but there are striking exceptions. The General Motors Foundation recently gave $5 million for the establishment of an African-American art center in Detroit, and Proctor & Gamble has donated $6 million to a new museum in Cincinnati that is to document the history of the Underground Railroad. 
Planning for the Cincinnati museum, which is not expected to open until 2004, has been under way for five years. Officials there said they were acutely aware of how many African-American museums had stumbled or failed because they were founded with more enthusiasm than savvy.
Rita Organ, the director of exhibits and collections at the embryonic Cincinnati museum, is also president of the Association of African-American Museums, which has more than 200 members. Several hundred museums devoted to aspects of the African-American experience, many of them in storefronts or single rooms, do not belong.
Ms. Organ said that in addition to coping with low funds and lack of professional expertise, such museums must deal carefully with political sensitivities.
"Telling African-American history can often offend donors if they feel that the history isn't the truth or places a particular person or group of people in a bad light," she said. "If it is perceived that our museums are becoming corporately run, then the community can often respond negatively, and this shows in attendance figures. On the flip side, if a corporation sees that there is no community support, it may be reluctant to give."
In February, which for 25 years has been designated Black History Month, many institutions across the country offer special programs and exhibitions documenting the African-American experience. This year's range from a photography exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago to re-creations of slave life at George Washington's estate in Mount Vernon, Va.
Throughout the year, museums that have large collections of African-American art but not enough space to display them often send their works on tour or lend them to other institutions. Last fall, for example, six historically black colleges and universities selected outstanding works from their collections, combined them into a single exhibition and arranged for it to be shown at Duke University.
Occasionally, private collectors of African-American art donate works to universities or other institutions that seem able to catalog and display them. Recently, for example, Paul R. Jones, who worked for a number of government civil rights programs, donated his collection of more than 1,000 works to the University of Delaware.
The collection at the Amistad Research Center includes works by many of the most celebrated African-American artists, including acknowledged masters like Henry O. Tanner, Edward Mitchell Bannister and Jacob Lawrence. Its most popular work, judging from the number of requests that the center receives for permission to reproduce it on notecards and posters, as well as in art history textbooks, is Ellis Wilson's colorful and stylized "Funeral Procession." It is among the best-known images in African-American art, but most of the time it sits unseen in the Amistad's storeroom.
"We want to show our art, which we can hardly do now, and we also want to contextualize it, because in our community, art and history really do overlap," Ms. Beauchamp-Byrd said. "Institutions like ours have to do this because mainstream museums are not presenting these artists' work. Our artists have not been on a level playing field with others who are not of color."
Many specialists in African-American history are frustrated that there is no single museum or center in the United States that comprehensively documents the institution of slavery, the root of the black experience in this country. Some, however, like the Anacostia Museum and Center for African-American History and Culture in Washington, display artifacts of slave life.
"In our society we're used to looking at museums as places where we see the best of ourselves," said Steven Newsome, the Anacostia's director. "The subject of slavery runs against that expectation. There have been a few efforts to confront this subject, but all of us need to do a better job of it. It's a question that will continue to arise, and at some point, it's going to have to be dealt with."
Mr. Newsome, like some of his colleagues, believes that it may be best for a museum or museums of slavery to be located in the South. The River Road African-American Museum and Gallery, which Ms. Hambrick opened in 1994, is a modest effort to begin such an institution.
Ms. Hambrick was born in Louisiana but left as a teenager, vowing never to return to what she considered a hateful part of the country, filled with visible and invisible reminders of overwhelming brutality.
"When I finally did come back, something told me to take one of these plantation tours," she said. "I wound up taking them all, and I was very disturbed and upset that there was no mention of slavery at all. One guide even talked about servants. That's when I decided that this story has to be told."
With no experience or training in the field, Ms. Hambrick persuaded the owners of one plantation to give her a vacant cabin, which now houses her museum. Its exhibits range from a cotton sack to a sign that reads "Colored Served in Rear."
Ms. Hambrick is now seeking $2.5 million in grants to buy an original slave cabin, present art and history exhibitions and build a sculpture garden.
"This is our Auschwitz," Ms. Hambrick said. "We need to learn about what happened, confront it and educate people about something a lot of them are only vaguely aware of. We've been so caught up in civil rights, fighting poverty and trying to reduce crime that we haven't had time to think about preserving our culture. If we can start doing that, we'll build our self-esteem in ways that will really be good for America."

Treasuries Lower on Price Data

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices posted their largest gain in 10 months in January, raising some concerns that inflation might not be as mild as many had thought.
 But losses were modest as stock prices continued to slide, and analysts said inflation was not enough of a threat to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates further. 
 The Consumer Price Index, the benchmark gauge of inflation, rose 0.6 percent last month as energy costs soared after a gain in December of just 0.2 percent. 
Inflation erodes the value of long-term securities, and 30-year bonds shed more than half a point by late afternoon. But economists maintained that the risk of a recession -- not inflation -- represented the greatest threat to the economy.
Of more immediate concern, traders said, slumping equity markets might be expected to stem losses by Treasuries.
Two-year notes, which are sensitive to the outlook for Fed rate cuts, were flat but held up relatively well as the market absorbed $11 billion in new notes at the Treasury's monthly auction.
By late in the day, good investor demand allowed the yield on the new issue to fall to 4.662 percent from 4.685 percent at auction. In trading in the current two-year issue, which will be replaced by the new one, the yield slipped to 4.70 percent from 4.71 percent the previous day.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32 , to 99. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.13 percent from 5.10 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond fell 13/32 , to 98 14/32 . Its yield rose to 5.48 percent from 5.45 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price: 99.887
High Yield: 4.685%
Low Yield: 4.620%
Median Yield: 4.663%

The Los Angeles Times will double the price of its Southern California newsstand editions to 50 cents beginning March 5. 
 John Puerner, The Times's publisher and president, said the decision was made in response to higher newsprint costs and general inflation. 
 The Times was one of the last large metropolitan dailies to charge a quarter. The paper raised the price to 50 cents in 1995, but reduced it by half a year later.
The new price will be effective Monday through Saturday. The Sunday paper will still cost $1.50.
The Times, which has a national daily circulation of one million, was bought by the Chicago-based Tribune Company last March for $6.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Inflation Index Jumps, Thanks To Energy Costs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Americans paid sharply higher prices for energy in January, causing inflation at the consumer level to rise at its quickest pace in 10 months, the government reported yesterday.
 The Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent last month, twice as much as economists had expected. The surge compares with a 0.2 percent increase in each of the previous three months. Even excluding energy costs, prices increased more than expected, with the core index rising 0.3 percent. 
 Leading last month's rise was a 17.4 percent surge in the price of natural gas, the sharpest increase ever measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
January's increase in consumer prices coincided with an unexpectedly steep 1.1 percent jump in prices paid to manufacturers and other producers last month. The Producer Price Index, reported last week, was also driven higher by rising natural gas prices, which peaked in early January and have dropped nearly 50 percent since then.
Several economists said the price gains reflected the efforts of corporations to pass their rising costs to consumers, a quest that may prove difficult if layoffs and slumping stock prices keep whittling away at consumer confidence.
The report "exceeded even my worst expectations," said John Youngdahl, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "The combination of the P.P.I. and the C.P.I. report is a clear indication of a squeeze on corporate profits."
The economy's projected 1 percent growth cannot support an attempt to pass costs on to consumers, economists said, leaving the Federal Reserve little choice but to cut interest rates again despite the inflation reports. Still, economists differed on how big a reduction the Fed was expected to make.
With retail sales rebounding and housing construction holding firm, "the Fed's looking at an economy that doesn't look as bad as it did on Jan. 3," when the central bank began lowering interest rates, said Cary Leahey, a senior economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. He expects the Fed to lower its target for the federal funds rate, on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a percentage point, in contrast to the two half-point cuts it made in January.
Others saw a bigger cut in interest rates. "Inflation is a lagging indicator, so with growth slowing we expect inflation to head lower in coming quarters," Gerald D. Cohen, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research report. "This data should not dissuade the Fed from cutting the fed funds rate by 50 basis points in March."
Energy prices were responsible for more than half of the increase in consumer prices last month. Over all, energy prices rose 3.9 percent, while the energy services index rose 7.7 percent. 
Despite the surge in energy costs, the underlying economy produced its own price pressures. The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent in January, faster than the 0.2 percent increase that economists had projected. It rose 0.1 percent in December.
Housing costs rose 1 percent last month, but fuel and utility costs contributed to three-quarters of that increase.
Gasoline prices, one of the few energy costs that had been falling somewhat, stopped declining so quickly. After a 3.9 percent drop in December, gasoline prices declined 0.9 percent in January, contributing to a 0.3 percent increase in transportation costs. They had risen 0.1 percent in December.
Retailers cut prices to move excess holiday inventory, but after seasonal adjustments to the results, overall apparel prices fell more slowly than in November or December. 
But prices rose faster than they had previously at drugstores, doctors' offices, gymnasiums and bookstores. And cigarette prices surged 2 percent in January as retailers passed on to smokers a 14-cents-a-pack increase announced by R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris last month.
The Labor Department also said yesterday that the average number of hours Americans spent on the job grew 0.6 percent from December to January, offsetting the price increases and leaving workers' real weekly earnings unchanged.
In a separate report yesterday, the Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit fell to $32.99 billion in December from $33.13 billion in November. Exports fell 0.8 percent while imports fell 0.7 percent. It was the first time since 1995 that the deficit declined in three consecutive months, but economists considered the drop too slight to be of much significance.
For the year, however, the trade deficit rose 39.5 percent, to a record $369.7 billion, from $265 billion in 1999, even as American exports exceeded $1 trillion. The increase came as imports from China surged, giving the United States a larger trade deficit with China than with Japan for the first time.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Supreme Court Opinions on Limits of Disabilities Act 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today that state workers cannot sue for damages for violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act. The vote in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote the dissent. 

FROM THE DECISION
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
We decide here whether employees of the State of Alabama may recover money damages by reason of the state's failure to comply with the provisions of Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (A.D.A. or act). We hold that such suits are barred by the 11th Amendment. 
The A.D.A. prohibits certain employers, including the states, from "discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." To this end, the act requires employers to "make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business." . . . 
The 11th Amendment provides:
"The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state."
Although by its terms the amendment applies only to suits against a state by citizens of another state, our cases have extended the amendment's applicability to suits by citizens against their own states. The ultimate guarantee of the 11th Amendment is that nonconsenting states may not be sued by private individuals in federal court. 
We have recognized, however, that Congress may abrogate the states' 11th Amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and "acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority." The first of these requirements is not in dispute here. The question, then, is whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority by subjecting the states to suits in federal court for money damages under the A.D.A.
Congress may not, of course, base its abrogation of the states' 11th Amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in Article I. 
In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer (1976), however, we held that "the 11th Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of Section 5 of the 14th Amendment." As a result, we concluded, Congress may subject nonconsenting states to suit in federal court when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its Section 5 power. Our cases have adhered to this proposition. Accordingly, the A.D.A. can apply to the states only to the extent that the statute is appropriate Section 5 legislation. Section 1 of the 14th Amendment provides, in relevant part:
"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
Section 5 of the 14th Amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in Section 1 by enacting "appropriate legislation." Congress is not limited to mere legislative repetition of this court' s constitutional jurisprudence. "Rather, Congress's power 'to enforce' the amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the amendment's text." City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) also confirmed, however, the long-settled principle that it is the responsibility of this court, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees. Accordingly, Section 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of Section 1's actual guarantees must exhibit "congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end."
The first step in applying these now familiar principles is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Here, that inquiry requires us to examine the limitations Section 1 of the 14th Amendment places upon states' treatment of the disabled. As we did last term in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents (1998), we look to our prior decisions under the equal protection clause dealing with this issue.
In Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center Inc. (1985), we considered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance requiring a special use permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded. The specific question before us was whether the Court of Appeals had erred by holding that mental retardation qualified as a "quasi-suspect" classification under our equal protection jurisprudence. We answered that question in the affirmative, concluding instead that such legislation incurs only the minimum "rational basis" review applicable to general social and economic legislation. . . . 
Thus, the result of Cleburne is that states are not required by the 14th Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational. They could quite hard-headedly -- and perhaps hardheartedly -- hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the equal protection clause.
Once we have determined the metes and bounds of the constitutional right in question, we examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the states against the disabled. . . . 
Congress made a general finding in the A.D.A. that "historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem." The record assembled by Congress includes many instances to support such a finding. But the great majority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of states.
Respondents in their brief cite half a dozen examples from the record that did involve states. A department head at the University of North Carolina refused to hire an applicant for the position of health administrator because he was blind; similarly, a student at a state university in South Dakota was denied an opportunity to practice-teach because the dean at that time was convinced that blind people could not teach in public schools. A microfilmer at the Kansas Department of Transportation was fired because he had epilepsy; deaf workers at the University of Oklahoma were paid a lower salary than those who could hear. The Indiana State Personnel Office informed a woman with a concealed disability that she should not disclose it if she wished to obtain employment.
Several of these incidents undoubtedly evidence an unwillingness on the part of state officials to make the sort of accommodations for the disabled required by the A.D.A. Whether they were irrational under our decision in Cleburne is more debatable, particularly when the incident is described out of context. But even if it were to be determined that each incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitutional action on the part of the state, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which Section 5 legislation must be based. . . . 
The A.D.A.'s constitutional shortcomings are apparent when the act is compared to Congress's efforts in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to respond to a serious pattern of constitutional violations. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), we considered whether the Voting Rights Act was "appropriate" legislation to enforce the 15th Amendment's protection against racial discrimination in voting. Concluding that it was a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under Section 2 of the 15th Amendment, we noted that "before enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting."
In that act, Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States. State officials, Congress found, routinely applied voting tests in order to exclude African-American citizens from registering to vote. Congress also determined that litigation had proved ineffective and that there persisted an otherwise inexplicable 50-percentage-point gap in the registration of white and African-American voters in some states. Congress's response was to promulgate in the Voting Rights Act a detailed but limited remedial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the 15th Amendment in those areas of the nation where abundant evidence of states' systematic denial of those rights was identified.
The contrast between this kind of evidence, and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. Congressional enactment of the A.D.A. represents its judgment that there should be a "comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." Congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy, but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the States, there must be a pattern of discrimination by the states which violates the 14th Amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation. Those requirements are not met here, and to uphold the act's application to the states would allow Congress to rewrite the 14th Amendment law laid down by this court in Cleburne. Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge Congressional authority. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.

FROM CONCURRING OPINION
By Justice Kennedy
For the reasons explained by the court, an equal protection violation has not been shown with respect to the several states in this case. If the states had been transgressing the 14th Amendment by their mistreatment or lack of concern for those with impairments, one would have expected to find in decisions of the courts of the states and also the courts of the United States extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations. This confirming judicial documentation does not exist. That there is a new awareness, a new consciousness, a new commitment to better treatment of those disadvantaged by mental or physical impairments does not establish that an absence of state statutory correctives was a constitutional violation.
It must be noted, moreover, that what is in question is not whether the Congress, acting pursuant to a power granted to it by the Constitution, can compel the states to act. What is involved is only the question whether the states can be subjected to liability in suits brought not by the federal government (to which the states have consented), but by private persons seeking to collect moneys from the state treasury without the consent of the state. The predicate for money damages against an unconsenting state in suits brought by private persons must be a federal statute enacted upon the documentation of patterns of constitutional violations committed by the state in its official capacity. That predicate, for reasons discussed here and in the decision of the court, has not been established. With these observations, I join the court's opinion.

FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Breyer
Reviewing the Congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the court holds the statutory provision before us, 42 U.S.C. Section 12202, unconstitutional.
The court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, that Congress improperly attempted to "rewrite" the law we established in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center Inc., and that the law is not sufficiently tailored to address unconstitutional discrimination. 
Section 5, however, grants Congress the "power to enforce, by appropriate legislation" the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee. As the court recognizes, state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities might " 'run afoul of the equal protection clause' " where there is no " 'rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.' " In my view, Congress reasonably could have concluded that the remedy before us constitutes an "appropriate" way to enforce this basic equal protection requirement. And that is all the Constitution requires.
The court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence. It says that "Congress assembled only . . . minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment." In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting "massive, society-wide discrimination" against persons with disabilities. In addition to the information presented at 13 Congressional hearings, and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation, Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation. That task force held hearings in every state, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first-hand. The task force hearings, Congress's own hearings, and an analysis of "census data, national polls, and other studies" led Congress to conclude that "people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically and educationally." As to employment, Congress found that "two-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 were not working at all," even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively. And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from "stereotypic assumptions" as well as "purposeful unequal treatment."
The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society. There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the "stereotypic assumptions" and pattern of "purposeful unequal treatment" that Congress found prevalent. . . . 
There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record. I fail to see how this evidence "falls far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which Section 5 legislation must be based."
In reviewing Section 5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the court appears to contemplate. Nor has the court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category. . . . 
There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its Section 5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a court's institutional limitations. Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy. Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification. Unlike judges, members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.
Moreover, unlike judges, members of Congress are elected. When the court has applied the majority's burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, i.e., the courts, do not "sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations." To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress's legislative power is to stand the underlying principle -- a principle of judicial restraint -- on its head. But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the court can find the legislative record here inadequate. 
Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment. And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justification -- shorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptions -- that this court recognized in Cleburne.
The court argues in the alternative that the statute's damage remedy is not "congruent" with and "proportional" to the equal protection problem that Congress found. The court suggests that the act's "reasonable accommodation" requirement, and disparate impact standard, "far exceed what is constitutionally required." But we have upheld disparate impact standards in contexts where they were not "constitutionally required."
And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable? Of course, what is "reasonable" in the statutory sense and what is "unreasonable" in the constitutional sense might differ. In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation. But it is just that power -- the power to require more than the minimum -- that Section 5 grants to Congress, as this court has repeatedly confirmed. . . . 
And, ironically, the greater the obstacle the 11th Amendment poses to the creation by Congress of the kind of remedy at issue here -- the decentralized remedy of private damage actions -- the more Congress, seeking to cure important national problems, such as the problem of disability discrimination before us, will have to rely on more uniform remedies, such as federal standards and court injunctions, which are sometimes draconian and typically more intrusive. For these reasons, I doubt that today's decision serves any constitutionally based federalism interest.

PERSON: Dr. Donella Hager Meadows 

HEADLINE: Donella Meadows, 59, Author, And Advocate for Environment 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Donella Hager Meadows, an author, educator and advocate for the environment, died Tuesday at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. She was 59 and lived in Hartland Four Corners, N.H.
 The cause was bacterial meningitis, said Prof. Jack E. Shepherd Jr., a friend and colleague at Dartmouth, where she was an adjunct professor of environmental sciences. 
 Dr. Meadows, known as Dana, was a MacArthur Fellow and the lead author of "The Limits of Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind," published in 1972. The book delivered a simple message: either civilization or growth must end.
The book stated that continued population and industrial growth would exhaust the world's minerals and steep the planet in lethal levels of pollution.
If trends continued unchanged, the authors said, the limits of growth would be reached within 100 years. They urged "deliberate checks" on economic and population growth.
Their thesis was sharply disputed at the time, but the book sold nine million copies and was translated into 28 languages. It was produced by an interdisciplinary team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and financed by the Club of Rome, an international research organization that studies "the complex of problems troubling men of all nations," like poverty, alienated youth and monetary disruptions.
In 1992, she and her co-authors, Jorgen Randers and Dr. Dennis L. Meadows, her former husband, published an update, "Beyond the Limits: Confronting Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future."
Based partly on new computer simulations, the book warned that unless human activity changed, humans would "overshoot" the carrying capacity of the planet in decades.
Both books remain in print, as does a selection from "The Global Citizen," the weekly syndicated column she wrote.
Dana Meadows was born in Elgin, Ill., and graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1963. She received a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard University in 1968.
She was a researcher in the Department of Nutrition at M.I.T. when "The Limits of Growth" report was written. 
She later taught and researched at centers in Hawaii, Austria and Norway. In 1972, she joined an interdisciplinary program at Dartmouth, the Resource Policy Center, rising to associate professor. 
She and her former husband founded the International Network of Research Information Centers, in which they organized training programs and workshops in resource management in Europe, Central America, Africa, Asia and the United States. In 1994, the John D. and Catherine MacArthur Foundation, known for its "genius grants," selected her for a fellowship and awarded her $320,000 over five years.
Dr. Meadows is survived by her parents, Phebe Quist of Tahlequah, Okla., and Don Hager of Palatine, Ill.; and a brother, Jason Hager of Waterford, Wis. Her former husband lives in Durham, N.H.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A Technology Magazine Is Reducing Its Staff by 17%

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In a move that signals the ever-deepening crisis in the sector of magazines that focus on technology and the Internet economy, Standard Media International, the parent company of The Industry Standard magazine, announced yesterday that the company would cut its staff by about 17 percent. 
 Of 400 employees, 69 were laid off. And for the first time, the editorial operations of the magazine were affected, with the forced departures of 18 editorial staff members. 
 This is the second time in two months that Standard Media, based in San Francisco, has announced significant layoffs. In January, 36 staff members at Standard Media were asked to resign, although none were from the magazine's editorial division. At the same time, the magazine's free weekly fresh-fruit breakfast and in-house massage service were also discontinued, staff members in New York said.
The technology and Internet magazines have suffered from the collapse of many Internet businesses and a coinciding downturn in the economy at large. 
Last year, The Industry Standard aroused the envy of the magazine industry by regularly posting fivefold increases in advertising pages and revenue, year to year. The business of attracting Internet company advertising became so tantalizing that Time Inc., now a unit of AOL Time Warner, rushed to produce a magazine, E-Company Now, to catch the overflow, and the profits, that would not fit in Fortune. 
But as the industry has contracted, the good times have ended. The Industry Standard's Feb. 19 edition published 61 advertising pages, down from 138 for the corresponding issue in 2000, a decrease of 55 percent. So far this year, ad pages have slipped 59 percent, according to Media Industry Newsletter. 
John Battelle, the chief executive of Standard Media, said that the company was responding to the marketplace. 
"At the end of the day we have to staff to the market as it is, not staff as we wish the market would be," Mr. Battelle said. The decision to cut back on the editorial staff, he described as "certainly the most difficult thing I have ever done."
"Our magazine is half the size it was when we had our peak editorial staff," Mr. Battelle added. "We were doing 120 to 140 pages of editorial content a week and now we are doing half of that." 
The conference division at Standard Media laid off 10 of its 20 staff members, but Mr. Battelle said that no conferences would be eliminated. And he emphasized that Standard Media and The Industry Standard were not alone. 
"We're not doing anything that our competitors have not done," he said.
The layoffs at Standard are the most recent in a series of setbacks for the technology-magazine sector. In the last month of 2000, The Industry Standard folded its monthly supplement Grok into the weekly magazine, citing a lack of advertising. Upside Media, publisher of Upside magazine, revamped its business and its management. Red Herring Communications, which publishes Red Herring magazine, laid off 22 people. And E-Company Now and Advance Publications' Wired are publishing slimmer issues than they did before.
Mr. Battelle said he did not expect more cuts. "If the winds come up and the marketplace picks itself up off the floor, then we will be very well positioned to spring back," he said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Well-Connected Cog in Harlem's Revival

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
OF all the many roles played by Darren Walker, chief operating officer for the Abyssinian Development Corporation in Harlem, one that catches the eye is his self-styled role as a kind of Sherpa for the rich and powerful, people curious but wary about trekking to the unfamiliar terrain of Harlem alone.
 Mr. Walker, an energetic 41-year-old, travels in so many circles that it could make you dizzy. But the other afternoon, he sits still long enough -- in a swivel chair, of course -- to talk about his job in a little basement office, with a window view of an air shaft, across the street from the famous church on West 138th Street. 
 As the No. 2 official of the nonprofit development arm of Abyssinian Baptist Church, Mr. Walker is a low-key, yet major-league player in the Harlem revitalization scene, involved in everything from finding subsidized housing for poor tenants to helping to negotiate the agreement with the federal government on a home mortgage scandal that left about 200 Harlem brownstones facing foreclosure.
But Mr. Walker is also an incredibly well-connected guy. Once a bond salesman on Wall Street making gobs of money, he counts a fair number of "boldface socialites" among his friends. Names like Rockefeller and Vanderbilt and Zeckendorf slip out a lot. He sits on seven trustee boards. His contacts have benefited Abyssinian. In his five years there, Mr. Walker has helped the development agency quintuple its fund-raising revenue to $2 million a year.
Mr. Walker clearly relishes his job. "When I look at Harlem, I see a sea of assets," he says, beaming. He talks of how he loves tearing down barriers and bringing people together. His entire life, it seems, has been about bridging worlds. (He is African-American, openly gay, with loads of influential friends.)
"In some ways, I'm an interpreter and facilitator for my downtown friends," he says. "I think people are pretty honest with me, in ways that they might not be generally when they have questions about Harlem. But it cuts both ways, because I also try to help my uptown friends figure out how to get in the door at a particular foundation, bank or business."
Mr. Walker gives an example from the other week. He got a call from a downtown gallery owner who was thinking about setting up an art gallery in Harlem. She told Mr. Walker that she was referred by the socialite Beth Rudin DeWoody, who told her that he was the one to contact if she wanted to know about Harlem.
Mr. Walker cuts to the chase, filling in the gaps of things left unsaid.
"I said, 'I need to tell you that as a white woman, you are safe walking around in Harlem,' " he recalls with a laugh. "I don't dance around it."
AS he is talking the other day, Karen Phillips, the organization's president, pokes her head through the door, smiling. She has been trying to reach him, but he has switched on his answering machine and more than a dozen messages have piled up. Ms. Phillips is with the real estate lawyer David Rubin, who is doing pro bono work for them. Mr. Walker looks embarrassed that he is in the spotlight.
Later, he says he cannot help but feel awkward. "My mama brought me up to never feel a sense of entitlement," he said, adding that as a child he was imbued with "old-fashioned black churchwomen values."
Mr. Walker was raised in a tiny Texas town called Goose Creek by a single mother who worked as a nurse to support him and his three sisters. Perhaps only Mr. Walker can find something charitable to say about a town that had its own Ku Klux Klan chapter. He says Goose Creek provided him with the armor to guard against bitterness about racism.
Even growing up, Mr. Walker was always joining something. He held student leadership positions from grade school to the University of Texas, where he was the first African-American to head the Friar Society, an elite honor group at the huge, overwhelmingly white university.
After graduating from the university's law school, Mr. Walker moved to New York, where he briefly worked for a law firm, then went to the Union Bank of Switzerland Securities. He was raking in $200,000 a year selling mortgage-backed securities during his eight years there.
While the salary enabled him to put two sisters through college, he was bored out of his mind and quit in 1995. He found inspiration in Harlem, first volunteering at the Children's Storefront School, a private school there, then signing on at Abyssinian, where he started at a mere $45,000 a year. (He has since received a promotion and a hefty raise or two.)
Mr. Walker confesses to missing his splurges from the old days. He used to buy Hermes ties by the handful. Now, he says, he buys used Hermes ties on eBay, the online marketplace. And see that caramel-colored cashmere sweater he's wearing? That's a $25 steal from eBay, too.
But Mr. Walker says the sacrifices are worth it. When he talks about his Harlem work, he and many other people recall the birthday party last fall arranged by his partner of eight years, David Beitzel, a Soho gallery owner. Mr. Walker insisted that the party be in Harlem. And so it was.
True to form, everyone who was anyone swarmed to the Lenox Lounge, a jazz club. There was a stunning five-tiered cake from Le Cirque. There were well-placed people from every world that you could imagine. And there was Mr. Walker, smack in the middle of it all.
"I think a lot of people did some excellent networking," he says, with complete satisfaction.

State Workers Ruled Unable To Sue Under Disability Act
The Supreme Court ruled that state employees cannot sue for damages for violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act, carving out a new area of immunity for the states from the reach of federal civil rights law.
 Beyond its immediate effect on state workers who are entitled under the law to reasonable accommodations for their disabilities, the decision was important for what it portends, both for other types of cases under the act and for other civil rights statutes. Page A1. 

Effects of Electricity Deregulation
A new study by the international consulting firm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton has found that many American businesses are "wholly unprepared" to deal with electricity deregulation and that few have switched electricity providers to take advantage of deregulation. C6.

Co-Chairman of Home Depot to Quit
A day after Home Depot said that its fourth-quarter earnings were down 20 percent, the company's co-founder and co-chairman, Arthur M. Blank, left, surprised the financial community by announcing that he would retire on May 30. Bernard Marcus, the company's other co-founder and co-chairman, will continue as chairman.

Rising Tides

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The easiest approach for the time being is to pretend it's not happening. It's better for the nerves in the short run to remain riveted by the Clinton follies or the latest shenanigans on "Temptation Island" than to acknowledge that the majestic ice cap atop Mount Kilimanjaro, which seemed for so long to be an almost permanent feature of the planet, will vanish in less than 15 years.
 It's February and it's cold in New York, which can help us maintain the fiction that the planet is not warming at a scary rate. But the snows are disappearing from Kilimanjaro, and a few years ago scientists were astonished when a mammoth fragment of the Larsen Ice Shelf at the edge of the Antarctic Peninsula collapsed like a window shattered by a rock. The fragment had measured 48 miles by 22 miles and was hundreds of feet thick. It eventually disappeared. 
 Many strange things are happening. The seasons are changing, rainstorms are becoming more intense, sea levels are rising, mighty glaciers are receding, the permafrost (by definition, the permanently frozen subsoil in the polar regions) is thawing, trees are flowering earlier, insects are emerging sooner, and so on.
Global warming is not coming, it's here.
There are likely to be some beneficial results in some areas from the warming, such as longer growing seasons and increased crop yields in certain mid-latitude regions, and a decline in deaths related to extreme cold. But over all, the effects of this sharp and accelerating and largely artificial warming of the planet -- including the consequences of such extreme events as droughts, floods, heat waves, avalanches and tropical storms -- are potentially catastrophic.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in a report released Tuesday in Geneva, said, "More people are projected to be harmed than benefited by climate change, even for global mean temperature increases of less than a few degrees centigrade."
The report also discussed an issue that has profound policy and ethical implications. The worst effects of global warming will probably not be felt by those most responsible for the pollution of the atmosphere by heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The great industrial societies, which have benefited so long from the rapacious devouring of resources and the indiscriminate release of pollutants, are also the societies best positioned to cope with the treacherous forces of global warming.
As the panel noted in its report, "The ability of human systems to adapt to and cope with climate change depends on such factors as wealth, technology, education, information, skills, infrastructure, access to resources, and management capabilities."
Developing countries, deficient in those areas, are doomed to suffer disproportionately from the warming of the planet. "The effects of climate change," the panel said, "are expected to be greatest in developing countries in terms of loss of life and relative effects on investment and the economy."
Despite the powerful and increasing evidence of the role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the warming of the earth, the concentrations of those gases in the atmosphere are expected to increase, not decrease, over the next several decades. Government leaders are not responding to the problem with the sense of urgency that is called for.
Carbon dioxide doesn't just float away in a day or two. It remains in the atmosphere for more than 100 years. The consequences of our failure to act will last for centuries.
Americans have a special responsibility here. The United States is the mightiest nation on the planet and the greatest contributor to the industrial component of global warming. The nation is wealthy and at peace. A mature approach would require certain sacrifices designed to provide a better environment for future generations of Americans and a more equitable relationship with neighbors around the world. 
But that's only one approach. Another is to just ignore the problem and continue to feast like gluttons at the table of the world's resources. That will work for awhile. Why not? All you have to do is convince yourself that damaging the planet is somebody else's problem.

HEADLINE: Michigan Plans a High-Tech Lure 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich. 

 BODY:
Here in Michigan, it may soon be possible for a lawyer to argue a court case while sitting in New York at a kitchen table, wearing pajamas, sipping coffee and eating a sticky bun for breakfast.
 The lawyer would never have to set foot in the Thumb or any other part of the Wolverine State. 
 That, anyway, is the plan. To lure technology companies to Michigan, Gov. John Engler wants to establish a separate "cybercourt" for cases involving technology and high-tech businesses, where virtually everything would be done via computer rather than in a courtroom. 
Briefs could be filed online, evidence viewed by streaming video, oral arguments delivered by teleconferencing, conferences held by e-mail. Lawyers would not have to be in Michigan or even be licensed to practice in the state. Cases could be heard any time of the day, even at night, and judges would be trained to understand the complex issues that arise in technology disputes.
At least one other state, Maryland, is planning a separate judicial division to make the state more attractive to high-tech businesses. Legal experts predict other states will follow. But some lawyers and judges say the idea raises questions about many issues, including handling evidence and training judges.
Governor Engler wants technology to become as much a mainstay of Michigan's economy as the automobile industry is. He is also proposing tax breaks for new technology companies, and the state already provides millions of dollars in grants for research and product development in biotechnology.
Mr. Engler, who proposed the cybercourt in his annual address last month, said he hoped it would be up and running within a year. He said he thought technology companies would be attracted to Michigan just as Fortune 500 companies were drawn to Delaware, where the 200-year-old Court of Chancery is especially equipped to handle business cases.
"I've always admired how Delaware, with its chancery court, really became a preferred business location," Mr. Engler said in an interview. He added, "We think this is a little bit of a case of if we build it, they may come."
With a separate court, he said, cases would be fast-tracked, saving litigants time and money.
"At a time when you can go from idea to I.P.O. at warp speed, we need to have a way to get through the court system at a faster rate," said Mr. Engler, a three-term Republican. "You literally can have companies be formed, have a relatively short life cycle, and go out of business in the time it takes a case to get through court."
Lawyers and judges seem generally receptive.
"I think it will streamline the court process for new-economy businesses, and hopefully that will be something that will lure business to Michigan," said Michigan's attorney general, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.
But some question how the court will iron out details.
"One of the biggest questions is what is the jurisdiction of this court?" said Richard D. McLellan, a lawyer who is chairman of the Information Technology Association of Michigan. For example, some disputes involve intellectual property rights, trademarks or patents, issues handled in federal court.
And while Mr. McLellan supports allowing lawyers not licensed in Michigan to try cases from their home states, he says it will be necessary to decide how to hold those lawyers accountable to Michigan's legal code and how to discipline them. 
What's more, he said, "there will be a lot of figuring out how each and every element of a courtroom proceeding will translate electronically, from filing documents to hearings to oral arguments to public access."
Marc Shulman, a Michigan state representative sponsoring the bill to create the cybercourt, said Michigan's Supreme Court would help answer those questions. Mr. Shulman, a lawyer, said the court could handle any technology-related civil litigation as long as the case did not require a jury and the parties agreed to have it heard in cybercourt. The cases would involve sums of $25,000 or more, and litigants might be charged higher fees than in regular courts.
Mr. Shulman said he thought that a judge and a clerk would still hear the case in a courtroom, to preserve a semblance of judicial pomp, but that the parties, lawyers and witnesses could be anywhere. And, he said, "the public could actually come online and follow the case as it happens, from their own homes," assuming the public found squabbles over URLs or gigabytes as gripping as the O. J. Simpson murder trial.
Mr. Shulman said Michigan's court would take elements from other states, like New York and North Carolina, which have judicial divisions for business cases. The online aspects would be modeled in part on an experimental electronic court project run by the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., and the National Center for State Courts.
In Maryland, which expects to start its new division this year, plans are for cases to sweep through the system in fewer than 18 months and for many proceedings to eventually be conducted electronically.
"Our Legislature wanted to get business here, and I think that may be the impetus for a lot of states to look at this," said James L. Thompson, a lawyer, who, while president of the Maryland Bar Association last year, appointed most members of a state commission that recommended the separate division of court for technology and business cases.
"Most of the technology companies that we heard from and evaluated said that if a state has a business and technology court, a better way of addressing disputes, that would certainly be one of the things on their checklist for moving there," he said.
Another impetus for these courts, Mr. Engler said, is the Microsoft antitrust case, in which the federal judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, suggested that his technology expertise was limited, saying in an interview with The New York Times that he had supported a proposal by lawyers for the Justice Department to break up Microsoft because "there's no way I can equip myself to do a better job than they have done."
In Michigan and Maryland, judges interested and versed in technology would be selected and receive additional training.
But Max S. Oppenheimer, a Baltimore lawyer specializing in intellectual property, questioned whether the training would lead judges to believe they understood technological facts in a case before the lawyers presented their arguments.
"Do you want a judge to walk into the courtroom being his own expert?" Mr. Oppenheimer asked. He also wondered whether "by training our judges to be friendly to business, we will deliberately build in a bias to attempt to attract a certain class of litigants to the state."
Mr. Oppenheimer, and others, also questioned how other litigants would feel if "your judge hasn't had special training in how to deal with your problem, but because someone else's problem involves the Internet, they're going to get a better judge."
But will high-technology companies flock to Michigan because it is easier to sue each other?
Joan E. Trusty, president of two large high-technology organizations in Michigan, said that in the past, many technology companies decided not to go to court because it was too costly and time-consuming. "Whether or not the cybercourt will be a be-all and end-all attraction," she said, will depend on whether its first few cases "work their way through the system quickly."

CREDIT RATING UPGRADED

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 A second rating agency has advanced New York State's credit rating by two notches, citing improved state economic health and fiscal practices. 
Fitch IBCA changed the state from an A-plus rating to AA on Tuesday. That moved New York's rating from next-to-last in the nation, ahead of only Louisiana, to the middle of the pack among states. It is the highest credit rating New York has ever received from Fitch. Gov. George E. Pataki said better state financial practices under his administration, including paying down debt and putting aside money in "rainy day" funds, had resulted in the credit-rating improvement.

HEADLINE: Big Chinese Oil Company Testing Equity Markets Again 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Seventeen months after an unforgiving stock market spoiled its foreign debut, China's flagship offshore oil company is again preparing to list its shares in New York and Hong Kong.
 How it fares will say much about China's ability to privatize its corporate sector in a market that has turned even colder. 
 The shares of China National Offshore Oil, the country's third-largest oil producer, will begin trading in New York on Tuesday and in Hong Kong next Wednesday. The company was expected to price its stock today at slightly less than $16.60 an American depository share, putting it on track to raise about $1.3 billion. 
That is $1.2 billion less than China National Offshore aimed for in its first planned initial public offering, which was scrapped in October 1999 after investors balked at the price. The collapse of that offering deeply embarrassed the company and its underwriter, Salomon Smith Barney.
China National Offshore dropped Salomon in favor of Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston and regrouped. Now, even as the bankers promote the deal, they are treading lightly.
"Certainly, investors ask us what happened," said Charles Li, who is leading the deal for Merrill. "But more people ask what has changed with the company. As we tell them, their concerns have evaporated."
Rival investment banks agreed that China National Offshore had rebounded from the fiasco -- a fact they said was testament to its tight focus, disciplined culture and more realistic expectations.
"Usually, there is a very big stigma attached to a failed deal," said Paul Bernard, an oil industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "What's surprising is how positive investors are about this company."
The warm reception bodes well for two other looming offerings in China. China Telecom hopes to raise $5 billion to $10 billion later this year, while the Bank of China aims to raise at least $2 billion.
As a company, China National Offshore looks tidy compared with China's No. 1 and No. 2 oil companies, PetroChina and Sinopec; both went public last year and have traded poorly in recent weeks.
PetroChina has been dogged by its parent company's operations in Tibet and Sudan, which have drawn protests from human rights groups. Sinopec has avoided China's political minefields, but it was badly hurt by the spike in crude oil prices.
China National Offshore Oil is more likely to benefit from higher oil prices because it is an exploration and production company. And it does not have the entangling alliances of PetroChina. It was created from scratch by the Chinese government in 1982.
It has oil reserves of 1.3 billion barrels, either wholly owned or through contracts with foreign partners. Its oil and natural gas fields lie in three areas: Bohai, a bay off northern China; the East China Sea, off the coast of Shanghai; and the South China Sea, near Hong Kong.
Mr. Li noted that 66 percent of the company's reserves had not been developed, which means it can pump oil and gas for 20 years -- without discovering a fresh field -- before it runs out of fuel.
Such statistics warm the hearts of oil drillers. But as with all Chinese companies, other considerations come into play. Will shareholders have a say in the company's governance? Will the company be run on purely commercial grounds? Will the government favor a competitor?
China National Offshore got a taste of this last week when an official of the State Planning Development Commission told Bloomberg News that the government would delay construction of one of its pipelines in favor of one owned by PetroChina.
After China National Offshore dispatched a delegation to the commission, it issued a statement saying the projects would be built at the same time. But the confusion muddied the company's sales pitch to investors.
"You always have these problems," said Ziwang Xu, co-head of China banking at Goldman, Sachs. "The Chinese bureaucracy is so big that people don't always talk to each other."
For portfolio investors, the murkiness of China can still outweigh the peculiar strengths given companies.
"In terms of an investor's portfolio, they all represent the same kind of risk," said Henry Lee, a director at Hendale Asset Management here. "China is still really a top-down-driven country."

HEADLINE: Power, Politics And Glory Dimmed; 
Pacific Gas and Electric Finds No Sympathy Among Customers Or Once-Docile State Legislature

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Pacific Gas and Electric has long been a company that Californians love to hate.
 In the 1940's, activists protested the utility's monopolizing of San Francisco's electrical supply. In the 1980's, hundreds were arrested at the company's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, trying to block preliminary testing. Just this week, "Erin Brockovich," a Hollywood blockbuster that paints the utility as a 1990's corporate villain, was nominated for five Oscars. 
 But nothing has done more to sully the utility's image than this winter's energy crisis in California and the debate over who should pay the billions that PG&E, as everyone here calls the company, owes its power suppliers. 
Critics say that Pacific Gas and Electric took full advantage of the state's deregulated market for electricity -- a market it helped design -- by funneling $4.69 billion from the utility to its parent company, the PG&E Corporation, and stockholders since 1997.
A recent state-ordered audit concluded that the utility's executives knew the state faced an energy squeeze but did little to prepare for it. PG&E has said it hired bankruptcy lawyers last August. But that month, the company also said top executives were selling shares of the parent company's stock.
None of this has raised the utility's esteem in its customers eyes.
"They are just another corrupt company that wants nothing but to protect its own interests," said Judd Fischer, a banker, as he smoked a cigarette outside the Leopard, a bar in downtown San Francisco, one recent chilly afternoon.
California politicians, in the habit of following PG&E's lead after collecting a century's worth of campaign contributions, now are competing to score points at the company's expense.
After weeks of maneuvering, Gov. Gray Davis and Democratic legislators offered a plan today to save Pacific Gas and Electric and its Los Angeles-area counterpart, Southern California Edison, from bankruptcy. 
The proposal, which Republicans oppose, includes a new charge on consumers' bills to help recover the nearly $13 billion that the state's utilities owe their power suppliers. Governor Davis also wants big concessions, including control of the utilities' transmission networks, in exchange for what he calls "a buyout," not "a bailout."
The companies "will have no undue influence in this situation," John Burton, Democrat of San Francisco and president pro tem of the State Senate, said. "In fact, they will have less than due influence. People are angry."
The loss of control can only be disorienting for Pacific Gas and Electric, whose executives declined repeated requests for comment. Regarding last week's proposal from the governor, the utility said it was not seeking a bailout, but instead wanted wholesale costs passed on to consumers. 
In the 1980's, wags printed bumper stickers that read, "Welcome to California. Owned and Operated by PG&E." Built by PG&E, at least. In the 1920's, the company helped harness the power of the Tuolumne River in the Hetch Hetchy Valley to light Northern and Central California. After World War II, Pacific Gas and Electric embarked on one of the largest construction programs by a power company at the time, fueling one boom after another as agriculture in California made way for the military industry, the high-technology explosion and the state's growth into the world's sixth-biggest economy.
"PG&E was one of the ways California came to know itself," said the historian Kevin Starr, the California state librarian. "The people who ran the local utilities which flowed into PG&E were the establishment of these regions." As a result, he said: "PG&E became society. It was ground zero of the California establishment."
That was true particularly in San Francisco where, in 1854, executives from the San Francisco Gas Company, which was later merged into PG&E, gathered at a banquet at the Oriental Hotel to celebrate the lighting of the state's first gas lights, according to a company history. Then, too, the revelers suffered a blackout -- but at the hands of a prankster, not the deregulatory nightmare and supply shortages that have bedeviled California this winter.
The party also established the utility's custom of courting politicians, with City Council members and San Francisco's mayor toasting the new gaslight era. Last year alone, the PG&E Corporation and its affiliates poured $1.34 million into the coffers of California politicians.
Those who have squared off against Pacific Gas and Electric say that its executives actively work their connections in every aspect of political life.
Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group based here, recalled the battle in 1998 over Proposition 9, a measure that could have reduced consumer rates by as much as 18 percent, a state study later showed.
One day when she was tracking the effort to get the issue on the state ballot, Ms. Hoge said, she got a call from Daniel D. Richard Jr., a senior PG&E executive. In detail, she said, he described the counties in which she did not have enough signatures.
"It was creepy," Ms. Hoge said. "Dan was following us county by county. I always had this sense he was monitoring everything."
Led by PG&E's $17.4 million, the state's three big investor-owned utilities spent $37 million to defeat the proposition 3 to 1. Afterward, when she ran into Mr. Richard at a meeting, he was still gloating, Ms. Hoge said, telling her, "We didn't need to bomb the rubble, but we did."
Through a spokesman, Mr. Richard declined to comment.
The company has not always had its way, but it has not been shy about trying to use its resources to wear down opponents.
"There is a lot to dislike about PG&E," said Edward L. Masry, the lawyer portrayed in "Erin Brockovich" who won a $333 million settlement from PG&E in 1996 for residents of Hinkley, Calif.
More than 40 years ago, Mr. Masry said, PG&E dumped water tainted with a cancer-causing chemical into unlined ponds, from which it seeped into Hinkley's water supply. Residents were not informed of the contamination until the late 1980's, and in 1993 they filed a lawsuit blaming the company for a spate of cancer-related illnesses.
Throughout the proceedings, Mr. Masry said, the utility stalled, insisting it was not to blame for the illnesses. Only after settling the case in 1996 did a spokesman for PG&E tell The San Francisco Chronicle, "We screwed up," adding, "that's why we agreed not to contest liability and to enter into binding arbitration."
Mr. Masry now represents another group of Hinkley residents who say they, too, have been harmed by the company. Pacific Gas and Electric said it planned "a spirited and vigorous defense" in that case.
Some critics cut the company slack, chalking its conduct up to an understandable arrogance.
"They have a 100-year history of getting bigger and prouder and putting their name on everything," said David Roe, an Oakland-based author and lawyer who has battled PG&E over its nuclear-energy policies while working for Environmental Defense, a nonprofit policy group. "In my dealings with the company, I've seen institutional incompetence and slowness of foot. But they are not out to really hurt people."
Last month's audit report, though, has only embittered the utility's antagonists. And the prospect of bankruptcy makes them positively glow.
"The demise of the company is the most exciting thing I've ever heard," said Angela Alioto, a former member and president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
Like the activists back in the 1940's, Ms. Alioto has long agitated for San Franciscans to wrest control of their electricity supply from PG&E and manage it themselves. Some state legislators say a municipal utility for the city is now an inevitability; Ms. Alioto, who has fought the company before and lost, is not so sure.
Still, the thought makes her laugh delightedly and threaten a bit of civil disobedience. "Maybe I won't pay my bill in protest," she said.
Not everyone is so brave. As Mr. Fischer finished his cigarette outside the Leopard, five blocks from Ms. Alioto's office, he dismissed the notion that he could ever skip a bill. Why?
"I'm not stupid," he said. "It's PG&E."

HEADLINE: Report Says Nike Plant Workers Abused by Bosses in Indonesia 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Workers at nine of Nike's contract factories in Indonesia have witnessed verbal and physical abuse by supervisors against co-workers, and female employees being coerced into sex, according to a report released today by a nonprofit group.
 Employees also complained of being forced to work overtime and of seeing assembly-line workers fondled by managers, the report by the Global Alliance said. 
 Nike, which paid for the report, acknowledged that the findings were "disturbing," but said it would work to improve conditions at the 25 Indonesian factories from which it buys products. 
"While the messages are tough, we welcome them," said Maria Eitel, Nike's vice president and senior adviser for corporate responsibility. Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights group, praised Nike for releasing the findings.
Researchers from Global Alliance conducted hourlong interviews with 4,004 workers -- 6 percent of the work force at the nine factories chosen -- for the report. Subjects were chosen at random, and the interviews were done without supervision from factory officials, said Rick Little, the chairman of Global Alliance.
The Global Alliance, formed in 1999, is a consortium of groups and companies, including the World Bank, Nike and Gap, that is committed to improving the professional and personal lives of factory workers, especially women, across Asia.
The alliance's first report, issued last year and focusing on Thai and Vietnamese workers, was criticized by labor groups for not concentrating enough on violations and alleged abuses.
Of the workers surveyed in the latest report, 56 percent said they had seen supervisors verbally abusing co-workers, 15.7 percent reported observing improper sexual touching and 13.7 percent said they saw physical abuse.
Workers reported seeing others punished for being late by making them clean toilets or run around the factory grounds. Others allege that the deaths of two workers were related to the denial of medication.
Ms. Eitel said Nike will implement a "remediation plan" to fix the problems. Chief among them will be starting a system under which workers can file grievances against their employers.
Nike paid for the latest report with a $7.8 million grant. Little, the alliance chairman, said Nike has acted in good faith to solve the problems.
Global Alliance will go back to the same nine factories and conduct more interviews in a year.
Ms. Eitel said Nike also would issue quarterly reports to the alliance to see whether the workers' conditions have improved.

HEADLINE: Bush Keeps Clinton Policy on Poor Lands' Need for AIDS Drugs 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
The office of the United States trade representative said today that the Bush administration would not change the Clinton administration's generous but contentious policy concerning AIDS drugs for impoverished countries. 
 The Bush administration, a trade official said, will not seek sanctions against poor countries overwhelmed by the AIDS epidemic that try to force down the price of patented anti-AIDS drugs by legalizing the importation or manufacture of generic versions. The administration, the official said, will not try to punish such countries even if American drug makers complain or American patent laws are being broken -- as long as the country adheres to the rules agreed under World Trade Organization treaties. 
 The decision surprised groups fighting to get cheaper AIDS drugs for Africa and other places where $10,000-a-year anti-retroviral therapy is out of reach of most AIDS sufferers. They had feared that a Republican administration would reverse the Clinton policy, a policy that displeases the multinational pharmaceutical companies. "We're pretty glad about this," said Paul Davis of the Philadelphia chapter of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. "Folks are cautiously optimistic that, instead of the United States throwing up roadblocks, it will facilitate bulk purchases of affordable generic drugs." Mr. Davis said he wanted to see if the policy would apply beyond Africa, in places like Brazil, India, Thailand, Romania and other countries that are poor but have their own drug industries.
The Clinton policy itself was an about-face in late 1999. Until then the administration had aggressively threatened sanctions against countries that wrote laws allowing compulsory licensing -- the seizure of patents in certain emergencies -- even though United States law allows compulsory licensing in antitrust cases and other circumstances. 
Members of the staff of the Bush-appointed United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, were very cautious today, but one gave an informal statement saying the trade representative "is not considering a change in the present flexible policy." 
"Consistent with our overall effort to protect America's investment in intellectual property," the statement said, the United States trade representative "will seek to contribute to administration efforts to work with countries that develop serious programs to prevent and treat this horrible disease." 
Shannon Herzfeld, a spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, tried to minimize the announcement, saying it was "not big news" and only meant that Mr. Zoellick would consult with other members of Mr. Bush's cabinet before taking actions that would affect public health. 
James Love, who heads the campaign by a Ralph Nader group, the Consumer Project on Technology, to push down the price of drugs and who pressed the trade representative's office for a clear declaration of the new administration's policy, was celebratory, however. He responded to the industry's diminishment of the announcement by saying, "They hate admitting they lost." 
In another announcement that could push down the price of AIDS drugs, a second Indian manufacturer of generic drugs said it would start making anti-retroviral drugs. The decision by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. of New Dehli, India's third-largest drug company, means there will be competition even between low-cost producers with active export businesses.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Smaller classes don't necessarily equal better education. Do the math!

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH has been on the road this week, promoting the education package that is a centerpiece of his policy agenda. His plan, whose broad outlines enjoy bipartisan support, ties federal funds to minimum performance standards on regular tests. But it also gives states a lot of flexibility in how they set and achieve their educational goals.
 One specific policy the package doesn't include: lowering class sizes across the board. That idea was dear to the Clinton administration and has been popular with many governors, most notably former Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican. In 1996, the state used its budget surplus to reduce the size of classes in kindergarten through third grade. 
 Despite the intuitive appeal of smaller classes, empirical economists have had a hard time finding any evidence that cutting class sizes increases learning. This counterintuitive result is a puzzle that requires more than data analysis. It needs theory.
Enter Edward Lazear, an economist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Hoover Institution. Struck by both the puzzle and the field's lack of theoretical underpinnings, he set out to develop a framework that would help education researchers understand the relation between class size and learning. While such a framework is always more stylized than reality, a useful theory provides predictions that can be tested empirically. And it can help explain seeming anomalies.
In a paper presented at the January meetings of the American Economic Association and coming in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Professor Lazear started with a real-world insight that his empirically minded colleagues had generally overlooked. "If you talk to elementary- school teachers," he says, "they will tell you that their No. 1 issue is managing the class." Student behavior is critical.
One can think of classroom learning as a public good with "congestion effects," he suggested. The behavior of each student affects every other student's learning, and the more crowded the classroom the more spillovers there are. Professor Lazear developed a mathematical model to express the relation among class size, behavior, learning and the cost of teachers. The model predicts what might happen when various factors change.
The key variable is how likely it is that students disrupt one another's learning. (This disruption can occur through classic misbehavior, or it can simply take the form of asking questions everyone else knows the answers to.) Small differences in behavior can have large effects on learning and big implications for class size.
To find out how much of the time learning is actually taking place in a given class, you multiply the probability a student is not disrupting by the probability for each other student. In his model, Professor Lazear uses the same probability for every student, which means he can simply raise the probability to the power of whatever the class size is.
The results are striking. If each student behaves well 99 percent of the time, learning takes place 78 percent of the time in a class of 25; if good behavior drops to 98 percent, learning takes place only 60 percent of the time; at 97 percent, learning drops to a mere 47 percent of the time.
Reducing class size makes a much bigger difference for disruptive students than for nondisruptive ones. In the example above, cutting the class size to 20 means the best-behaved students are learning 82 percent of the time, the middle ones learn 67 percent of the time, and the most disruptive now learn 54 percent of the time.
What does this have to do with the class-size puzzle?
First, this model suggests that across-the-board reductions like California's are a foolish use of limited resources. Such reforms spend a lot of money to cut the size of classes where behavior is already good and smaller classes won't make that much difference. Adding teachers and classroom space takes resources that could be used more effectively elsewhere.
"I would prefer to see a much more focused effort on reducing class size for kids that have special needs, or disadvantaged areas," Professor Lazear said. For schools where disruption isn't a problem, it would be better to improve facilities or raise teachers' salaries to attract a better pool of applicants. (This assumes that such salary increases would lead to new hires, not just give a windfall to existing teachers.)
Second, the model explains the sorting that already takes place. Young children are in small classes because they have shorter attention spans than do high school students. Special education classes are small for the same reason. Catholic schools may have big classes, but they attract students who aren't disruptive. (In an extension of his model, Professor Lazear looks at how self-selection affects the makeup of private schools.)
Finally, it's possible to reduce the size of a class, increase student learning and still look bad compared with larger classes. This happens if, as the model suggests they should, schools put disruptive students in smaller classes. The students will learn more than they would in a larger class. But at the optimal class size (which depends on the cost of teachers), they'll still learn less than better students in a big class. Special education students, for instance, tend to be in very small classes. But they won't score as well on tests as above average students in large classes.
"The puzzle is reconciled immediately once you think about it this way," says Professor Lazear. Schools do adjust class size to their students' characteristics. "But," he adds, "that optimal adjustment doesn't reduce class size enough to counteract the fact that the kids who are in the smaller classes are not the better kids. And that's the key thing. You're reducing the class size, but not enough to offset that factor. That's what the model shows, and that's what seems to be true in the real world."
Different children and different school settings have different needs. When it comes to classroom learning, one size does not fit all.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Stocks Fall Broadly, With Major Indexes Around Year Lows

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The pessimism gripping United States stock markets deepened yesterday, as investors nervous about weak corporate earnings and higher inflation sent stocks to new lows for the year.
 Issues like Cisco Systems again led the way down, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index falling 2.13 percent, or 49.41 points, to 2,268.94, its lowest close since March 1999. The weakness extended to the broader market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.85 percent, or 23.67 points, to 1,255.27, and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, also off 1.9 percent, ended 204.30 points lower, at 10,526.88. Financial stocks like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were hard hit. 
 The Nasdaq has now fallen more than 18 percent since the beginning of February and 55 percent from its high last March, the steepest drop since 1973. The much broader S.& P. 500 has also fallen 18 percent since the March 2000 high.
Yesterday's declines leave the Nasdaq and the S.& P. below their closes on Jan. 2, the day before the Federal Reserve tried to spur the sputtering economy with a half-percentage-point cut in short-term interest rates. In the wake of that rate cut, stocks rallied strongly as many investors bet that corporate earnings would quickly turn stronger.
But even though the Fed again lowered rates on Jan. 31, numerous profit warnings and job layoffs this month from companies like Nortel Networks and Dell Computer have left some fearing that the economy is still weakening and that corporate profits will not strengthen until at least the end of this year.
"The primary trend, I think, is down for a while," said Gary Schlarbaum, who manages the $1.25 billion MAS small-capitalization value fund. Mr. Schlarbaum said that after the Fed's first rate cut, he hoped for a "V" in corporate profits, with a sharp slide in the first half of this year followed by a sharp recovery the second half. But he has grown more pessimistic.
"One of the reasons for assuming a 'V' bottom was assuming that the Fed could control what was going to happen, and these rate cuts were going to do it," he said. "I'm not sure that lowering the rates will do it."
William Meehan, senior market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said he expected last fall that the Nasdaq would reach a bottom around 2,250, then rally sharply. Now, after watching January's rally fail, he believes the Nasdaq will fall to 1,500. The S.& P. 500 could fall below 1,000, he said. "I haven't thought since the election that the Fed could avert a recession," Mr. Meehan continued, "and it doesn't matter how many times they lower interest rates. You have a heavily indebted consumer facing significantly higher heating- and-cooling energy costs."
A government report that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in January, the biggest gain since March 2000, did not help the market's mood. Most of the increase came from the higher price of natural gas; the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3 percent. But if inflation is strong, the Federal Reserve would have less room to cut interest rates to spur growth.
And confidence is plunging. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index fell sharply in January, the university reported last week. That is likely to lead to slower consumer spending, another drag on the economy.
Most forecasters still think that the economy will grow solidly this year, especially in the second half, as the Fed rate cuts kick in. But many investors are not convinced, said Neil Barsky, co-founder of the $400 million MRG Nucleus hedge fund.
"I will pay a premium for certainty," he said, "and I think that is coming back to the market."
Notable losers yesterday included Cisco, which fell 93 cents, to $25.13; Citigroup, which dropped $2.90, to $48.30; and I.B.M., which lost $3.99, to $107.51. Lucent Technologies, whose stock has dropped 85 percent since the end of 1999, fell 74 cents more yesterday, to $11.60. Sun Microsystems dropped $2.63, to $19.63.
Some storage and some optical-networking companies, superstars months ago, had a very bad day. EMC dropped $6.32, to $42.95; Ciena lost $5.69, closing at $71.63; and JDS Uniphase fell $2.63, to $31.69.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

BARBEZ, GROOVELILY, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Barbez is a Brooklyn-based collective that considers cafe decadence from a European standpoint, inspired by fruitful sources like Kurt Weill and Edith Piaf. Groovelily features Valerie Vigoda, who has sung and played her magic violin with stars like Cyndi Lauper and Cher. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ann Powers).

* TIGGER BENFORD GROUP, the Energy Center, 53 Wyckoff Street, near Smith Street, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 243-1285. Explore the relationship between music and the body at this second program in a series titled "The Yoga of Sound." Robert Benford is a percussionist and professor of dance at Rutgers University; he uses his skills on tabla, marimba, congas and djembe drum to stimulate the movements of modern dance. A veteran of Paul Winter's group, Mr. Benford will lead a percussion ensemble in this intimate room endowed with wonderful acoustics. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; admission is $14 (Powers).

URI CAINE'S MAHLER PROJECT/GOLDBERG VARIATIONS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This pianist, once best known to jazz audiences as a pianist with Dave Douglas and Don Byron, has turned out a series of high-concept albums for the German label Winter & Winter: they reimagine and subvert music from the classical canon, refitting them for improvisers. His sextet performing this weekend, which includes the turntablist D.J. Olive, will play music from "Primal Light," Mr. Caine's version of Mahler, and also from his newer "Goldberg Variations" album. The performance is Sunday at 8 p.m.; $10 in advance; $12 day of show (Ben Ratliff).

C. J. CHENIER, Village Underground, 130 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7745. The son of Clifton Chenier, the king of zydeco, picked up his late father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. Swampadelica opens tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Jon Pareles).

JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by trance disc jockeys like John Digweed. His marathon sets use steady repetition to hold time at bay, and they use floating, whooshing sounds and voices to suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Doors open tonight at 11 p.m., with Sean Cusick warming up. Admission is $35 (Pareles).

DISPATCH, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Dispatch, a three-man band whose members regularly swap instruments onstage, has worked its way up the jam-band circuit with amiable, tall-tale songs that wander from Grateful Dead folkiness to Police ska to the borderline of funk. Its Saturday-night show is sold out. A Sunday matinee, with doors opening at noon, also includes Seeking Homer and Booda Velvet. Tickets are $18; $16.50 advance purchase (Pareles).

JERRY AND ANDY GONZALES-JOE FORD-LARRY WILLIS-STEVE BERRIOS, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Once known -- and maybe still, but who can say? -- as the Fort Apache Band, this mixture of the young generation of Latin musicians and hard-core New York jazz players caused a lot of excitement when they arrived in the early 1990's. They're back to take their place in a jazz scene that has become thoroughly Latinized in their wake. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).

THE GOSSIP, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, at 11th Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Genuine loose-limbed, sexy fun is rarer in pop today than it should be. This Arkansas-bred, Washington State-based trio brings it back in buckets. Thrill to the shimmy and hurricane vocals of the band's frontwoman, Beth (no last names for these cultural delinquents!), as her mates lay down a basic roadhouse groove that still sounds as fresh as a trucker on a Friday night bender. Palomar and Skyrocket share the bill tonight at 9:30; tickets are $7. The Gossip also plays tomorrow with the White Stripes at the Bowery Ballroom (see below) (Powers).

BENNY GREEN TRIO, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Fluent and funky, with influences from both Oscar Peterson and Wynton Kelly, this young pianist has always been right down the middle of the mainstream but delivered in performance. Sets are tonight through Sunday are at 8:30 and 10:30, and at midnight tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).

HOLMES BROTHERS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Steeped in blues and gospel, Sherman and Wendell Holmes harmonize and raise the rafters with songs that draw hope from hard times. They have been expanding their repertory and just released a gospel-charged album, "Speaking in Tongues" (Alligator Records), produced by Joan Osborne. Tomorrow night at 11 and 12:30; admission is $20 (Pareles).

ALAN JACKSON, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800. Alan Jackson is a country heartthrob who has made an art of being the strong, silent type. He has injected wry humor into songs like "She's Got the Rhythm (and I've Got the Blues)" and stood up for populism with "Little Man." But he uses a light touch on those familiar tropes, right down to the reserved melodies that let him keep his moist bass-baritone vocals mellow. Few artists so easily manage to be laid back. Tomorrow at 8 and Sunday at 7 p.m.; tickets are $60 (Powers).

STEVE KILBEY, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. As the songwriter and guitarist in the Church, Steve Kilbey has made it his business to wrap husky-voiced enigmas in sinuous guitar lines; this is a show for fans who care as much about his musings as his melodies. Tonight at midnight; admission is $7 (Pareles).

* STEVE LACY TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Lacy is one of the most impressive economizers playing any kind of saxophone in jazz, and sometimes his improvisations are so pared-down that they're downright phlegmatic. But in more than 40 years on the scene, nobody else has really sounded like him. He is not just one of the few originals on soprano saxophone but also one of the great originals among American musicians. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover for early shows and $10 minimum; $18 for midnight show and $10 minimum; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover and $10 minimum (Ratliff).

CHRIS LEE BAND, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. North Carolina-bred and Brooklyn-based, Chris Lee makes soaring, emotional rock that pays homage to the Zombies, Led Zeppelin and Jeff Buckley. Tonight at midnight; tickets are $5 (Powers).

LEVELLERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. In their native England, these self-described anarchist hippie punks play to huge audiences of festivalgoers who admire their Celtic-tinged protest songs and raucous stage show. The band hasn't broken through to a large stateside audience, but the street activists of the East Village and plenty of British expatriates will probably show up to enjoy a little left-wing revelry. Tonight at 10; tickets are $12 (Powers).

LI'L BRIAN AND THE ZYDECO TRAVELERS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. The younger generation of zydeco bands from bayou country sees no barriers between two-steps, blues, funk and even hip-hop. Behind his accordion, Li'l Brian stands ready to get crowds moving. Tonight at 9:30 and 11 and 12:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).

* BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. After all the initial jazz-world buzz and then all the television-generated fame, Mr. Marsalis has settled into that far less glamorous thing: an interesting musician with something to say. He has a new album ("Contemporary Jazz" Columbia), and his engagements here are always packed, so plan ahead; naturally he'll have Jeff Watts on drums, with whom he has one of the more exciting partnerships in jazz. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow (Ratliff); $20 music charge and $10 minimum tonight and tomorrow; $15 music charge and $10 minimum on Sunday.

* IRVIN MAYFIELD, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Mayfield, who has been spending time with the great new Latin jazz band Los Hombres Calientes, is a young New Orleans trumpeter with a Marsalisesque vibe and a very good rhythm section. He hasn't performed much in New York, and there couldn't be a better place in town for him to play a string of dates than this small, comfortable room in the depths of the Knitting Factory. Sets tonight through Sunday night are at 8 and 9:30; $10 cover charge and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).

* ARTURO O'FARRILL TRIO, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, near Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Arturo O'Farrill, who is the son of the composer and arranger Chico O'Farrill and the pianist in his band, is making strides as a band leader: he is a fast, exciting pianist in the straight-ahead jazz and Latin idioms, and he, like seemingly everyone else in the last few months, has begun working with the exciting young Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9, 10:30 and midnight, with a $15 cover charge and $5 minimum (Ratliff).

ORGANIC GROOVES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This floating party pioneers a dance music subgenre called cosmic, and its organizers mean that in the most literal sense. These grooves are built from a world's worth of sources, including new wave, dub reggae and disco. D.J.'s lay the foundation on the turntables while live musicians play with the flow. Tonight at midnight; admission is $10 (Powers).

BILLY PRESTON, SAM MOORE, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The keyboardist Billy Preston has moved between gospel and pop since the 1960's, when he played electric piano with the Beatles in the rooftop concert that yielded "Get Back." He went on to combine them in singles like "That's the Way God Planned It." Sam Moore was half of Sam and Dave, whose singles like "Hold On, I'm Coming" were one definition of 1960's soul. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; table seats are $35, $25 at the bar (Pareles).

JIMMY SMITH, LOU DONALDSON, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Smith, the Hammond organist, and Mr. Donaldson, the saxophonist, sold a lot of records for Blue Note in the 1960's, and both have a no-nonsense way of playing the blues; Mr. Donaldson, particularly, can still be an electrifying performer. Sets through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $30; $5 minimum (Ratliff).

SICK OF IT ALL, Wetlands Preserve, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 386-3600. The all-ages hard-core matinee, a place for teenagers to mosh their frustrations away, has become a New York institution, and so has Sick of It All, a hard-core band that has been blasting out complaints and self-help advice since the mid-1980's. Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30, with Kill Your Idols, Stretch Armstrong and Fast Times opening; Sunday at 6 p.m. with Cooter opening, Strike Anywhere, Most Precious Blood and Sick of It All. Tickets are $10 (Pareles).

* TOWN AND COUNTRY, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. "We're trying to write music that can sweep over you, but music where you can also notice everything that happens," Josh Abrams, one of the two bassists in Town and Country, told the Chicago journalist Peter Margasak in a recent interview. That combination of oceanic drone and meticulous detail is key to the "chamber rock" style this Midwestern acoustic ensemble embodies. Expect to be hypnotized into paying more attention than rock usually demands. The arty, country-influenced, Boston-based songwriter Blake Hazard opens the show. Tonight at 9; tickets are $8 (Powers).

JIMMY WEBB, EDDI READER, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. As the writer of hits like "Macarthur Park" and "Wichita Lineman," Jimmy Webb is a patriarch of lachrymose, existential pop epics with soaring tunes. Sharing the bill is Eddi Reader, a more optimistic folk-rocker who has quietly been putting out one congenial album after another. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30; admission is $22.50 (Pareles).

* WHITE STRIPES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes are siblings from deepest south Detroit, and like their more famous neighbor Eminem, they channel black culture through a white adolescent world view. The White Stripes aren't into hip-hop, though; they're into the blues, the same greasy, mythical blues that inspired the Cramps and Jon Spencer before them. Their utter belief in the intensity of this music makes their sound fresh despite its familiarity, and they have become the hottest underground band of the moment. Also on this bill are an older and wiser New York outfit, the Knoxville Girls, and the equally youthful and wonderful Gossip. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $12 (Powers).

HEADLINE: Does the U.S. Trade Deficit Matter? This Year, It Will 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
ONLY a year ago, as the United States trade deficit set a record, there were warnings that something had to give. Surely the United States could not continue to buy $723 million a day more than it sold. The dollar would have to decline, it was said. 
 The warnings were wrong. In 2000, the trade deficit grew an astonishing 40 percent, to $1 billion a day. And the dollar rose against every major currency. 
 So we'll say it again. This can't go on forever. This is the year it will stop.
Not that many appear to be worried now. Wednesday's announcement of the record 2000 trade deficit got relatively little attention, and some even proclaimed it to be good news. "The trade deficit is not a problem to be fixed, but a symbol of America's global economic strength, a Good Housekeeping seal of approval from the world's investors," said Daniel Griswold of the Cato Institute.
After all, he said, the flip side of a huge trade deficit is equally large foreign investments in this country. "Expanding trade deficits are almost always a sign of economic expansion and robust investment."
The trade deficit has dipped a bit in recent months as the American economy slowed, but there is little chance it will decline substantially this year. The question is whether foreign investors will continue to send cash to this country to finance it. If they don't, Mr. Griswold said, "You'd see the dollar fall." He declined to guess how big the decline might be.
Last year investors the world over were eager to invest in the so-called new economy, which was concentrated in this country. "More than 40 percent of investment in U.S. corporations by foreigners has been in high-tech areas, particularly telecom," noted Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm. By and large, those are investments the buyers now regret. 
If equity investments in America look less enticing, how about bonds? Foreigners now own 38 percent of outstanding Treasuries and 20 percent of corporate bonds. But their incentive to buy more is not being increased by the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower interest rates.
The dollar is now being supported not by the attractiveness of American investments, but by the unattractiveness of the competition. Japan continues to suffer more than a decade after its bubble burst. The euro has recovered some ground, but Europe's unemployment remains high and investment opportunities are limited. Still, it is hard to believe that the competition is ugly enough to keep $1 billion a day flowing into declining American markets.
If the United States fell into a severe recession, the trade deficit would decline, but foreign investments would probably decline more rapidly. Would the Fed raise rates to support the dollar, or cut them to help the economy? Would Congress pass ill-advised protectionist legislation? 
Alan Greenspan would not like to find out the answers to those questions. So he is trying to sound confident about the economy while slashing interest rates. But the markets are not cooperating. Nasdaq's best day in history -- a 14 percent gain -- came the day the Fed first slashed interest rates. Now all major stock indexes are lower than they were before the Fed moved. Wall Street optimists are forecasting another "surprise" rate cut.
The strength of the dollar has reflected belief in the new economy. As that belief unravels, so will the dollar's value. The Good Housekeeping seal is in jeopardy.

HEADLINE: A Chief Exporter, and Not at All Pleased About It 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: MOORESVILLE, N.C., Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Factories just like the Matsushita plant here made North Carolina an industrial colossus less than a decade ago, the state with the largest percentage of its workers in manufacturing jobs. Surrounded by fountains and landscaped nature trails, that pristine compressor factory seemed to embody the state's economic promise when it opened with fanfare in 1991.
 But North Carolina lost 27,800 manufacturing jobs last year -- by far the largest such loss in the country -- and the trend continued last month when the Matsushita factory's Japanese owners announced that they would close it in March, putting 530 employees out of work. Air-conditioning compressors will instead be made in China and Malaysia, the company said, and stunned workers now contemplate a future of sporadic, lower-paying jobs. 
 "Look at this place -- I thought I would retire here," said Helen Dishman, a 48-year-old line leader for Matsushita, gesturing at the 10-acre factory on its lush 100-acre lot, the town's largest employer last year. "Now I'll be lucky to find something that doesn't even pay as much." 
Probably more than any other state, North Carolina has been shaken by a drain of low-wage factory jobs overseas in the last five years. One by one, the pillars on which the state's economy was built 20 years ago -- textiles, furniture, apparel -- have begun to fall to foreign competition, and its growing high-tech centers are usually out of the reach of laid-off workers.
The loss of those jobs last year and 30,000 in the previous four years, along with the closing of the factories that provided them, contributed greatly to the tax revenue shortage that forced Gov. Michael F. Easley to declare a fiscal emergency two weeks ago in order to close a budget gap of nearly $800 million.
Western North Carolina, though still the nation's furniture capital, lost 2,200 furniture jobs last year as imports rose and plants closed. More than 13,000 textile workers were laid off when big plants shut, three in Greensboro alone, and today there are fewer than half the 400,000 textile and apparel jobs that dominated North Carolina employment in 1980.
The erosion of its base has made the state all the more vulnerable as the national economy begins to slow, economists say, and in that sense it may offer an early warning signal to the rest of the country.
"North Carolina has been losing manufacturing jobs for a long time, but up to now it has also been able to create new jobs," said Patrick J. Conway, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina. "What's worrisome about this new downturn is that the new sectors are not able to absorb those losses anymore. People who might have moved to the new jobs before will now have to sit longer and train harder and probably drive farther."
Here in Mooresville, a town of 17,000 half an hour north of Charlotte on Interstate 77, Burlington Industries laid off 600 people in 1999 when it closed a huge denim plant. In the last few months, the town has also lost a mobile-home factory and a truck-parts supplier. Even its economic prize -- the racing car manufacturing industry, which was recruited here to replace textiles and now employs 1,400 people -- is starting to suffer: about 15 of 65 Nascar teams here have shut their doors in the last six months, and many of the others are worried as the slowdown begins to hurt the corporate sponsors whose logos festoon the cars.
As melancholy tourists milled around the area this week mourning the death of the racing star Dale Earnhardt, who lived outside Mooresville, many of the team owners expressed concern that the economic slowdown's effect on Nascar could hurt the town.
"If the racing industry gets hit like I think it's going to get hit, it will devastate this area," said Don Miller, president of Penske Racing, where a flag drooped at half-staff across the street from the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. "Racing is one of the first things the sponsors cut when hard times come. There's two or three more teams that are on the ropes now, and every one of us can see it coming."
The unionized heavy industry of the Upper Midwest never took root in North Carolina. Instead, the state became the South's most industrialized through thousands of low-wage, low-skill jobs like those in textile mills. In some ways, it actually preferred such jobs to those that paid better; in 1990, a group of business leaders told United Airlines not to build a maintenance plant that would have added 5,000 high-paying jobs to the state, because its union shop would not be welcome. The airline instead built in Indianapolis.
North Carolina thrived in the 1980's: as factories in Ohio and Indiana closed, many workers moved South to take nonunion jobs at less than half of what they had been paid. But global competition eventually caught up with the state's manufacturing advantage, and seized it.
"The Northern states shed these low-end jobs 20 years ago, and they came here," said Colin Austin, a work-force expert with MDC Inc., researchers in Chapel Hill. "But now technology is replacing a lot of workers, and the cheap labor isn't here anymore -- it's overseas."
As the plants started closing, however, a very different North Carolina was rising: the financial center, Charlotte, and the research and development center in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill triangle. The state added nearly 700,000 service and technology jobs from 1978 to 1997, more than making up for the loss in manufacturing employment. 
North Carolina's overall economy grew so briskly that state budget planners seemingly forgot they were much more vulnerable to a downturn now that they were without their old economic foundation. But this month, when tax revenue fell far short of estimates at the same time that Medicaid costs skyrocketed, the state encountered its worst budget crisis in a decade.
The state's job growth continues, but that growth is significantly slower than it was, and unemployment, while low, is beginning to edge up. The 4 percent jobless rate in December was the highest in more than four years and the first since 1982 that was as high as the nation's.
A huge disparity remains between the economy of the growing metropolitan areas and that of the rural counties, where more than 60 percent of the manufacturing layoffs have occurred. Many of the laid-off workers lack the education to compete in the new economy, and their counties lack the infrastructure and other resources to grow along with Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham.
A state rural development task force headed by Erskine B. Bowles, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, recommended bringing high-speed Internet access to every county, as well as spending more state money to improve roads, schools and housing in rural areas. Rick Carlisle left his job as North Carolina commerce secretary last week to lead a state fund that will invest $150 million in growth companies outside urban areas.
But promises of Internet access and investment, however much they may assist the state's long-term strategy, sound rather empty to the assembly-line workers at the Matsushita plant, who filed into the parking lot on a shift change the other day grumbling about Asian companies and broken promises.
"We've got plants closing right and left, and I don't know who's going to hire us," said David Peters, a pump repairman at the factory. "If something doesn't happen soon, this whole area's going to have a lot of vacation time and no vacation pay."

HEADLINE: Judge Approves Auction House Settlement 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
A federal judge gave final approval yesterday to a $512 million settlement of the lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses by customers who said they were cheated in a price-fixing conspiracy that lasted several years.
 While attaching two conditions to the approval, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in a 44-page decision, called the settlement "eminently reasonable by any standard." 
Richard Drubel, a plaintiffs' lawyer, said, "We are delighted with Judge Kaplan's opinion and expect it will not be difficult to meet his conditions."
Approval of the settlement begins to close one chapter in a scandal that has roiled the secretive and rarefied art and auction world for more than a year. 
The civil suit grew out of a four-year-old criminal antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that heated up last year when the former chief executive of Christie's provided documents detailing how officials of the two companies colluded to fix rates on commissions and on other matters. Prosecutors are continuing their criminal investigation, but lawyers in the civil case said the judge's conditions would be met by March 1 and that payments could be made to more than 130,000 auction house customers within months if there were no court challenges.
Officials at Sotheby's and Christie's declined to comment on the approval. 
One of Judge Kaplan's conditions on the $512 million settlement is that customers who bought or sold at auctions outside the United States be compensated "even if only in a very small way." Initially the suit would not have provided any specific payments for transactions abroad.
The second condition by Judge Kaplan was that the auction houses publicize the existence of the discount certificates that would be issued to sellers by Sotheby's and Christie's as part of the $512 million payout. In order to stimulate a market in the certificates, the judge said he wanted notices about them included in auction catalogs and on sellers' invoices.
The settlement calls for the auction houses to pay $256 million each. Last September, Sotheby's and Christie's agreed to pay $50 million each in the form of the certificates, which could be sold, but could only be used to reduce commission costs on future consignments. 
Judge Kaplan was skeptical that the certificates were worth their face value. Last month after economic analyses ordered by the judge and pressure from the lead plaintiffs' lawyers, David Boies and Mr. Drubel of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, the auction houses agreed to increase the value of the certificates to $125 million.
Sotheby's and Christie's also agreed that class members could redeem the certificates, which will be issued to plaintiffs with claims of more than $500, for cash after four years. 
When the judge preliminarily approved the settlement last November, the companies had 30 days to deposit $100 million in cash in an escrow account. The balance will be paid within 30 days after the judge's two conditions are met. 
But just when customers will begin to see the money is uncertain, with estimates ranging from months to years if someone were to appeal the approval. 
The judge also approved a $26.7 million payment to the Boies firm, 20 percent of which will be in the discount certificates. The lawyers were named lead counsel in an unusual bidding process held by the judge to designate the lawyers who would accept the lowest fees and therefore disburse the most money to the class. 
In the decision, Judge Kaplan wrote that he believed that the plaintiffs would have received "hundreds of millions of dollars less" if his bidding process had not been used. Only 916 class members, or fewer than 1 percent, have requested to opt out of the settlement and only 61 filed objections, the judge wrote.
The criminal side of the case, in which Sotheby's and its former chief executive have pleaded guilty and Christie's has received conditional amnesty, continues with federal prosecutors focusing on A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's largest shareholder and its former chairman. Mr. Taubman denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors questioned Sotheby's employees in New York as late as last week and talks are being held in Washington between Mr. Taubman's lawyers and antitrust prosecutors.

HEADLINE: Letting Out Market Fear Elsewhere 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Turkey's devaluation of its currency yesterday seemed to take some of the pressure out of the latest emerging-markets crisis. Most damage in other nations' financial markets came earlier in the week as the crisis grew.
 And emerging-markets experts said that they did not expect the events in Turkey to have much of a continuing effect on other markets. "The direct impact of Turkey should be very limited," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. 
 Joyce Chang, global head of emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, said Turkey was "not a Russia in 1998," alluding to the devaluation of the Russian ruble and Moscow's default on some debt that year. That led to a wide sell-off in other emerging markets.
"But it is not as benign as the Brazilian devaluation in 1999," she added, referring to the modest effect then. By January 1999, many investors had already turned their backs on emerging markets. In addition, the Brazilian devaluation had been anticipated.
The devaluation in Turkey, which sent the exchange value of the lira down more than 25 percent, contributed to further weakness in the euro against the dollar, currency analysts said. In New York, the euro settled at 90.57 cents, down from 90.82 cents on Wednesday.
Other analysts said that the declines in some Eastern European stock markets came from investors' selling to cover their losses in Turkey. The Polish stock market dropped as much as 2 percent during the day but rebounded to end down just 0.7 percent. It fell 2 percent on Wednesday. The Russian stock market, in dollar terms, ended 4 percent higher after falling 7.9 percent on Wednesday.
The prices of emerging-market bonds, which had fallen earlier in the week, moved slightly higher as the yield, moving in the opposite direction, declined. The yield on Brazil's widely traded C bond, which jumped to 12.38 percent on Wednesday from 11.88 percent last Friday, slipped to 12.24 percent yesterday. Russian bond prices also moved higher.
There are several reasons analysts expect the fallout from Turkey to be small. One is that Turkey's bonds make up only 1.9 percent of the Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus compiled by J. P. Morgan. As a point of comparison, Argentina's bonds make up 23.1 percent.
According to the index, the spread between the yield on emerging-market debt and that on comparable United States Treasury securities slipped to 7.25 percentage points yesterday. It had jumped to 7.31 percentage points on Wednesday from 6.90 percent last Friday. And it had fallen from a spread of more than 8 percentage points early in December, when the Federal Reserve first signaled that it was ready to cut short-term interest rates to spur growth in the United States.
Another mitigating factor is that Turkey does not trade with many other emerging-market countries. And Turkey, unlike Russia in 1998, is not a place where large numbers of foreign investors have flocked in hopes of big returns.
But this does not mean that there will not be some fallout in the future as Turkey tries to put together a new economic plan with the International Monetary Fund.
Devaluing the currency is a good step, Ms. Chang said, but added that Turkey still had many other problems to deal with -- including a weak banking system that would be hurt further by the devaluation, a slowing economy and rising borrowing needs.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Small Ripple in a Big Pond"The devaluation of the Turkish lira and concerns about whether the country will be able to meet its debt obligations are not likely to have the same impact on international markets that Russia's default did in 1998 because Turkey accounts for a much smaller fraction of total emerging-market debt.

HEADLINE: Memories Chiseled in a Cathedral's Stone 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
Twenty-two years ago, the idea rang out like a clarion.
 To resume work on the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, British masters would come to New York and train jobless youths in the ways of medieval stonemasonry. Together they would revive a dying craft. And lo, a stoneyard arose on the edge of Harlem. The cathedral began to grow again. 
 It was an idea at once grandiose and simple, and well covered in the national news media. But a decision to commercialize the operation just before an economic downturn drove the stoneyard under in 1994. The young masons, who had the promise of a lifetime's work, scattered. 
So whatever happened to them? 
It turns out that a surprising number of the cathedral masons remained in the trade or on its edges. More broadly, the stoneyard left a deep mark on the group, who themselves, through hammer and chisel, left a mark on the physical city. 
"It opened me up to a world -- of God, passion, people, possibilities," said Dennis Reed, 45, a former cocaine user raised in Harlem who now does freelance stone work. 
And while there is little evidence the program has created a stone carving renaissance in the city, it nourished the craft by seeding alumni throughout the profession.
The Kincannon brothers, Joseph and D'Ellis, operate a stone carving business in Austin, Tex. Timothy Dunlap Smith also has a masonry concern, in Philmont, N.Y. Nelson Otero and four others found jobs at a decorative stone company in New Jersey. Chris Pellettieri and Treese Robb are struggling on as independent carvers. Michael Orekunrin works as a master mason at a Mount Vernon, N.Y., stone company and taught a carving course at Bard College.
But many more drifted off into different lines of work. Eddie Pizarro works for an art moving company. Jessica Lowrie designs Web sites, and so does Joseph Chiffriller, who still carves decorative pieces on the side and sells them on the Internet. 
Albert Rivera is a technician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. James Jamerson lives in his boyhood home in Harlem and works as a messenger. Carol Hazel, who raised four children as a single mother while at the yard, plans to graduate this year from Mercy College with a degree in education. Still others have fallen into oblivion, untraceable and unremembered. And inevitably, a few found sad fates. One died in a motorcycle accident, another died of AIDS. Several served spells in jail, former officials of the stoneyard said.
About 100 apprentices passed through the program, staying from a few months to 12 years and learning how to transform blocks of limestone into ornamented bits of architecture and, for the talented, into sculpture.
They arrived as young men and women in their 20's, either adrift or intent on learning the trade. Now paunchy and pushing middle age, with spouses, divorces and children, they remember the friendships formed hammering rock, the soccer games in the stoneyard, the rivalry between carvers and masons, the occasional drug-taking that prompted the phrase "stoned yard." 
The former apprentices have some sour memories, revolving around the yard's increased commercialization and its closing. But overwhelmingly, they look back at that time as the happiest of their lives.
"I remember I used to say, 'I'll grow old working here,' " Mr. Pizarro said. "Now I'll grow old looking at it." 
Mr. Rivera said he thought about stonecutting every day: "It's something that caught my heart." He still has his mallet 10 years after leaving the cathedral.
The stoneyard was the brainchild of the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the cathedral's energetic dean from 1972 to 1996. Work on the building had begun in 1892 and sputtered on until it stopped with the onset of World War II. The cathedral then squatted on Amsterdam Avenue minus its towers and with only part of one transept until Dean Morton decided it was time to continue work.
In 1978, he recruited five young people, including two former street gang members, for the first apprentice class. By taking in neighborhood youths, the Episcopal Church sidestepped the charge that it was ignoring people in need while spending money on a building.
"It was showing that this great cathedral is not a thing of the past, showing that cathedrals have got to be completed," he said recently. And it was also a way to revive a fast-fading tradition, he said. 
Word filtered out. Ms. Lowrie saw it on the television news. Mr. Orekunrin, a wood carver in his native Nigeria, was driving by in his gypsy cab and stopped out of curiosity. Pedro L. Colon stumbled on it while delivering flowers to the cathedral for a florist shop. 
The apprentices, some of whom were sent for study in England and France, cut across race and economic background, and later generations included Europeans with carving experience. The stoneyard became a crossroads, a sometimes odd mix of streetwise New York, artistic endeavor and heavy lifting.
Dean Morton became the yard's spiritual father. He buried and baptized apprentices, proselytized about its virtues and cheerfully extracted money from donors.
"It made me get up in the morning," he said. "It was the most exciting thing going. I took everyone I knew to see it, and they all went bananas."
Mr. Pizarro arrived in late 1979. He was 20, with a rough upbringing in Spanish Harlem and a vague idea to pursue carpentry. His brother's junior high school graduation at the cathedral changed that.
"I was so amazed. I was looking at this place like, 'How do they do these things?' " he said. "I started looking into it, getting more information. I realized then: Wow, I was meant to do this. It came so natural. Not only that, I was building a cathedral. It was overwhelming."
David M. Teitelbaum, a real estate developer with a preservationist bent, also became captivated by the stoneyard. In 1989, Dean Morton invited him in to expand it and form a partnership, Cathedral Stoneworks, with part of the profits from outside work plowed back into the cathedral. 
"The idea was very romantic, and it was wonderful," Mr. Teitelbaum said. "I felt this was one thing I could do that would be really an imprint on my life."
He invested heavily in advanced machinery. But a real estate crash in 1990 dried up financing for cathedral building, and Mr. Teitelbaum said he had trouble paying for his investment. Construction stopped in 1991. Mr. Teitelbaum hung on for three more years before going out of business.
"Our big baby died," said Dean Morton, who founded and now runs the Interfaith Center of New York. So did about 70 jobs. 
Some blamed Mr. Teitelbaum for the stoneyard's demise, or at least ruining its spirit.
"It turned basically into a factory," said Joseph Kincannon, who worked at the yard from 1980 to 1992. "The work became much simpler and less interesting."
Mr. Teitelbaum counters that he was providing training and jobs, and that the machinery created more time for carvers to carry out detail work.
After the stoneyard closed, the masons wandered off. Mr. Pizarro did some renovation work and drove a U.P.S. truck. He spent three years restoring works at an antiques dealer in Manhattan before his current job moving art.
Many of the former cathedral masons want the cathedral building to continue, with or without them. The prospects seem unlikely, at least for the moment. The administration that followed Dean Morton decided to focus on conservation rather than on new building. A new dean and bishop are expected soon, and supporters of building are placing their hopes in the change.
"The cathedral needs to be built," said Mr. Reed, the freelance stonemason. "I've dedicated my life to it."
"We build nuclear plants and weapons," he added, "why not a cathedral? This is the most prosperous nation at its most prosperous time. Why not build?"
Now 45, Mr. Reed started his apprenticeship in 1986, in the aftermath of his brother's murder and during a respite from the intravenous cocaine habit that he says gave him the AIDS virus. The cocaine habit came back while Mr. Reed was at the cathedral. He even broke open a collection box with a masonry hammer. Officials from the cathedral got Mr. Reed into rehabilitation. 
Mr. Reed, speaking through lips swollen by an AIDS-related infection, is a lay minister at his church in Brooklyn and is hoping to start a landscaping business.
AIDS claimed Ruben Gibson in 1988, at age 39. He is remembered as a fiercely dedicated carver with a strongly religious, almost monastic, bent. On a recent visit to the cathedral with other former apprentices, Mr. Reed contemplated a rough-hewn lion's head poking out of a stone block. It was Mr. Gibson's last work.
After the stoneyard closed, Mr. Teitelbaum established Stoneworks Gallery, which produces inscribed stones, fountains, benches and patios in Closter, N.J. Five former apprentices went to work for him. Mr. Otero is the only one still there.
Of the others, Henry Espinal moved to Rhode Island at the end of last year, with hopes of doing masonry, Mr. Teitelbaum said. Mr. Colon went on disability last summer because of alcohol-related illnesses. Julio Kuong is in a nursing home. He suffered an aneurysm helping someone move furniture, Mr. Otero said. Jorge Subervi opened a grocery store in the Bronx last year.
Before they dispersed, the apprentices did raise up the cathedral's south tower by 50 feet and carve much of its central portal. Cathedral Stoneworks worked on dozens of places around New York and elsewhere, including the Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church and Rockefeller Center.
Though the stoneyard is defunct, it brought new blood to the field, and demonstrated that highly skilled conservation work on historical stone buildings was possible.
For the human beings who passed through it, the stoneyard left a profound mark. "It's like it's in your blood, the rhythms, the sound, the smell, the scale of things," said Ms. Robb, who along with Mr. Pellettieri still uses space in the cathedral close, working amid forlorn stacks of partly carved limestone blocks. 
"Everybody loved the cathedral, and it was central to the entire experience," Ms. Robb said. "And that was the thought behind putting this program together: the medieval concept of community. That's what we had.
"And it was gorgeous."

HEADLINE: Turkey Floats Currency, and It Falls 25% 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Sixty-five million Turks awakened this morning to find their national currency in a free fall that stripped away more than 25 percent of its value by the end of the day and sent a wave of concern -- but so far no panic -- through many foreign markets.
 While investors and political leaders worried about whether Turkey's financial problems would be contagious, Turks waited for prices to skyrocket and wondered whether the crisis might bring down the government. 
 "Those who are responsible should pay the price," a statement from the Civil Initiative, a coalition of labor unions and business groups, said.
The leaders of the two main opposition parties demanded that Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit resign and call early elections, though few officials or diplomats in Ankara, the capital, expected either. 
The new turmoil resulted from the decision by Turkey -- in hopes of averting a financial meltdown -- to let the value of its currency, the lira, be decided by market forces. The lira had been pegged to a mixture of the dollar and the euro. The decision was announced at 3 a.m. today after a 12-hour meeting of Mr. Ecevit and his senior cabinet members.
In Washington, officials at the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, with bitter memories of the collapse of Thailand's currency in 1997, issued a series of statements intended to calm the markets by expressing support for Turkey's decision to let the currency float.
But in private, these officials were much more critical. American officials noted that in the autumn, before the I.M.F. worked out a $7.5 billion emergency loan deal to support economic change in Turkey, many at the Treasury thought the effort to maintain a fixed exchange rate was doomed. And a senior I.M.F. official said: "There was a lot of doubt that they could make the reforms stick, and that they were playing with global markets they didn't entirely understand. They didn't have the political cohesion to make it work."
The officials noted that there was no evidence of Turkey's problems spreading to other emerging markets.
Here in Istanbul, the financial markets responded quickly and harshly, sending the lira lower even as stock prices rebounded somewhat from Wednesday's decline. The lira had been trading at 685,000 to $1, but by the end of the business day here it dropped to a rate around 925,000 to the dollar. A few hours later in New York, the Turkish currency weakened further, settling at 962,499.
Analysts here said that there were few large currency transactions even at that price and that the volatility made it difficult to determine a fair price for the Turkish lira.
The financial crisis erupted on Monday after a public dispute between Mr. Ecevit and Turkey's president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The prime minister left a meeting of senior government officials in a huff after President Sezer accused him and his ministers of not being tough enough on corruption in the banking industry.
With the risk of political instability, interest rates soared and the stock market plummeted, leading to the decision to allow the lira's exchange rate to float to market value.
The decision was a blow to the economic package that the Turkish government instituted a year ago with backing from the International Monetary Fund. Trimming inflation was a key goal, but freeing up the lira is expected to cause a sharp jump in inflation and the cost of imports.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill were briefed on the crisis early today, and Mr. O'Neill issued a brief statement saying he supported the Turkish government's decision to float the lira. "Turkey is an important ally and good friend of the United States," he said. "The United States continues to back the I.M.F.'s ongoing support for Turkey's economic reform program."
The briefing of General Powell was notable because it indicated that the State Department, mindful of the Mexican and Asian currency crises, was now significantly more sensitive to the possibility that a financial crisis could breed new political and security problems.
The managing director of the I.M.F., Horst Kohler, called on private investors and commercial banks to back Turkey in the financial markets. Mr. Kohler indicated that the lending agency might speed up delivery of the next installments of its $7.5 billion emergency loan.
The biggest fear among many foreign leaders is that Turkey's new round of problems could set off a crisis of confidence in emerging markets elsewhere, leading to investor flight and a repetition of the panic that started with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 and spread widely.
The decision to free up the lira was part of an effort to stem the outflow of foreign investment capital from Turkey. The nation's central bank spent $7.5 billion of its cash reserves early in the week as investors fled and commercial banks faced difficulty making payments.
On Tuesday, Turkey sold $2.7 billion worth of lira-denominated bonds, which dropped sharply overnight with the devaluation. Some analysts said the lira is likely to bounce back in the coming weeks, but the timing and the level are uncertain. 
The three parties that form the coalition government had staked their political future on curbing Turkey's chronic double-digit inflation and reducing spending. Economists and analysts said there would be pressure to come up with strong new measures to restore investor confidence, but they questioned whether the government had sufficient public trust to demand more sacrifices.
Kamil Yilmaz, an economics professor at Koc University in Istanbul, said: "Working people and fixed-income people have really suffered under the inflation-fighting program, and now they are going to suffer more. They have lost confidence in the government."
Concerns were evident across this city as the lira plummeted. Crowds gathered outside currency exchanges in the busiest neighborhoods and seemed dazed as the currency's value dropped. Many money exchanges refused to sell dollars at any price, encouraging fears that inflation was going to soar again.
"All the prices will jump in a couple of days," said Cevat Demirci, as he surveyed the shelves in his small grocery store near the Bosporus. "The rich will be more rich and the poor will be more poor."
A more immediate concern for the government will be the effect of the floating lira on the country's banks, which are suffering from falling profits and face a wide corruption investigation. Turkey's 80 banks have an estimated $18 billion in open foreign-currency positions.
Indeed today, Deutsche Bank warned, "The currency adjustment and the losses accrued over the past few weeks on the securities portfolio could cause even some large banks to face very serious problems."

HEADLINE: Spy Drama Survivor Watches as Story Unfolds 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Boris Yuzhin could be called the third man in the unfolding F.B.I. spy drama, the only survivor of a trio of named Russian agents for the United States who the government says were exposed by Robert Philip Hanssen.
 On Monday, the day before the espionage scandal broke, Mr. Yuzhin received a cryptic call at his home in Northern California. "Watch the news tomorrow," an F.B.I. contact said. 
 And so Mr. Yuzhin, a mild-mannered former Soviet K.G.B. operative who worked secretly for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the 1970's and 80's before being unmasked in Moscow and imprisoned in Siberia, learned with the rest of the world on Tuesday of Mr. Hanssen's arrest. 
"They always catch them on my birthday," Mr. Yuzhin, who turned 59 on Wednesday, told a friend, who later recounted the conversation in an interview. 
It was exactly seven years earlier, on Feb. 21, 1994, that the F.B.I. arrested Aldrich H. Ames, a senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency, and his wife, on charges of selling the Soviet Union and later Russia some of the nation's most sensitive secrets. Although working independently of each other, Mr. Ames and Mr. Hanssen corroborated each other's information for the Russians, the Justice Department has charged. Mr. Ames is serving a life sentence.
In an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint and arrest and search warrants, the F.B.I. named Mr. Yuzhin and two K.G.B. officers in the Soviet Embassy in Washington -- Valery F. Martinov and Sergei M. Motorin -- as having been exposed as American spies by Mr. Ames in 1985 and then several months later by Mr. Hanssen. 
The two senior K.G.B. officers were recalled to Moscow and executed. Mr. Yuzhin, back in Moscow for reassignment, was arrested in 1986 and spent more than five years of a 15-year sentence in Perm 35, a Siberian prison, before being released in an amnesty after the fall of Communism in 1992. 
He later immigrated to the United States and was resettled with the help of the F.B.I. in the San Francisco area, where he had been assigned by the K.G.B. a quarter century ago to monitor student activities and work under the cover of being a Tass correspondent -- and where he decided to volunteer his services to the F.B.I.
Why wasn't he executed? "He was never in residency in the K.G.B. offices," said one of his former F.B.I. handlers. "He was able to convince his interrogators he knew nothing about operations and cases."
Mr. Yuzhin, who first recounted the story of his double-agentry and his arrest to The New York Times in 1994, said yesterday that he did not want to discuss the latest developments, largely over concern with jeopardizing family ties in Russia. He said, however, that he had never met Mr. Hanssen and had long thought that it was Mr. Ames alone who had betrayed him.
Friends of Mr. Yuzhin's, including some longtime F.B.I. agents who worked with him, said he lived with his wife and grown daughter, an occupational therapist, in an attractive house he bought about five years ago in Santa Rosa, Calif. His mother, sister and a married son, an economist, with children of his own, live in Russia. Mr. Yuzhin has not been back to Russia since his release from prison in 1992, but his son and grandchildren come for visits. 
Supported by a modest American government stipend, he writes, does historical research and augments his income with occasional lectures.
According to one listing carried on the Internet, Mr. Yuzhin spoke last October in Palm Springs, Calif., to the Southern California Fraud Investigation Association. His topic: "The Russian Mind."
One project that long absorbed Mr. Yuzhin was researching the cases of other former Soviet prisoners, including Raoul Wallenberg, the anti-Nazi Swedish diplomat who disappeared into the gulag after World War II. Working with an American, Susan Mesinai, in the Ark Project, a human rights organization dedicated to finding lost political prisoners under the Soviets, Mr. Yuzhin helped establish that Mr. Wallenberg did not simply disappear but was secretly held by Soviet authorities until his death in prison, a fact that Russian authorities subsequently acknowledged.
Mr. Yuzhin also worked with Ms. Mesinai and others to track down missing American prisoners, including a defector from the National Security Council, Victor Hamilton, who was found 30 years later, in 1992, in a Soviet psychiatric hospital. 
Friends of Mr. Yuzhin's said that they had encouraged him in recent years to look for other work that would occupy his mind and offer him income but that he found it difficult to find the right thing.
"He's not going to flip burgers," one retired F.B.I. agent said. "His attitude was that he would not start at the bottom."

HEADLINE: Breezy Point Journal; 
Neighborly Place Hits a Sewer Line in the Sand

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
It might be too simple to blame the whole mess at Breezy Point on the toilet, but it wouldn't be far off.
 There have been arrests, shouting matches, a hunger strike and a $15 million lawsuit. There was an 16-year legal battle that finally drew to a close last month as a judge, quoting Descartes, dismissed the complaints that fueled a sewer imbroglio. 
 Years ago, when the Breezy Point Cooperative, a serene and highly secured gated community on the western tip of the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, was a summer resort -- known as the Irish Riviera -- there was a lot less toilet flushing. 
But things changed about two decades ago, when many residents of the community, between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, began living there year-round. The summer bungalows were winterized and renovated. New families flocked to buy into the cooperative of 2,800 single-family homes, a kind of seaside suburb in the city, with sandy walkways and hardly any crime.
With the people came, well, heavy flushing, which put a strain on the septic tanks and cesspools. In the mid-1980's, the leadership of the cooperative started studying the possibility of putting in sewers, the cost of doing so, and whether the city, which pays for sewer lines on public property, would foot the bill.
But to Tom Young, a 63-year-old resident and retired firefighter, sewers would be the first step toward rapid development of the 500-acre property, some of the most pristine beachfront in New York.
The issue has become even more contentious because Breezy Point is actually growing wider, raising the prospect that developers would seek the new property. The area gained more than 100 acres in the last four decades, as the ocean's westward drift moved sand from Fire Island and the Hamptons to its shores.
But Breezy Point officials have consistently said there are no plans to further develop the property. Mr. Young won't buy it. "You been down to Atlantic City?" he said recently, as he stood on the cooperative's half-mile-wide beach, with the World Trade Center just a speck in the distance. "It's all high-rises. They built right up on the sand."
In 1991, a narrow majority of the residents rejected the idea of installing sewers. But the case was far from closed. Mr. Young, who claims that he was harassed and assaulted by residents and cooperative leaders for his vociferous crusade against sewers, sued the cooperative in 1985 and sought $15 million in punitive damages. 
In 1987, the cooperative, whose chairman then was the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who owns a summer home there, sued Mr. Young for abuse of process, alleging that he was misusing the judicial system to oppose sewers. 
The two cases, which were combined into one, dragged on for years, with Mr. Young going on a two-day hunger strike last spring and standing outside the State Supreme Court courthouse in Kew Gardens demanding a trial. The case went to trial last fall. Then, in December, Mr. Young was arrested and charged with threatening Mr. Hynes, saying he was going to "get" the district attorney. Mr. Young, who denied saying that, was released without bail. 
Justice Thomas V. Polizzi dismissed the case last month, saying that although Mr. Young had "exhibited a total disrespect of the judicial system," the cooperative had not proved that Mr. Young had abused the legal system. Mr. Young said he planned to appeal.
Cooperative officials declined through their general counsel, Robert E. Lee, to discuss the case and possible sewer plans.
But in a newsletter distributed to residents last spring, the cooperative's chairman, John V. Hudson, said, "We must explore every possible avenue for obtaining public funds to pay for the installation of a sewer system."
The city would probably pay for a main sewer line along the public road that runs through the cooperative. But to secure city money to attach houses to the sewer main, the cooperative would have to make the streets, many of which have individual gates that require access cards to enter, public property, said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff at the city's Department of Environmental Protection.
Mr. Sturcken said city officials had met with cooperative officials several times but were unable to agree on a plan.
Residents of Breezy Point jealously guard their privacy and few would speak with a reporter about the sewer situation. But those who did said the crux of the issue was cost, not Mr. Young's fears of development.
"We're not expanding into the dunes," said Rita Shea, a retired marketing consultant and a sewer supporter who turned her summer home into a year-round home in 1989. "I think we're dealing with economics. And it's like anything else you do to improve the community. You do it to make your life better, not because you want to become something you never were before."

HEADLINE: Hartford Worst in National Study Of Births to Unmarried Mothers 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The statistics tell the damning story of this city: nearly 80 percent of all babies born in 1998 had single mothers, double the national average and 10 times the state average. A quarter of all births were to teenage mothers, and a quarter of those teenagers had given birth before. 
 In each category, Hartford topped a list of 55 cities included in a nationwide child health report published Tuesday by the Annie E. Casey Foundation in Baltimore. The survey, which also included statistics for New York City, New York State and New Jersey, further illustrated Hartford's decade-long struggle to overcome social and economic problems that public health experts and elected officials have not been able to solve. 
 "What this report suggests is that the state and city elected officials have done the worst job in the nation, of these 55 communities, tending the needs of Hartford," said Paul Gionfriddo, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Human Services in Hartford, which helped the foundation compile its report. "For Hartford, it is as dismal a picture that could be imagined."
Hartford's rankings were no surprise to Gov. John G. Rowland, said his spokesman, Dean Pagani. "He's known for some time that Hartford and some other cities in the state lag behind the rest of the country," Mr. Pagani said. 
Asked what the state could do to improve child health in Hartford, Mr. Pagani noted that the governor, a resident of the city's far west end, has made urban renewal a focus of his administration's second term.
"The governor thinks that the place where you can have the biggest impact is the schools," he said, especially in combination with job-training programs that help residents rise above poverty. 
Asked if there were cultural reasons for Hartford's high rates of single mothers and teenage pregnancies, Mr. Pagani said, "From the governor's point of view, he's more interested in fixing the problems than looking at what caused them."
The foundation's report, "The Right Start," used 1998 data to rank the 50 states, the nation's 50 largest cities and 5 others -- Hartford; Des Moines; Louisville, Ky.; Providence, R.I.; and Savannah, Ga. The report was based on eight child health indicators, including the number of births to teenagers, births to unmarried mothers of all ages and the prevalence of low birth weights and prenatal care. The data, the latest available, were taken from the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The report is a part of the Annie E. Casey Foundation's larger annual Kids Count survey, due in May. 
In contrast to Hartford, a chronically impoverished city of 128,000 that is the capital of the nation's wealthiest state, statistics for Connecticut as a whole showed that it had the fifth-lowest percentage of births to teenage and single mothers. In fact, for seven of the eight indicators used in the survey, Connecticut's ranking was better than the national average and better than the rankings for New York and New Jersey. 
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were among the states with the lowest percentage of births to teenage mothers, but in most other categories, such as the number of low-birthweight babies and the prevalence of births to mothers who received late or no prenatal care, New York and New Jersey were slightly worse than the national average. Likewise, while New York City had a relatively low number of births by teenage mothers and a low rate of births to mothers who smoke, it ranked in the middle of the city survey for most of the indicators. 
The report did not report statistics for any cities in New Jersey.
William P. O'Hare, the director of the Kids Count program, said New York City's constant flow of immigrants, who tend to marry quickly and stay in the city for years afterward, helped the city avoid the child health problems evident in Hartford, where financial investment is fleeting and residents have long tended to leave for jobs in places with brighter prospects. 
"There's a strong correlation between poverty and negative birth outcomes," Mr. O'Hare said today.
The grip of teenage motherhood and poverty develops into an insidious cycle, he said. According to the foundation's 1999 Kids Count report, a child born to an unmarried teenage high school dropout is 10 times as likely to be living in poverty as a child born to a mother with none of these three characteristics. 
Katherine McCormick, Hartford's health director, said the city's high number of pregnant teenagers could be attributed to a mixture of causes, including poverty, school dropout rates and cultural factors.
But she disputed the accuracy of some of the foundation's statistics regarding teenage pregnancies in Hartford, saying the majority of those were for women 18 or 19 years old, not for girls 13 to 17 years old. If the city's teenage birth numbers were broken down by age, she added, they would show that the percentage for girls 17 and younger is 10.8 percent, a less troubling figure than the 24.8 percent listed in the report for all teenage mothers.
Eloisa Hernandez, the director of the Association for Children of New Jersey, a child advocacy group in Newark, said a pregnant teenager was a problem at any age. 
"These are kids who are more than likely still in high school, more than likely under their parents' roof, and more than likely not able to properly care for a child," she said.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Approves Budget, Putting Capital Plan in Motion 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday approved a $4.6 billion budget for 2001, from which it will begin spending on a $14 billion, five-year capital plan that is the largest in the agency's history.
 Officials of the bistate agency said the agency would spend $2.05 billion of the new budget to begin buying new PATH trains, modernizing airports, dredging harbor channels and improving bridges and tunnels. 
 Much of the rest of the capital plan will be financed by issuing bonds that will be repaid from proceeds of the higher bridge and tunnel tolls and PATH train fares that the agency approved last month. 
Lewis M. Eisenberg, chairman of the agency board that approved the budget, said the agency planned to "take on the most ambitious agenda in its 80-year history." 
The capital program is expected to generate 15,000 jobs, largely in the construction industry, and generate about $2.3 billion in economic activity. "The Port Authority's 2001 budget provides funds to improve the commutes of millions of New York and New Jersey residents as well as the airports and seaports on which our region depends," said Robert E. Boyle, the agency's executive director.
In approving the budget, the agency also reported that it had amassed reserves of $1.6 billion in 2000 and had net revenue of $2.6 billion. Traffic volume at bridge and tunnel crossings was 1.6 percent higher than in 1999, agency officials said, while PATH ridership increased by 10 percent. The passenger traffic at La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark International Airports was 92.6 million in 2000, an increase of 3.3 million. 
The amount of spending devoted to long-term capital projects this year is nearly double that spent on capital programs last year, when the Port Authority was embroiled in a dispute between New York and New Jersey representatives on the agency's board over allocation of its funds. 
The dispute was resolved last June, paving the way for the toll and fare increases, and the start of the ambitious five-year plan.
Included in the spending approved yesterday was $30 million to soundproof 21 New York schools and 12 New Jersey schools affected by aircraft noise at the three commercial airports and the one general aviation airport, Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, that the agency operates. The program is jointly financed by the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration, which pays 80 percent of the cost.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Oracle defies wisdom by using itself to pitch its software products.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
THEY are hardly an advertising novelty, but whether they are offered by movie celebrities, sports stars or plain citizens, testimonials are usually about products that are made by third-party companies and not by the person who is delivering the pitch. 
 Except for weight-loss gurus, toupee salesmen and the occasional iconoclastic maker of vacuum cleaners or electric razors, hardly any advertisers promote their experiences with their wares as proof of their merit. Who, after all, would believe them? 
 Enter Oracle, the software company in Redwood City, Calif., that is second only to Microsoft in size and the industry leader when it comes to database or information-management products. Instead of using software from 10 or more companies and having to spend the time, and the money, to integrate them, Oracle says it has saved more than $1 billion over the last year by using its E-Business Suite of software in its business operations. 
And, says Mark Jarvis, Oracle's worldwide chief marketing officer, the company is so proud of this accomplishment that it is defying common wisdom by making its experience the centerpiece of its advertising campaign. It is an effort that is costing $100 million worldwide, $40 million in the United States, Mr. Jarvis said, and was highlighted by two recent conferences, both titled AppsWorld 2001.
The campaign began last fall with direct mail, direct e-mail and Internet banners. In print, it has appeared in technical publications and many with a more general business focus, including Business Week, The Economist, The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal.
The print ads are simple, with black-and-white type and only a few lines and the name Oracle printed in red. One ad sets forth, in chart form, 10 applications that Oracle's software can handle, together with the names of 10 vendors, listed alongside, to whose nonintegrated software the tasks might otherwise be entrusted. 
"Oracle saved $1 billion in 1 year," the ad states. "How much will you save?"
Another ad, following the same form, omits the $1 billion figure but provides additional details about Oracle's assertions on its software. It is "engineered to work together," the ad says. "Systems Integration costs a lot more than software. Think about it."
In an age when many advertisers seek attention by shocking consumers or by using drama, the straightforwardness of the Oracle ads is striking. It is also deliberate, said Dave Tutin, executive vice president and executive creative director at the San Francisco office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, the agency handling the Oracle account. He and Casey Jones, executive vice president and managing director for technology at Grey, are in charge of the campaign.
"The ads are laser-focused at the most rational business-decision-making part of customers' brains," Mr. Jones said. The idea is to underscore the simplicity of the concept with ads that are equally simple and direct.
"What Oracle is selling," Mr. Tutin said, "is the corporate equivalent of plug and play."
That is also the message at the conferences, both sponsored by Oracle, Mr. Jarvis said. The first, for European clients of the company, was two weeks ago in Paris. The second, for North American customers, began in New Orleans on Monday and is scheduled to end today. 
Mr. Jarvis said yesterday that 6,200 people had attended the conference in Paris and 11,000 were in New Orleans, where they were able to talk with one another and hear Oracle's praises sung by industry luminaries like Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape Communications, and John Chambers, president of Cisco Systems, the computer network company. And it was not all business; in New Orleans, conference highlights included a speech by former President Bill Clinton and a concert featuring the Bangles and Third Eye Blind.
The total cost, not including advertising, was about $10 million for the New Orleans event and $2 million to $3 million for the one in Paris, although Oracle expected to break even after receiving registration fees of up to $1,000 a participant as well as exhibitor and sponsorship fees from companies like Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer. It was worth the effort, Mr. Jarvis said.
"We are absolutely delighted by the success of AppsWorld," he said yesterday. "And next year will be twice as good."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day on Friday, about a campaign for Oracle software, misstated the affiliation of Dave Tutin at the agency handling the account. He is executive vice president and executive creative director of Grey Worldwide, New York, which is part of the Grey Global Group -- not of Grey Worldwide's San Francisco office.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Oracle has made its experience using its software the centerpiece of its advertising campaign.

System Is Planned to Send Prescriptions Electronically
Three companies that operate most of the nation's managed-care drug plans agreed to establish a joint system to make it easier for doctors to send prescriptions to pharmacies electronically or over the Internet.

A federal judge gave final approval to a $512 million settlement of the lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses by customers who said they were cheated in a years-long price-fixing conspiracy. The approval begins to close one chapter in a scandal that has roiled the secretive and rarefied art and auction world for more than a year. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan called the settlement "eminently reasonable by any standard." Shares of Sotheby's Holdings fell 49 cents, to $23.86. C10.

HEADLINE: Sub Accident Shakes Japan's Security Ties With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush won the White House, people on both sides of the Pacific predicted that the new administration's plans to give greater emphasis to relations with Japan would usher in an era of closer security ties.
 But before the Bush administration's plans could take shape, the accidental sinking this month of a Japanese fishing vessel by an American submarine off Hawaii has decisively shifted the landscape in one of the United States' most important military alliances. 
 Not only has the incident provided new ammunition to those who resent the American troop presence here, but it has also reinforced the perception in some quarters that the United States is a less than reliable guarantor of Japan's security interests. This sentiment could accelerate the trend of recent years toward a more independent defense posture, with Japan less willing to follow Washington's lead in the region and rethinking its longstanding restrictions on the use of military force. 
The latest revelations about the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the Ehime Maru on Feb. 9, in which nine people are still missing and presumed dead, unleashed new anger today in Japan.
Reports that the ship had been detected an hour before the submarine Greeneville surfaced and struck it indicate "grave negligence" by the American crew, said the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, adding that the Japanese government could press for "strict disciplinary steps on the U.S. side."
His comments came against the backdrop of demands by many politicians for a new, much stricter Status of Forces Agreement, which governs the legal rights of the 47,000 American soldiers in Japan.
Those in Okinawa, the southern island province where most American troops are based, have stepped up their longstanding demands for a reduction in American forces. Today, for the first time, Okinawa's governor, Keiichi Inamine, joined those calls.
And Kantoku Teruyu, a member of Parliament from Okinawa, said: "The reduction of the marines' presence is the general desire of the Okinawan people. The marines can go somewhere else, and conduct their drills in Guam and Hawaii. We cannot accept the presence of the Americans here as inevitable."
Beyond angry words like those, primarily inspired by a spate of crimes committed over the years by American soldiers in Okinawa, many here feel that the Ehime Maru sinking will make it far more difficult for Tokyo and Washington to pursue the enhanced security collaboration envisioned by some Bush advisers.
Instead, some say, the fallout from the accident could encourage Japan to push for more autonomy in security matters and bolster its military. 
"The public increasingly feels that Japan cannot fulfill its defense obligations anymore," said Masashi Nishihara, president of Japan's National Defense Academy. But then he listed some of the steps Tokyo has taken lately to strenghten its armed forces.
"A couple of years ago we decided to launch our own intelligence-gathering satellite," he said. "We have launched a large transport ship, which some people have claimed is a kind of aircraft carrier. And we have just approved purchase of in-flight refueling tankers, which expand Japan's defense perimeter."
"Of course," he added, "the government doesn't talk about a defense perimeter, but says that it is meant to increase our ability to support peacekeeping operations."
Under its post-World War II Constitution, written in large part by the United States, Japan is prohibited from any military activity except self-defense. Despite this, Japan has long boasted one of the world's largest military budgets, and its 237,000-member Self-Defense Forces easily rank among the world's most capable military establishments. 
Significantly, many of Japan's major new weapons systems, which include a fleet of antisubmarine aircraft, increase the country's ability to project force.
Late last year, in a widely circulated report, a bipartisan group of American scholars and defense experts headed by Richard L. Armitage, now Mr. Bush's deputy secretary of state, called Japan's military restrictions "a constraint on alliance cooperation," and urged Tokyo "to become a more equal alliance partner."
But Washington jealously guards its leadership role in the alliance, as seen by its unease when Tokyo decided to develop its own intellience-gathering satellite rather than buy one from the United States or rely entirely on American intelligence.
"Some of the displeasure about the satellite intelligence one also picks up about the antisubmarine aircraft," said Benjamin Self, senior associate at Henry L. Stimson Center, a research group in Washington. "You hear questions like, 'Why aren't they investing more in the alliance?' "
"But as long as Japan is operating in the model of very light Gaullism," he added, referring to France's more independent status in NATO, "I think the Armitage team is willing to swallow that and say: 'Oh well, O.K., we trust you. You recognize that the alliance is the best guarantee of your security.' "
Shingo Shuto, director general of defense policy in Japan's Defense Agency, would not comment on the Armitage report, except to say, "During the Clinton administration we were already enjoying very close cooperation over security guidelines, and we expect a continuing strengthening of the relationship."
The last decade has been a very trying time for Japan's national image and sense of security, however, and not just because of the country's shrinking population and economic doldrums.
Throughout this period, China has loomed ever larger as a military and economic rival and potential superpower, while even tiny North Korea, with its medium-range missiles and possible nuclear arms ability, has emerged as a threat. 
While no mainstream Japanese politician openly opposes the alliance with the United States, some are beginning to suggest that, in a world that looks increasingly insecure, it is not enough.
"Let me ask you a question: What would the United States do if China were to attack Japan?" said Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, a member of Parliament. "We cannot totally depend on Washington. That era is coming to an end, and Japan must do more to ensure its own survival."
Others, however, played down the need for greater autonomy, and praised the Armitage report as a reasonable road map for increased cooperation.
"I would say that U.S. bases in Japan will never leave -- unless Americans go back to the isolationist principles of the Monroe era, said Kazuhisa Ogawa, an independent Japanese defense analyst, "because, of the 50-plus countries that are the United States' allies, only Japan is a power-projection platform." 
"Japan is supporting the activities of the United States military from Hawaii to Cape Town," he said. "And if Japan nullified the alliance, the U.S. would never have that kind of platform again."
He added: "But America is also the most valuable country to Japan. For Japan's national interest, it should learn to make use of America more. Not in the conventional way of America proposing and Japan always responding, but by Japan coming up with ideas and proposals sometimes and letting the United States consider whether or not it likes them, too."

HEADLINE: BUSH FAULTS CHINA ON ITS AID TO IRAQ FOR RADAR SYSTEM 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that evidence of China's aid to Iraq in building radar systems to use against American and British warplanes had "risen to the level where we are going to send a message to the Chinese," a statement that put Mr. Bush at odds with Beijing only four weeks into his presidency.
 Mr. Bush made the comments during his first solo news conference at the White House, called somewhat hastily today so Mr. Bush could sum up his first month in office before an address to Congress next week. 
 While he repeated his call for tax cuts and his education program, he also used the moment to declare that last Friday's bombing of the radar sites -- which the Pentagon said was timed to avoid killing Chinese workers there -- was intended to send a "clear signal" to Saddam Hussein and to reduce the capacity of Iraqi radar. Excerpts, Page A10. 
"I believe we succeeded in both those missions," Mr. Bush said, although new indications from the Pentagon suggest that the bombing was not as effective as American officials had initially stated.
While Mr. Bush's harshest words were reserved for Iraq, he struck a tough tone with China saying, "It's troubling that they'd be involved in helping Iraq develop a system that will endanger our pilots."
Two hours later, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, softened the president's statement a bit. She said the White House and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had sent inquiries to Beijing through the new Chinese ambassador here, Yang Jiechi. "I want to make clear that we are not accusing, at this point, the Chinese of anything," she said. "But we are telling them that we have tremendous concerns about what's going on."
Ms. Rice said that China had not yet responded to the inquiries. But in Beijing a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said, "China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has always strictly and seriously implemented all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning Iraq."
American military and intelligence officials say that Chinese workers are helping Iraq build a fiber optic communications network that links the radar stations and other targets attacked by American and British warplanes last Friday.
The Chinese actions could violate United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, administration officials said. 
The confrontation with Beijing puts a chill on Mr. Bush's first high-level exchanges with the Chinese leadership. Only a week ago he exchanged polite introductory letters with President Jiang Zemin in which both leaders described in the most general terms their goals for their relationship.
The Chinese know the Bush family well: Mr. Bush's father was the American representative in Beijing before the two countries opened diplomatic relations, and Mr. Bush spent six weeks there in the 1970's, his longest stay abroad.
Now Mr. Bush's stance suggests that the United States and China may be headed to tougher exchanges, after the Clinton administration had finally succeeded in repairing most of the diplomatic damage done by the accidental American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's air war against Serbia in 1999.
In its first weeks, the new administration has signaled that it will sponsor a resolution condemning China's human rights violations at an annual conference in Geneva. And it has promised to go ahead with a national missile defense plan despite China's vehement opposition and its promises to build up its own nuclear forces to defeat the system.
In his appearance today, Mr. Bush seemed by turns relaxed and somewhat uneasy, especially when the subject turned to problems in foreign policy. He also used the event to argue anew for his tax cut proposal, which will be the subject of an address to Congress on Tuesday.
While Mr. Bush claimed that the raids on Friday against Iraqi air defenses served as a warning on Mr. Hussein, Iraqi forces appear undaunted. They continued to fire at American and British jets patrolling the no-flight zones over southern and northern Iraq, including those that flew today. 
In fact, an American fighter jet attacked a missile defense battery today near Mosul, in northern Iraq. The strike was carried out against a French-made mobile antiaircraft battery purchased before the gulf war. It was not specifically authorized by President Bush but was carried out under standing orders that the pilots can defend themselves when they feel threatened by Iraqi forces in the no-flight zones.
Pentagon officials have said last week's attacks -- against 20 to 24 radar sites and five to seven command or communication centers at five sites ---- disrupted Iraq's air defenses, but they acknowledge that the damage was moderate.
The mixed success was attributed to problems with the Joint Standoff Weapon, or J-SOW. Navy F/A-18's fired more than two dozen of the relatively new J-SOW's at radar stations but "the vast majority" missed their precise targets, a military official said.
That was in sharp contrast to the early reports from Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said on Friday after the raid, "We have no indications that there were any of the strikes that might have gone amiss."
Pentagon officials said the strikes had weakened Iraq's air defenses, and a spokesman said today that only two of the radars attacked had resumed tracking allied patrols.
He said the Pentagon had still not completed an assessment of the damage, but other officials said the raids had severely damaged five command or communications sites. In the case of the radar sites, which included some mobile systems, the success was less clear. One official said only that more than half showed damage visible from aerial or satellite photographs. 
General Powell leaves for the Middle East on Friday, and the president said today that piecing together a consensus on how to rebuild a coalition to isolate Iraq is high on the agenda.
"The secretary of state is going to go listen to our allies as to how best to effect a policy, the primary goal of which will be to say to Saddam Hussein, 'We won't tolerate you developing weapons of mass destruction and we expect you to leave your neighbors alone.' "
But he conceded, as he did in an interview last month, that "the sanction regime is like Swiss cheese."

HEADLINE: Quiet on the Lobbying Front; 
Sudden Halt to Coalition's Bid for Corporate Tax Breaks

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
With a determined tax cutter moving into the White House and Republicans still in charge on Capitol Hill, the stage seemed set early this year for Charls E. Walker to help lower the taxes paid by corporate America once again.
 The most enduring and perhaps best known of the scores of lobbyists who push tax cuts for business, Mr. Walker began making plans for a major effort to rally corporations around tax breaks that could be added to President Bush's $1.6 trillion tax reduction plan. 
 He had reason for optimism when he was invited to the White House a few weeks ago for lunch with President Bush and a group of executives. Not only had he helped shape tax legislation as a government official and lobbyist for four decades, but he was well connected to the new administration. 
At 77, he had been friend, adviser and political supporter of three generations of Bushes, including the current president. The new Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, had served on the board of Mr. Walker's research and advocacy group, the American Council for Capital Formation. He counted Vice President Dick Cheney an ally.
But within days after that lunch at the White House on Feb. 7, Mr. Walker, who has been fine-tuning his political antennae in Washington since the Eisenhower administration, came to an unexpected conclusion: now is not the time to press hard for business tax cuts.
The reason was not opposition from Democrats or infighting among business groups or the possibility of a populist reaction against special-interest tax breaks -- all factors that have complicated or doomed prior efforts to cut corporate taxes.
This time, the roadblock was Mr. Bush. As he settled on a strategy for promoting his tax cut, which would direct its benefits overwhelmingly to individuals, Mr. Bush sent the message that he would not countenance changing or enlarging his proposal, and was willing to use the powers of his office against anyone who defied him.
"I have made it clear to the business interests that the best tax policy is one that reduces taxes on the people," Mr. Bush told a news conference at the White House today. "I hope they listen to me, and I hope they help me get the tax plan through that I have proposed." 
For Mr. Bush, taking a hard line is a way to signal that he is serious about enacting the tax package he promised voters during the campaign. Some business executives say they suspect they have become a politically convenient foil for the administration, which by standing up to corporate lobbying can portray itself as the defender of the ordinary taxpayer and as intent on keeping the tax bill from becoming fiscally irresponsible.
In any case, Mr. Bush's strategy has left Mr. Walker and other proponents of reducing corporate taxes in a bind.
Disinclined to take on a new president whose ideology is generally in sync with their own, they have gone out of their way to pledge support to Mr. Bush's plan. But they have also made clear that they are not completely giving up, either, on the kinds of broad tax relief Mr. Walker is seeking or on the specific tax breaks for companies and industries that other lobbyists are pushing.
Mr. Walker said his coalition had gone into research mode, assembling arguments to back up its efforts so it would be ready to strike if and when Mr. Bush backed down or another tax bill came along.
"It's a matter of timing," Mr. Walker said. "It also reflects a very significant change in the atmosphere with respect to the president's ability to keep his tax bill clean."
"There's been a significant lineup of support in the business community of groups that earlier were planning to hit the Hill pretty strongly, where they have now said they will wait," he added.
As Congress prepares to begin work in earnest on what could be the biggest tax cut in two decades, Mr. Walker's judgment is widely -- though not universally -- shared among trade groups and lobbying firms in Washington that until recently had regarded this year as a golden opportunity to reduce taxes on business.
"The business community is waiting at the corral door," said Bob Packwood, the former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee who is now a lobbyist. "If the gate opens and the herd is coming out, they want to get on a horse, too. But they're not going to open the gate, especially with the president saying he'll drill the first guy who tries."
The White House has been blunt to business. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, met recently with some executives about taxes. Ignoring criticism from Democrats that the president's plan would primarily benefit the wealthy, Mr. Lindsey told the executives that Mr. Bush was intent on focusing his tax cut on the needs of the single mother struggling to make it into the middle class.
"I went around the room and asked them if any of their pet ideas were more important than solving her problem," Mr. Lindsey recounted. "No one raised a hand. If you look at the priorities the president laid out, they are the right priorities."
The situation is one of the trickier to have faced Mr. Walker since he set up shop as a lobbyist in the early 1970's after a stint as deputy Treasury secretary in the Nixon administration and an earlier tour in the Treasury Department at the end of the Eisenhower administration.
Mr. Walker's first big triumph was in helping shepherd through Congress in 1978 a reduction in the top capital gains rate to 28 percent from an effective rate of 50 percent.
Three years later he played a critical role in shaping the main business provisions in President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax bill, the establishment of an investment tax credit and a depreciation schedule that stepped up the pace at which companies could write off their capital investments. Although they were later scaled back, the business provisions eliminated taxes for many companies and added up to as much as $50 billion a year in tax savings.
The next big tax bill, in 1986, was a major defeat for Mr. Walker, however. The bill reduced individual income tax rates, but also repealed the investment tax credit, effectively increasing the tax bill for many companies. "I got my butt beat," Mr. Walker said.
Mr. Walker helped build support in Congress for the provision in the 1997 bipartisan budget deal that reduced the top capital gains rate to 20 percent from 28 percent.
In recent years, Mr. Walker has stopped lobbying for clients. And he has gradually scaled back his involvement in the American Council for Capital Formation, which he founded in 1974 to develop economic research in favor of tax cuts and serve as an umbrella group for trade associations and companies who want to promote corporate tax reductions. He has largely turned over management of the council to his longtime No. 2, Mark Bloomfield.
When the council's board met in Washington on Dec. 13, Mr. Walker decided to skip it and remain at his winter home in Georgia. With Mr. Bush's victory having only become final the previous evening, the board quickly decided that it should mount a substantial effort on behalf of corporate tax reductions. 
Members of the board called Mr. Walker and urged him to jump back into the fray. He immediately agreed.
"I said if I had anything left in strength, skills and contacts, I should do it," Mr. Walker said.
In addition to having a Republican back in the White House, Mr. Walker had another factor working in his favor as he began to plot strategy: the pent-up demand for business tax cuts is considerable. 
Small-business groups are seeking to make health insurance premiums fully deductible for self-employed people, up from 60 percent today, and to repeal a surtax on employers that helps finance unemployment compensation. 
Technology companies are pressing for tax credits to help pay for the broadband networks that provide high-speed Internet access. 
Financial services companies want to expand the individual retirement account and 401(k) retirement savings programs. Multinational corporations want a change in the way their foreign subsidiaries are taxed in the United States. The National Association of Manufacturers wants repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and an acceleration of the rate at which companies can write off their investments in capital equipment.
Some of the proposals sought by business groups would be very expensive. An acceleration in the write-off schedule, especially for technology equipment, could reduce federal revenue by $250 billion or more over the next decade. The expansion of the retirement programs would cost more than $50 billion over 10 years.
The one significant tax break for business included in Mr. Bush's plan -- the permanent extension of the credit for research and development expenses -- is valued at $30 billion over 10 years.
But from Mr. Walker's perspective, the danger was that business would not be able to present a united front, and would end up fighting with itself over whose favorite provisions made it into the tax bill.
So along with Mr. Bloomfield, the council's president, Mr. Walker decided to try to put together a coalition of business interests that could unite behind a limited set of tax issues.
"We wanted a proposal that would make economic sense," Mr. Bloomfield said. "It would attract all sectors of the corporate community. It would be revenue-responsible. And it would help avoid a Christmas tree," when a tax bill becomes so laden with special-interest provisions that it runs the risk of collapsing under its own weight.
To appeal to Wall Street, they included the proposal to expand the retirement savings programs, and they signed up Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, as coalition co-chairman.
To attract multinational corporations, they decided to seek a change that would limit corporate income taxes levied in the United States to income generated in this country. And to give their efforts as broad a cast as possible, they included in their agenda a call for a reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent, or an acceleration in business depreciation.
The hope was that the coalition would be a vehicle for bringing together other groups and companies with similar views. But within a week after announcing the coalition on Feb. 6, Mr. Walker made his decision that the political terrain had become too uncertain to push ahead aggressively.
Some lobbyists say Mr. Bush may need help from business groups to get his proposal through the evenly divided Senate, help that could translate into a chance to insert some favorable provisions in the bill. Others say members of Congress will inevitably begin attaching pet ideas to Mr. Bush's bill in response to pressure from constituents and contributors, setting off a free-for-all.
Having seen presidents and members of Congress come and go for four decades, Mr. Walker says he can afford to be patient.
"We'll be ready with our studies and models if and when the opportunity to move ahead occurs," Mr. Walker said. "If the dam breaks, all I will say now is that we would have to reconsider our position."

HEADLINE: Transcript of President Bush's White House News Conference 

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:

MR. BUSH
 Good afternoon. It's been about a month now since I've taken office. And I thought it appropriate to come by and have a press conference. 
 Before I do so, though, I'd like to make a few comments. One of my missions has been to change the tone here in the nation's capital to encourage civil discourse. I think we're making pretty good progress. I want to thank the Democrats and the Republicans who have been coming up to the White House to hear me make my case. I appreciate their responsiveness. 
I just hope they vote for my agenda that I'll be submitting next week in a budget address to the Congress. I have a reasonable and balanced budget. It meets growing needs with a responsible rate of increase in spending. It funds priorities. 
And my administration has no higher priority than education. Yesterday I announced that the Department of Education will receive the largest percentage increase of any department in the federal government, a little more than 11 percent increase. But with new money will come high expectations. We must insist on results and support programs that work. It is in the best interest of American children that we reform our public schools by having strong accountability at its core. 
Our budget will honor commitments of America's senior citizens. Social Security and Medicare funds will be protected for Social Security and Medicare. We're now spending $216 billion on Medicare. Under my budget, Medicare spending will increase by more than $21 billion in 2002. My budget also locks away $2.6 trillion of the $5.6 trillion surplus for Social Security over the next 10 years. 
Our budget is fiscally responsible. If enacted, it will reduce debt by an unprecedented amount over the next four years. Altogether, about 60 percent of the projected federal surplus will be used to fund priorities and to reduce debt. 
After we've funded our priorities, after we have paid down an unprecedented amount of debt, we'll still have money left over. Which leaves us with two options: First is to spend it on bigger government, or return it to the taxpayers who earned it. I believe it should be returned to the taxpayers. It's the people's money and the government ought to be passing it back after it's met priorities. 
It's also necessary because these are uncertain times -- increasing layoffs, growing consumer debt, lower consumer confidence. And lower taxes will help our economy. 
This will be a responsible and fair budget that reflects the nation's priorities. 
I invite the American people to listen to what I have to say to the Congress. I'd be glad to answer any questions you have.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q. Mr. President, in light of the latest spy scandal, should a senior F.B.I. official be required to take polygraph tests? And secondly, what, if any, responsibility should the F.B.I. director, Louis Freeh, bear for this breach of national security?

MR. BUSH. I have confidence in Director Freeh. I think he does a good job. I have confidence in the men and women who work at the F.B.I. I am deeply concerned about the current spy case, as is Director Freeh. He has made the right move in selecting Judge Webster to review all procedures in the F.B.I., to make sure that this doesn't happen again. We ought to be concerned about espionage in America. In the statement I made the other day, I said we will be diligent; we will find spies and we will prosecute them. I am pleased that they caught the spy. Now the courts must act.

Q. Do we need polygraphs so we'll be able to catch ----

MR. BUSH. I look forward to seeing what Judge Webster has to say. I presume he's going to review that issue and will make a recommendation to the director and to me.

Presidential Pardons

Q. Do you believe that pardons were for sale in the Clinton White House? And what, specifically, do you think should be done to look into, to investigate, the circumstances of the president's brother-in-law accepting money to lobby him on pardons?

MR. BUSH. As far as this White House is concerned, it's time to go forward. I've got too much to do -- to get a budget passed, to get reforms passed for education, to get a tax cut passed, to strengthen the military -- than to be worrying about decisions that my predecessor made. I understand there's going to be some people on Capitol Hill that are going to be asking questions. That's their right to do so. But I can assure you our White House is moving forward.
And to the extent the Justice Department looks into this matter, it will be done in a nonpolitical way. During John Ashcroft's confirmation process I said that the Justice Department will conduct its business in a nonpolitical way. And we will do so.

Q. Can I just follow up?

MR. BUSH. Sure. Yes.

Q. Other presidents are commenting on this matter. On the Rich pardon specifically, former President Carter said that in his opinion, it was, quote, disgraceful. Do you not have an opinion on a power that is absolute and is vested in you as the president?

MR. BUSH. My opinion is, should I decide to grant pardons, I will do so in a fair way. I'll have the highest of high standards. But the president made the decisions he made. And he can answer the questions raised by the American citizens and the press corps. This White House is moving forward. We've got a lot to do. We've got a lot of people to convince on our agenda. I think we're making pretty good progress but there's a lot of work to be done.

Q. Mr. President, do you think that U.S.-Russian relations have been damaged by the new spy case? And secondly, are the Russians showing any flexibility on a missile defense system?

MR. BUSH. I intend to deal with Mr. Putin in a very straightforward way, to be up front with him on all matters. I am, of course, disturbed about the spy, the espionage, the alleged espionage that took place. I'm mindful that there are people who don't particularly care what America stands for. And people are interested in our secrets.
Secondly, I was pleased to see comments from Russian leadership that talked about missile defense. Their words indicate that they recognize that there are new threats in the post-cold war era, threats that require theater-based antiballistic missile systems. I felt those words were encouraging. When I meet with Mr. Putin, I'm going to talk to him about exactly what he meant by those words. We have no meeting set up yet, I might add. But I took that to be encouraging, Steve. It reminded me of what happened after I met with Mr. Ivanov Igor S. Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister shortly thereafter. Mr. Putin also talked about theater-based systems and the ability to intercept missiles on launch. And to me it's indicative of his recognition of the realities of the true threats in the post-cold war era, threats from an accidental launch or threats as a result of a leader in what they call a rogue nation trying to hold ourselves or our allies, or Russia for that matter, hostage. So I was pleased with what I saw.

Iraq and Sanctions

Q. Sir, the secretary of state is departing for the Middle East tomorrow. One of the things that he will be discussing with Middle East leaders is the possibility of modifying sanctions on Iraq. And I'm wondering what message he will take from this administration to leaders in the Middle East in the area of sanctions that matter, sanctions that are effective on the regime but do not carry with them the same level of criticism the current sanctions have had in that they affect the Iraqi civilian population more than they do the regime, sir.

MR. BUSH. We're reviewing all policy in all regions of the world and one of the areas we've been spending a lot of time on is the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The secretary of state is going to go listen to our allies and as to how best to effect a policy, the primary goal of which will be to say to Saddam Hussein: We won't tolerate you developing weapons of mass destruction and we expect you to leave your neighbors alone. I have said that the sanction regime is like Swiss cheese -- that meant that they weren't very effective. And we're going to review current sanction policy and review options as to how to make the sanctions work. But the primary goal is to make it clear to Saddam that we expect him to be a peaceful neighbor in the region and we expect him not to develop weapons of mass destruction. And if we find him doing so, there will be a consequence.
We took action last week. And maybe on your mind is that decision I made. The mission was twofold. One was to send him a clear message that this administration will remain engaged in that part of the world. I think we accomplished that mission. We got his attention. And secondly the mission was to degrade his capacity to harm our pilots who might be flying in the no-fly zone. And we accomplished that mission as well.

Q. How would you characterize sanctions that work, sir?

MR. BUSH. Sanctions that work are sanctions that, when a -- the collective will of the region supports the policy. That we have a coalition of countries that agree with the policy set out by the United States. To me, that's the most effective form of sanctions. Many nations in that part of the world aren't adhering to the sanction policy that had been in place. And as a result, a lot of goods are heading into Iraq that were not supposed to. And so a good sanction policy is one where the United States is able to build a coalition around the strategy.

Q. Mr. President, go back to the controversies surrounding former President Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Are you at all concerned that these controversies are serving as a distraction for your administration's agenda? Are you concerned that further Congressional hearings will mean that lawmakers are spending more time on those matters than are working on your policies?

MR. BUSH. As I said earlier, I've got a lot of work to do. And I think I've got the Congress's attention. I certainly hope so. There's been a lot of discussion about tax relief. And I'm pleased with the progress being made on that important subject. There's a lot of hot debate that has already taken place. And we've just begun to make the case. I'm beginning to travel around the country to important states -- all states are important, of course. But some states may be more important than others right now in trying to convince some lawmakers to hear the message of the people. And this is an issue that affects everybody who pays taxes. Congress is listening to the debate. They're participating in the debate. There's a lot of discussion about education reform on the Hill. And I'm confident that the focus will be the right focus. And my speech Tuesday night I hope will help keep the focus on the agenda.

Q. Mr. President, why do you refuse to respect the wall between the church and state? And you know that the mixing of religion and government, for centuries, has led to slaughter. The very fact that our country has stood in good stead by having this separation -- why do you break it down?

MR. BUSH. I strongly respect the separation of church and state.

Q. Well, you wouldn't have a religious office in the White House if you did.

MR. BUSH. I didn't get to finish my answer, in all due respect. I believe that so long as there's a secular alternative available, we ought to allow individuals who we're helping to be able to choose a program that may be run by a faith-based program or can -- will be run by a faith-based program. I understand full well that some of the most compassionate missions of help and aid come out of faith-based programs. And I strongly support the faith-based initiative that we're proposing because I don't believe it violates the line between the separation of church and state. And I believe it's going to make America a better place.

Q. Well, you are a secular official.

MR. BUSH. I agree. I am a secular official.

Q. Sir, on the air strikes in Iraq, the Pentagon is now saying that most of the bombs used in those strikes missed their targets. Given that, what is now your assessment of how successful those strikes were, how much danger do the remaining installations that we missed in those strikes pose to our forces? And would you hit them again if commanders in the field ask for authorization to do so?

MR. BUSH. We had two missions. One was to send a clear signal to Saddam and the other was to degrade the capacity of Saddam to injure our pilots. I believe we succeeded in both those missions. The bomb assessment damage report is ongoing and I look forward to what the Pentagon has to say as they fully assess the mission. And I will continue to listen to the commanders in the field. My job as commander in chief is to get input from the commanders in the field. And we will do everything needed to protect our pilots, to protect the men and women who wear the uniform.

Tax-Cut Proposal

Q. You said that your $1.6 trillion tax cut is reasonable and responsible within the outlines of the budget you're going to present. If, when that gets to Congress, things start getting layered onto it like corporate tax cuts, capital gains, would you still support it? And if it reached your desk at a higher number, would you sign it?

MR. BUSH. As you know I shy away from hypotheticals. I am going to resist the Christmas-tree effect of tax policy. I don't want people putting ornaments on my plan. I have made it clear to the business interests that the best tax policy is one that reduces the taxes on the people. And I hope they listen to me and I hope they help me get the tax plan through that I have proposed. And the reason I feel so strongly about that is one, a marginal cut will help the economy. Secondly, I am deeply concerned about high energy prices and their effect on the working people in the country. I am concerned about consumer debt. I know there's a lot of talk in Washington about paying down the national debt. And that's fine and good and our budget will do so. But I am very concerned about the fact that a lot of consumers in our country have got high consumer debt. And I believe we need to share some of their money with them so they can help manage their own personal finances. And I will resist the temptation by folks to pile on their pet projects onto our tax cut.

Q. But if they do pile on?

MR. BUSH. Well, first of all, I'm not willing to admit defeat right here, before I've begun to fight or persuade -- let me put it to you that way. I think I've got a pretty good case and I think that many of the business interests will hear that case.

Relations With Latin America

Q. Mr. President.

MR. BUSH. Yes, sir.

Q. You've shown a lot of interest in Latin America issues.

MR. BUSH. Si.

Q. I have a double question for you. The first one has to do with Colombia. You've got a big meeting on Tuesday with Colombian President Andres Pastrana and a lot of people are still worried about the implications of Plan Colombia, which your predecessor set in motion about possible future military involvement of the United States. I want to know your impressions of Plan Colombia. And my second question has to do with the free trade agreement. You're going to be going to Quebec in April. Are you going to ask for fast-track approval so this thing can get going again, because it's been kind of dormant lately?

MR. BUSH. I appreciate that question. I'd love to have fast-track approval. I think it's going to be important to work with our neighbors to the south and Canada to the north to promote free trade throughout the hemisphere. I spoke to the prime minister of Canada this morning and that subject came up about the summit -- upcoming summit. And so we're going to begin the process in Congress of Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick the United States trade representative will be working with members of Congress to lay the groundwork for the ability for the president to have what they call fast-track negotiating authority. Secondly, I look forward to meeting with President Pastrana. I'm looking forward to the briefing that he'll be bringing from Colombia. And I, too, am worried about ever committing the United States military to an engagement in that part of the world. I know we're training and that's fine. But the mission ought to be limited to just that. And so I share the concern of those who are worried that at some point in time the United States might become militarily engaged. Now, in terms of the success of the mission, the president's going to bring me his firsthand account of what's taking place in the country. I am concerned about the amount of acreage in cultivation of -- for the growth of coca leaves. We've got to do a better job of working with the Colombia government on its eradication program. I had a long talk about the Andes with President Vicente Fox of Mexico . I'm convinced President Fox will be a stabilizing influence for that part of the world. Fortunately, I've got a good relationship so that he will share with me his insights as things develop. He has had meetings with Mr. Pastrana, Mr. Chavez Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela and I believe Vicente Fox is going to be a stabilizing influence and a positive influence in the Andes.

Q. Mr. President, on Iraq, what is your understanding of the Chinese presence in Iraq, especially with regard to constructing military facilities? And do you see anything that you see as a violation of U.N. sanctions?

MR. BUSH. Well, we're concerned about Chinese presence in Iraq. And my administration is sending the appropriate response to the Chinese. Yes, it's troubling that they would be involved in helping Iraq develop a system that will endanger our pilots.

Q. And that is what they're doing sir? You think ----

MR. BUSH. Well, we think that may be the case. Let me just tell you this: It's risen to the level where we're going to send a message to the Chinese.

Q. Mr. President, I know you want to move forward on this question of pardons.

MR. BUSH. Correct.

Q. But when you campaigned you talked about the legacy of the 60's, where leaders didn't stand up and take their moral role and say something's been done wrong here. You want to move forward but on the question of these pardons do you feel there's any moral obligation in terms of your office to stand up and say to those who may be watching this say, look, something has been done wrong here?

MR. BUSH. I think the press corps will ferret out any wrongdoing. My job is to assure the American people that this administration will have the highest ethical standards and we're going to move forward. The president made decisions he made and I've made the decision in this White House to move forward and we will.

Q. President Bush, given the questions that are being raised about the involvement of Senator Hillary Clinton's brother in the pardons process, what kind of guidance would you give members of your own politically active family in not only seeking pardons but seeking any other influence on any other issues with your administration?

MR. BUSH. My guidance to them is behave yourself, and they will.

Q. Mr. President, to follow up on your answer on the tax question, perhaps looking at it through the other way, some people are saying that perhaps it's too large a tax cut and that ----

MR. BUSH. Some are saying it's too small, some are saying it's too large and I'm saying it's just right.

Q. But are you willing ----

MR. BUSH. I interrupted him.

Q. You were not willing to be flexible in terms of people who want to increase the size. Are you willing to be flexible with people who want to lower the size of your tax cut?

MR. BUSH. I think it's just right. We've thought long and hard about the right number. This is a well-planned-out tax relief package that addresses the concerns of working Americans. It is needed, it is necessary, it'll make a very positive difference in the lives of people who pay taxes. And our country can afford it. There is a choice we have to make: Once we meet priorities, do we increase the size of the government or do we increase the amount of money in the pockets of the people who are working for a living? It is the right size and it the right time for tax relief in the country.

Q. Mr. President, on that same subject, your tax and budget package, how can you be sure that as you put it there'll be money left over? All it would take would be a less than one percentage point drop in productivity for that out-year surplus to dwindle or maybe even vanish. And also nobody, including Alan Greenspan, thinks that it would provide much of a current stimulus.

MR. BUSH. First of all, I think given the choice between increasing the baselines of the budget, the extent to which it had been increased in the past, and passing money back to the people, I think Mr. Greenspan -- not to put words in his mouth -- but it seems like -- why don't I just put some words in his mouth -- it seems like what he said in his testimony is he'd rather see tax relief rather than increasing the size of the budgets beyond the needs of the country.
Now secondly, I believe we can do a heck of a lot better in growing our economy than the basic assumptions in the 10-year plan. I believe that good monetary policy, good fiscal policy, good regulatory policy, good trade policy will enable our economy to grow beyond the scope that is envisioned in the current budget projections.
Secondly, I believe as well that if we don't pass some of the money back to the people that pay the bills, it is going to be spent. And I worry about a bloated federal government serving as a drag on economic growth.

Relations With Europe

Q. You have a meeting with Prime Minister Blair tomorrow ----

MR. BUSH. Correct.

Q. There are some concerns in this country about the European plan for what they call the rapid reaction force, their own military capability. What will you tell Prime Minister Blair about the American attitude to this rapid reaction force?

MR. BUSH. I first look forward to the visit. I'm anxious to meet the prime minister. We've had a couple of good conversations on the telephone. I'm thankful that he's coming across the -- actually coming down from Canada -- but coming across the sea to visit us. Laura and I are looking forward to having a private dinner with he and Mrs. Blair Friday night. We'll be having a press availability after our meeting and ----

Q. unintelligible

MR. BUSH. Well, why don't we wait until after he and I visit, so I don't have to give the same answer twice.

Q. But just on the outline of the question of the European defense ----

MR. BUSH. You bet. I understand. You're trying to get me to tell you the answer twice. But Britain and the United States have got a special relationship. We'll keep it that way. I look forward to talking to the prime minister about the importance of NATO. It is -- anyway, let me visit with him first and I promise to call upon you tomorrow. Nice try.

Q. You've talked a lot about areas of the budget that are going to increase: education, today you talked about Medicare, you talked before a little bit about defense. You haven't talked much about the areas where to come in with a budget that's going to be responsible you'll have to do some cuts.

MR. BUSH. Yes.

Q. Where might we see you take the red pen to the budget?

MR. BUSH. Let me remind you and the people who are listening that accounting in Washington's a little different than the way normal -- I shouldn't say normal people -- the average person accounts. This is a town where if you don't increase the budget by an expected number, it's considered a cut.
We are going to slow the rate of growth of the budget down. It should come as no surprise to anybody that my budget is going to say loud and clear that the rate of growth of the budget, for example, from last year was excessive. And so we'll be slowing the rate of growth of the budgets down. And that evidently is a cut. In my parlance it's not a cut. When you increase spending is not a cut.
I will be glad to explain some of the slowdowns and some of the increases and perhaps a decrease or two after we put the budget out. Let me submit it to you, let me submit it on Tuesday and then I'll be glad to answer your questions. Thank you for this. I look forward to this -- I look forward to future press conferences.

Q. unintelligible

MR. BUSH. Well, yes, of course. Oh, you don't want to see me once a week. You'll run out of questions. Oh, twice. I'll be running out of ties. Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Sun Revises Its Estimates Downward

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems said yesterday that many of its large customers had sharply cut back on investments in computer equipment, making it likely that it will fall well short of projected sales and earnings in the current quarter.
 "We are gaining market share," said Ed Zander, the president and chief operating officer of Sun. "We're disappointed in one and only one thing -- the U.S. economy." 
 Sun said that it now expected revenues to grow 10 percent to 13 percent in the current quarter, down from 35 percent a year ago and a previous projection of at least 20 percent for the current quarter. The expected squeeze on its profitability is likely to result in earnings of 7 cents to 9 cents a share, at least 40 percent lower than the 15 cents a share that had been the consensus of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
The warning came after a rocky day of trading for technology stocks on Wall Street following an announcement yesterday morning from EMC, the leading vendor of large data storage systems, that its growth this year might be slower than previously expected. Coming after a more pointed warning to lower earnings projections late Wednesday from Brocade Communications Systems, a leading supplier of networking equipment for storage systems, EMC's uncharacteristically cautious note helped send storage stocks sharply lower.
EMC was one of the most heavily traded stocks on the Big Board yesterday, falling $2.60, to $40.35. Its shares are down 47 percent this month. Brocade fell $2.75, to $41.94, on the Nasdaq.
The selling pressure also hit Veritas Software, a leading vendor of software that manages storage systems, even though Veritas announced strong quarterly earnings Wednesday and raised its projections for the year. Its shares fell $6.88, to $65.50.
Sun's shares rose $1.19, to $20.81, in trading on the Nasdaq yesterday before the company's cautionary conference call with analysts. Investors initial reaction to the news was negative, and Sun tumbled as low as $18.81 in after-hours trading, falling below the 52-week low of $19.88 the company had touched on Wednesday.
Sun painted a picture of its customers' senior managers as nearly paralyzed with uncertainty about the direction of the United States economy. "Anything to do with capital spending is being slowed down," said Thomas Lehman, Sun's chief financial officer.
EMC said that major customers continued to plan on spending heavily but it fretted that such decisions seemed perilously close to being delayed.
"It points out how important it now is for these companies that Europe and Asia continue to be strong," said H. Clinton Vaughan, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco. "But you have to ask how likely that is if the U.S. economy weakens."
Michael Lehman, chief financial officer of Sun, said that Sun would cut back on hiring and administrative expenses to try to raise profits but he said that the company intended to continue investing heavily in research and development. He also announced that Sun would buy back $1.5 billion worth of stock, asserting that the company was undervalued at current prices.
Sun and the storage companies still expect to grow at rates that would be the envy of most other businesses. Sun projected that revenues would grow anywhere from 20 percent to 35 percent this year. Noting that the company last year passed I.B.M. to become the largest vendor of server computers, according to recently published research by Dataquest, Sun executives said that the company's competitive position in server markets would be even stronger as this year progressed. Sun is scheduled to roll out long-awaited upgrades to several computer lines this year and expects the chip shortages that are crimping sales of recently upgraded products to ease by this summer.
Sun singled out storage as an area where its sales have been weak. But the better barometer of the outlook in the storage sector is EMC. And the reaction to EMC's guidance yesterday showed how little confidence many investors now have in the argument of companies that specialize in storage -- heartily endorsed by many analysts until this month -- that their products are so essential to information managers that storage stocks are a relatively safe haven.
"They've taken away the illusion that any area is immune," said Andrew J. Neff, who follows EMC and its rivals for Bear, Stearns. 
EMC said that sales have already slowed to dot-com ventures and other companies having trouble raising capital.
EMC said that its ability to compensate by increasing sales to the big businesses that account for a vast majority of its market could be hurt if corporate managers listen to predictions by "pundits" that the economic slowdown will worsen. That could lead those customers to delay or cancel investments, EMC said, making the slowdown a "self-fulfilling prophecy." 
EMC's guidance was couched in upbeat trappings. "Thus far in the first quarter of 2001, global demand for EMC's information storage systems, software and services is strong," the company said in a statement yesterday morning, making it clear it was not about to issue a rare quarterly earnings warning. The statement also said that EMC, which is based in Hopkinton, Mass., "continues to march toward its revenue goal of $12 billion in 2001." 
Having thus cleared its throat, EMC finally got around to its real mission of telling Wall Street that a 35 percent growth rate, which would work out to more than $12 billion in sales, now represents its most optimistic projection for the year. The 33 percent to 38 percent growth projection the company put out with earnings last month has now shifted to 25 percent to 35 percent growth. At the low end, the result would be $11 billion in revenues and substantially lower profits than analysts' current estimates. 
Thomas Kraemer, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch, called the message "mixed or at least unclear." But any sort of caution from EMC, which has not specifically warned analysts to lower estimates since 1995, was viewed as a novel development.

HEADLINE: Screwdriver Scholars And Pencil Punditry 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
After decades of languishing in obscurity, the zipper finally got its lucky break in 1921. That year, an engineer at the B. F. Goodrich Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, decided to attach the metal contraption to a pair of rubber galoshes. The result was the popular Goodrich Zipper Boot, and its so-called hookless fastener went on to trounce the button and the snap.
 Life without it seems inconceivable now. But for a good deal of the zipper's existence the success of the device was far from assured. "It was very much a superfluous invention," said Robert Friedel, a historian at the Uni versity of Maryland at College Park. "It didn't do anything you couldn't do more simply and cheaply with buttons, hooks and eyes or snaps. It took 20 years to invent the zipper -- to make the thing work. It took an additional 20 years to get anyone to buy it. And 40 years is a very long gestation period for a thing this trivial." 
 Decidedly trivial, the zipper seems hardly worth thinking deeply about. But society's low-status objects have become scholarship's hot properties. On campus, objects -- the more banal the better -- are in. 
Across the humanities, in fields like art, architecture, history and even English, a growing number of experts are turning to things in an effort to better understand the past. In addition to Mr. Friedel's "Zipper: An Exploration in Novelty" (W. W. Norton, 1994)," which records the fastener's unlikely ascent to wardrobe mainstay, the last few years have seen scholarly accounts of such ordinary artifacts as the pencil, the book, the chair, the screwdriver and the mirror, not to mention such basic foodstuffs as coffee, sugar and chocolate. 
The academic name for the stuff of everyday life is material culture. The concept itself is not new. It first came to prominence in the 1970's in the work of the French historian Fernand Braudel, whose path-breaking approach to such subjects as the rise of capitalism combined an analysis of large-scale forces like geography and the environment with detailed accounts of daily life for various social classes.
Until recently, however, material culture was largely the province of folklorists and museum curators. Over the last decade the field has gone mainstream. The University of Delaware now has a Center for American Material Culture Studies. Scholars in Yale University's material culture study group meet once a week. Critical Inquiry, a top scholarly journal, is publishing a special issue on things this fall, with essay topics ranging from Renaissance gloves to aluminum in Fascist Italy.
"The field of material culture is breaking out into the world of historians more generally," said Leora Auslander, a professor at the University of Chicago and the author of "Taste and Power: Furnishing Modern France" (University of California Press, 1996), a history of French furniture from 1720 to 1920.
Experts offer various reasons for academe's current object obsession. Some stress a discipline-wide turn away from production, the main focus of historians since Marx, to consumption. "So much of the literature on change in the 18th and 19th centuries had been focused on revolutions in production, on factories and machines," Mr. Friedel said. "We're realizing there had to be a revolution in consumption at the same time." 
Others stress the influence of several decades' worth of social history, with its emphasis on ordinary people. "In the 1950's and 1960's, culture typically meant high culture," said Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom, a professor of history at Indiana University and the acting editor of the American Historical Review, a leading journal in the field. "Now people are interested in culture again, and everyday objects becomes a way of combining an interest in culture with doing history from the bottom up."
Then there is the impact of the Internet. Witold Rybczynski, a professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of "One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw" (Scribner, 2000), speculates that "electronic innovations make other things we use -- like screwdrivers -- seem historical." When you spend the day in virtual space, he points out, even books and chairs can begin to seem like artifacts from antiquity.
But scholars agree about one thing: objects tell us things people can't. "If you want to get something of the atmosphere and the mood of a time, it's through the everyday trivia rather than the pompous reflections of historians looking back or government edicts," said Martin Andrews, deputy director of the two-year-old Center for Ephemera Studies at the University of Reading in England, where researchers study disposable printed matter.
Last year the center published the first "Encyclopedia of Ephemera" (Routledge), which contains more than 400 thumbnail histories of throwaway items, including air-sickness bags, lavatory paper and garment labels. "We're interested in people's wastebaskets as much as anything else," Mr. Andrews said.
Objects also tell us things that people won't. "When people are engaged with objects -- whether making them or using them -- they're only semiconscious," she said. "It's true of every last object. People say things through them without meaning to." She said that by looking at someone's furnishings, for example, a historian could tell whether the person once belonged to a different social class -- a fact that an aspiring social climber might take pains to hide. 
Ms. Auslander's current project concerns the role of objects in turning monarchists into republicans in revolutionary America, England and France. "You can use language and rational arguments to change people's minds," she said. "But in order to change how they feel, you need to use objects. You make them cease loving the king and have faith in fellow citizens by creating new symbols and rituals." In the Colonies, she said, the use of coarse homespun wool was heavily promoted by the local authorities as a symbol of republican self-reliance and austerity (in contrast to the British monarchy's penchant for luxury).
Other object scholars make a similar argument: many everyday items on which people have come to depend serve not just practical needs but also social and political ones. 
The chair? It may have evolved in the West as a way of indicating rank -- kings were early users -- but according to Galen Cranz, a professor of architecture at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "The Chair: Rethinking Culture, Body and Design" (W. W. Norton, 1998), among its values today is its function as a "sedative to create a docile population not inclined to criticize or become politically active." The verb sedate, Ms. Cranz's points out, comes from the Latin "to sit." Besides, she adds, chair sitting is bad for your spine.
The zipper? It was the embodiment of mechanized modernity, Mr. Friedel said in his book. And for that reason, it nearly failed. For many years the zipper was mainly a barometer of ambivalence about a fully automated world -- especially when it came to intimate matters like dress. The machine-run dystopia of Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel "Brave New World," Mr. Friedel pointed out, is littered with zippers -- from zippyjamas to zippicamiknicks. "To Huxley," Mr. Friedel wrote, "there was nothing at all natural about zippers, and that is just why they are such a powerful yet subtle symbol throughout his novel." 
To scholars of material culture, objects are never neutral. Instead, they are teeming with social and political meanings. As a result, it can be tempting to exaggerate an object's historical importance.
"Monocausality is a disease that very good historians fall prey to," said Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton University. "We call it 'the chapter in which you show that whatever you're writing about caused the French Revolution.' "
While the 19th-century French historian Jules Michelet may have been guilty of that offense -- he singled out coffee as a culprit in the French Revolution (cafe society stimulated revolutionary ardor), contemporary object scholars tend to be more circumspect. 
Thus while the German historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch links the advent of the light bulb to the beginning of corporate capitalism in his history of electricity, "Disenchanted Night" (University of California Press, 1988), he is careful not to hold one development responsible for the other, suggesting instead that they mirrored each other. "The concentration and centralization of energy in high-capacity power stations corresponded to the concentration of economic power in the big banks," he wrote.
Likewise, Lenin and Henry David Thoreau make appearances in "The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1989). But the book's author, Henry Petroski, a professor of civil engineering at Duke University, does not claim that the pencil played any role in the development of Soviet Communism or transcendentalism. Lenin allowed the American entrepreneur Armand Hammer to open Russia's first pencil plant in the 1920's, and Thoreau made a crucial contribution to the struggling domestic pencil industry in the late 1830's. Determined to make his father's pencil factory more competitive with its European rivals, young Thoreau did some research in the Harvard library, where he reportedly stumbled across a German pencil-making formula in an encyclopedia entry. After a little experimentation, Mr. Petroski wrote, John Thoreau & Company was soon producing the "best pencil in America," one that could hold its own in the international market. 
Mr. Petroski's investigation of the pencil convinced him of the value of object studies. "There is no end of common objects whose close scrutiny rewards us with an understanding of the rest of the world as well," he said at the end of his book. (He went on to write a history of the book and the bookshelf.)
Colleagues were more skeptical. Even among everyday objects, the pencil seemed especially trivial. But Mr. Petroski knew of an 1868 essay by the British naturalist Thomas Huxley, Aldous Huxley's grandfather, about a piece of chalk.
"The man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which every carpenter carries about in his breeches-pocket," Huxley wrote, will understand the world better than "the most learned student who is deep-read in the records of humanity." For Mr. Petroski, these were encouraging words. "When people said, 'Can you really write a whole book just about a pencil?' I said, 'Well, Huxley did it for a piece of chalk.' "

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, With Earnest Orations

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
If the economy really is headed downward, as so many people say, Mary Stuart Masterson's new drama series, "Kate Brasher," is ahead of the curve. From the looks of the first episode (tonight on CBS), the show is all about hard times.
 The title character, played by Ms. Masterson with her usual no-nonsense charm, is a struggling, eviction-threatened single mother of two. As another character points out, and not sympathetically, she is "trying to raise two teenage boys in the Santa Monica school district on minimum-wage jobs." By day she's the spunkiest waitress at the diner. By night she works at a bar and is part of the all-female cleaning team at a bowling alley. But the man at the bowling alley refuses to pay his workers, and a funny thing happens when Kate goes to a community action center to look for free legal help: she proves herself a natural at social work. Finally, a career break! 
 Let's be thankful for small blessings. "Kate Brasher" has an appealing cast and doesn't insult viewers' intelligence most of the time. But the main characters -- who are 100 percent good and face off against people who are 100 percent bad -- always seem to be making self-righteous speeches. "With or without you, I'm going to keep my place -- in Fantasy Land," Kate tells the center's director (Hector Elizondo), who has accused her of unrealistic expectations. "Because my boys deserve the best education humanly possible. Period." To the man at the bowling alley, she announces: "You count on people like us to be too scared to stand up to people like you. But you know what? You counted wrong. Maybe you didn't know this, but slavery is illegal in the United States of America." 
There's nothing wrong with inspiring little speeches that make audiences cheer. It was always a pleasure to see Dixie Carter get carried away with one of hers on "Designing Women." But the speeches have to say something in a fresh way, and even Ms. Carter's orations got old once the show's writers became so self-conscious about them. 
"Kate Brasher" is trying too hard. (1) To be quirky. When Kate needs guidance, she opens the Bible to a random page, hoping for a message. (2) To create a noisy "E.R."-ish atmosphere of hustle, bustle, chaos and crisis at the community center. (3) To be simultaneously uplifting and cynical. Mr. Elizondo talks about a "random universe" (Ms. Masterson, of course, disagrees) and asks, "Where was the Big Guy?" when a 15-year-old was killed. If the characters are debating theology on the day they meet, where will they go from here?
Rhea Perlman's character, a lawyer just admitted to the bar after 16 years of school, earning a living and child-rearing combined, has possibilities. At least when she addresses an unpleasant character with a spur-of-the-moment nickname (as in "Look, Barbie, this is us making an appointment") in her best Carla Tortelli snarl, it seems to come from the heart.

HEADLINE: Most Colleges Are Expected To Continue to Use the SAT 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
As the University of California weighs a recommendation by its president to drop the SAT's as an admissions requirement, the vast majority of the nation's highly selective institutions, as well as other large public universities, are expected to rely on the tests for the foreseeable future.
 The proposal last Friday by the president of the California system, which has such flagship campuses as Berkeley and U.C.L.A. and gives out one of every 50 American bachelor's degrees yearly, has added fresh fuel to the decades-old debate within admissions offices over the merits of the SAT's. But interviews in recent days with administrators from half a dozen other colleges and universities suggest that there may be no other institution that will immediately follow California's lead. 
 "I'm not ready to throw out the SAT," said Jack Blackburn, the dean of undergraduate admissions at the University of Virginia since 1985. "I think it's a very good test. It's been given to millions of people. If used properly, it provides a good piece of information about an applicant. 
"I think the bad stories come from places that don't know how to use it."
All of the university officials interviewed, from Harvard to Stanford, and from the University of Michigan to the University of Texas at San Antonio, said they continued to regard the SAT's as the best instrument available for establishing a common national yardstick, one that allows them to compare, say, an A-student from an underfinanced high school in a rural state with an A-student in a top-flight suburban school. 
The officials cautioned that most institutions weigh the SAT differently in different situations, depending, for example, on whether the applicant is the son of an accomplished lawyer or the son of parents who never completed high school, and whether one applicant is white and another black. 
At the same time they echoed the concerns of the president of the California system, Dr. Richard C. Atkinson, about the tests' shortcomings and about the ways that the SAT's have come to dominate the lives of so many American teenagers, who often view them as nothing less than a barometer of their own potential. 
All of the officials acknowledged that the scores on the SAT I, an aptitude test (the SAT II's is an achievement text tied more closely to course work), and the ACT, a similar standardized exam, often reveal more about students' family lives, socio-economic station and school quality than about their prospects for succeeding in four years of college and beyond. But over all they said they planned to continue to consult the SAT scores.
"It's the only standard factor in every student's application," said Robin Mamlet, the dean of admission and financial aid at Stanford University since September. "But we're also aware that students from different kinds of backgrounds score very differently."
Ms. Mamlet added: "One of the things Atkinson's saying is that they're going to move to a more holistic approach. But most of the nation's really selective institutions have mastered giving a holistic approach to their admissions, while still using the SAT. It's not a dichotomy."
If the University of California system does make the SAT's optional, it would become, by far, the largest institution on a small list of defectors that includes Bates, Bowdoin and Mount Holyoke Colleges.
But California's timetable in abandoning the SAT would be drawn out. If Dr. Atkinson can persuade the faculty senate and the Board of Regents to adopt his proposal, it would not take effect until 2003 at the earliest; the full impact of the proposal, if implemented, will not be known for years.
"We are caught up in the educational equivalent of a nuclear arms race," Dr. Atkinson said in a speech last weekend. "We know that this overemphasis on test scores hurts all involved, especially students. But we also know that anyone or any institution opting out of the competition does so at considerable risk."
In taking the first step down that path, the California system is responding to immense outside political pressures. In 1996, the state's voters banned the consideration of race and ethnicity in determining college admission. Doing away with the SAT's as a requirement would eliminate a measurement on which the performances of black and Hispanic students have trailed significantly behind white and Asian students.
In 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit barred the consideration of race in university admissions in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Like California, Texas now guarantees a seat in the University of Texas system to all students who are ranked at a particular level in their high school class, regardless of SAT scores.
But Ricardo Romo, the president of the University of Texas at San Antonio, said he did not expect the Regents of the University of Texas system to move any time soon to drop the SAT's at any of its campuses as a way of further complying with the federal ruling.
"There's a significant number of people out there -- they're parents, they're ministers, they're business people -- who have bought into the SAT," Mr. Romo said. "They believe it is very good currency. For you to say we're not going to use this currency any more, it would come as a shock."
Nonetheless, Mr. Romo said the California proposal was already receiving serious scrutiny on his campus, and others in the Texas system.
"Atkinson's sort of landed on the moon," Mr. Romo said. "The rest of us are looking at the opportunities of space exploration."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Tumble, Then Regain Some Ground

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rebounded slightly yesterday after a suggestion of an imminent cut in interest rates gave hope to investors who are dismayed by the continuation of corporate earnings warnings.
 Other stock market gauges declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a low during the day of 1,215,44, a drop of more than 20 percent from last year's highs. 
 The major market gauges were down sharply in the morning but turned around in the afternoon after Wayne D. Angell, the chief economist of Bear, Stearns and a former Federal Reserve governor, said there was a 60 percent chance that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point as early as next week. He had previously maintained there was a 40 percent chance. 
For much of yesterday, though, the market was hurt by companies that warned of reduced profits. Both Sun Microsystems and Motorola warned of lower-than-expected profits and both stocks initially fell sharply, although Sun recovered to close unchanged at $20.81. Motorola, however, ended down $1.04, at $16.25.
The technology selling put early pressure on the Nasdaq composite index, which fell as much as 88 points. It recovered to close up 17.55 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,262.51.
The S.& P. 500 index fell 6.96 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,245.86, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined 84.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,441.90 after falling more than 300 points earlier.
With yesterday's decline, the S.& P. 500 is down 18.4 percent from its closing high in March 2000, just shy of a 20 percent loss that would signify to some market analysts that a bear market had begun. In contrast, the Nasdaq is down 55.2 percent from its record closing high, also reached in March 2000.
Weighing on the Dow, as well as the technology sector, was a sharp drop in I.B.M., which fell $4.90, to $104. Investors retreated from I.B.M. after John B. Jones Jr., an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, lowered his earnings forecast for the company because spending on information technology in the United States "is clearly soft."
In addition to heeding profit warnings, market strategists have been waiting for the Federal Reserve to act on interest rates.
Economists have been expecting the Fed's policy makers to reduce interest rates further at their regular meeting on March 20 after making two cuts totaling one percentage point in January. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rally
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices surged yesterday, driving yields on two-year notes close to their lowest level since January 1999, as further turmoil in stock markets stirred investor hopes for aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the near future.
With major stock indexes having losses nearly every day in the last week, investors have parked funds in shorter-term Treasuries, sending those yields, which move opposite to price, much lower compared with long-term bonds.
"With the Dow and Nasdaq down this much, there's nowhere else to go except the Treasury market," said Don Kowalchik, fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons.
Even a late-day recovery in technology shares was not enough to take the allure off short-term Treasuries.
The price of the two-year Treasury note rose 4/32 , to 100 6/32 . The note's yield fell to 4.53 percent.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 , to a price of 99 9/32 . Its yield fell to 5.09 percent from 5.16 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32 , to 98 16/32 . The bond's yield fell to 5.48 percent from 5.53 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Budget Office's Estimates For Drug Spending Grow 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office has sharply increased its estimates of spending on prescription drugs for the elderly, revisions that will make it more difficult for Congress to pay for drug benefits under Medicare.
 The new estimates, about one-third higher than those made last May, reflect new information about drugs that are in the pipeline and likely to come into use in the next decade. 
 The budget office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, presented its new estimates to Congressional aides on Thursday and today.
Prescription drugs were hotly debated in campaigns for the White House and Congress last year. George W. Bush promised to add drug benefits to Medicare as part of an effort to overhaul the program, which provides care to people who are elderly or disabled. 
A Republican analyzing proposals for Medicare drug benefits said, "Everything just got a lot more expensive." A Democrat said some of his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill were "in shock" over the new numbers.
One-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries have no insurance to pay for prescription drugs outside the hospital. The number of beneficiaries is expected to reach 47 million in 2011, just as the first baby boomers turn 65.
The Congressional Budget Office is the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its work is widely respected by experts outside the government. Even if its estimates are wrong, they are binding on Congress, which generally must find ways to pay the costs of legislation as estimated by the budget office.
In May 2000, the budget office predicted that spending from all sources on prescription drugs for the elderly would total $1.1 trillion in the decade from 2001 to 2010. Updating its estimates this week, the budget office said such spending would total nearly $1.5 trillion from 2002 to 2011.
The difference between the old and new estimates widens each year. The budget office now says that drug spending in 2001 for people on Medicare will total $70.6 billion, which is 7 percent more than the earlier estimate for the same year. The new estimate for 2010 -- $205 billion -- is 23 percent higher than the old figure for that year.
Economists said that Medicare coverage of prescription drugs would create some additional demand, as the government would help purchase drugs for millions of people who now have no insurance to cover such costs. But federal officials have said they will seek ways to restrain costs and to prevent excessive or inappropriate use of drugs.
Last year the budget office predicted that drug spending for the elderly would rise an average of 11 percent a year over the next decade. Now, it says, the growth will average 12 percent to 13 percent a year.
These numbers have major implications for Congress as it tries to devise drug benefits for the elderly and the disabled.
If Congress decided to spend a specific amount on Medicare drug coverage -- say, $40 billion in the next five years -- the benefits would seem less generous because the money would cover less of the costs actually incurred by the elderly.
Conversely, the government would have to spend more, or charge beneficiaries more, for coverage deemed adequate by the elderly. As premiums rise, economists say, fewer people will enroll, and those who do will expect to have high drug expenses.
In the campaign, Mr. Bush said the government should pay any drug costs exceeding $6,000 a year for a Medicare beneficiary. Under the new estimates, more beneficiaries would incur such costs and would therefore qualify for "catastrophic coverage."
Drug companies are feverishly developing drugs to prevent, treat or cure ailments of the elderly including heart disease, cancer and stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis and arthritis. 
The new drugs often enter the market at prices much higher than the prices charged for the drugs they replace. A few drug products now cost more than $10,000 a year, and the number may grow as scientists exploit genetics to tailor drugs to the needs of individual patients. 
In recent years, spending on prescription drugs has grown faster than any other category of personal health spending. The Food and Drug Administration has reduced the time needed to approve new drugs, and federal officials say that advertising has stimulated demand for many medicines.
The Congressional Budget Office said spending on prescription drugs averaged $1,525 for each Medicare beneficiary in 2000, and it estimated that the average would triple by 2011, reflecting higher prices and the greater use of prescription drugs by the elderly.
The Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, is also preparing new spending estimates, which are expected to show higher rates of growth than it anticipated last year.
Congressional aides said the new estimates reflected more up-to-date information about drug spending in recent years, as well as fresh projections of spending in the future. 
The figures on recent drug spending were derived from government surveys of Medicare beneficiaries and from commercial sources of data like IMS Health of Westport, Conn., which collects data from pharmacies across the country.
Elderly people have repeatedly told Congress that they need help paying for prescription drugs. While acutely aware of these needs, some members of Congress are also skittish about the costs.
Lawmakers recall the political fiasco after Congress expanded Medicare in 1988 to cover catastrophic illnesses and prescription drugs. Official estimates of drug spending rose within months after the law was enacted. The extra coverage was partly financed by a surtax on the elderly, many of whom concluded that the extra benefits were not worth the added cost. Congress repealed the law a year later.

HEADLINE: For Parents, One Size Doesn't Fit All in Bilingual Education 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Yuliya Kovardinskaya remembers being thrown into an 11th-grade classroom when she arrived from Ukraine 10 years ago and not understanding much of what she was taught. In this sink-or-swim environment, she swam. By 12th grade, she had moved from an English as a second language program, or E.S.L., to a regular classroom.
 So when she sent her 5-year-old son to school last September, she shunned a bilingual program, in which instruction is initially given mostly in the native language, in favor of E.S.L. classes, where teachers instruct immigrants in English. 
 "You have to be with the people who speak English to speak the language," Ms. Kovardinskaya, 25, said. 
Yet Sandra Almanzar had a different experience as a schoolgirl and chose a different path for her daughter. When Ms. Almanzar came from the Dominican Republic, she said, she thrived in a bilingual program and moved within a year to regular classes. Ms. Almanzar, 32, has enrolled her 6-year-old daughter in a dual language program where subjects are taught in English one day and Spanish the next.
"It'll benefit her, and I also want her to keep up with Spanish," she said.
Among immigrant groups, views about the programs that are meant to ease their children's transition into English can be as mixed as a parent's own memories of learning English for the first time. Some groups of parents, like the emigres from the former Soviet Union, seem overwhelmingly to reject bilingual education, while staunch supporters can be found among other groups -- parents from Haiti and the Dominican Republic, for example.
But parents' opinions seem more often shaped by intensely personal factors rather than by any collective attitude. Often, their decisions have to do with things like how often they fly back to the home country, whether the child will be baby-sat by his non-English-speaking grandmother and whether the child will pick up the bilingual teacher's foreign accent when speaking English.
The views of parents will acquire new importance under a proposal by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy that comes before the Board of Education for a vote next Tuesday. The chancellor is asking that parents, not administrators, decide in which language program to place students who are not proficient in English.
For some parents, loyalty to the native language results from proximity to the home country.
Ms. Almanzar said her daughter's ability to talk with non-English-speaking relatives back home was paramount.
"I go back and forth to my country, and I want her to be able to communicate with my family," she said.
By contrast, the rejection of bilingual programs among Russian parents sometimes reflects a more total severing of ties -- relatives and friends have also moved here -- or even a deeper rejection of the native country.
Among Russian Jews, said Vladimir Epshteyn, president of the Metropolitan Russian-American Parents Association, "Some parents say, 'Why keep the language of the country that gave us a very difficult time?' "
Sometimes, the degree to which parents want their children to assimilate is dictated by family dynamics. In Brooklyn, Yvonia Direny, 33, a native of Haiti whose 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter attend bilingual programs in Creole at Public School 6, said that for her family Creole was a necessity. Their father, who speaks mostly Creole, is able to help them with homework. Their Creole-speaking grandmother can baby-sit. 
"If my children didn't speak Creole, their grandmother wouldn't be able to take care of them," said Ms. Direny, a special education teacher's assistant.
Currently, students who test low on English skills must attend either bilingual classes offered in 12 languages or E.S.L. classes. The chancellor's proposal would allow parents to choose from two other options: a dual language program now offered in only 60 schools but expected to be expanded to 20 others, and a new accelerated version of E.S.L.
The original programs in New York City were mandated in the mid-1970's by a consent decree that resulted from a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Puerto Rican students who were experiencing high dropout rates. But, today, the Latino population is much more diverse, with Spanish speakers hailing from the Dominican Republic, Mexico and South America, and high dropout rates are attributed to factors like overcrowded classrooms rather than to language barriers.
Only about a quarter of Latino students, 26 percent, participate in bilingual and E.S.L. programs, Board of Education data shows. But most students in bilingual and E.S.L. programs, about 65 percent of a total of 160,000, are Spanish-speaking, and views among Latino parents differ sharply. A survey last year by the Hispanic Federation found that support for bilingual education had eroded among Latinos, to 47 percent of respondents from 53 percent the previous year, and that the higher the education and income of respondents the more supportive they were of an English-only education.
In interviews over the last few weeks with more than two dozen people whose children speak Spanish, Russian, Cantonese, Creole, Polish and Urdu, the parents spoke passionately about language programs for their children, many of whom are American-born but grew up speaking a foreign language at home. On one end of the spectrum, there are parents who said they felt their children could handle two languages comfortably, that doing so will benefit them in an increasingly global economy.
"The important thing is that they don't forget Spanish," said Elizabeth Cabrera, 38, whose three children -- two daughters ages 15 and 11 and a 12-year-old son -- arrived from the Dominican Republic less than two years ago and attend bilingual programs in Manhattan schools. She said the schools would teach her children "correct" Spanish much better than she could ever do herself. "The more languages they know, the more opportunities they'll have," she said.
On the other end, there are parents who expect the schools to put their children quickly on an equal footing with American students by immersing them in English. Among these is Romana Khan, a homemaker who arrived in New York eight years ago from Pakistan with her husband, a cabdriver, and who speaks Urdu to her four children. She said she wants her children to be bilingual, but not in school.
"New York is the city of immigrants, and most of them speak their native languages at home," said Ms. Khan, whose three daughters, ages 10, 8 and 5, attend P.S. 225 in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. "So when we send them to school we just say, 'Please teach English to them.' "
At Junior High School 56 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a group of nine Chinese parents, most of them recently arrived immigrants, stood solidly behind bilingual education and said their children's older age was one reason. Situ Fyang, 45, said that when she enrolled her twin sons, now 16, in school after arriving from China three years ago she worried they would end up dropping out of school because of the culture shock. The bilingual program, she said, has given the boys time to adjust to their new life.
She argued that for teenage children, unlike elementary school students, it is easier to keep up with subjects in their native language and later catch up on their English.
Patrick Fiscina, assistant principal at the junior high school, noted that keeping up with subjects is a higher priority than learning English quickly for his students because they have to pass state and city exams to advance to the next grade. (Except for the English tests, city and state exams are offered in native languages.)
"If we had put them in an English class, they would have been lost," Ms. Fyang said through a translator.
But in some school districts, parents have rejected bilingual programs en masse. In District 21 in Brooklyn, Russian immigrants have historically opted for E.S.L. programs instead of bilingual classes, said Anita Malta, executive assistant to the superintendent.
"We would form a class, and they'd say no," she said. "They were concerned about bilingual education holding their kids back."
At P.S. 225 in Brighton Beach, Ms. Kovardinskaya and other mothers said English, not history or other subjects, was what their children must master first. They said they did not want their children segregated by language in bilingual classes.
"It could affect them for life," said Wanda Komar, whose son, Eric, is a kindergartner who grew up speaking Russian and Polish. "At that age they're confused, they can't find their identity."
Officials from several Chinese community organizations said some Asian parents are concerned about the poor English skills of some bilingual teachers, nearly a third of whom are uncertified; the parents are afraid their children will learn to speak English with an accent, the officials said.
The chancellor's proposed changes, school officials said, were prompted by problems in the program -- particularly that about 10 percent of participants remain in bilingual and E.S.L. classes for seven years or more -- and complaints from parents who wanted more say. 
Board of Education studies show that among the three major language groups, 68 percent of Spanish-speaking students, 97 percent of Russian speakers and 93 percent of Chinese speakers exit bilingual programs within three years.
Among E.S.L. students, 77 percent of Spanish speakers, 85 percent of Russian speakers and 87 percent of Chinese speakers left within the same period.
The goal of the chancellor's proposed modifications, school officials said, is to develop proficiency in English in three years. Many parents, however, said that the changes do not fix underlying problems like uncertified teachers and lack of appropriate textbooks. 
"Instead of four options they should improve the system they already have," said Mirna Burgos, president of the parents' association at P.S. 132 in Washington Heights.

HEADLINE: On Eve of a Visit by Powell, Rising Unrest in the Mideast 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
On the eve of Colin L. Powell's first visit to the region as secretary of state, officials in Israel today rebuffed his pleas for an easing of the blockade of Palestinian territories, while Palestinian militants burned him in effigy.
 The actions were less a reflection of sentiments about the Bush administration than of the hostility that has gripped the area for several months now. 
 General Powell is due in Jerusalem on Saturday night and plans to visit Gaza on Sunday. He is expected to reiterate his recent calls for an end to terrorist violence and the easing of Israeli security and economic restrictions on Palestinian communities. On both fronts, the situation was deteriorating today. 
The Israeli Army closed roads in and around the Gaza Strip after a night in which homemade mortar shells were lobbed at Jewish settlements in northern Gaza. Israeli snipers opened fire on the seafront refugee camp they said was the source of the attacks, and two powerful bombs exploded in Gaza early today on roads used by Israeli Army convoys. 
Today's security clampdown in effect divided the small coastal swath of Palestinian territory in half and stepped up already strict controls on the movement of goods in and out of Gaza. Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza said they had punitively destroyed two Palestinian police posts, first with tank shells and then with armored bulldozers.
In the West Bank, Palestinians lobbed gasoline bombs at Israeli soldiers in Hebron and traded fire with Israeli forces outside Ramallah. Israeli Army checkpoints were also strengthened. 
Palestinian radio reports accused Israeli forces of shelling residential neighborhoods near Jenin, in the northern West Bank. A 21-year-old Palestinian man was killed today in a clash with Israeli troops near Bethlehem, Israeli Army radio reported. An Israeli man remained in a hospital today after a machine-gun attack on Thursday on an East Jerusalem highway intersection.
The backdrop of violence stiffened Israeli resistance to measures that might reduce the increasing economic distress in Palestinian areas, including the handover of more than $50 million in Palestinian tax revenues collected by Israel. 
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said on Thursday that the Bush administration wanted Israel to transfer the money to the Palestinian Authority, which is unable to meet payrolls and faces bankruptcy. "We do believe that the economic pressure on the Palestinians needs to be relieved," he said. 
But spokesmen for Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Prime Minister-elect Ariel Sharon said today that the continuing clashes with the Palestinians made any such transfers untenable.
"This money is used, among other things, to encourage violence and terrorism," said an official in Mr. Barak's office. "It is almost ridiculous to doubt the legitimacy of withholding these funds, when the Palestinian Authority does not fulfill even one single item of any of their agreements with us. It is their money, but it is our lives."
Ranaan Gissin, a top aide to the incoming prime minister, said Mr. Sharon had told Yasir Arafat that financial transfers would be renewed only if there was a "reciprocal response," including an end to violence. 
"There is no free lunch here," he said. "They have to meet their obligations. The Palestinian Authority owes money to the Israeli government for water, for energy, for infrastructure, so it is only reasonable that some of this would be withheld to pay for these obligations."
Palestinians contend that their problems with Israeli utilities payments are caused by Israel's economic blockade. Ahmed Qurie, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, bridled at suggestions that the transfer of Palestinian tax funds to Palestinian accounts could be construed as an Israeli concession, or even a peacemaking gesture. 
"This is a right, not a gesture," he said. "This is our money. They must release it."
General Powell, who plans to meet with Mr. Barak on Saturday night and Mr. Sharon on Sunday morning, arrives in Israel at a time of political transition and intense infighting. Now that Mr. Barak has again vowed to leave government, the Labor Party appears poised to approve Mr. Sharon's plans for a unity government at a central committee meeting on Monday. 
The top-heavy government Mr. Sharon envisions would leave out only Arab members and the leftist Meretz and secularist Shinnui parties and would feature a cabinet with a record 30 ministers, almost a fifth of the entire Parliament. Shimon Peres, a longtime fixture of Labor and unity governments, is expected to back up Mr. Sharon as either foreign or defense minister. But Labor leaders are squabbling over the allocation of other ministerial portfolios, while a faction led by Justice Minister Yossi Beilin and Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami is refusing to join Mr. Sharon's coalition.
When General Powell visits Mr. Arafat in Gaza on Sunday afternoon, the lines of authority will be clearer. But American officials express growing doubts over the Palestinian leader's control of political factions and police forces ostensibly under his command.
Palestinian and Israeli leaders say they welcome the Bush administration's policy approach to the region so far -- the Palestinians because they thought the Clinton administration was too close to Israel, and the incoming Israeli leaders because they thought the Clinton team was too close to Prime Minister Barak. 
Mr. Sharon said Thursday that he agreed with General Powell's emphasis on broader strategic concerns in the region, including the containment of Iraq, in contrast to the approach under President Clinton, when "the peace process was focused on too much, and bilateral relations suffered." 
But Mr. Qurie expressed hope today that General Powell would urge Israel to resume the peace talks that were suspended shortly before last month's prime ministerial election. 
"Negotiations must start from the point they they stopped," he said. "We believe this should be the priority of the American administration. We are not against meeting with Sharon, but not from point zero. This is impossible."
On both sides, though, lines are being drawn even more rigidly on the central and explosive issue of Jerusalem and its ancient holy sites.
In a speech here Thursday night to visitors from the Conference of Presidents Major American Jewish Organizations, Mr. Sharon urged leaders of American Jewish groups to help fight proposals for the shared control or partition of Jerusalem between Israel and an eventual Palestinian state.
"Not only can you interfere, but you have to interfere when it comes to Jerusalem," Mr. Sharon told the group. "Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, but it was promised to the Jews." 
The day before, in a move he said had been prompted by Mr. Sharon's postelection pilgrimage to the Western Wall in the Old City, the grand mufti of Jerusalem issued a fatwa, or religious edict, decreeing the wall where Jews have prayed for centuries to be an integral part of the Muslim-run Aksa Mosque complex. The fatwa was quickly endorsed by the grand mufti of Egypt, Naser Farid Wasel, who is considered a leader of politically moderate Islamic clerics in the region.
The Jerusalem grand mufti, Sheik Ikrima Sabri, said today: "This was a response to Sharon, who visited the wall immediately after his victory, to affirm that even this part of the city is ours, and that Israel controls it now by the force of arms alone. It is a religious edict, but one with a political dimension."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 24 about diplomatic maneuvering by Israelis and Palestinians on the eve of a trip to the Middle East by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell quoted incompletely from a remark about Jerusalem by Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister-elect at the time. In a speech on Feb. 22 to American Jews, Mr. Sharon prefaced the remark -- "Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, but it was promised to the Jews" -- by saying that Pope John Paul II said that to him when the two men met in 1999. The Vatican said the two had held a private conversation of which it has no record.
