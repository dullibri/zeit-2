HEADLINE: This Crisis Won't Stop Moving

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
YOU know we're in trouble when we're told that the economic problems in Greece, Portugal and Spain, the most indebted countries in the euro zone, are likely to remain safely contained in those nations. 
 After all, we heard the same nonsense in 2007 from United States financial leaders talking about the subprime mortgage mess. Both Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, rolled out to reassure concerned investors that troubles in mortgage land wouldn't permeate the rest of the economy. 
 As we all now know, mortgage woes were contained -- to planet Earth. And so it may be with overleveraged nations in Europe. 
 Simply put, contagion is a fact of life in our interconnected global economy and financial markets. And that means investors must strap in for more gyrations in the stock and bond markets as the great and painful deleveraging that began in 2007 continues around the world. 
 Sure, there are rays of light amid the gloom. The slightly upbeat jobs report on Friday, for example, is an example. But it is only one data point and not enough to move the needle on much larger issues that remain, including investor fears that Greece, Portugal and Spain will default on their debts.
 ''This is a reminder that every country has its limit,'' said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates in Toronto, one of Canada's top wealth management firms. ''And our heightened concerns over sovereign credit quality are not going to abate anytime soon.''
 During his years as chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, Mr. Rosenberg was perspicacious indeed. So his take on the potential fallout from financially stressed countries is a valued one. 
 First, Mr. Rosenberg reckons that the flight to the dollar will continue. Even though the United States has plenty of its own economic challenges -- enormous public debt weighing on a struggling economy, for example -- our lot is far better than others', he maintains. ''In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,'' he said. ''The U.S. dollar is that one-eyed man.'' 
 But that does not mean we are finished with our own debt purge.
 ''Watching the situation in Europe, it's not even clear that the root cause of problems here at home has been solved,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''We still have a very fragile situation: household balance sheets, and delinquencies, defaults and home prices are still vulnerable to another down leg. People think because you finish one chapter in this post-bubble credit collapse that the book is done.''
 As for housing prices, Mr. Rosenberg expects further declines of 10 to 15 percent over the next few years. He pointed to the roughly nine million residential housing units available for sale across the country, a very high vacancy rate when judged against a total housing stock of 130 million units.
 If his forecast is accurate, the numbers of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth will rise significantly. Mr. Rosenberg estimates that fully half of the mortgage-holding population in the country could be underwater by 2011. 
 For now, these borrowers are getting little to no help from lenders -- no surprise -- or from the government. Indeed, the Obama administration's loan modification program has more or less allowed banks that own second mortgages on troubled borrowers' homes to continue to press for full repayment of these obligations.
 When it comes to writing down principal amounts on mortgages, the government has pressured those holding the first mortgages more than the institutions holding the seconds. Never mind that the second liens are worthless and should be written down to zero.
 THIS see-no-evil approach to second mortgages is part of an overall denial on the part of policy makers, politicians, bankers and regulators that has prolonged the agony of this crisis. Owning up to reality about what loans are worth is rough medicine to take, but denying that problems exist only puts off the inevitable. 
 ''We are much further along the road to price discovery and full disclosure than Japan was at this same stage of their credit contraction,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''There are still some very significant credit problems in the U.S. and as they pertain to commercial real estate are still extremely problematic. Some banks will likely be whipped very hard.''
 The challenge for Mr. Obama is that he has thrown oodles of taxpayer money at these problems and still the unemployment rate stands at 9.7 percent. 
 ''We came off a year when you could not have asked for more government stimulus and we lost five million jobs,'' Mr. Rosenberg pointed out. ''What do you do for an encore? The deleveraging is ongoing and yet the government stimulus is largely behind us. That is problematic for an economic forecaster.''
 The fact is, to save the world from economic collapse we have transferred the liabilities of the private sector to the public. And not every country has the money to service or repay that debt. 
 ''We are in a post-bubble credit collapse and there are going to be periods of calm and stormy weather. Investors will have to navigate through the volatility,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''Unfortunately, I think we are still in the early stages. The next recession will happen more quickly than people think.''

HEADLINE: The Truth About the Deficit

 BODY:
When the White House released its new budget last week, including more spending to create desperately needed jobs, Republican leaders in Congress denounced President Obama for driving up the deficit and demanded that the Democrats halt their ''reckless'' ways. 
 The deficit numbers -- a projected $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2011 alone -- are breathtaking. What is even more breathtaking is the Republicans' cynical refusal to acknowledge that the country would never have gotten into so deep a hole if President George W. Bush and the Republican-led Congress had not spent years slashing taxes -- mainly on the wealthy -- and spending with far too little restraint. Unfortunately, the problem does not stop there.
 The Republican amnesia and posturing are playing well on the hustings, where Americans are deeply anxious about the economy and fearful of losing their jobs and homes. Far too many Democratic lawmakers are losing their nerve.
 Americans should be anxious, for reasons including the huge deficit. But the cold economic truth is this: At a time of high unemployment and fragile growth, the last thing the government should do is to slash spending. That will only drive the economy into deeper trouble. 
 None of this means that the politicians -- from either party -- are off the hook. They will soon need to make hard decisions about how to reduce the deficit. But more posturing and sniping is not going to make the economy better or solve the deficit problem. President Obama has called on the Republicans to join a bipartisan commission to help make those tough decisions, but they have been resistant to the proposal. 
 We fear the demagoguing is not going to stop, especially with Congressional elections this November. As the budget debate plays out, here are some basic facts about the deficit that Americans need to consider: 
 HOW DID WE GET HERE? When President Bush took office in 2001, the federal budget had been in the black for three years, and continued surpluses were projected for a decade to come. 
 By the time Mr. Bush left office in early 2009, the government had run big deficits for seven straight years, and the economy was on the brink of another Great Depression. On Jan. 7, 2009 -- two weeks before Mr. Obama was inaugurated -- the Congressional Budget Office issued new budget estimates showing a fiscal year 2009 deficit of well over $1 trillion.
 About half of today's huge deficits can be chalked up to Bush-era profligacy: mainly cutting taxes deeply while borrowing to wage two wars and to enact the Medicare prescription drug benefit -- all of which Republicans supported, virtually in lockstep. 
 The other half of recent deficits is due to the recession and the financial crisis. 
 To avoid a meltdown, the government -- under President Bush and President Obama -- rightly decided it had no choice but to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out banks and car companies and to stimulate the economy. That prevented a very bad situation from becoming much worse, but as the recession dragged on, hundreds of billions in tax revenues have also dried up. 
 As for why the financial system and the economy imploded, President Bush and Congress deserve much of the blame for their devotion to debt-driven growth and blind deregulatory zeal -- although on deregulation, President Clinton and his team (some of whom are back in the White House) were also complicit. 
 Were it not for those multiple calamities, budget deficits today would be negligible. That does not mean we would be off the hook. An aging population and relentlessly rising health care costs will hit the country with even deeper deficits as the baby boomers retire. Politicians need to pass health care reform now and start thinking seriously about Social Security and tax reform. 
 So what are the immediate fiscal lessons here? The first lesson is that spending without taxing is a recipe for huge deficits, and that running big deficits when the economy is expanding only sets the country up for bigger deficits when the economy contracts. The second lesson is that once a deep recession takes hold, slashing government spending is not going to solve the problem. It will only make it worse.
 WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW? Here is an unpopular but undeniable fact of life: When private sector demand is weak, the federal government must serve as the spender of last resort. Otherwise, collapsing demand sets in motion a negative, self-reinforcing spiral in which lack of demand -- for goods, services and new employees -- leads to ever deepening economic weakness. 
 That is why when the banks and the economy began to crumble in 2008, President Bush responded with a $700 billion bank bailout and a $168 billion stimulus package. When Mr. Obama took office, the banks were still shaky and the economy was still plunging-- as measured by real-life indicators like jobs, consumer spending, credit availability, home equity, retirement savings and business confidence. The new administration made the sound decision to continue the bailout and pushed a $787 billion stimulus through Congress, with very little Republican help. 
 The stimulus package slowed job losses and helped spur activity -- in the third quarter of 2009, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, and the initial fourth-quarter reading was 5.7 percent, a rebound few thought possible a year ago.
 Still, without a jobs revival to boost consumer spending and tax revenues -- and with the states facing immense budget shortfalls -- the economy is unlikely to do anything other than limp along, at best, once the effects of the stimulus fade this year. 
 In his recent budget, Mr. Obama proposed to spend $266 billion on tax credits for hiring and new job-creation investments, and on other short-term stimulus including extended unemployment compensation. That would improve on the House-passed $154 billion jobs bill. But in the Senate, Republicans are balking at the prospect of a big bill, saying they need to hold down the deficit. They have spooked the Democrats, who are now trying to negotiate what appears to be a far too modest bill in hopes of winning Republican support. 
 What they should be saying -- and what the White House should be saying a lot louder -- is that a prolonged downturn or a renewed recession would do far more damage to the budget than upfront deficit spending. In fact, a clear lesson from the Depression of the 1930s is that reducing deficits at a time of economic fragility undercuts recovery.
 SO DO WE JUST LIVE WITH THE DEFICIT? The problem must be addressed. Persistently high deficits are harmful to the economy and the country's long-run security.
 If the government must keep borrowing to make up the difference, it could drive up interest rates and force private companies to compete with the government for investors. That, in turn, would reduce economic growth and, by extension, the potential earnings -- and standard of living -- of everyone. 
 The process is generally gradual. But it could be wrenching if creditors lose confidence that the government will ever put its fiscal house in order and suddenly decide to put their money elsewhere. That could lead to a fiscal crisis, with sharp spikes in interest rates and a rapidly depreciating currency. 
 There is no question that, over the next several decades, deficits and debt in the United States are headed for dangerously high levels. But today's deficit fearmongers invariably fail to note that the impact of stimulus spending on the long-term fiscal problem is small, because the spending is temporary. 
 The real problem, which also goes unmentioned, is that dangerous deficits will accumulate over time if continuing trends and policies -- especially in health care -- persist unchanged. 
 SO HOW DO WE FIX IT? Mr. Obama's budget makes a down payment on deficit reduction by freezing some nonsecurity discretionary spending for three years, and by letting the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans expire at the end of this year. 
 To truly tame deficits will require serious health care reform, the sooner the better. Other aspects of the long-term fiscal problem -- raising taxes and retooling Social Security -- must take place in earnest as the economy recovers. 
 Contrary to popular belief, there are many well-thought-out ideas for such reforms. Where technical questions are difficult, particularly on health care costs, reformers have advocated demonstration projects that can be tested over time. Where the real difficulty lies is summoning the political will to do what must be done, even though it will be unpopular. 
 If these problems are not addressed, here is what we face: Under current policies, federal debt in the United States -- the sum total of annual deficits -- would grow from 53 percent of the size of the economy in 2009 to more than 300 percent by 2050, driven mainly by rapidly rising health care costs and, in part, by the aging of the population. Combined, those two factors exert enormous pressure on the government's biggest spending programs, Medicare and Medicaid, and, to a lesser extent, Social Security. 
 Unless health care costs are controlled, there is no way to solve the country's long-term deficit and debt problems.
 But that will not be enough. Broad tax reform is also essential to ensure that revenues keep pace with expenditures. From 1978 to 2008, revenues averaged about 18.4 percent of the economy. But without policy changes, expenditures for everything other than interest on the national debt will increase from 19.2 percent of the size of the economy in 2008 to 24.5 percent in 2050. 
 On the need for more taxes, Mr. Obama has been less than candid, pledging never to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. Republican lawmakers have been worse, calling for tax cuts at most every opportunity -- and never acknowledging that a shortfall in revenue is one of the important causes of the deficit. 
 The deficit commission that Mr. Obama intends to establish could be helpful in breaking this logjam, by calling for necessary changes that politicians would be loath to broach without political cover. 
 We hope that health care reform will move ahead before that. If it does, the commission will still have to press for new taxes that both raise revenue and broaden the tax base, including a value added tax.
 And then there is Social Security. What is needed is a combination of benefit cuts and tax increases that preserve the program's essential nature -- a contract under which the young support the old via taxes and the rich help the poor via a benefits formula that favors low- income beneficiaries. One sound approach would be to link benefit levels to life expectancy, so that as people live longer, future benefits would be modestly reduced while payroll taxes that support Social Security would be modestly increased. 
 There is no way to get deficits under control until our political leaders are willing to acknowledge difficult truths and make even more difficult political choices. We have heard and seen too little of that from the Democrats lately, and none at all from the Republicans. That is truly a recipe for disaster.

HEADLINE: Sex Ed, With No Federal Strings?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Sex Ed in Washington,'' by Ross Douthat (column, Feb. 1), misses several key points. 
 First, comprehensive sex education does work. A recent study by the University of Washington found that teenagers who were taught comprehensive sex education were half as likely to become pregnant as those who received no sex education or were taught abstinence-only. 
 Second, sex education is not a question of ideology. Republican and Democratic governors have rejected Title V abstinence-only financing for their states because abstinence-only programs simply don't work. 
 Third, Congressional studies have found not only that abstinence-only programs are ineffective, but also that they teach misleading and inaccurate information. 
 President Obama is right to invest in medically accurate, age-appropriate sex education programs, and to insist on rigorous evaluation of these programs. Our teenagers deserve nothing less than to be healthy and safe. 
 That's why local Planned Parenthood health centers throughout the country are a trusted resource for parents, teenagers and their communities for teaching comprehensive sex education, which emphasizes abstinence as the best way to avoid pregnancy and infection, along with information about contraception, healthy communication, responsible decision-making and prevention of sexually transmitted infections.
 Cecile Richards President, Planned Parenthood Federation of America New York, Feb. 2, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Like nearly every other commentator on sex education, Ross Douthat focuses narrowly on its behavioral aspects -- does it ''work''? -- and neglects its civic potential.
 From abortion and stem cell research to AIDS policy and sex education itself, a huge number of our hot-button political issues involve sex and reproduction. Sex education should give future citizens the knowledge and skills to deliberate these questions in an informed and fair-minded fashion. Whether it changes behavior or not, sex education can change minds. And that's the only good reason to go to school. 
 Jonathan Zimmerman New York, Feb. 1, 2010
 The writer is a professor of education and history at New York University.
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat suggests that we should make federal funds for sex education available to localities without strings attached. He writes, ''Don't try to encourage Berkeley values in Alabama, or vice versa.'' 
 Unfortunately, when the high teenage pregnancy rate in Alabama and other abstinence-only-sex-ed regions costs the taxpayers in Berkeley and other comprehensive-sex-ed regions significant amounts of money in terms of welfare and health care costs for the teenage mother and her (likely) fatherless baby, the strings do in fact need to be attached.
 Navin Pokala New York, Feb. 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat's citing of Roe v. Wade as dealing with a mere culture-war issue dismisses federally guaranteed individual rights. 
 Would he also make free speech and religious practice subject to the whims of 50 separate state legislatures? 
 Abstinence-only sex education is a misnomer foisted upon the nation by religious ideologues who couldn't care less about the nation's outrageous teenage pregnancy rates, which are higher than comparable nations' rates. Abstinence-only is the antithesis of sex education; it deprives its victims of sex education, substituting futile anti-sex exhortation. 
 Its failure was anecdotally demonstrated by the ludicrous example of Sarah Palin's daughter and statistically by the higher pregnancy rates in the Bible Belt states most dedicated to this folly. 
 Its proponents are evidently above worrying about this birth of children doomed to economic and other forms of deprivation guaranteed by birth to uneducated, unwed teenage mothers. 
 C. W. Griffin Phoenix, Feb. 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat's column didn't mention that comprehensive sexuality education (which would of course cover abstinence) is really not all that common in our schools. Western Europe has lower teenage pregnancy and abortion rates because of comprehensive sexuality education.
 As for Mr. Douthat's attack on Roe v. Wade, why shouldn't the privacy rights and freedom of conscience of women be uniform throughout the United States?
 Edd Doerr Silver Spring, Md., Feb. 1, 2010
 The writer is president of Americans for Religious Liberty.
 To the Editor:
 The language used within this debate is imperative. ''Abstinence-based'' education, as Ross Douthat uses it, actually refers to ''abstinence only until marriage'' programs, which teach, among other things, that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.
 Comprehensive sexuality education does teach abstinence, but it is informed by research and health behavior theories, which indicate that contraception, safer sex and other topics must also be addressed. 
 Mr. Douthat is mistaken that ''courses that social conservatives champion produce unimpressive results -- but so do the contraceptive-oriented programs.'' Actually, extensive research conducted by Douglas Kirby shows that comprehensive approaches help young people delay sexual intercourse and practice safer sex once they do have sex.
 Comprehensive sexuality education is invaluable to young people, and must teach more than just abstinence.
 Elizabeth Schroeder New Brunswick, N.J., Feb. 1, 2010
 The writer is executive director of Answer, a national sexuality education organization housed at Rutgers University.

HEADLINE: Charter School Founder Faces Financial Scrutiny

BYLINE: By CAROL POGASH; Gerry Shih and Felicity Barringer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The founder of a public charter school in the East Bay that provides a comfort zone for Muslim students is under attack in the wake of a state audit that uncovered questionable financial practices, including lavish payments to her.
 In 2007, compensation for the founder and director of the FAME school in Fremont, Maram Alaiwat, was more than $240,000. This was roughly the same as the total compensation of the Fremont Unified Schools superintendent, who oversees 38 schools.
Ms. Alaiwat's compensation package included a base salary of $153,702, a $32,500 housing allowance and a mileage stipend of $7,000. She was also given 10 percent of federal grant money that the school received for books and other needs, a stipend worth $30,000. She was paid $18,700 in lieu of vacation, and was provided with the money to buy a $74,820 2007 Mercedes GL 450. 
 According to the audit, the five-year-old charter school, Families of Alameda for Multi-Cultural/Multi-Lingual Education, had also taken out more than $3 million in loans from private lenders including Ms. Alaiwat's two brothers and two school board members, at an interest rate significantly higher than commercial lenders charge. In most cases, the private lenders also received a 10 percent fee. 
 In addition to the compensation and the loans, Ms. Alaiwat rented her new condominium to an employee, whose salary she subsequently increased.
 These financial issues and concerns about lagging test scores are expected to be raised Tuesday by officials of the Fremont schools at an Alameda County Board of Education meeting. Last month the board voted, 5 to 2, to give provisional approval for FAME's operations to continue. By March, the school must show it has complied with the auditors' recommendations before it can receive final approval.
 In her own defense, Ms. Alaiwat said she was ''one of the least-paid directors in the state'' given the number of students and the size of the area FAME draws from. When she started the school, she said, she agreed to work for $88,000, ''a lowered salary because it was my baby.''
 ''Money was not the motivation,'' she said. ''You make a lot of sacrifices.''
 The school has received favorable attention for the welcome and resources it extends to Muslim families in this multiethnic region. On one of the FAME campuses, a converted J.C. Penney's call center, no one stares when three slender girls slip away at lunch to kneel in a corner and pray. Arabic is taught in all grades, and many girls wear hijabs.
 FAME is ''a second home to many inner-city Muslim families,'' Ms. Alaiwat said in an e-mail message. She added, ''The wall separating church and state in public schools was barb wired on the Muslim side, making it impossible to have equal access to public services and making it emotionally 'unsafe' for many Muslim children.''
 But scores on standardized state tests lag well below the average of the Fremont public school system in almost all subjects -- a fact Ms. Alaiwat ascribed to the number of students who come from low-income families. 
 In recent interviews, Ms. Alaiwat blamed the efforts to shut FAME on Fremont Unified school officials, whom she called ''old white men.'' She said they had not come to terms with changes in Fremont, which is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the region. 
 ''I personally believe they are racists,'' she said. ''I hate to pull the race and ethnicity card, but it's so blatantly that. The fact we exist is haunting them.''
 Larry Sweeney, a member of the Fremont Unified School Board, responded, ''What a shameful, untruthful thing for an educational leader to say.''
 FAME's students would be better served in the public system, Mr. Sweeney said. 
 Dr. Milt Werner, superintendent of Fremont Unified School District, said his district provided ''shining examples'' of award-winning schools with mostly minority populations that were ''closing the achievement gap.''
 The FAME school has grown rapidly, as have the state payments provided in part on the basis of enrollment. The school has 1,490 students, coming from as far away as Richmond. Half are home-schooled. Ms. Alaiwat received bonuses for increasing enrollment and maintaining the financial stability of the school. Fast-growing charter schools often have financial gaps since their state revenue is based on the previous year's enrollment.
 In April 2009 the state's ''exceptional audit'' of FAME Public Charter School made 42 recommendations. Jeff Stark, the Alameda County senior deputy district attorney, said he was ''conducting a review of the audit and the underlying issues.'' 
 Robert Chisholm, the president of FAME's board, defended the payments to Ms. Alaiwat.
 ''They are not excessive for what she's done,'' Dr. Chisholm said, adding that the board gave her $75,000 for a car because ''we thought she deserved it.'' 
 The board also agreed to pay $958 in reimbursement for a speeding ticket. In its response to the auditors, the board agreed to stop paying such citations with school funds.
 Jacki Fox Ruby, president of the Alameda County Board of Education, which granted FAME its charter, called Ms. Alaiwat's compensation ''outrageous.''
 ''What I don't get is,'' Ms. Ruby added, ''if the teachers teach and the principals manage resources, what does the director do?'' 
 The ''extraordinary audit'' issued in April was only the third requested by Superintendent Sheila Jordan in 10 years. A follow-up audit last fall indicated that more than half the 42 recommendations in the first audit had been carried out, and that progress was being made on the rest. One recommendation, asking that corrected W-2 forms for Ms. Alaiwat be filed, had not been resolved as of a follow-up audit in the fall. 
 Ms. Alaiwat, however, appeared confident when discussing the audit. 
 ''Not a penny was legally mismanaged,'' she said. ''The audit did not result or yield any financial loss to taxpayers.''
 The recommendations, she added, ''are subjective best practices. Not the law. No criminal activity was found.'' 
 Lara York, the president of the Fremont Unified School District's board, said, ''As a citizen, I have deep concerns over the amount of compensation the board is giving and the fact that they have not been elected.''
 Ms. Alaiwat said these problems began after someone sent an anonymous complaint to the Alameda County superintendent of schools saying that she ''was funneling money to terrorism.'' 
 Not so, said Ms. Jordan, the superintendent, adding, ''I never received an anonymous letter.'' Complaints, she said, came from concerned citizens who wanted the school to continue.
 In June 2008, Ms. Jordan requested that the state's Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team investigate possibilities of fraud and misappropriation of money at FAME. That audit showed a new charter school that was scraping by from loan to loan as its population grew. 
 FAME's response dismissed many of the auditors' concerns, including those about Ms. Alaiwat's renting an apartment to an employee. It said that she has a history of helping the homeless, the abused and orphans and was being charitable. 
 It also said that charter school officials were not obligated to abide by state conflict-of-interest laws cited in the audit. 
 FAME's board now consolidates all of Ms. Alaiwat's compensation into one lump sum.
 In 2008, she received total compensation of $336,663. This year, her total pay will come to $240,000, Ms. Alaiwat said.

HEADLINE: A Practiced Politician Who Doesn't Look It

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
Joe Simitian has spent nearly half his life in elective office, having served on the Palo Alto school board, the City Council, as mayor, on the County Board of Supervisors and in the State Assembly. Now he is in his second and final term in the State Senate. He is married to his political consultant. 
 On paper, Mr. Simitian seems like the very definition of a career politician. 
 But sit down with him and you come away with a different impression. Riffing comfortably on topics from education reform to highway safety, from environmental policy to infrastructure, Mr. Simitian sounds more like a wonk than a wannabe.
 The truth is that he is a little bit of both. Educated as a city planner and trained as a lawyer, Mr. Simitian is serious about public policy and is something of a maverick. He is willing, on occasion, to offend powerful interest groups. 
 He is also as ambitious as any politician, practiced in the art of getting his name on important legislation and in the newspaper. Even now he is plotting a possible run for Congress should Representative Jackie Speier run for attorney general, though Ms. Speier's district covers large portions of San Mateo and San Francisco Counties that Mr. Simitian has never represented.
 But if he remains in the Legislature, do not expect the 56-year-old Mr. Simitian to fritter away his final three years in office before term limits force him from the Senate. He has too many ideas to pursue, too many changes he wants to make.
 Last year alone, Mr. Simitian was the author of prominent legislation on education reform, water policy and renewable energy. Before that, he wrote California's bans on using cellphones and sending text messages while driving, tackled medical and pharmaceutical waste and regulated sewage dumped from cruise ships. He attracted national publicity when he stepped into a classic California dispute between homeowners with solar power and their neighbors whose trees were blocking the sunlight.
 ''The legislation I carry has a real impact on people's daily lives,'' he said in an interview last month.
 Mark Simon, a former journalist who covered most of Mr. Simitian's career and who now manages public relations for the San Mateo County transit district, said any legislator representing Palo Alto and its environs must be more engaged and informed than the average Sacramento politician because the district demands it. Mr. Simitian's constituents are among the best educated in the state.
 ''You end up having to have a pretty high-level game,'' Mr. Simon said.
 If Mr. Simitian is an institution on the peninsula, his reputation in the capital is not quite as stellar. There he is seen as something of a lone operator who grabs the spotlight at the expense of his colleagues and who sometimes wiggles out of commitments that others think he has made in the course of negotiations. 
 But it is difficult to argue with the results. Year after year, he seems to be in the middle of the action on the capital's most important legislation.
 The senator said it took him a while in the Legislature to learn the art of collaboration.
 ''You cannot be a one-man band and expect to get it done,'' he said. ''Empathy is underrated. You have to get inside the heads of your colleagues and figure out what it's going to take to bring them along.''
 In the coming year, one of his top goals is to win enactment of a bill requiring that 33 percent of California's electricity be generated by renewable energy sources by 2020. 
 The Legislature passed his measure to do that last year, but it was vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr. Simitian said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that he could satisfy the governor this time around.
 The policy, he insists, would help California's economy by providing markets for clean energy, fight climate change and even affect foreign affairs by making California, and the United States, less dependent on imported oil.
 The issue is likely to be a big one in Sacramento this year. But if something else rises to the top of the policy agenda, you can bet that Mr. Simitian will not be far behind.

HEADLINE: Title Decided, but Labor Battle Is Just Beginning

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Miami Gardens, Fla. 

 BODY:
 The N.F.L. season ended Sunday night.
 And how.
 The New Orleans Saints, who had come to represent the city's hope for recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, won the first Super Bowl in the franchise's history, upsetting the Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning, 31-17. 
 Fittingly, Tracy Porter, one of four Louisiana natives on the Saints, intercepted Manning with 3 minutes 12 seconds left and returned the ball 74 yards for a touchdown to give the Saints their margin of victory. 
 But the most significant individual performance of the evening was turned in by Saints quarterback Drew Brees.
 Brees, who became a side story last week with all the praise being heaped on Manning, put on a clinic of clutch passing. 
 He completed 32 of 39 passes for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns. His touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey with 5:42 left gave New Orleans the lead for good. The pass also tied Tom Brady's Super Bowl record for completions.
 His performance catapulted him into the top echelon of N.F.L. quarterbacks.
 But in a week when so much of the talk here was about a labor war looming between owners and players, Brees's championship performance gives the players a high-profile advocate.
 Brees is the Saints' player representative and has been an outspoken advocate for players rights. 
 His performance was just what the doctor ordered -- for the city, for the franchise and for the N.F.L. players.
 ''Four years ago, whoever thought this would be happening?'' Brees said after Sunday's game, in which he was the most valuable player.
 This Super Bowl may be remembered as the last championship game played under labor peace.
 On Thursday, DeMaurice Smith held his first news conference as executive director of the union. Asked what he thought the chances were of a lockout, he said that on a scale of 1 to 10 the likelihood was 14.
 A day later, Commissioner Roger Goodell, when asked about Smith's prediction, said, ''I sure hope he's wrong and I sure hope it doesn't become a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
 The back and forth between Smith and Goodell is not unlike the rhetoric between opposing teams leading up to the Super Bowl: lots of talk, lots of posturing. When competition begins, the actual contest often bears little resemblance to the talk that preceded it.
 Smith, speaking with the sharp edge of a good prosecutor, laid out the facts -- as he saw them: How does a business that made $8 billion, averaging $31 million in profit per team, ask players to take an 18 percent pay cut.
 ''I keep coming back to an economic model in America that is unparalleled,'' Smith said. ''And that makes it incredibly difficult to then come to players and say, on average, each of you needs to take a $340,000 pay cut to save the National Football League. Tough sell.''
 A day after Smith had his say, Goodell talked about the owners' liability. Since 2006, he said, the N.F.L. has generated $3.6 billion in incremental revenue and additional revenue. Of that, $2.6 billion has gone to players, causing the owners to be $200 million worse off than they were in 2006.
 ''So the system is not working for at least one side of the equation,'' Goodell said. ''You have to have a system that works for everybody here.''
 Smith and Goodell are smooth operators. Smith will not be outcampaigned, Goodell will not be outflanked. 
 But Smith cannot be certain about his army. In every major confrontation, the N.F.L. has crushed the union. The significant exception was the 2006 collective bargaining agreement, in which the union chief at the time, Gene Upshaw, leveraging his close relationship with the former commissioner Paul Tagliabue, won a revenue-sharing agreement that favored the players. The owners are determined to get their money back. 
 Smith's greatest challenge will be to rally his players for a grueling fight. 
 Can Smith mold players into an effective fighting unit? Can he persuade the league's high-profile players -- the Peyton Mannings, the Donovan McNabbs, the Reggie Bushes -- to join the battle?
 With a labor fight with owners inevitable, having a high profile quarterback like Brees in the fold could make Smith's job infinitely easier. ''It's not very often that you find high-profile guys like that who are so active on the labor side of things,'' Saints linebacker Scott Fujita said after Sunday's game. ''He's standing up for players on this and that's important for us.'' 
 Although this battle will be waged in the trenches, it will also be fought -- and to a large extent won -- in the court of public opinion. Smith should make certain that whenever players are seen by the public, they are working on union-sponsored initiatives: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, comforting the sick. The Saints have been a living advertisement for a partnership between team and city. For the last five seasons, Saints players have been an integral part of the New Orleans story. Brees in particular has gone out of his way to sing the praises of New Orleans and to tie the Saints' success to the city's rebuilding effort. 
 ''We played for so much more than ourselves,'' Brees said Sunday. ''We played for our city. We played for the entire Gulf Coast region.''
 With the help of players like Brees, Smith must prepare players for a battle with ownership the way coaches prepare them for games. He must make the players realize that the coming confrontation is the biggest game of their professional lives.
 The season is over but the battle has just begun.

HEADLINE: Huge Church Project Renews Downtown, and Debate

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
For many devout Mormons, Utah's capital city is important mainly as a setting for the jewel that really matters: Temple Square at the city's center. Brigham Young, the pioneer leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, laid out the urban grid with street numbers starting at the temple. The secular world was thus defined by the sacred core.
 But now a hugely ambitious, $1 billion church-financed redevelopment project near the temple, called City Creek Center, and a wave of recent church property purchases in the vicinity are prompting a new debate inside the church community and out over where the line between culture and economics should be drawn. 
 Some residents say the church, by opening its checkbook in a recession, rescued the city when times got tough. The 1,800 construction jobs at City Creek alone have provided a big local economic cushion. Completion of the project -- 20 acres of retail shops and residential towers -- is scheduled for 2012. 
 ''City Creek has been a literal and figurative godsend,'' said Bradley D. Baird, the business development manager at the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, a private nonprofit group that has no direct involvement with the project. 
 Other people say that if the new heart of downtown has a strong church flavor, Salt Lake, which has become more diverse in recent years -- could veer back toward its roots, for better or worse. About half of city residents are Mormon, according to many estimates, and if many, or most, of the roughly 700 apartment units at City Creek were occupied by Mormon families, the city could have a dramatic new feel.
 ''Our downtown has become a ghost town in my life -- nobody lives there,'' said Dan Egan, 55, a lawyer and church member who works near the site but lives in the suburbs. ''Having several thousand people live down here will have a big impact, and having many of them L.D.S. would be a very interesting thing to see.''
 Church leaders say they have no religious goals in mind for City Creek, or for their other recent acquisitions. Over just the last month, the church has bought three more properties, including a 13-acre parcel a few blocks south of City Creek. A spokesman said the purchases were investments.
 ''There will be no evidence of the church within those blocks,'' said H. David Burton, a former corporate executive who oversees the church's business interests as the presiding bishop. Mr. Burton said the civic spaces inside City Creek would be private property, but ''with all the attributes of a public venue.''
 Alcohol, for example -- always a cultural flashpoint because of the church's teachings to avoid it -- will probably be allowed in City Creek, Mr. Burton said, under special contracts that will allow a restaurant wanting a liquor license to buy the underlying property. That would keep the church from being in the liquor business or from benefiting from liquor sales while still allowing sale and consumption on the premises.
 As for who might want to move in, Mr. Burton said he thought proximity to the temple would make the apartments attractive to church families, but only time will tell. About 40 percent of the available condominium units have been reserved by deposit, but a church spokesman said the buyers' religious affiliations were unknown.
 ''If I were making a guess -- and I don't have any empirical data -- it might be more attractive to L.D.S. than to others,'' Mr. Burton said.
 One former Salt Lake City planning official, Stephen A. Goldsmith, who is not a Mormon, said he was thrilled by the thought of people moving back downtown, but feared that the church's economic concentration would lead to a ''Vaticanization'' of the area.
 ''The concern is about having just one owner own so much of the heart of the capital city,'' said Mr. Goldsmith, who was director of city planning from 2000 to 2002 and is now an associate professor of architecture and planning at the University of Utah. 
 Already, Professor Goldsmith said, a buffer zone of about 100 acres of church-owned properties, assembled gradually over the past few decades, rings the inner core. He said the ''we/they'' divide between Mormons and non-Mormons could widen if even more public space became private or was linked to one group's cultural values.
 Church leaders said the desire to head off economic decline in downtown was their prime directive at City Creek. 
 ''Along with economic malaise comes an element that we were concerned about in proximity to the temple,'' said Mr. Burton, the presiding bishop. That the temple area might one day start to feel dangerous was simply intolerable, he said. ''With decay, sometimes comes crime,'' he said. 
 Although lots of urban churches worry about those issues, the ones that can write a $1 billion check are rare. 
 ''It's certainly one of the largest, if not the largest project in the United States funded by a single entity, and the fact that the entity is a church makes it doubly unusual,'' said Patrick L. Anderson, the chief executive and founder of the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based real-estate consulting company. 
 Mr. Anderson, who said his firm had no economic involvement in City Creek, said such megascale urban redevelopment mostly went out of fashion after the 1970s and '80s. That makes Salt Lake even more singular, he said.
 Church officials said, however, that some of what they were doing was a throwback -- to the 1930s. In the Great Depression, the church established a food and clothing distribution system for destitute members and bought land all over the state, establishing a precedent for wading in during hard times. 
 Now, some of those 1930s economic stimulus lands could come back into play. The Salt Lake City Council is considering another huge development project called the Northwest Quadrant near the airport, where the church owns a swath of land used long ago as a Depression-era church farm.

HEADLINE: In Nordic Combined, the U.S. Team Is Closing In on a Quantum Leap

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Americans are used to being the scrappy underdog in Nordic combined, a sport that involves cross-country racing and ski jumping and has traditionally been dominated by Norwegians, who originated the sport.
 But this year, the Americans are getting used to being the favorites. Three of the top athletes in the sport -- Todd Lodwick, Johnny Spillane and Bill Demong -- are on the United States team, and each is hitting his peak before the Vancouver Olympics. 
 At the world championships in 2009, Americans won the gold medal in three of four events, and the team is now widely favored to take the podium at the Winter Games. If they do that even once, it will be a first: no American has won an Olympic medal in Nordic combined. 
 Vancouver will be the fourth Olympics for Demong and Spillane, who are each 29, and the fifth for Lodwick, who is 33. Still, Demong acknowledged that something was different this year. ''Before, we were trying to believe that we could do it,'' he said. ''And now we know that we can.'' 
 Although Americans have generally excelled in high-profile sports like downhill skiing and figure skating, they have lagged in Nordic sports, which draw less news media attention and where champions take years to develop. In addition to Nordic combined, the United States has never won a medal in biathlon, and the last time an American cross-country athlete won a medal was in 1976.
 That is why team leaders are so excited about their three stars in Nordic combined. Demong, seen as the Americans' best hope for a medal, took the World Cup podium 10 times last season and won a gold medal in January. Lodwick earned two medals this season and two last season. Spillane won gold at a World Cup event in January. 
 Leaders in the United States Ski and Snowboard Association, which oversees Nordic combined, say the Americans' success is in part a result of the heightened attention paid to the sport since the mid-1990s, when American winter sports were under pressure to improve their performance before the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
 ''Salt Lake was a big push, for sure,'' said John Farra, the ski association's Nordic director. 
 He said leaders realized that in order to improve the United States' position, they had to take on Norway, a powerhouse. ''Every medal that we win is a medal that we potentially take away from Norway,'' Farra said. ''We really needed our Nordic sports to be a part of that.''
 Some sports can benefit quickly from an infusion of cash and commitment, but that has not been the case with Nordic combined. Athletes enter their best years in their late 20s and early 30s, and only after investing at least a decade of hard work. 
 ''Nordic combined is such a funky sport,'' said Alan Ashley, the managing director of sport performance at the United States Olympic Committee. ''It takes a really long time to first of all develop the skills and the physical capability in both of these disciplines, and then to figure out how to balance the two.''
 The United States team came close to winning a medal at Salt Lake, taking fourth place in the team event. Lodwick placed fifth in one event and seventh in another. At the 2006 Turin Games, the United States placed seventh in the team event. 
 Farra declined to say how much the ski association invested in Nordic combined, but he said it had been consistent, which was not always true in the past. ''The financial resources don't necessarily make the champion, but it's really hard for these athletes to commit to their sport for a decade,'' he said. 
 Even today, the ski association does not pay a stipend to elite athletes in Nordic combined, but pays their expenses to travel and compete around the world. Athletes who perform well can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in prize money and bonuses from sponsors, Farra said.
 However, ''if you're 10th in the world, it drops off pretty dramatically,'' he said. ''If you're 30th in the world, forget about it -- you're staying in your parents' house.''
 Demong can relate. ''Everybody has to figure out how to make it work,'' he said. 
 As recently as three years ago, Demong said, he was earning extra cash making concrete countertops for clients in Park City, Utah, where he trains. And in 2003, while he was recovering from fracturing his skull in a swimming pool accident, he worked construction. 
 This year, the economic recession forced the ski association to trim expenses, and Farra said the team cut financing to some lower-level athletes -- a difficult decision, given that the team attributes its success to developing athletes. 
 Ashley said finding a balance between supporting elite athletes and encouraging younger ones was always difficult. However, ''you need to make sure that you sustain your top programs,'' he said. Elite athletes become heroes, and ''those heroes help drive kids.''
 Demong and others say they are seeing proof of that in Nordic combined. He points to promising performances by the other two members of the Olympic team: Taylor Fletcher, who is 19, and Brett Camerota, who is 25.
 In addition, Demong said, ''there's five guys that are disappointed right now that they didn't make the team, who had realistic expectations, and I think that's a lot different than it was for us 10 years ago.''
 Demong said that although he hoped to compete at the next Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, his focus had begun to shift toward grooming the next generation. 
 ''It would be sad if this was a flash in the pan,'' he said. ''Because we are poised to continue this forever.''

HEADLINE: Britain Announces Plan to Reduce Flow of International Students

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
In the face of mounting concern about abuse of student visa rules by migrant jobseekers and potential terrorists, Britain said Sunday that it was planning an immediate tightening of its border controls that could reduce the flow of people entering the country as students by tens of thousands a year.
 The new rules will apply to all applicants from outside the European Union, including the United States. But the primary focus appeared likely to be the Indian subcontinent and countries in the Arab and Muslim world, both because of the large numbers of allegedly fake applicants who originate there and because of concerns about combating terrorism by Islamic extremists. 
 The controls appeared to have been drawn up, in part, to meet American pressure for a tougher British approach to combating terrorist threats. While officials from both countries say counterterrorism cooperation has been close, United States officials have warned that Britain, with its large Muslim population and its relatively open borders, is among the countries that are central to American concerns as potential planning grounds for terrorist attacks against the United States.
 Announcement of the new controls came six weeks after the failed attempt on Christmas Day to bomb an American airliner approaching Detroit on a trans-Atlantic flight. The 23-year-old Nigerian charged in that attack, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, spent three years in Britain as an engineering student and while in London associated with radical Muslim groups, though British and American intelligence officials have said he was prepared for the bombing attempt by associates of Al Qaeda in Yemen.
 British officials announcing the new controls made no reference to the Detroit attack, and noted that the policy review that prompted the new restrictions had been ordered in November, before the airliner bombing attempt. They said their main concern lay in stopping the abuse of student visas by people seeking to find jobs and settle in Britain.
 They said 240,000 student visas were issued in the 2008-9 statistical year, accounting for a third of all migrants reaching Britain.
 The rapid rise in immigration, and the strain it has imposed on public services like education, medical care and the welfare system, promise to be a major issue in a general election that must be held before June. The ruling Labour Party has come under growing pressure from the opposition parties -- in particular the Conservatives, who are leading in pre-election polls -- to defend policies that have brought three million migrants to the country since the party took power in 1997.
 Still, the Christmas Day attack appeared to have had an influence. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said that Britain regarded the thwarted attack as ''a wake-up call'' requiring a review of airport security measures and border controls, among other things. And British officials were at pains to explain a sequence of events that led Mr. Abdulmutallab to be denied a student visa to re-enter Britain in May 2009, but not flagged to the United States as a potential security risk.
 They have said that the Nigerian was rejected because he had applied to study at a ''bogus college'' not on a visa-approval list, not because of his radical links, and that monitoring of his activities as a student at University College London from 2005 to 2008 showed him to be a ''peripheral figure'' among Islamic radicals, and not at the time a terrorist threat. Still, the attempt heightened American concerns about efforts by terrorists to gain entry to Britain through what critics had often described as the ''gaping holes'' in the student visa system.
 Home Secretary Alan Johnson, responsible for overseeing domestic security, said in a BBC interview that care would be taken not to damage ''a major part of the U.K. economy,'' the $8 billion to $13 billion a year generated by the education of foreign students here. But in a formal statement, Mr. Johnson said that ''those who are not seriously interested in coming here to study, but come primarily to work, should be in no doubt that we will come down hard on those that flout the rules.''
 The restrictions will include a requirement that students speak English well enough to pass British high school exams, not just the ''beginner's English'' required previously. Applicants for courses lasting less than six months will no longer be allowed to bring family members with them, and the dependents of students on courses not leading to degrees will be barred from working. Colleges will be more tightly monitored, to eliminate the kind of fake institutions that one critic described last year as ''a couple of people above a chip shop.''
 The restrictions come only nine months after a major overhaul aimed at weeding out false applicants. But the new system -- requiring applicants to show they have offers from approved colleges and adequate finances -- was quickly overwhelmed, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, where applications soared and British officials complained that they were approving applications on paperwork alone, with no interviews.
 Last week, the government halted all student visa approvals from northern India, Nepal and Bangladesh while the system was under review.

HEADLINE: Transit-Plan Prescription for Disappearing Detroit

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
The biggest jolt in ''Blueprint America: Beyond the Motor City'' comes as the director of Madrid's subway and light-rail system talks about the importance of infrastructure. (Maybe ''jolt'' is too strong.) Discussing Spain's ambitious high-speed rail system, he says countries that neglect their infrastructure experience ''a slow decline in importance and their weight in the world.'' Cut to Detroit's imposing Michigan Central Station, sitting in abandoned, broken-windowed splendor. It doesn't look like decline -- it looks like whatever comes next.
 This new installment of PBS's ''Blueprint America'' project, Monday night on most stations, is about plans to revitalize Detroit by reviving its once thriving but now nearly nonexistent public transportation system (which was, of course, destroyed by the hometown auto industry). But despite all the earnest talk of light rail getting people back downtown, what lingers are the eerily quiet images of the former Motor City. 
 It's one thing to know that Detroit's population is half what it was in the 1950s. It's quite another to see the scruffy green acres within the city limits, block after block of what used to be neighborhoods and now are weed patches and incipient forests, devoid of people unless they've bedded down in the tall grass where we can't see them. 
 As the city dissolves back into the landscape, analysts discuss the possibility of forcing the few still living in the empty zones to move into more densely populated areas so the city can cut back on utilities and police services. Others advocate large-scale urban farming.
 There's much more to the 90-minute program than simply cataloging Detroit's woes. It offers a history of national transportation planning in the United States -- yes, it ends with the Interstate System -- and presents the counterexample of the Spanish AVE system, which in less than 20 years has linked the country from north to south and fostered economic development in the cities it serves (at a cost of increased national debt and higher taxes). 
 So much ground is covered -- the Gallatin Plan, the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, car culture, the 1967 riots, white flight, green technology -- that the actual plans for light rail and a new transportation hub in Detroit don't get all that much screen time. 
 An earlier ''Blueprint America'' program, ''Road to the Future,'' had the same problem, giving a quick once-over to transit issues in New York, Denver and Portland, Ore. In Detroit's case, perhaps details are avoided because the notion that improved public transportation can address problems rooted in fundamental economic shifts and race and class divides seems iffy at best. 
 The program keeps returning to those Spanish trains, humming along at 155 to 185 miles an hour, well above the 150 that Amtrak's Acela achieves for a few miles here and there. It doesn't get into the factors -- shorter distances, more empty space -- that make the construction of such a system easier in Spain than it would be here. But the case it's making has more to do with political will and national priorities.
 ''Beginning in the 1980s, in the United States it was perceptible that things were beginning to deteriorate, that the maintenance of those infrastructures was getting worse and that the network didn't evolve in any way to keep pace with the country,'' a former Spanish economy secretary says by way of a coda. ''And in the 1990s, in terms of infrastructure, it was a country that had fallen behind the standards of any European country.'' O.K., maybe not Albania. But we get the point.

 THE BOMBING OF GERMANY 
 On PBS stations Monday night (check local listings).
 Also Monday ''American Experience'' looks at the Allied bombing campaigns against Germany in World War II -- specifically at the factors that led to the wholesale bombing of cities like Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden, which killed an estimated half a million German civilians, despite initial avowals by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill that they would not condone such attacks.
 While there is no comparison in either methods or the scale of casualties, the questions about civilian deaths in American missile attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan lend the program an air of timeliness. At one hour it's a frustratingly brief and condensed treatment of both the history and the issues, but it's worth seeing if only for the vintage film. In Berlin survivors take in the sight of their ruined city like tourists, perched on huge piles of rubble.
 The military historian Conrad Crane adroitly straddles the question of whether the bombings were justified, saying, ''I see this idea of just killing civilians and targeting civilians as being unethical, though the most unethical act in World War II for the Allies would have been allowing themselves to lose.''

HEADLINE: With Federal Stimulus Money Gone, Many Schools Face Budget Gaps

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Federal stimulus money has helped avoid drastic cuts at public schools in most parts of the nation, at least so far. But with the federal money running out, many of the nation's schools are approaching what officials are calling a ''funding cliff.''
 Congress included about $100 billion for education in the stimulus law last year to cushion the recession's impact on schools and to help fuel an economic recovery. New studies show that many states will spend all or nearly all that is left between now and the end of this school term. 
 With state and local tax revenues still in decline, the end of the federal money will leave big holes in education budgets from Massachusetts and Florida to California and Washington, experts said.
 ''States are going to face a huge problem because they'll have to find some way to replace these billions, either with cuts to their K-12 systems or by finding alternative revenues,'' said Bruce Baker, an education professor at Rutgers University. 
 The stimulus program was the largest one-time infusion of federal education dollars to states and districts in the nation's history. As the program took shape last year, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and other officials repeatedly warned states and districts to avoid spending the money in ways that could lead to dislocations when the gush of federal money came to an end.
 But from the start, those warnings seemed at odds with the stimulus law's goal of jump-starting the economy, and the administration trumpeted last fall that school districts had used stimulus money to save, or create, some 250,000 education jobs.
 Now the new studies point to the problems likely to beset thousands of school districts when the federal money runs out.
 One study, which Dr. Baker wrote with David Sciarra and Danielle Farrie of the Education Law Center in Newark and which is to be presented on Monday at a conference at Teachers College of Columbia University, examines how 11 states have used their education stimulus money. The 11 states received amounts from the stabilization fund ranging from $234 million (Nebraska) to $2.5 billion (New York). 
 Nine of the 11 states had already allocated most of that money for this school year and last, the study found, leaving a third or less of their federal money available for the 2010-11 school year. 
 Another bigger study, also to be presented at the conference, found that some states facing pressing financial problems last year as the stimulus program emerged decided to use 100 percent of their education stimulus money almost immediately.
 Of the 20 states in the study by Michael A. Rebell, a professor at Teachers College, and two colleagues, Jessica Wolff and Dan Yaverbaum, six of them -- Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington -- had allotted all of their education stabilization money to schools for this school year and last, leaving zero to spend on the school term beginning this fall.
 The two new studies based their findings on data supplied by the states last year to the federal Department of Education on their applications for stimulus money, as well as on other financial reports that have allowed the scholars to document states' actual expenditures on public schools. Professor Rebell's study also involved phone interviews with state and local school officials in the 20 states, he said.
 The new studies align with results of a broader, 50-state survey on the stimulus program carried out by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The conference's survey, based solely on an examination of the states' stimulus applications, found that 20 states said when applying that they intended to spend 100 percent of their stabilization funds in the 2008-9 and 2009-10 school years.
 The 20 states were Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
 But Dan Thatcher, who conducted the conference's survey, said that Idaho, and perhaps others among the 20, had reconsidered those plans, deciding to reserve some stimulus money for the coming school year. 
 On average, according to the conference's survey, states allotted 38 percent of their stabilization money to the 2008-9 year and 48 percent to the current school year, leaving only 14 percent for the school term that begins this fall.
 About $65 billion of the $100 billion in education stimulus money went to states in three pots: $39.5 billion as part of a stabilization fund intended to bolster the finances of state public education systems, $13 billion for the federal program for poor students known as Title I, and $12.2 billion for students with disabilities. Congress directed the rest of the $100 billion to smaller initiatives, including $4.3 billion to a school improvement grant program the Obama administration calls Race to the Top.
 Professor Rebell's study examined in some detail how school districts have used the stimulus money they received under the federal programs intended for poor and disabled students. Many districts have chosen to spend much of the money they received for students with disabilities on things like lift buses, handicap-accessible vans and renovated bathrooms. 
 ''This was a godsend, and the investment will last for years,'' Professor Rebell said. ''In most cases, districts didn't put people on the payroll that they would now have to lay off.'' 
 But many school systems have not been so prudent in their use of Title I money.
 ''The need to spend these funds quickly has led districts to add large numbers of temporary staff positions,'' Professor Rebell's study says. ''In most states that we studied, some school districts appear to have spent a considerable amount of their Title I funds to save jobs formerly paid for through state and local funding that were threatened as a result of cuts in that funding.''

HEADLINE: Wielding Iron Checkbook to Shape Cultural Los Angeles

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Every American city has its power brokers, but only Los Angeles has an Eli Broad. 
 Mr. Broad dominates the arts here with a force that has no parallel in any major city. Los Angeles would literally not look the same had Mr. Broad not chosen it as his home 40 years ago, and his business-focused method of managing his giving has earned him a reputation as both a genius and a despot.
 Now, as his preferred pick, Jeffrey Deitch, prepares to take the helm of another cultural pillar of Los Angeles -- the Museum of Contemporary Art, which Mr. Broad helped found three decades ago and recently bailed out with a $30 million grant -- Mr. Broad's grip on the city and its arts has never been tighter.
 A billionaire philanthropist whose beneficence comes with not just strings but with ropes that could moor an ocean liner, he is known to pull his support, resign from a board or, in some cases, decline to fulfill his financial promises when a project comes together in a way he does not like. 
 ''For me there has been no downside,'' said Roland G. Fryer Jr., an economics professor at Harvard who has collaborated with Mr. Broad on education projects and whom Mr. Broad, in typical fashion, hunted down one Christmas Eve in Austria, where he was on vacation, to discuss their work. ''But I think if you're not on your game, Eli will crush you.'' 
 Mr. Broad (pronounced to rhyme with ''road'') founded two Fortune 500 companies before retiring into a life of aggressive philanthropy, and his reach here, while most pronounced in the arts, is also civic and scientific. A manikin in carefully tailored suits, he makes no apology for his exacting demands on how the millions he has donated are spent, nor the consequences for failure. ''If we start with a game plan, I want to make sure it happens,'' he said. ''At age 76 I don't want to feel frustrated.''
 Through his $2.5 billion foundation, he has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to education reform and scientific and medical research, including major programs at Caltech, the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles. He oversaw fund-raising for the Walt Disney Concert Hall and has used his own contemporary art collection as a lending library that will soon be another museum here. He was one of those responsible for supporting the Los Angeles Opera production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle.
 His remarkable influence -- even his critics suggest the results of his patronage have been overwhelmingly good for the city -- says much about Los Angeles and its still-adolescent philanthropic culture, diffuse power base and lack of civic investment among many of its richest residents. 
 ''Eli is not the problem,'' said Ann Philbin, the director of the Hammer Museum, who sparred with Mr. Broad when he sat on and eventually resigned from that museum's board. ''The problem is that we don't have enough Elis in Los Angeles to balance out his generosity and the power of his influence.''
 Born and raised in Detroit, a lifelong Democrat and among the youngest in the history of Michigan to become a certified public accountant (he was 20), Mr. Broad made his first fortune in home building, then went on to be a co-founder of SunAmerica, a financial services firm that is now a subsidiary of AIG. 
 From an early point in this life here Mr. Broad saw the potential of downtown, which, unlike the downtowns of other cities, does not serve as a cultural center. He was the founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art in 1979. His impact, however, can be stormy, as with his recent showdown with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
 In 2003 Mr. Broad pledged $50 million for a much-needed new building to hold contemporary art. He personally lobbied the Italian architect Renzo Piano to design it, and it was universally inferred that Mr. Broad and his wife, Edythe, would donate much of their extensive personal collection for the walls of the new building.
 But just before the new wing opened in 2008, Mr. Broad said he would keep the 2,000-plus works in his collection and instead loan hundreds of them to the museum. Soon the new wing became home to various shows and other works of art, in addition to the Broad pieces, enraging Mr. Broad. As a result, several board members said, he did not pay the balance of his pledged gift of roughly $6 million.
 ''He owes us a fortune,'' said Lynda Resnick, a board member. ''There was a period he wouldn't speak to me for a year and a half'' over the dispute. 
 Mr. Broad has ''fulfilled my gift to Lacma 100-plus percent,'' he said. ''The question is: Have they honored their commitments to me, which was to show our collection?'' 
 Efforts to ameliorate the situation, he said, went nowhere.
 ''We've endeavored to do so, and at one point suggested mediation or arbitration, none of which they wanted to do, which surprised me because we've been the largest donor and fund-raiser in Lacma's history,'' Mr. Broad said. (The largest donor in the museum's history is actually the Ahmanson Foundation, which has given over $100 million.)
 Ms. Resnick said: ''When Eli gives, it is like negotiating a business deal. It is not altruistic. It is not blind charity. And there is a difference between being generous and being charitable. But it doesn't matter in the end because the good was still done.''
 Mr. Broad has been known to pull his financial support for other things. 
 In 2008 Mr. Broad and the Gates Foundation financed a political campaign, Strong American Schools, with the goal of raising the profile of education among the presidential candidates and the voting public. He and the Gates Foundation promised $60 million. 
 But Mr. Broad is fond of using a specific matrix to judge the success of his giving. Museums should see attendance rise and giving increase by board members. Schools should see test scores go up. 
 In the case of Strong American Schools he suggested to Chad Kolton, the communications director for the campaign, that one way to judge its impact would be the number of column inches newspapers devoted to the subject.
 In the end, Mr. Broad said, the campaign did not have the impact on voters that he'd hoped, so he reduced his pledge to about a third of the original promise. 
 ''If we're not getting results,'' Mr. Broad said during an interview in his offices in the Westwood district, surrounded by modern art on the walls and framed by the spread of Los Angeles behind him, ''why should we spend all that money?''
 Mr. Kolton said the campaign staff saw an ever-moving goal post.
 ''Just because we couldn't make education the main campaign issue when we were fighting two wars and the country was slipping into a depression, it was held against us,'' he said. 
 The story was much the same at a public arts high school that Mr. Broad helped to start, then turned away from when the infamously sclerotic school system here failed to attract the leadership he thought would best serve the city. 
 His focus on minute details also makes museum leaders and others chafe; it is much like taking money from your rich parents who then tell you what car to buy and where your kids ought to go to school. 
 As the new building that would bear his name at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art was under construction, dust flying, paintings carefully readied, staff put into place, Mr. Broad was deeply concerned about what would be done about the weatherstripping. 
 ''He also wondered where the temperature readings would be on the wall,'' said Michael Govan, the museum's director.
 In some ways Mr. Broad is as much a product of Los Angeles as an architect of its philanthropic culture. He does not actually run a business here, as most big-city philanthropists do, nor is he even the largest donor to many institutions to which he contributes. 
 But unlike other cities, where old families and old money tend to dominate boards, Los Angeles has the philanthropic spirit of a relatively new city. While money in New York is generally concentrated across a few miles of Manhattan, Los Angeles wealth is spread across hundreds of miles among people with diffuse interests, many with few longstanding ties to the city. 
 That has meant that young donors can quickly gain access to big-name things, and that some people who came to remake their lives here can remake tired institutions too. 
 ''You can come to this city as I did 40 some odd years ago without the right background, familywise, politically, religiously, and be accepted,'' Mr. Broad said, ''if you're willing to work hard, have good ideas and make things happen.''
 On the flip side, many organizations here remain underfinanced, and many of the city's richest residents are completely out of the cultural loop. ''It's not a very crowded field, in my opinion, of people who are civically active in a meaningful way,'' said Rick Caruso, a Los Angeles developer who has been involved in numerous civic affairs. ''So Eli has a lot of room he can work in.''
 But it may also be that Mr. Broad is setting the terms for the emerging philanthropic culture in Los Angeles. ''Eli does nothing without strings, but I happen to think you need strings,'' said Jane Nathanson, a longtime trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art. ''I think there is a new type of philanthropist now. With old-family wealth, people gave money because it was the chic thing to do. New wealth is earned, and if you can get it, there is going to be a great deal of control.''

HEADLINE: New Orleans Picks Mayor With Show Of Support

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
At forums during the mayoral campaign here, candidates were frequently asked what they would do about the racial divide in the city, the dysfunctional stalemate that has often bogged down the city's recovery from Hurricane Katrina.
 All said they would try to overcome that stalemate. But only one could cite a family legacy of having done so, the one named Landrieu.
 In the 1970s, Mayor Moon Landrieu led the desegregation of City Hall, and on Saturday his son, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, won an extraordinary showing of support from both blacks and whites to become the first white mayor of New Orleans since his father left office 32 years ago. According to Greg Rigamer, an election analyst, Mr. Landrieu won 70 percent of the white vote, 63 percent of the black vote and all but one of the city's 366 precincts. 
 ''The message was simple, it was direct, and it was clear for everybody to see,'' Mr. Landrieu said at a news conference on Sunday at the Roosevelt Hotel. ''The people of this city are ready to come together to find higher common ground and to start getting things done.''
 But the path to that higher ground is steep. Blocks upon blocks in the city are still pockmarked with vacant lots or abandoned houses. Violent crime, while down significantly in recent months, still plagues much of the city, and the low-wage, stagnant economy that has burdened so many of the city's poor black residents has not been retooled.
 Mr. Landrieu, 49, built his campaign around reducing crime, improving schools and bringing jobs. But one of the main reasons for his victory was an electorate that wanted someone with the political connections to make the recovery move faster and more efficiently. 
 The current mayor, C. Ray Nagin, had a sometimes thorny relationship with federal and state officials, and many voters had grown to feel that his outsider approach was not serving the city.
 ''The recovery has not moved that far along,'' said Renette Dejoie-Hall, the executive editor of The Louisiana Weekly, a black-interest publication that endorsed Mr. Landrieu over other candidates who it said would have needed ''on-the-job training on how to maneuver through labyrinthine governmental bureaucracies.''
 At least one of Mr. Landrieu's connections is fairly solid. Asked Sunday how he was going to work with federal and state officials during the transition period, he began by saying that he was planning to travel to Washington soon to meet with Louisiana's Congressional delegation. 
 Then he stopped to point out that he could talk to one of them immediately: his sister Mary L. Landrieu, the Democratic senator from Louisiana, was standing in the back of the room.
 Mr. Landrieu went on to say that he had been in recent contact with White House cabinet members who are crucial to the recovery process -- including the secretaries of housing and urban development, homeland security and health and human services -- and was going to seek their involvement in the 90 days before he takes office on May 6.
 ''I'm also going to ask each one of them whether or not they would be willing to embed somebody from each of their departments in the transition so that we can stay linked,'' he said. ''I'll actually do that with the governor as well, so that during the transition we have federal, state and local officials beginning to work on the mechanism of the recovery.''
 He said he was anticipating some federal aid packages that were already being negotiated, including a large payment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild schools. And he has been an enthusiastic supporter of plans for a $1.2 billion medical complex downtown, which recently moved closer to reality with a decision by a federal arbitrator to fully reimburse the city for Charity Hospital, which has been closed since Hurricane Katrina.
 The broad coalition behind Mr. Landrieu's victory in many ways continued the tradition of his father, the patriarch of the Landrieu political dynasty, who rode into office with a coalition of nearly all the black voters and some white liberals and moderates. Once in office, he desegregated city agencies from top to bottom, as he had promised to do. The elder Mr. Landrieu, now 79, remains a widely admired figure here, and his popularity has benefited his children. 
 ''If it was Moon Landrieu, then my generation would be extremely comfortable,'' said Rudy Lombard, the former chairman of the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality and a leading organizer of sit-ins in early 1960s New Orleans.
 But Mr. Lombard said any talk of a ''post-racial'' city was premature, and that the younger Mr. Landrieu would have to back up talk of racial unification with action. ''I'll give Mitch the benefit of the doubt,'' he said. ''He's got an opportunity.''
 Mr. Landrieu ran for mayor twice before, coming in third in 1994 and second in a close runoff with Mr. Nagin in 2006. He was a legislator for 16 years and was twice elected lieutenant governor. He and his wife, Cheryl, like him a lawyer, have five children.
 Mr. Landrieu drew praise in 2007, when, in just 45 days, his office helped direct $9.6 million in federal aid to owners of 283 historic buildings that were damaged by the storm and ensuing flood. Local officials at the time contrasted the speed of the payment to the notoriously slow pace of the much larger Road Home program, which was for owners of severely damaged homes.
 But he did not have a central role in the recovery process, which seemed to frustrate him. When he failed to persuade the Obama administration to reappoint a federal recovery czar -- a job he might have taken if it had been offered -- he returned to his duties of lieutenant governor, mainly fostering the state's tourism industry and what he calls its cultural economy. He denied interest in running for mayor -- until December, in the week of the deadline for qualifying. 
 From the moment Mr. Landrieu declared, he was the frontrunner, and suffered little from criticism that he was a career politician. Now he has to use that political career to meet the daunting challenges of New Orleans. ''In many ways,'' he said at the news conference, ''yesterday was the beginning of the rebirth.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Balancing Act On U.S. Trade Policies

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania challenged President Obama last week on behalf of steel workers, and helped underscore the administration's ambivalence about trade.
 During a public meeting between the president and Senate Democrats, Mr. Specter asked whether Mr. Obama would upend existing agreements with China in response to trade policies in Beijing that he said amounted to ''international banditry.''
 ''Arlen, I would not,'' the president replied. ''What I don't want is for us as a country, or as a party, to shy away from the prospects for international competition.'' 
 But Mr. Obama also noted his ''much tougher'' line than his Republican predecessor on enforcing existing trade agreements -- including slapping tariffs on imported Chinese tires.
 It is little wonder that Mr. Obama's message on trade has gotten muddled.
 Like every president of the last generation, he has maintained the rhetorical embrace of free trade. But even as he insists that Washington cannot afford to wait for a new health care system, energy policy or set of Wall Street regulations, Mr. Obama has been willing to wait on asking Congress to approve pending trade deals.
 Given the opposition from his labor union allies, that stance conserves Mr. Obama's political capital at a time when so many other priorities hang in the balance on Capitol Hill.
 But it also undercuts Mr. Obama's top priority: reducing the nation's 9.7 percent unemployment rate. And as a result, even some fellow Democrats believe that Mr. Obama is leaving new jobs on the table.
 Contrasting Clinton
 The last Democrat in the Oval Office before Mr. Obama made trade the center of his economic agenda: Bill Clinton, in his first year in office, bucked union opposition to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with help from Congressional Republicans.
 Mr. Obama, by contrast, has sent mixed signals since the 2008 Democratic primaries. While candidate Obama courted blue-collar votes by criticizing Nafta, his economic adviser Austan Goolsbee was depicted in a Canadian official's government memorandum as having privately ascribed such rhetoric to political maneuvering.
 As president, Mr. Obama has not moved to renegotiate Nafta. The administration recently tempered the impact of ''Buy America'' provisions in last year's economic stimulus legislation by agreeing to treat Canadian companies the same as American ones on some projects.
 And in his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama embraced a goal espoused by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: doubling American exports in the next five years, which the administration says would create two million jobs. 
 Commerce Secretary Gary Locke last week laid out details of the initiative, including promotional, logistical and financing help for small and medium businesses. ''A positive sign,'' said Myron Brilliant, a trade analyst at the chamber. 
 Yet the administration has still not resolved the longstanding dispute that is keeping long-haul Mexican trucks out of the United States, despite what is called for by Nafta. The Teamsters union has resisted that step, on safety grounds.
 Nor has Mr. Obama asked Congress to ratify three trade agreements negotiated during the Bush administration, with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. His negotiators continue to seek more concessions -- in the case of South Korea, better terms for American auto companies.
 ''The administration is not interested in putting forth an agreement that's unfair to U.S. companies,'' Mr. Locke said in an interview.
 Pressure All Around
 Mr. Obama was also pressed on trade in his recent public meeting with House Republicans -- but from the opposite direction. Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois blamed Democratic resistance in Congress for blocking the ''no-cost job creation'' that those pending trade deals would bring, and asked the president whether he would work with Republicans to push those deals through.
 ''You're right, there are conflicts within and fissures within the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Obama acknowledged. But he remained vague on next steps.
 If that tentativeness avoids a fight with organized labor, it may also conflict with Mr. Obama's larger economic goals.
 Unless the South Korea, Panama and Colombia trade deals are implemented, ''the president will have no hope at all of keeping his promise to create two million new jobs,'' said Jim Bacchus, a trade lawyer, former Democratic congressman from Florida and onetime World Trade Organization official. 
 Chamber officials calculated that failure to implement those agreements would cost the economy 383,400 jobs. But they remained hopeful that, eventually, the White House would move forward rather than abandon them.
 ''I think the administration will wait until the political environment is a little bit better, which means after the midterms,'' said Mr. Brilliant, the chamber trade analyst. ''The words are encouraging, but we need action.''

HEADLINE: Obama Challenges Terrorism Critics

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House pushed back Sunday against Republican criticism of its approach to terrorism, calling it ''not anchored in reality'' as a national security debate that was largely muted in recent years roared back to center stage with an angry intensity.
 After a week of sustained attacks led by former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and a host of Congressional Republicans, President Obama and his aides argued that they were handling terror suspects much as the previous administration did, dismissing Republican complaints as politically motivated. 
 ''The most important thing for the public to understand is we're not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them all through 9/11,'' Mr. Obama told CBS News on Sunday. ''They prosecuted 190 folks in these Article Three courts,'' he added, referring to civilian courts. ''Got convictions. And those folks are in maximum security prisons right now. And there have been no escapes.'' 
 Mr. Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, was more scathing about the Republican criticism. ''Quite frankly, I am tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football,'' Mr. Brennan, a longtime Central Intelligence Agency officer, who also worked under President George W. Bush, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''They are going out there, they are unknowing of the facts, and they are making charges and allegations that are not anchored in reality.''
 The White House rebuttal came a day after Ms. Palin drew rousing applause at a convention of Tea Party activists by declaring that ''we need a commander in chief, not a professor of law.'' Appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Ms. Palin followed up her critique of Mr. Obama by attacking what she called ''this perceived lackadaisical approach that he has to dealing with the terrorists.''
 The exchanges reflected a stark escalation in rhetoric in recent weeks as the uneasy truce on terrorism that existed at the beginning of the Obama presidency evaporated. The Republican critique of Mr. Obama as a Miranda-reading, soft-on-terror president attempts to tap into an historic vulnerability for Democrats, with midterm elections on the horizon and the president already on the defensive on a health care bill and the economy. 
 Strategists in both parties said the argument had gained new traction with the attempted Christmas Day bombing of an airliner, the missed deadline for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the collapse of the plan for a trial in New York of the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. Some Democrats worried that Mr. Obama was losing control of the issue politically.
 ''Terrorism has really become an issue again,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, a former president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's jumped to a much higher level because of the Christmas bomber that scared the willies out of people.'' And, he added, ''for the most part, the narrative has been taken out of the White House's hands.''
 Republicans said they were seeing growing alarm after a year of Mr. Obama's policies. ''People suspended judgment and wanted to let him play his hand,'' Karl Rove, the former adviser to Mr. Bush, said of the president. But the Christmas Day bombing attempt ''has caused doubts about how he is handling this to bubble to the surface.''
 Republicans have criticized the decision to charge Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in the Christmas Day plot as a civilian and, after a short period of interrogation, read him his Miranda rights. Mr. Brennan said Sunday that he spoke with four Republicans on Christmas night and told them that Mr. Abdulmutallab ''was in F.B.I. custody'' and cooperating. 
 Mr. Brennan said the Republicans, Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Christopher Bond of Missouri, and Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, should have understood that ''F.B.I. custody'' meant reading Miranda rights in a civilian process.
 ''None of those individuals raised any concerns with me at that point,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''They didn't say, 'Is he going into military custody?' 'Is he going to be Mirandized?' ''
 Spokesmen for the four Republicans said Sunday that the conversations with Mr. Brennan had been brief and went into no detail. They also noted that the nation's top intelligence, homeland security and counterterrorism officials were not consulted before the decision to treat Mr. Abdulmutallab as a civilian defendant.
 ''Brennan never told me of any plans to Mirandize the Christmas Day bomber,'' Mr. Bond said in a statement. ''If he had, I would have told him the administration was making a mistake.''
 Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said, ''Instead of attempting to dodge responsibility, John Brennan and this administration should focus on fixing the near-catastrophic intelligence breakdown that failed to prevent this attack.''
 In his interview, Mr. Obama rejected the Republican version of Mr. Abdulmutallab's interrogation. ''What happened was he clammed up, and after we had obtained actionable intelligence from him, that's when the F.B.I. folks on the ground then read him his Miranda rights,'' he said. ''But keep in mind, Richard Reid was read his Miranda rights five minutes after he was arrested, under the previous administration,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to the man who tried to blow up a plane with a shoe bomb in December 2001.
 ''Some of the same critics of our approach have been employing this policy for years,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama has preserved much of Mr. Bush's counterterrorism strategy. He not only continued drone missile strikes against terrorist cells in Pakistan, but he also escalated them. American troop levels in Afghanistan are tripling on his watch. He kept the surveillance program, military commissions and rendition authority he inherited, and he plans to continue holding some detainees without charges.
 But where Mr. Obama has veered away from Bush-era policies, he has drawn sharp criticism -- most notably, the decisions to close Guantanamo and ban harsh interrogation techniques, investigate allegations of past interrogation abuses by C.I.A. officers and put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed on trial in civilian court in New York City for orchestrating the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''The handling of detainee issues is going to be a huge, huge issue in the period ahead,'' said Marc A. Thiessen, a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush.
 ''For six years,'' Mr. Thiessen added, ''the left has had a field day with this, running around saying we tortured people and comparing us to the Spanish Inquisition.'' Now, he said, the politics have turned. ''It's a huge vulnerability for Obama and the Democrats, and Republicans are starting to gather their courage and talking about this.''
 Democrats see the criticism as expedience more than courage, noting that under Mr. Bush, terrorists were charged in civilian court, read Miranda rights and given lawyers.
 ''The one thing that's changed is there's now a Democratic president instead of a Republican president,'' said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. ''It's fairly obvious that a lot of the criticism is being driven by politics and not substance.''
 Republicans discovered the renewed power of terrorism in last month's special Senate election in Massachusetts. Neil Newhouse, the pollster for the Republican victor, Scott Brown, said voters responded to the way Mr. Brown framed the issue, supporting him 63 percent to 26 percent when told he favored charging suspected terrorists as enemy combatants in a military tribunal while his Democratic opponent would give them constitutional rights and a civilian trial.
 ''This moved voters more than the health care issue did,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''The terrorism stuff resonated, and it wasn't just from the advertising we did.''

HEADLINE: In Commercials, The Nostalgia Bowl

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS dangerous as it may be to generalize, it is probably safe to say that few folks think of Marcel Proust as they watch the Super Bowl. But for the advertising bowl that took place inside Super Bowl XLIV on Sunday, it was one long remembrance of things past -- with candy bars, mobile phones and beer bottles standing in for madeleines.
 Nostalgia is a critical component of the pitches from sponsors on Super Bowl Sunday. After all, the best way to appeal to a mass audience of 100 million or so Americans is usually to fill spots with paeans to the past along with catchy music, stars, special effects, talking babies and endearing animals. 
 Even so, the salutes on Sunday to bygone eras reached a peak perhaps not seen since the last time Fonzie said ''Ayyyy'' on ''Happy Days.'' The reason is, of course, the economy and the belief along Madison Avenue that tough times call for familiarity rather than risks.
 How retro was Super Bowl XLIV? Let us count the ways it resembled Super Bowl XXXIV, XXIV, XIV and even IV:
 There were celebrities of a certain age, on screen or as announcers, among them Don Rickles, for Teleflora; Abe Vigoda and Betty White, for Snickers; and Stevie Wonder, for Volkswagen. 
 Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, who first appeared together in 1983 as the hapless travelers Clark and Ellen Griswold in the movie ''National Lampoon's Vacation,'' recreated their roles for a spot for HomeAway, a service for renting vacation homes.
 A commercial for the Census Bureau was directed by Christopher Guest in a style reminiscent of the films he has written and directed, like ''This Is Spinal Tap'' (1984). 
 There were enough vintage athletes to fill a locker room -- or a trainer's room. They included Lance Armstrong, for Michelob Ultra; Charles Barkley, for Taco Bell; Brett Favre, for Hyundai; and members of the Chicago Bears ''Shuffling Crew'' who won the 1986 Super Bowl, for Boost Mobile.
 Among the old-school rock acts heard were Cheap Trick, for Audi; the Electric Light Orchestra, for Select 55 beer; Kiss, for Dr Pepper Cherry; Kool and the Gang, for the Honda Accord Crosstour; and Bill Withers, for the Dante's Inferno video game sold by Electronic Arts.
 A commercial for the 2011 Kia Sorento from Kia Motors America featured childhood toys like Sock Monkey and a teddy bear.
 Executives at Anheuser-Busch InBev changed their minds about leaving the venerable Budweiser Clydesdales out of the game and scheduled a schmaltzy spot about a horse and its pasture-mate, a bull.
 Who says nostalgia isn't what it used to be?
 Other sponsors revived several other overused Super Bowl ad tactics aimed at younger viewers. 
 Doritos, KGB and Motorola, among others, tried slapstick violence. And women were objectified by the likes of Bridgestone, Bud Light, GoDaddy, Motorola and Vizio. 
 Critters were plot devices in spots from Bridgestone, Cars.com, Coca-Cola, Denny's, Doritos, American Honda Motor, Monster.com and the TruTV cable channel, formerly Court TV. And the sight gags included men without pants, for Dockers; a depressed robot, for Intel; a bridge made of human beings, for Budweiser; and people behaving like dolphins, for Diamond Foods.
 Sigh. It may take an economic recovery, even a boom, for Super Bowl advertisers to start taking chances again.
 There were other high and low points among the commercials shown nationally on CBS during the game. The spots were among more than 40 provided to reporters before Sunday night.
 ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV The best among the eight commercials for four beer brands were the Budweiser spot that brought back the Clydesdales and a clever Bud Light commercial, reminiscent of the ''Whassup?'' phone freaks, in which guys emulated the Auto-Tuned voice of the rapper T-Pain. Agencies: DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, for Budweiser, and Cannonball, for Bud Light.
 AUDI Officious ''green police'' punish citizens who are not sufficiently eco-conscious, but an owner of an Audi A3 TDI with clean-diesel technology drives away scot-free. This misguided spot put the ''mental'' in ''environmental.'' Agency: Venables Bell & Partners.
 BRIDGESTONE One commercial had a misogynistic punch line -- a driver gives up his wife rather than his tires -- that was reminiscent of last year's sour, stereotypical spot about a talkative wife. The second commercial was far better, paying homage to ''The Hangover'' with a killer whale replacing the tiger. Agency: the Richards Group.
 COCA-COLA Cartoons came through again for Coke. In 2008, a spot with Charlie Brown, Stewie of ''Family Guy'' and Underdog was a huge hit. Two years later, a commercial featuring ''The Simpsons'' generated warm smiles. Agency: Wieden & Kennedy.
 DENNY'S Screaming chickens are silly, but the ad featuring them makes it hard for viewers to ignore that Denny's is bringing back its popular Grand Slam breakfast giveaways. Agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of Omnicom. 
 DIAMOND FOODS It's two, two, two ads in one as Diamond Foods stuffed a pair of products into a single 30-second spot. Another 30 seconds, even 15, could have made the joke -- snackers will do anything for Emerald Nuts and Pop-Secret popcorn -- more memorable. Agency: Goodby, Silverstein. 
 E*TRADEThe shtick of the talking baby was refreshed in a clever commercial that compared diversifying a stock portfolio to playing the field. Agency: Grey New York, part of the Grey Group division of WPP.
 GODADDY As tired and pointless as the ''sexy'' spots for GoDaddy were, CBS deserves plaudits for rejecting a commercial the company also wanted to run that some found homophobic. Shame on channels like Comedy Central for accepting the awful ad. Agency: In-house. 
 HOMEAWAY The Chase-D'Angelo reunion worked because the commercial made a product-focused plea: The HomeAway Web site helps travelers avoid vacations that family and friends will lampoon. Agency: Publicis in the West, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 MONSTER.COM Why did a magazine called The Beaver feel compelled to rename itself Canada's History, but a commercial for Monster.com could be devoted to a violin-playing beaver? Maybe the CBS censors believed it was a groundhog like the one in the wacky spot for TruTV. Agencies: BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, for Monster.com, and Grey New York for TruTV, owned by Time Warner.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column on Monday, about Super Bowl commercials, referred imprecisely to the career of Christopher Guest, who directed an ad for the Census Bureau. While Mr. Guest has been both writer and director for films, he was only a writer for the 1984 film ''This Is Spinal Tap.'' An accompanying picture caption misstated the age of ''The Simpsons'' animated television show, some of whose characters appeared in a Coca-Cola ad. The show's first episode was shown on Dec. 17, 1989, and it is now in its 21st season; it does not turn 20 this year. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: This year, the familiar faces were a bit more familiar, like Betty White.
 Coke used characters from ''The Simpsons,'' which turns 20 this year.

 A survey by the Association of National Advertisers, New York, reported that companies were planning to reduce their marketing budgets by smaller amounts than they had during the financial crisis. Seven percent of respondents said they intended to cut their budgets by more than 20 percent, compared with 20 percent that said so last summer. Forty-one percent said they planned to cut their budgets by only 1 to 5 percent, compared with 22 percent that said so last summer. ''Our series of surveys suggest that the deepest cuts may have already been made,'' Robert D. Liodice, president and chief executive at the association, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Asia's Economies Prove Resilient Despite the Danger of Deficits

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and KEITH BRADSHER; Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
While rising government debt is a growing concern in Europe and the United States, Asia's economies remain remarkably resilient, even buoyant, underscoring how economic might is shifting from West to East.
 China has been repaying some of what little foreign debt it owes, even as economists wonder whether Greece will require an international bailout and ask how long the United States can sustain record budget deficits. ''We took a pass on the economic crisis,'' said Philip S. Carmichael, president of Asian operations at Haier, China's biggest appliance maker.
 Even the Asian economies that have shrunk during the recession, like Malaysia and Cambodia, escaped the worst ravages -- with the notable exception of Japan, Asia's first industrialized country. Because of the Asian financial crisis of 1997, many Asian countries have been more conservative about borrowing and spending over the last decade than Western nations, which went on a debt binge during the good times and continued to increase their borrowing during the recession to try to turn around their economies. 
 Many economists say countries have to spend during recessions, increasing deficits and debts. But investors and economists alike worry about the long-term effect of mammoth debt on the vitality of Europe and the United States. The longer it takes Western capitals to confront their overspending, the higher and more rapid Asia's rise will be, many economists say. 
 Even though Asian stock markets fell last week, analysts say there is no obvious Asian equivalent to, say, Greece. Investors see little risk of default among even heavily indebted countries like India and Japan. 
 In India, the government's debt is nearly 80 percent of the gross domestic product, but it owes more than 90 percent of that money to its own citizens. Of the rest, a big chunk is held by agencies like the World Bank, which, are not likely to press for quick repayment.
 Compared to Greece, ''the threat of these two defaulting is nowhere close, and the reason is that, thanks to high domestic savings rates, their debt is almost all domestically financed,'' said Kim Eng Tan, a sovereign debt analyst in the Singapore office of Standard and Poor's.
 ''If you sell bonds to your own citizens, and you do it in your own currency, you don't have much of a problem,'' said Ajay Kapur, the chief global strategist for Mirae Asset, a big South Korean financial services company.
 China has been repaying some of its small external debt as it comes due, a luxury that a country with more than $2 trillion in foreign reserves can afford. 
 China showed a government budget surplus for the first 11 months of last year, but Western economists still expect a small deficit for the entire year because agencies tend to go on spending binges every December to avoid returning unspent money.
 A few smaller Asian nations have had difficulties in the last year and a half. But they have been hurt more often by political strains than by economic troubles. Like Greece, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have relied heavily over the years on overseas borrowing. That started to dry up in late 2008, as fighting with insurgents in both countries began to scare off foreign lenders. Both ended up receiving assistance from the International Monetary Fund, and that has shored up their finances, at least for now.
 Thailand and the Fiji Islands both had ratings downgrades last year because of civil unrest as well, although neither required I.M.F. assistance.
 The Asian country hurt the most by the global financial crisis was arguably Mongolia, where a steep but temporary decline in world copper prices prompted the government to obtain a $224 million I.M.F. loan in March.
 Though the risk of a full-blown sovereign debt crisis in Asia may seem remote, economists say there are other reasons that investors and policy makers should be concerned about high deficits.
 In India, the growing fiscal deficit -- which reached 8 percent of G.D.P. last year, up from 3.3 percent in 2008 -- could damp growth by making it harder and more expensive for corporations and individuals to borrow money, said Ila Patniak, a senior fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. 
 India's policy makers have signaled that they intend to pare the deficit by selling stakes in government-owned companies and reducing subsidies on fuel and fertilizers. Analysts point out that Indian governments have long promised those reforms but have struggled to deliver them due to internal political pressures.
 China, too, has internal conflicts -- between rural and urban populations and between Beijing and the disparate governments in the provinces -- that make fiscal policy more difficult. 
 But the debt problems faced by Asian nations are neither as immediate nor as far-reaching as the growing debt in Europe and the United States.

HEADLINE: A Well-Written War, Told in the First Person

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; James Dao contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Brian Turner was focused on staying alive, not poetry, when he served as an infantry team leader in Iraq. But he quickly saw that his experience -- ''a year of complete boredom punctuated by these very intense moments'' -- lent itself to the tautness of verse.
 The result was a collection called ''Here, Bullet,'' with a title poem inspired by Mr. Turner's realization during combat patrols that he was bait to lure the enemy. 
 If a body is what you want, 
 then here is bone and gristle and flesh, 
 ... because here, Bullet,
 here is where the world ends, every time.
 ''Poetry was the perfect vehicle,'' said Mr. Turner, who had a master's in fine arts from the University of Oregon before joining the Army. ''The page was the place where I could think about what had happened.''
 Mr. Turner is a literal foot soldier in what might be called the well-written war: a recent outpouring of memoirs, fiction, poetry, blogs and even some readable military reports by combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Soldier-writers have long produced American literature, from Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs about the Civil War to Norman Mailer's World War II novel, ''The Naked and the Dead,'' to Tim O'Brien's ''The Things They Carried,'' about Vietnam.
 The current group is different. As part of a modern all-volunteer force, they explore the timeless theme of the futility of war -- but wars that they for the most part support. The books, many written as rites of passage by members of a highly educated young officer corps, are filled with gore, inept commanders and anguish over men lost in combat, but not questions about the conflicts themselves. ''They look at war as an aspect of glory, of finding honor,'' said Mr. O'Brien, who was drafted for Vietnam in 1968 out of Macalester College in St. Paul. ''It's almost an old-fashioned, Victorian way of looking at war.''
 The writers say one goal is to explain the complexities of the wars -- Afghan and Iraqi politics, technology, the counterinsurgency doctrine of protecting local populations rather than just killing bad guys -- to a wider audience. Their efforts, embraced by top commanders, have even bled into military reports that stand out for their accessible prose.
 ''The importance of good official writing is so critical in reaching a broader audience to get people to understand what we're trying to do,'' said Capt. Matt Pottinger, a Marine and former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is a co-author of the report ''Fixing Intel,'' an indictment of American intelligence-gathering efforts in Afghanistan released last month. ''Even formal military doctrine is well served by a colloquial style of writing.''
 The report, overseen by the top military intelligence officer in Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, is an anecdote-rich argument against intelligence officers who pursue secrets about insurgents but ignore data for winning the war right in front of them -- local economics, village politics and tribal power brokers. The report compares the American war in Afghanistan to a political campaign, ''albeit a violent one,'' and observes, ''To paraphrase former Speaker of the House Thomas P. 'Tip' O'Neill's famous quote, 'all counterinsurgency is local.' ''
 Another report, an unreleased Army history about the battle of Wanat in July 2008 -- the ''Black Hawk Down'' of Afghanistan -- unfolds in stiffer prose but builds a strong narrative. Written by Douglas R. Cubbison, a military historian at the Army's Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., the draft report lays bare the failures of an American unit to engage the local population in a village in eastern Afghanistan -- ''these people, they disgust me,'' one soldier is quoted as saying -- and graphically tells the story of the firefight that killed nine Americans.
 Most of the writing by combatants has been memoirs that bear witness to battles of their own. Craig M. Mullaney, a former Ranger and Army captain, writes in ''The Unforgiving Minute'' of a 2003 ambush on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border that killed one of his men, Pfc. Evan W. O'Neill.
 ''Small-caliber rounds dented the Humvees around me, but it was strangely silent, as if someone had pressed the mute button. ... All I could remember were those eyes, glacial-blue, like my brother's. There's no way O'Neill's dead. This wasn't a game or an exercise or a movie; these were real soldiers with real blood and real families waiting back home. What had I done wrong?''
 Mr. Mullaney, who has left the Army and is now a Pentagon official handling policy for Central Asia, said he wrote his book in part as catharsis, and as a way of telling Private O'Neill's parents what had happened to their son. ''I had a lot of ghosts I was still wrestling with,'' he said. ''I thought by writing I could make some sense of this jumble of experiences and memories and doubts and fears.''
 Nathaniel C. Fick, a former Marine officer who wrote of taking heavy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq in ''One Bullet Away,'' had his own troubles coming home. Mr. Fick, now the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, a military research group in Washington, also appears in Evan Wright's book (and the HBO miniseries) ''Generation Kill,'' based on Mr. Wright's experience as a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with Mr. Fick's platoon.
 Mr. Fick, a Dartmouth graduate who applied to graduate school after leaving the Marines, describes getting a call from an admissions officer.
 '' 'Mr. Fick, we read your application and liked it very much. But a member of our committee read Evan Wright's story about your platoon in Rolling Stone. You're quoted as saying, ''The bad news is, we won't get much sleep tonight; the good news is, we get to kill people.'' ' She paused, as if waiting for me to disavow the quote. I was silent, and she went on .... 'Could you please explain your quote for me?' ...
 '' 'You mean, will I climb your clock tower and pick people off with a hunting rifle?'
 ''It was her turn to be silent.
 '' 'No, I will not. Do I feel compelled to explain myself to you? I don't.' '' 
 Other books started as soldier blogs, at least before commanders shut them, among them ''My War'' by Colby Buzzell, a former machine gunner in Iraq. Another soldier's blog, shut by the Army in 2008 but to be published as a book in April, is ''Kaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage Little War,'' by Matt Gallagher, a former Army officer in Iraq. 
 There are far fewer books by women, but one of them, ''Love My Rifle More than You'' by Kayla Williams, an Arabic-speaking former sergeant in a military intelligence company, is particularly critical of the military. (Ms. Williams writes of how she was instructed to verbally humiliate a naked Iraqi prisoner in Mosul.)
 So far there are relatively few novels, although ''The Mullah's Storm'' by Tom Young, a flight engineer in the Air National Guard, is to be published in the fall. The story is about a soldier shot down in Afghanistan.
 Mr. O'Brien, whose own memoir, ''If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home,'' was published in 1973, said that the dearth of novels did not surprise him. His first war novel, ''Going After Cacciato,'' was not published until 1978. ''The Things They Carried'' was published in 1990. Soldiers need more time to explore ''what happened inside,'' Mr. O'Brien said -- suggesting that the flow of their war books will not stop anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Q & A With Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Q: (Reader)
 This is in response to the question last week about seeing more fathers with daughters in ads. Here's my take on it: Marketers are reacting to the realities of current statistics and shifting roles at home. 
 As Iconoculture has noted, the recession has resulted in higher job-loss rates for men than women (and perhaps hair loss, but that's another story). Baby-boomer men in particular have been above the national average for unemployment and women have been below it. 
 Combine that with the longer-term trends of women outpacing men in education and you've got more women becoming primary breadwinners -- and more men embracing the role of at-home dads. 
 My guess is that you will see more ads with at-home dads and even more ads with breadwinner moms. Moms will still be the lead decision-makers for years to come, but the fathers' opinions might carry a little more weight.
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 Thanks, dear reader, for your theory. I can understand from what you suggest why we are seeing more at-home dads in ads, but why are so many of their children girls rather than boys? Readers, other theories are welcome. 
 Q: (Reader)
 I just read your feature last week about the new campaign for Colonial Williamsburg. Good story.
 I am a biased observer. We were huge fans and frequent visitors when we lived in Atlanta (we are now on the West Coast). That said, this is a fitting shift in the foundation's advertising emphasis. 
 It was not uncommon for friends to look at us quizzically when we enthusiastically recommended a ''museum'' as a great vacation destination. I think they just wrote us off as overeducated history geeks. 
 But a few took us up on our suggestion and the universal response was similar to our own: a whole lot more interesting and informative than another trip to a Universal theme park or Disneyland, and more active than Myrtle Beach, S.C., or Panama City, Fla., with decent golf and shopping to go along with the history.
 My wife and I always found the programs thought-provoking. And whichever ages our kids were, starting as young as 6 to as old as 18, they were always ready to return. It was a great tool to engage them in thinking about current events. By the way, if anyone doubts this, you should schedule your first visit for an Independence Day holiday.
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 Thanks, dear reader, for sharing your enthusiasm.

HEADLINE: An Uneven World of Debt

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Whether he likes it or not, Jean-Claude Trichet is not just the president of the European Central Bank. Mr. Trichet, 67, is also the de facto president of Europe, at least for the 16 nations that rely on the euro as their common currency. 
 On paper, the European Union has just established a new president in Brussels, and the central bank's sole responsibility is to keep inflation in check. Moreover, the bank, based here, has almost no formal policy tools to help an ailing member country like Greece. 
 But as investor alarm about Greek, Spanish and Portuguese indebtedness increases, the crisis has highlighted the fundamental weakness of the European monetary union. With no strong political arm to ensure that members observe debt limits set by treaty, the responsibility falls to Mr. Trichet to try to resolve the crisis.
 In the current situation, said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, only the bank's president ''has the authority and the expertise'' to manage the situation.
 On Saturday, Mr. Trichet told reporters at a meeting in Canada of the Group of 7 finance ministers and central bank presidents that he was confident that Greece would meet tough new belt-tightening goals.
 ''We expect and we are confident that the Greek government will take all the decisions that will permit it to reach that goal,'' Mr. Trichet said, according to Reuters.
 Just a couple of days earlier, Mr. Trichet lectured European governments on the need to swiftly pare their budget deficits. ''When you share a single currency with others, the counterpart is that you have to have a sound fiscal policy,'' he said during a briefing in conjunction with the bank's monthly policy meeting.
 But then, in a gesture that did little initially to calm nervous investors, Mr. Trichet pointed out that the overall deficit level among euro countries, at about 6 percent of gross domestic product, was still well below that of the United States and Japan, which are each set to borrow more than 10 percent of their G.D.P.'s this year.
 Mr. Trichet delivers such comments in excellent English with a distinct French accent. Though he can be stern, he sometimes displays a dry sense of humor. Before the G-7 meeting on Saturday, he joked that by gathering in frozen Canadian territory, ''we will have just the right environment to be as cool as possible in judging the situation.'' 
 Mr. Trichet sometimes maintains that problems with individual euro nations should be of no greater concern to Europe's central bank than the fiscal problems of an individual state are to the Federal Reserve in Washington. After being peppered with questions about Greece on Thursday, Mr. Trichet responded: ''I doubt that, in a press conference, Ben Bernanke would have a question on Alaska or Massachusetts.''
 In fact, Mr. Trichet needs to be more outspoken than Mr. Bernanke because Mr. Trichet operates with many more constraints.
 The lack of a strong central government to back up the euro is the most obvious difference. Since last month, the European Council, the body that represents the 27 national governments in the European Union, has had a president for the first time, Herman Van Rompuy. But he has few powers to discipline the 16 euro members.
 ''The ultimate problem is the nonexistence of a political union,'' said Mr. Kramer, the Commerzbank economist. ''This is the big, big reason behind all the problems we are talking about.''
 The other big difference is that the central bank, unlike the Fed, is prevented from buying government bonds or offering direct support to troubled banks within its sphere. During the recent financial crisis, however, the bank showed it was able to find creative ways of bolstering the European banking system. It vastly expanded the volume of lending to banks, thus helping to avoid a more serious credit crisis. 
 In the current situation, the bank is aiding Greece by accepting Greek bonds as collateral that banks in Greece can use to borrow money. As long as Greece maintains its current credit ratings, the bonds qualify under central bank rules.
 If the crisis worsens, it would fall to European governments to arrange a rescue of Greece or any other ailing country, like Portugal. While wanting to avoid anything that encourages further reckless borrowing and excessive government spending, they have indicated they will do whatever it takes to prevent a sovereign default of a euro member.
 But the European Commission, the union's executive body, lacks the expertise to manage the delicate mixture of carrots and sticks that would be involved in any bailout, economists say. Last year, when growth collapsed in countries in Eastern Europe like Latvia, Hungary and Romania, Brussels essentially outsourced the rescue to the International Monetary Fund.
 European leaders do not want to turn to the I.M.F. for help rescuing a member of the euro zone, its core unit.
 That probably leaves them with the alternative of advancing aid funds, issuing bonds on behalf of Greece that would be backed by other European countries or guaranteeing Greek bonds.
 While the central bank itself cannot supply the money, Mr. Trichet is bound to play a discreet but influential behind-the-scenes role. He has the advantage of being able to speak his mind without worrying about being elected.
 That becomes a greater concern as European taxpayers become aware of how much a rescue may cost them. 
 Many seem resigned to some sort of bailout. Martin Mann, a proprietor of a Frankfurt wine shop, said that he expected the European Union to pay for Greece one way or another. 
 Asked if that made him angry, Mr. Mann shrugged. ''As a taxpayer, I already have to pay the bill for so many messes created by other people,'' he said. ''I would have to be mad every day.''

HEADLINE: Irked, Wall St. Hedges Its Bet On Democrats

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If the Democratic Party has a stronghold on Wall Street, it is JPMorgan Chase. 
 Its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is a friend of President Obama's from Chicago, a frequent White House guest and a big Democratic donor. Its vice chairman, William M. Daley, a former Clinton administration cabinet official and Obama transition adviser, comes from Chicago's Democratic dynasty. 
 But this year Chase's political action committee is sending the Democrats a pointed message. While it has contributed to some individual Democrats and state organizations, it has rebuffed solicitations from the national Democratic House and Senate campaign committees. Instead, it gave $30,000 to their Republican counterparts.
 The shift reflects the hard political edge to the industry's campaign to thwart Mr. Obama's proposals for tighter financial regulations. 
 Just two years after Mr. Obama helped his party pull in record Wall Street contributions -- $89 million from the securities and investment business, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics -- some of his biggest supporters, like Mr. Dimon, have become the industry's chief lobbyists against his regulatory agenda. 
 Republicans are rushing to capitalize on what they call Wall Street's ''buyer's remorse'' with the Democrats. And industry executives and lobbyists are warning Democrats that if Mr. Obama keeps attacking Wall Street ''fat cats,'' they may fight back by withholding their cash. 
 ''If the president doesn't become a little more balanced and centrist in his approach, then he will likely lose that support,'' said Kelly S. King, the chairman and chief executive of BB&T. Mr. King is a board member of the Financial Services Roundtable, which lobbies for the biggest banks, and last month he helped represent the industry at a private dinner at the Treasury Department. 
 ''I understand the public outcry,'' he continued. ''We have a 17 percent real unemployment rate, people are hurting, and they want to see punishment. But the political rhetoric just incites more animosity and gets people riled up.''
 A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on its political action committee's contributions or relations with the Democrats. But many Wall Street lobbyists and executives said they, too, were rethinking their giving.
 ''The expectation in Washington is that 'We can kick you around, and you are still going to give us money,' '' said a top official at a major Wall Street firm, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating the White House. ''We are not going to play that game anymore.'' 
 Wall Street fund-raisers for the Democrats say they are feeling under attack from all sides. The president is lashing out at their ''arrogance and greed.'' Republican friends are saying ''I told you so.'' And contributors are wishing they had their money back. 
 ''I am a big fan of the president,'' said Thomas R. Nides, a prominent Democrat who is also a Morgan Stanley executive and chairman of a major Wall Street trade group, the Securities and Financial Markets Association. ''But even if you are a big fan, when you are the pinata at the party, it doesn't really feel good.''
 Roger C. Altman, a former Clinton administration Treasury official who founded the Wall Street boutique Evercore Partners, called the Wall Street backlash against Mr. Obama ''a constant topic of conversation.'' Many bankers, he said, failed to appreciate the ''white hot anger'' at Wall Street for the financial crisis. (Mr. Altman said he personally supported ''the substance'' of the president's recent proposals, though he questioned their feasibility and declined to comment at all on what he called ''the rhetoric.'')
 Mr. Obama's fight with Wall Street began last year with his proposals for greater oversight of compensation and a consumer financial protection commission. It escalated with verbal attacks this year on what he called Wall Street's ''obscene bonuses.'' And it reached a new level in his calls for policies Wall Street finds even more infuriating: a ''financial crisis responsibility'' tax aimed only at the biggest banks, and a restriction on ''proprietary trading'' that banks do with their own money for their own profit.
 ''If the president wanted to turn every Democrat on Wall Street into a Republican,'' one industry lobbyist said, ''he is doing everything right.''
 Though Wall Street has long been a major source of Democratic campaign money (alongside Hollywood and Silicon Valley), Mr. Obama built unusually direct ties to his contributors there. He is the first president since Richard M. Nixon whose campaign relied solely on private donations, not public financing.
 Wall Street lobbyists say the financial industry's big Democratic donors help ensure that their arguments reach the ears of the president and Congress. White House visitors' logs show dozens of meetings with big Wall Street fund-raisers, including Gary D. Cohn, a president of Goldman Sachs; Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; and Robert Wolf, the chief of the American division of the Swiss bank UBS, who has also played golf, had lunch and watched July 4 fireworks with the president. 
 Lobbyists say they routinely brief top executives on policy talking points before they meet with the president or others in the administration. Mr. Wolf, in particular, also serves on the Presidential Economic Recovery Advisory Board led by the former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. 
 Mr. Wolf was the only Wall Street executive on the panel and became the board's leading opponent of what became known as the Volcker rule against so-called proprietary trading, according to participants. Such trading did nothing to cause the crisis, Mr. Wolf argued, as the industry lobbyists do now. (The panel concluded that the crisis established a precedent for government rescue that could enable big banks to speculate for their own gain while taxpayers took the biggest risks.)
 Mr. Wolf and Mr. Dimon, who was in Washington last week for meetings on Capitol Hill and lunch with the president, have both pressed the industry's arguments against other proposed regulations and the bank tax as well -- saying the rules could cramp needed lending and send business abroad, according to lobbyists.
 Both men are said to remain personally supportive of the president. But UBS's political action committee has shifted its contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. After dividing its money evenly between the parties for 2008, it has given about 56 percent to Republicans this cycle. 
 Most of its biggest contributions, of $10,000 each, went to five Republican opponents of Mr. Obama's regulatory proposals, including Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking minority member of the Banking Committee. 
 The Democratic campaign committees declined to comment on Wall Street money. But their Republican rivals are actively courting it.
 Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he visited New York about twice a month to try to tap into Wall Street's ''buyers' remorse.'' 
 ''I just don't know how long you can expect people to contribute money to a political party whose main plank of their platform is to punish you,'' Mr. Cornyn said.

HEADLINE: After Turmoil at Merrill, Thain Will Lead the Lender CIT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Over his 30-year career, John A. Thain has risen to top executive positions at Goldman Sachs, the New York Stock Exchange and Merrill Lynch.
 On Monday, he will start over at a humbler institution: the CIT Group, the lender to small and midsize businesses that emerged two months ago from a swift bankruptcy.
 In doing so, Mr. Thain, 54, is seeking to leave behind the controversies that haunted his final days at Merrill after it was acquired by Bank of America, a deal he helped engineer to save the brokerage during the height of the financial crisis. 
 As CIT's new chairman and chief executive, he will try to rebuild a company whose bet on increasingly risky businesses led it to the brink of dissolution, only to be saved at the last minute by its creditors. 
 CIT also bears the ignominy of being the first company in which the government realized a loss under its $700 billion federal bailout program. Taxpayers' $2.3 billion investment was wiped out by the Chapter 11 reorganization. When it ran into trouble last summer, CIT failed to persuade its regulators to give it another bailout and was forced to rely on its large investors for help.
 Now CIT is positioning itself as a crucial player in the administration's effort to preserve and create jobs; it is one of the main providers of capital to businesses like small merchandisers and Dunkin' Donuts. 
 ''What attracted me here is that CIT is a company that's very important to small- and medium-size businesses,'' Mr. Thain said in an interview on Sunday. ''If we're going to see the U.S. economy continue to grow and see new jobs, we have to provide financing to those companies.''
 Mr. Thain was forced out of Bank of America in 2009 amid controversy over billions of dollars in losses at Merrill, lavish spending on renovations to his office and several huge bonus payouts to Merrill employees. Since then, he has kept a low profile, considering job opportunities in areas like private equity. But he was approached by an executive search firm hired by CIT about two months ago.
 ''We saw tremendous upside to John,'' John Ryan, CIT's lead director, said in an interview on Sunday. ''We think of him as an Olympic-class athlete with a lot of potential going forward. He's the best person to position us to become profitable again.''
 Jeffrey H. Aronson, a co-founder and managing principal of Centerbridge, a large CIT shareholder, said the firm supported the move. ''Following its successful restructuring, CIT is well-positioned to continue its role as a leading lender to small businesses and the middle market,'' he said. ''John Thain is a skilled and proven business builder.''
 Mr. Thain's hiring was cleared by CIT's regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Treasury Department, which still has a say over the company's executive compensation despite the loss of the bailout investment.
 Mr. Thain's pay at CIT will be lower than he has made in years, according to people briefed on the matter. He will receive a $500,000 base salary, along with $5.5 million worth of restricted stock, much of which must be held for one to three years. He will also receive an additional discretionary payment of $1.5 million in restricted shares, which will vest over two years.
 He pointed to his tenure at the New York Stock Exchange as a precedent, where he helped it rethink its business model. He took the exchange public, doing away with its long-held tradition of membership seats, and helped give it an international presence.
 Mr. Thain must find a way to curtail CIT's dependence on short-term debt markets for financing, a source of capital that dried up after the financial crisis.
 CIT has pledged to move more of its operations into a bank subsidiary based in Utah and focus on the same kind of staid lending to small and midsize businesses that was its mainstay for decades. Mr. Thain must also hire a new senior management team, one that may include Nelson Chai, his former deputy at the N.Y.S.E. and Merrill Lynch.
 ''I'm optimistic, but these things are not easy,'' Mr. Thain said.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about the hiring of John A. Thain as chairman and chief executive of the CIT Group misstated the role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in his selection. While the F.D.I.C. was consulted by CIT about Mr. Thain's hiring, it did not ''clear'' the appointment.

HEADLINE: With Just $100, It's Not How Much You Give, But How Imaginatively

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS

 BODY:
Andrew Marantz paid strangers to walk through Bryant Park holding hands and sharing secrets. Joshua Krafchin walked up and down a B train begging people -- to take his money.
 Amy Coenen placed 20 $5 bills, each inscribed with quotations on the theme of giving, in places around the city -- the straw container at a Starbucks, the floor of an apartment building lobby -- where they might be found and inspire generosity.
 And Helen Coster slipped the whole $100 into a thank-you card and asked a friend to hand it to the clerk at Duane Reade who regularly cheers her up.
 As acts of philanthropy go, none of the above would rate particularly high on any measure of effectiveness. They do get points for creativity, however, which, to Courtney Martin, the 30-year-old minor-league benefactor who spawned them, is an undervalued aspect of charitable giving. ''Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted,'' she likes to say, quoting a fellow maladjust, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
 Ms. Martin is not a civil rights leader. She's a Brooklyn-based writer who, five years ago, was shocked to find herself in possession of a six-figure book advance. She wanted to give a chunk of it away, but was not sure how. So she decided she would make it someone else's problem -- nine other people's problems. She chose nine thoughtful friends, gave them each $100, and told them they would be expected to account for what they had done with it at a gathering a month later.
 Heart-warming high jinks have ensued ever since. Saturday night marked the fourth annual dance-crazed celebration of what Ms. Martin calls the Secret Society for Creative Philanthropy. Since that first year, Ms. Martin has been joined by several other small-time philanthropists, who bestow multiples of $100 on admired acquaintances. This year 16 inductees committed creative acts of kindness, some of them kooky, most of them thoughtful.
 Someone is publishing the writing of New York students in a nonprofit literacy program. Someone else bought a video camera for a public high school in Canarsie, Brooklyn. One recipient, who runs a Web site to encourage female writers, decided to give the money to the most frequent commenter on the site, who turned out to be a former correction officer with dreams of a life in the arts. Several people doubled down by donating $100 of their own money, part of the ripple effect that so often gives small, charmed gestures reach beyond their scope. (The ripples go as far as San Francisco and Athens, Ga., where others have started their own chapters of the Secret Society.)
 There's nothing original or YouTube-worthy about sending $100 to help in Haiti, but people did that, too, which also thrilled Ms. Martin (who said she also gave considerably more money to traditional nonprofits). ''I could not argue giving away 100 flowers is as important as giving money to Paul Farmer,'' Ms. Martin said of the anthropologist who helped found the medical charity Partners in Health. But, she added, there's something to be said for ''a visceral engagement with joy and spontaneity, and injecting more of that into our lives.''
 It's a great technological trick that it now takes no more than a text message to send $10 to Haiti. But with that simplicity comes a certain passivity. There is a benefit, too, to having a creative challenge built into some personal charitable giving -- innovation of all kinds requires ownership, reinvention, elaborate consideration.
 What if every philanthropist had to get up in front of some party of their peers and riff about how they had spent their money? All kudos to Bill Gates, but how might he surprise the world with an infinitesimal portion of his foundation dollars if he had his monologue at a Secret Society gala in mind?
 Or what if every average Joe just made a pact with his five best friends that they would get together once a year and share how they donated their money? To start, they'd surely get around to actually donating that money: and yes, accountability is as much the point for Ms. Martin as celebration.
 Ms. Martin does not harbor illusions of global impact. For her, there's elation in thinking small, in considering what even the most starving writers or unemployed marketers or over-mortgaged homeowners can do.
 One young teacher who used the $100 to buy notebooks and food for a writer's group with two former students has since given each of them $50 of his own to give away. And one of the subway riders who took $25 from Mr. Krafchin told him she was going to send it on to Haiti relief.
 The urge to pay it forward was in evidence Saturday night at the party, held at the Underwater Lounge in Brooklyn. Kamy Wicoff, the 37-year-old founder of that social network for female writers, high on the energy of the event, suddenly felt a surge of generosity toward the bartender.
 ''In times like this, we all could use a boost beyond the classic philanthropy,'' she recalled thinking. So she left her a fat tip: $100 felt exactly right.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Plan $78.5 Million Effort to Keep Dangerous Carp Out of Great Lakes

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Bernie Becker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Federal authorities on Monday presented a $78.5 million plan intended to block Asian carp, a hungry, huge, nonnative fish, from invading the Great Lakes. 
 The threat has grown increasingly tense throughout the region in recent months as genetic material from the fish was found near and even in Lake Michigan. 
 In a meeting in Washington with leaders of some Great Lakes states, officials from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies laid out an ''Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework'' to ensure that the fish, known to take over entire ecosystems, do not establish themselves in the lakes.
 The state officials said they appreciated that the federal government was stepping in, but at least one said the plan did not go far enough. 
 So far, DNA material -- but no actual fish -- has been found in Lake Michigan, and federal officials want to improve the search with additional physical and sonar monitoring, faster testing, more nets, electric shocks and other measures. 
 The plan, which would be paid for mostly with federal money already promised to Great Lakes restoration efforts, calls for new barriers to prevent flooding that might allow the spread of the fish. It also seeks completion of a third electric barrier aimed at preventing the fish, which have already made homes in the Mississippi River system, from traveling through the waterways that lead to the Great Lakes. 
 The plan suggests that navigational locks along those waterways, which connect to Lake Michigan and are crucial to commercial barge traffic in the Chicago area, could be opened less often than they are now as a way to slow the carp.
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said the measures were inadequate, particularly the notion of opening the locks less frequently. ''They just need to shut the locks down, at least temporarily,'' Ms. Granholm said in a telephone interview after the meeting. 
 She added that some type of modified schedule for closing the locks would hardly stop the fish from swimming. 
 Everyone agrees that the carp should be kept out of the Great Lakes, which contain 20 percent of the world's freshwater, but economic interests appear to have divided state officials.
 Leaders from Michigan and other states point to the risks the carp pose to the fishing industry here, valued at $7 billion a year. But officials in Chicago worry about closing waterways between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River because of a barge industry that carries millions of tons of gravel, coal, cement and salt along that path.
 Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat, described Monday's meeting as ''productive'' and said he looked ''forward to working with all parties to protect the Great Lakes.'' 
 But Mike Cox, the Michigan attorney general who has filed a lawsuit against Illinois and other parties demanding that the locks be closed, was critical. He described the federal plans as ''half-measures and gimmicks'' inclined toward Chicago's wishes. 
 ''President Obama proved today that he'll do anything to protect the narrow interests of his home state of Illinois,'' said Mr. Cox, a Republican who is running for governor, ''even if it means destroying Michigan's economy.''

HEADLINE: Newsstand Sales and Circulation Fall for Magazines

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
In another tough stretch for the magazine business, newsstand sales and subscriptions declined in the last six months of 2009. The only good news: the rate of decline is getting less steep for newsstand sales.
 Newsstand sales for the almost 500 consumer magazines in the United States measured by the Audit Bureau of Circulations declined 9.1 percent, to 39.3 million, in the last half of 2009 versus the same period a year earlier, the organization reported on Monday. That follows a 12.36 percent decline for the first half of 2009 compared with the same period a year earlier and an 11.12 percent decline for July through December 2008 compared with the same period in 2007. 
 ''Single-copy sales are very recession sensitive -- it's a discretionary, impulse purchase,'' said Kenneth Godshall, executive vice president for consumer marketing at the industry group Magazine Publishers of America. ''We're encouraged that the rate of decline has slowed.'' 
 Some of the well-known magazines with large single-copy declines included W, down 41.7 percent to about 25,000 for an average issue; Newsweek, down 41.3 percent to about 62,000; Time, down 34.9 percent to about 90,000 (Newsweek and Time decreased the number of copies on sale, representatives said); SmartMoney, down 37 percent to about 26,000; Good Housekeeping, down 30.7 percent to 395,000; and Redbook, down 30.1 percent to 126,000.
 Newsstand sales are often a more timely indicator of a magazine's vitality than subscriptions, which tend to lag and can be driven by discounts. While newsstand sales are a small percentage of most magazines' circulation, they are a profitable part of it -- publishers typically charge several times more for a newsstand copy than they charge for a subscription copy. Newsstand sales also attract new readers.
 Overall circulation, including subscriptions, fell 2.23 percent, a sharper decline than in the last two six-month periods, where subscriptions fell 1.19 percent (January to June 2009 versus the same period a year earlier) and 0.86 percent (July to December 2008 versus the same period a year earlier). 
 ''Subscriptions have been pretty stable for the last few years, so we're not sure what's happening here,'' Mr. Godshall said. ''It could be recession-related, it could be magazines attempting higher prices,'' or it could be magazines cutting down on the extra copies they print.
 There were some bright spots, though. Off-Road Adventures magazine had the highest percentage increase in circulation, rising 483 percent -- however, it was starting from a low base of about 41,000. Other popular magazines that had circulation spikes were Rodale's Women's Health, which rose 21.5 percent to 1.45 million; the Disney magazine FamilyFun, which rose 16.7 percent to 2.2 million; and American Rifleman, published by the National Rifle Association, which rose 20.2 percent to 1.7 million. 
 Among the 25 biggest magazines, the largest circulation declines were at TV Guide magazine, which was sold to a private equity firm in 2008. Circulation there declined more than a quarter, to 2.4 million. Reader's Digest, whose parent company is in the midst of a bankruptcy filing and which is cutting the circulation it guarantees advertisers to 5.5 million, fell 13 percent to 7.1 million. Prevention declined 13.2 percent, to 2.9 million.

HEADLINE: Writing a Law to Help Just One Company

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
When Nat Sherman, the venerable Midtown tobacconist, opened its new showroom on 42nd Street a few years ago, it quickly ran into a problem. The showroom included a private smoking lounge, known as the Johnson Club Room, where members and guests could have enjoyed a drink or a snack along with their cigars, pipes and cigarettes. But under New York law, smoking is forbidden wherever food or beverages are served to the public.
 When city officials twice rebuffed the company's requests for a waiver, Nat Sherman sought the intervention of a higher power: The New York State Legislature. 
 Two Democrats, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx and Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing of Manhattan, are sponsoring legislation that would carve out an exception specifically for the company -- or, as the bill reads, any retail tobacco business ''that was in existence prior to nineteen hundred forty-seven.'' (Nat Sherman was officially incorporated in November 1946.)
 The bill would exempt such a business from New York City's own stringent antismoking laws, otherwise known as ''any regulations or local laws adopted by a city with a population of one million or more.''
 William Sherman, Nat Sherman's vice president and grandson of the store's founder, said that the company was simply trying to iron out some kinks in a law that should never have applied to the Johnson Club Room, which is not open to the public and which does not even have a kitchen. After the city turned down the company's appeals, Mr. Sherman said he approached Mr. Klein, whom he had known for years, and Mr. Bing, whose district is home to the flagship store, for help.
 ''We were caught up in some technicalities and absurdities,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''Basically, what we were trying to do is provide a place for our customers to enjoy a bottle of water or something like that, and based on the technicalities in the city law, it was unmanageable. What we're trying to do is, in a very confined way, address some of the technicalities.''
 All involved played down the importance of the company's political contributions last year: $2,500 to Mr. Bing and $2,000 to Mr. Klein.
 ''When they called me about their plight, I thought it made sense,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I voted for the Clean Air Act, and I don't think this exposes any additional people to the dangers of smoke. It's a private club. They want to be able to smoke a cigar, and they would like to enjoy a bourbon or a single-malt scotch while they do.''
 Mr. Bing argued that the store would have been able to obtain a waiver under existing law if it had not been in the middle of moving its showroom across Fifth Avenue to the new location, since most existing cigar bars and smoking lounges were grandfathered in when the city law first went into effect in 2003. For now, patrons of the Johnson Club can light up, but cannot enjoy food or beverages. 
 ''The bill is narrowly drawn so there's one specific location,'' Mr. Bing said. ''It's a company that provides jobs and revenue throughout the city. In this difficult economic time, we should be helping businesses succeed instead of putting impediments to them doing so.''
 Others are not so sure.
 ''This bill would put private profit ahead of public health,'' said Russell Sciandra, a tobacco policy specialist for the American Cancer Society. ''In the more than six years that this law has been in effect, we've found that the health benefits of a smoke-free workplace are even greater than we expected. To allow anyone to blow a hole in the city and state laws is unconscionable.''

HEADLINE: How to Reduce the Federal Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Truth About the Deficit'' (editorial, Feb. 7):
 Without the restoration of at least five million of the over eight million American jobs lost in this recession, and the sustained creation of at least 200,000 jobs per month for the next decade, America will never truly recover from this horrible recession.
 Consumer spending and tax revenues will continue to suffer, and the federal government will be forced to keep spending and thereby increase the deficit. 
 As your editorial correctly points out, strong health care reform is needed now. True health care reform would add many well-paying jobs and reduce the huge cost of health care in this country. 
 But first and foremost is job creation across the board, in every sector. We must make meaningful progress in consumer spending and tax revenues, and the only way to do this is through full employment in America.
 Henry A. Lowenstein New York, Feb. 7, 2010
 The writer is the senior director of an executive search firm and the former chief executive of two health care companies.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial is thorough and persuasive about both the causes and the consequences of current and projected deficits. Failure to deal realistically with these deficits will almost certainly be catastrophic.
 As you indicate, entitlements like Medicare and Social Security can only become more burdensome as our population ages. The solution is both simple and morally appropriate.
 These programs should have never been labeled ''entitlements''; they were conceived of and should be administered as buffers against poverty among the elderly.
 We must apply means testing and stop handing out benefits to those who manifestly do not need them.
 Shorey H. Chapman San Francisco, Feb. 8, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial advocates ''a combination of benefit cuts and tax increases'' for Social Security. This prescription ignores the fact that the program pays its own way in full. According to the program's trustees and the Congressional Budget Office, its resources will suffice to pay full benefits for about three decades. Increasing both the employee and employer payroll tax by a mere 1 percent each would eliminate the program's 75-year projected shortfall.
 The meltdown of 401(k)s, I.R.A.'s and pensions makes Social Security benefits all the more vital for the retired and disabled and their families.
 Merton C. Bernstein Brewster, Mass., Feb. 8, 2010
 The writer, emeritus professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, served as a consultant to the 1982-83 National Commission on Social Security Reform.
 To the Editor:
 As a senior citizen, I am deeply troubled by your editorial recommending cutting Social Security benefits as seniors live longer.
 This is not an ethical way to reduce the deficit. It is a view that defines old people as of less worth. We should not consider saving health costs on the backs of old people.
 Sidney Moss Elkins Park, Pa., Feb. 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In your editorial you state that the worst possible thing to do during an economic downturn is to cut government spending because it could lead to a downward economic spiral. There's some truth to this, but equally true is that raising taxes during an economic downturn could lead to the same kind of death spiral. 
 The Obama administration sees this economic crisis more as an opportunity to permanently expand the scope and size of government than as an opportunity to help the average American worker.
 John Newman Northglenn, Colo., Feb. 8, 2010
 To the Editor:
 A big reason for the huge deficit is the $1 trillion we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Stopping the wars now would take a large bite out of our deficit. Our children and grandchildren would be grateful.
 Jordan Langner Delmar, N.Y., Feb. 8, 2010

HEADLINE: A Downward Spiral Continues as U.S. Stocks Fall Below 10,000 Benchmark

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average, a closely watched barometer of the economy's health, dipped below the 10,000 threshold on Monday, delivering a psychological setback as investors braced for more market volatility.
 When the final bell sounded, the Dow had fallen to 9,908.39 -- its lowest level in three months -- as lingering fears over a debt crisis in Europe undermined confidence in American financial institutions.
 Analysts played down the significance of the Dow's tumble below the five-digit mark. But they did not deny the broader message it underscored: that the energy of last year's rally seems to have fizzled as the market comes to terms with the reality of an uneven recovery. 
 ''Investors and traders find solace in 10,000,'' said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac. ''While it may not be important technically, falling below that level indicates that the whole economic picture is not as rosy as everyone had thought.''
 Wall Street's focus remained on Europe, where the fallout from swelling deficits in Greece, Spain and Portugal continued to sway global markets. Investors spent Monday trying to gauge how significantly American banks would suffer if European governments could not pay back their loans. They also looked at the effect foreign defaults might have on the availability of credit worldwide.
 Traders seemed skeptical of reassurances from the Group of 7 finance ministers, who pledged over the weekend to closely monitor the situation in Greece but provided no firm plans for reining in huge deficits. 
 ''You can tell investors there's no contagion, but it doesn't matter, because people start to think there's more than one cockroach,'' said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. ''Right now, it's still a little wait and see.''
 The cost of insuring debt in Greece, Spain and Portugal continued to rise on Monday, suggesting investors still lacked confidence that those nations would be able to repay their debt. 
 In the United States, the Dow fell 103.84 points, or 1.04 percent, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.89 percent, or 9.45 points, to 1,056.74. The Nasdaq composite index declined 0.7 percent, or 15.07 points, to 2,126.05.
 The Dow first rose above the 10,000 benchmark in 1999. Since then, it has proved to be one of the hardest levels to sustain. The Dow dipped back into four digits in the years after the dot-com bubble deflated, and it reached 10,000 again in late 2003 before peaking above 14,000 in October 2007. Today, the index is about 30 percent below its record high.
 In November, the Dow's surge beyond 10,000 was considered a symbol of the strength of the nascent recovery, coming in the midst of a high-powered rally for stocks. But now, as the financial world tries to regain its footing, investors worry it may take some time before the market can sustain a level above 10,000.
 ''The market has been bulletproof, and now the question is whether the reality of the recovery is in the same place,'' said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist for Bell Curve Trading. ''There's a gap there.''
 Analysts expect volatility to persist as investors assess the threat posed by Europe's deficits to the global recovery. Investors will get a preview of the government's plans to gradually withdraw stimulus measures later this week, when the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, is expected to present plans to tighten credit.
 Overseas, markets in Europe were higher after Monday a week of wild swings. The FTSE 100 in London closed 0.62 percent higher, the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.93 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 1.22 percent. 
 The euro remained near a nine-month low, trading at slightly less than $1.37, amid concern that euro-using countries would have difficulty selling bonds to finance their debt. 
 Oil, which fell 7.5 percent over two days last week, was up modestly on Monday, climbing nearly 1 percent, to $71.89 a barrel. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1/32, to 98 15/32. The yield fell to 3.56 percent from 3.57 on Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: In Northern Iraq, a Vote Seems Likely to Split on Familiar Lines

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
QARAQOSH, Iraq -- There was a hope, not long ago, that democracy would mean peace and stability for Nineveh, a place where cultures and armies have clashed since biblical times. Instead, democracy is hardening divisions -- of people, of resources, of land -- in ways that threaten the future of Iraq itself.
 Last year's election of a new provincial governor and council spawned political deadlock, inflamed by ethnic tensions. A boycott by a third of the council's new members since last summer has crippled the government's work at a time when Iraqis were promised that the elections would improve it. 
 Basic services remain meager, the economy feeble. The violence, though diminishing, is relentless, ravaging a crossroads of peoples and faiths in the plains where Arab Iraq meets the Kurdish mountains. 
 ''This is the democracy the Americans brought,'' said Hussein Mahmoud Ahmed, a Shabak, a member of a small minority group that occupies the plains. 
 It is a sentiment increasingly heard across Iraq as the country prepares to elect a new Parliament on March 7. The vote -- only the country's third since the American invasion in 2003 -- is considered crucial to forging a unified, functioning democratic state. Here in Nineveh Province, though, as elsewhere, it is highlighting Iraq's alarming fragmentation.
 Lebanon is a model Iraqis often cite, a democracy that produces gridlock among ethnic and sectarian parties as divided before elections as after them, resulting in an ever tense political paralysis. Bosnia is another. When it comes to land and borders, disputed between the Arabs and the Kurdish regional government, the divisions are as intractable as those of Israelis and Palestinians.
 When the federal government started to build a textile factory in Mr. Ahmed's village, Bartallah, in a part of Nineveh controlled by the Kurds, the Kurdish regional government halted the project lest it create jobs for workers loyal to Mosul, the largely Arab provincial capital. 
 In Qaraqosh, the ownership of land is so fraught politically that the community council created a ''black book'' to register the name of any Christian who sold property to ''an outsider.'' 
 ''We are living as doves among wolves,'' said Staifo Jamil, a leader of a community council that represents Qaraqosh, a Christian town that lives in such fear that it mustered its own irregular militia to stand watch.
 Iraq's democracy is still young, and compared with those of other countries in the region, it remains the most competitive, if not exactly robust. Voter apathy and disillusionment, however, are already taking root. The election, delayed for months by bickering in Baghdad, has become a contest not of ideas as much as for advantage in the way the vote itself will be conducted and the parliamentary seats distributed. 
 The murky process to disqualify candidates with ties to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party knocked out at least 10 candidates allied with the governor, Atheel al-Nujaifi, a Sunni who sought to restore Arab dominance in a still divided province. Among them was the mayor of Mosul, Zuhar al-Araji, who once worked closely with the American military. 
 Nineveh remains split, as it has since 2003, between Arab- and Kurdish-controlled regions. The tensions are so high that the American military this month joined troops from both sides to police the line of control along a series of new checkpoints. 
 Politicians on both sides on the line complain of restrictions when they campaign on the opposite side: harassment of candidates, pressure on parties, violence. When Mr. Nujaifi recently crossed the unofficial boundary on his way to Tall Kayf, his convoy was pelted with stones and tomatoes and briefly held up by Kurdish troops, the pesh merga. On Sunday evening a woman running with a secular coalition that includes Mr. Nujaifi and a former prime minister, Ayad al-Allawi, was shot to death outside her home in Mosul.
 Mr. Nujaifi's election last year raised hopes that the post-2003 disenfranchisement of Sunnis in Nineveh, which once fueled the insurgency, was coming to an end, and some measure of reconciliation would result. 
 That it has not is one reason that few interviewed here expressed hope that the coming election would result in anything better.
 ''Nothing is going to happen,'' said Saleh Hassan Ali al-Jubouri, the mayor of Ash Shura, a town on the Arab side of the Tigris River not far from the ancient ruins of Kalhu, or Nimrud.
 ''We know which part belongs to the Kurds and which part to Nineveh,'' he said, when asked how the results in March might affect the territorial dispute that has cleaved the province. He repeated, with evident disdain, ''Nothing is going to happen.''
 What is striking is how faithfully Iraqis expect to vote by identity, despite campaign appeals to national unity. 
 Issues -- basic services, economic development, security -- all seem to stem from identity as much as politics. ''First ethnicity, second political party,'' was how the leading Kurdish official here, Khasro Goran, put it. 
 The new Parliament will include 31 members from Nineveh, and Mr. Goran expects the main national Kurdish coalition to win 10 seats -- based not on polls, but on the estimated percentage of Kurds in the province. Nineveh's small minority communities -- Yazidis, Shabaks and Christians -- have dedicated parliamentary seats reserved for their representatives.
 Mr. Goran, who has led the boycott of the provincial council, blames the governor and his party for the increasing bitterness, saying stability in Nineveh will come only with respect for minority parties, like his. 
 He also acknowledged that Nineveh's border with the three officially recognized Kurdish provinces to the north is enmeshed in the impasse between the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and that of the Kurdish regional president, Massoud Barzani, over the extent of Iraq's federalism. That, as much as the local disputes, has perpetuated Mr. Goran's boycott. Becoming the loyal opposition in Nineveh might imply recognition of Mosul's political authority over the whole region. 
 ''Some of the problems are local, but others are Iraqi,'' Mr. Goran said in the Kurdish regional capital, Erbil, referring to the disputes that plague Nineveh. ''And we have to pay the price.''
 Khalis Isho, a candidate from Qaraqosh vying to win one of the Christian seats in Parliament, said that the country's political leaders had failed -- failed to embrace democratic values of rights and representative government, failed to learn that elections are only one part of democracy.
 ''I don't believe we will reduce the activities of the terrorists until the thinking in Iraq generally and in Mosul in particular improves,'' he said, ''until they understand that peace in Mosul means peaceful coexistence.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Have Eyes on House Seats in Northeast in Midterm Races

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican candidates are showing surprising financial strength in Congressional districts held by Democrats in the Northeast that party leaders have singled out as ripe for what could be critical gains in the November election.
 Some of the most competitive races are taking shape in the New York metropolitan region.
 In the 19th Congressional District, north of New York, the Republican challenger, Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist, has amassed about $519,000, slightly more than the roughly $451,000 that the Democratic incumbent, Representative John J. Hall, has in his campaign coffers. 
 On eastern Long Island, the Republican candidate, Randy Altschuler, a businessman, is closing the gap with the Democratic incumbent, Representative Timothy H. Bishop, stockpiling nearly $800,000, compared with the roughly $1 million Mr. Bishop has, even though Mr. Altschuler has already embarked on an advertising campaign.
 The promising financial picture for individual Republican candidates suggests that the midterm elections in the Northeast, a Democratic stronghold, may turn out to be far more competitive than expected, forcing Democrats to play defense on what is essentially their home turf.
 Independent analysts say there are a dozen Democratic-held districts in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire where the incumbents could face strong challenges , and in many of those districts Republican candidates have amassed sizable sums of money. 
 The financial strength of these Republican candidates compounds the growing vulnerability of Democrats, who have been weakened by the partisan battle over health care reform, an issue that President Obama has made a centerpiece of his agenda even as economic concerns continue to weigh heavily on many voters. The developments in the Northeast are welcome news to national Republican leaders in Washington at a time when House Republicans' Campaign Committee is confronting an enormous fund-raising gap with its Democratic counterpart.
 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had $16.6 million on hand at the end of last year, dwarfing the $2.6 million that the National Republican Congressional Committee had in its account, according to the most recent campaign-finance disclosure statement.
 ''If Democrats have to spend money protecting seats in a place like the Northeast, they'll have less money to spend in other parts of the country,'' said one senior Republican official who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss internal party strategy. ''That could make a big difference around the country.'' 
 The Northeast has been politically inhospitable in recent elections to Republicans, who have had a hard time mounting viable campaigns. Since 2006, Republicans have lost 16 seats in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but as the political mood sours for incumbents, Republicans hope to score victories in Democratic-held districts with large numbers of Republican and independent voters. 
 Republicans still face a number of serious challenges in many of the Northeast districts they are concentrating on, including the possibility of primary battles that could drain their candidates of large sums of money. But the cash available to some of the party's candidates potentially alters the dynamics of individual races.
 In the Seventh Congressional District outside Philadelphia, where the Democratic incumbent is running for Senate, the candidate supported by the Democratic Party, Bryan Lentz, a member of the State Legislature, has about $460,000, compared with the nearly $700,000 amassed by Patrick Meehan, a local prosecutor and the leading Republican candidate for the seat.
 In the Utica area, Representative Michael A. Arcuri, a Democrat, has about $415,000, even as Richard Hanna, a wealthy construction executive, entered the race telling Republican leaders in Washington that he was prepared to spend significant amounts of his own money. In 2008, he invested $1 million seeking to unseat Mr. Arcuri.
 Still, many Democratic incumbents whom the Republicans are singling out in the region have moved quickly to fortify their campaign war chests, sometimes doubling and even tripling the amount of money of their Republican rivals have on hand.
 On Staten Island, Representative Michael E. McMahon, a freshman Democrat in a conservative-leaning district, has about $1 million, far more than either of the Republicans in the race. Michael Allegretti, a lobbyist for an environmental firm, has roughly $235,000, and Michael Grimm, a retired F.B.I. agent, has about $298,000.
 In New York's Southern Tier, Representative Eric Massa, a first-term Democrat, has amassed about $645,000, compared with roughly $122,000 for the Republican candidate, Tom Reed, the mayor of Corning. 
 Tory Mazzola, a spokesman for the House Republicans' committee, said many of the party's candidates in the region were in a strong position to finance campaigns that tap into voter concerns over issues like the large amount of federal spending under Democratic rule in Washington.
 But Shripal Shah, a spokesman for the House Democrats' campaign committee, said he believed the Republican financial strength was overstated. ''For every Republican candidate that's trying to show strong fund-raising prowess, there are countless more who have failed miserably when it comes to raising money they need for their campaigns,'' he said. 
 Still, Democrats are bracing for tough races next year in part because of the economy, but also because the midterm election is historically tough on the president's party. The concerns of Democrats have deepened since Republicans picked up the Massachusetts Senate seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy.
 In a sign of how aggressively Republicans intend to contest seats in the Northeast, Mr. Altschuler, the Republican candidate on Long Island, has already begun running television advertisements attacking Mr. Bishop.
 In other districts, however, Democratic incumbents appear to have amassed enough cash to ward off any major challengers -- so far, anyway.
 In Connecticut's Fourth Congressional District, which includes Fairfield County, Representative Jim Himes, a Democratic freshman, has stockpiled nearly $1.3 million, a sum that even Republicans agree is impressive.
 While a handful of relatively unknown Republicans are seeking the party's nomination to challenge Mr. Himes, Republican leaders have had little success in their effort to recruit a candidate with the kind of name recognition or fund-raising ability needed to mount a credible challenge to Mr. Himes.
 Republicans are hopeful that they can avoid a similar fate in New Jersey's Third Congressional District, where Representative John H. Adler, another first-term Democrat, has stockpiled nearly $1.4 million.
 Republican Party leaders say they expect Jon Runyan, a former star player for the Philadelphia Eagles, to officially enter the race against Mr. Adler in a district that includes some of the suburbs of Philadelphia. Republican strategists in Washington say he has indicated that he is willing to spend some of his own money on the race.

PERSON: John P. Murtha 

HEADLINE: Representative John P. Murtha Dies at 77; Ex-Marine Was Iraq War Critic

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, a gruff ex-Marine who used his immense power in military spending to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to his hard-luck district and who became an outspoken critic of the Iraq war, died on Monday. He was 77. 
 He died at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, where he was being treated for complications of gallbladder surgery, his office said. Mr. Murtha's death came two days after he became the longest-serving congressman in Pennsylvania history, his office said, surpassing the record of Joseph M. McDade, a Scranton Republican who served from 1963 to 1999.
 Elected in 1974 and the first Vietnam combat veteran to serve in Congress, Mr. Murtha voted in 2002 to authorize use of military force in Iraq. But he evolved into a leading foe of the war as it was conducted under the administration of President George W. Bush.
 ''The war in Iraq is not going as advertised,'' Mr. Murtha said in November 2005 as he demanded an immediate withdrawal of American troops. He called the Iraq campaign ''a flawed policy wrapped in illusion.'' 
 Mr. Murtha's long involvement in Pentagon issues and his history of hawkishness made the criticism all the more influential.
 In a statement Monday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates called Mr. Murtha ''a true patriot'' and said that while they did not always agree, ''I always respected his candor, and knew that he cared deeply about the men and women of America's military and intelligence community.''
 Before speaking out on the war, Mr. Murtha was not much known outside Washington or his district in southwestern Pennsylvania.
 But he was alternately respected and feared by his colleagues on Capitol Hill as he used his influence to funnel hundreds of millions of federal dollars into his hard-luck district, where prosperity had vanished with the decline of the coal and steel industries.
 Mr. Murtha used his position as the ranking Democrat on the Appropriation Committee's military subcommittee to reward or punish colleagues in both parties, depending on whether they went along with the special items, or earmarks, that he tucked into bills for the benefit of his 12th Congressional District. More often than not, they did.
 The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, once described Mr. Murtha as someone ''who likes to get things done with virtually no spoken words.'' 
 Though Mr. Murtha, who was known as Jack, did not go out of his way to win friends among journalists, he understood the power of words. ''Let me tell you the facts of life,'' he often told balky legislators, as he recalled in an interview in 2006. ''If you vote against this bill, you won't have any input at all the next time.''
 Nor did he apologize for the political horse-trading in which he was so adept. ''Deal making is what Congress is all about,'' he said.
 As an ally of Representative Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Murtha helped navigate her rise to speaker of the House. Ms. Pelosi, in turn, backed him in his unsuccessful contest against Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland to become House Democratic leader.
 While Mr. Murtha steered huge sums to his district and was able to rake in plenty of money for his campaigns, he lived modestly in Johnstown, Pa., where he owned a carwash. 
 Mr. Murtha, who served five years in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives before going to Washington, was a protege of Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts, who may not have coined the phrase that ''all politics is local'' but surely embraced it. So did John P. Murtha, who once boasted on a campaign billboard that ''The 'P' stands for power.'' (It actually stood for Patrick.)
 When he drew fire from the political right for his shift on Iraq, Mr. Murtha said his criticism of the war in no way lessened his support for the Americans fighting in it.
 ''I don't take a back seat to anybody for my service to my country,'' Mr. Murtha said in a recent, profanity-spiced interview with his local newspaper, The Tribune-Democrat. But he said the killing of Iraqi civilians, even if accidental, and the abuse of Iraqi prisoners had undermined American efforts.
 Mr. Murtha told The Tribune-Democrat that he had trusted people in the Bush administration too much when it came to Iraq. ''I gave them the benefit of the doubt,'' he said. ''That was a bad mistake.''
 A slogan in his first campaign for Congress was ''One Honest Man Is Enough.'' Yet he barely survived the Abscam affair that ruined several other politicians in the early 1980s. Mr. Murtha was shown on videotape turning down money from an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation posing as a ''sheikh'' but he expressed a willingness to talk about money later. 
 Despite that awkward moment, he was never charged, and he eventually testified against two other Abscam defendants. 
 Early in 2009, he came under scrutiny again, when it came to light that federal agents had raided the offices of the PMA Group, a major Washington lobbying firm, in November 2008 as part of an investigation into potentially improper campaign contributions.
 Mr. Murtha was among the lawmakers lobbied by the firm (its founder, Paul Magliocchetti, had worked for the Defense subcommittee long dominated by him), and PMA's executives and clients were major sources of contributions to Mr. Murtha's campaigns. The firm's specialty was helping clients obtain multimillion-dollar earmarks, Mr. Murtha's stock in trade.
 The PMA Group closed its doors after the investigation, and a Congressional ethics office declined to recommend formal investigations into the actions of Mr. Murtha and the other legislators. But the affair did nothing to dispel the impression that Mr. Murtha ran a busy political trading post. 
 The plainspoken Mr. Murtha's statements sometimes got him in trouble. In October 2008, for example, he was criticized for saying that some of his own constituents were ''redneck'' and ''racist'' and might have trouble voting for Barack Obama for president. 
 Trying to explain away his remarks, Mr. Murtha told reporters that change was difficult for some people, ''particularly older people'' -- this in a state that had at the time the second-highest population of elderly people in the country, after Florida.
 But Mr. Murtha won handily anyhow, defeating a political unknown. On Election Night, he told his supporters, ''You keep sending me back regardless of what I say.'' 
 John Patrick Murtha was born in New Martinsville, W.Va., on June 17, 1932, and grew up in Mount Pleasant, Pa., about 45 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. He left Washington & Jefferson College in 1952 to enlist in the Marine Corps and go to Korea. 
 After graduating with a degree in economics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1962, he rejoined the Marines, serving as an officer in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967 and receiving a Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts for wounds suffered in combat in the spring of 1967 and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry.
 His survivors include his wife of 55 years, Joyce; a daughter, Donna; twin sons, John and Patrick, and three grandchildren. 
 As for his constituents, their support largely never flagged. The only close call at the polls for Mr. Murtha was his first run for Congress, a special election in February 1974 to fill the seat of Representative John P. Saylor, a Republican, who had died. Mr. Murtha won by fewer than 200 votes, out of some 120,000 cast. 
 Mr. Murtha left a legacy visible across southwestern Pennsylvania: roads, airports and hospitals there are named after him. Indeed, though he became a fixture in Washington, he remained, in his own eyes, one with the people back home.
 ''I know better than those damn people in the White House what needs to be done in my district,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Sport's Olympic Rewards Fail to Pay the Bills

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
Tears welled in Kip Carpenter's eyes last fall as he addressed the Wisconsin Speedskating Association board at the Pettit National Ice Center. One of the athletes he coaches, Jilleanne Rookard, had an abundance of talent, desire and grit, he explained, but a cash deficit threatened to derail her bid to make the 2010 United States Olympic team. 
 Rookard was at a crossroads, said Carpenter, a two-time Olympian and a bronze medalist at the 2002 Salt Lake Games. Without financial assistance, she would have to quit training, possibly before the team for the Vancouver Games was chosen in December. 
 The association responded to Carpenter's appeal by writing Rookard a check for $1,000. In a telephone interview, Katie Traver, the group's secretary, said: ''Our reaction was, 'Of course we're going to give her this money.' It was a call for help.'' 
 In a niche sport like speedskating, people bond like the atoms that make up ice. As word of Rookard's precarious financial situation trickled out, the donations poured in. 
 ''I budgeted about $12,000 until the end of the year,'' Rookard said in December, ''and that's how much I got.'' 
 Rookard, 27, made the switch from in-line skating to speedskating just three years ago, but her story is older than clap skates. With 75 medals, speedskating is the United States' most successful sport at the Winter Games, and yet fame and fortune remain as ephemeral for long-track skaters as their breath in the winter air. 
 Thirty years after Eric Heiden won a record five Olympic gold medals at the 1980 Lake Placid Games, the sport still suffers in the United States from a scarcity of television coverage and 400-meter ovals. The Pettit Center in suburban Milwaukee is one of four 400-meter ovals in the country (and one of two indoor facilities). A fifth, an outdoor rink in Butte, Mont., has fallen into disrepair.
 The sport demands a farmer's ethic that seems increasingly at odds with a fast-food nation, which perhaps also explains the sport's niche appeal. Traver said 2,100 long-track speedskaters were registered in the United States, many of whom volunteered as coaches and meet officials after they stopped competing. 
 Rookard's story resonated with the two-time Olympian Dave Tamburrino, who said, ''It doesn't sound like much has changed in 15 years.'' 
 Tamburrino, now the corporate marketing director for the Milwaukee Brewers, was 21 when he made the 1994 Olympic team and finished in a tie for 22nd in the 1,500 meters in Lillehammer, Norway. The next season, while training for the World Cup circuit, he said, ''I found myself not having two nickels to rub together.'' 
 The bounty was not much better for Tamburrino's teammate Dan Jansen, a four-time Olympianwho won a gold medal in 1994 in the 1,000 meters. Despite being the pre-eminent sprinter of his time, Jansen did not get rich quick. 
 ''Fund-raisers to try to go to Europe to train, things like that, were very common,'' he wrote in an e-mail message.
 Jansen added: ''I thought I was rich when I made $50,000 one year. Might have made $100,000 the last couple of years, and then I was loaded.''
 Jennifer Rodriguez, a double bronze medalist at the 2002 Salt Lake Games who will compete in her fourth Olympics in Vancouver, was asked how much she made from skating in sponsorships and stipends in her best year.
 ''I've never seen six figures,'' she said.
 Catherine Rainey, a three-time Olympian, lost her job at the Home Depot last year when the company ended its United States Olympic Committee sponsorship. On the bright side, ''the Bank of Mom and Dad has been fabulous,'' she said. 
 Rookard's father died of a heart attack when she was 18, and her mother, Claire, was found to have multiple myeloma in 2005. With six siblings, Rookard could count on a wealth of emotional support but little financial assistance. 
 In the lead-up to the three-month Olympic team selection process in the fall, Rookard was living in the furnished basement of a speedskating family near the Pettit Center. 
 Her monthly rent was $300. She was training 8 to 10 hours a day, a schedule that restricted her employment options. Rookard, who was not receiving a stipend from the U.S.O.C. or U.S. Speedskating, worked 20 hours a week as a D.J. at a roller rink and subsisted on leftover pizza from birthday parties. 
 A year after she took up speedskating, she qualified for the 2007 national World Cup team. Instead of moving to Salt Lake City, where the team is based, Rookard stayed in Milwaukee to be closer to her mother, who lived a few hours away in Woodhaven, Mich. 
 It was a costly decision, but one she said she did not regret. In Salt Lake City, national team members do not have to pay for coaching or ice time. In Milwaukee, Rookard pays $315 a month for ice and coaching, a fee Carpenter waived when she did not have the money. 
 ''It has been pretty rough,'' Rookard said last fall. ''There's times when I've had $30 in my bank account. There are times when I don't know how I'm going to get through it.'' 
 She persevered because she viewed representing her country and her community in the Olympics as a calling worthy of taking a vow of poverty. 
 ''It's about finishing what I started,'' Rookard said. ''It's about my family. It's about the people who did all the small things for me -- drove me to practice and cheered for me and held me when I struggled. I just want to honor them and do my best and thank them for allowing me to do what I love.''
 The United States Olympic movement eschews government support in favor of a more grass-roots approach. The U.S.O.C. relies on private donations to offset expenses not covered by corporate sponsorships, but the economic downturn has blighted the giving tree. 
 In October, U.S. Speedskating experienced a $300,000 budget shortfall after the Dutch bank DSB, its primary sponsor, declared bankruptcy. In swooped the comedian Stephen Colbert, who rallied viewers of his Comedy Central show, ''The Colbert Report,'' in a speedskating telethon of sorts that has raised more than $300,000 in three months. 
 He said he could relate to the speedskaters' circumstances.
 ''Believe me, I spent 20 years racking up huge debts pursuing comedy,'' Colbert wrote in an e-mail message. 
 He recently donned a sequin-fringed bodysuit and challenged Shani Davis, America's best multimedal hope in long track, to a race that was broadcast on his show. Afforded a 450-meter head start, Colbert lost but gained a signature move: the Panicky Flail. 
 With the exception of Davis, who initially took umbrage with Colbert's barbs at Canadians, speedskaters have seemed delighted to have Colbert in their corner. They are grateful for the spotlight he has trained on their sport, and for a subsequent deal U.S. Speedskating signed with Verizon Wireless, a sponsor of Colbert's show. 
 But what will happen once the flame is extinguished in Vancouver? Speedskating officials wonder where they will find the money to pay for training and travel leading to the next Winter Games, in Russia.
 ''We're trying to find now sponsorships for the next four years,'' said Bob Crowley, the executive director of U.S. Speedskating. ''That's certainly a concern.'' 
 Rookard's worries eased in mid-December when she made the Olympic team in three events: 1,500, 3,000 and 5,000 meters. She then received a $5,000 stipend from U.S. Speedskating to cover her training for the season. 
 Her celebration was short-lived. Before Christmas, Rookard's mother, who was her most ardent supporter, died.
 ''The last thing she gave me,'' Rookard said in an e-mail message, ''was a diamond necklace of hers.'' 
 While valuable, no price can be attached to the heirloom. The same can be said of the Olympic memories Rookard will string together.

HEADLINE: Frustration at Obama's Nuanced Style on Race

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The civil rights movement will come alive in song at the White House on Wednesday night, when President Obama plans to celebrate Black History Month with a star-studded concert. 
 And it came alive in quiet conversation on Martin Luther King's Birthday, when Mr. Obama installed a rare signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office and invited a small group of African-American elders and young people in for a private viewing.
 The two events -- a televised extravaganza with celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Queen Latifah, and an intimate discussion with people like Dorothy Height, the 97-year-old chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women -- reflect the nuances in Mr. Obama's handling of the often incendiary issue of race in America. He is using his platform to advance racial consciousness, even as he has steered clear of putting race front and center in his administration.
 It is a balancing act that has frustrated some black leaders and scholars, who are starting to challenge Mr. Obama's language and policies. 
 On Capitol Hill, members of the Congressional Black Caucus have expressed irritation that Mr. Obama has not created programs tailored specifically to African-Americans, who are suffering disproportionately in the recession. In December, some of them threatened to oppose new financial rules for banks until the White House promised to address the needs of minorities.
 ''I don't think we expected anything to change overnight because we had an African-American in the White House, but the fact still remains that we've got a constituency that is suffering,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. ''I think he could do more, and he will do more.''
 Some black scholars say Mr. Obama has failed to lead on the race issue. The Kirwan Institute, which studies race and ethnicity, is convening a conference on Thursday to offer policy prescriptions. After analyzing the State of the Union address, the institute's scholars warned that ''continued failure to engage race would be devastating.'' 
 Michael Eric Dyson, a Georgetown University sociologist and longtime supporter of Mr. Obama, is exasperated.''All these teachable moments,'' he said, ''but the professor refuses to come to the class.''
 In an interview in late December with American Urban Radio Networks, a group of black-owned stations, Mr. Obama conceded that there was ''grumbling'' among African-Americans, especially about his jobs policies. But he rejected the idea that he should pay special attention to them -- an argument that Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a black author and political analyst, called ''disingenuous at best, and an insult at worst.''
 Mr. Obama framed it this way: ''I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks. I'm the president of the United States. What I can do is make sure that I am passing laws that help all people, particularly those who are most vulnerable and most in need. That in turn is going to help lift up the African-American community.''
 Until now, black leaders have tended to tread lightly in criticizing Mr. Obama, and some find it painful. Black Americans remain overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Obama; a recent ABC News poll found that 96 percent approve of his job performance. 
 But Elinor Tatum, the editor and publisher of the black-owned Amsterdam News, says that if blacks were asked ''Is he doing a good job for African-Americans?'' his numbers would be lower. 
 ''Every time someone brings up an issue that affects blacks, he says that's an issue that affects all of America,'' Ms. Tatum said. ''But at the same time, if he were of a different race or ethnicity, he would be playing to the black community. So there's a double standard there. Should we be the victims in that?''
 The conventional wisdom about Mr. Obama is that he tries to duck the issue of race, but close advisers say he is acutely aware of his role as the first African-American president and is trying to heighten racial sensitivity in constructive ways. 
 Many black leaders view this as wise. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is working with Mr. Obama to close the achievement gap in education, says the president is smart not to ballyhoo ''a black agenda.''
 Instead, Mr. Obama has been trying to shine a spotlight on the history that laid the foundation for his presidency, with events like Wednesday's concert and the celebration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, which offer a peek into his style. 
 Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, said the King event was intended as ''an intergenerational conversation'' in which guests could share their experiences in a ''safe and private moment.'' Before the Oval Office tour, they gathered in the Roosevelt Room and Mr. Obama invited each to speak.
 Dr. Height began with the story of her first encounter with the young Martin Luther King Jr., then 15 and trying, she said, to ''analyze his own thoughts as he was trying to determine whether he wanted to enter the ministry, education or law.'' 
 A local pastor, John Pinkard, recounted his dinner with Dr. King. Participants said the session seemed as much for the president's benefit as their own.
 ''My impression was that it was deliberately something for him and for Michelle, and that it was kind of like medicine, it was healing for them,'' said the historian Taylor Branch, who also attended. ''It seemed to answer something personal for them.''
 Race, of course, can be an incendiary issue in American politics: as a candidate, the biracial Mr. Obama was criticized as either too black or not black enough. He addressed the topic memorably in a speech in Philadelphia after the controversy involving his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.
 Ms. Jarrett said, ''He has communicated quite clearly his thoughts on the subject.'' 
 As president, Mr. Obama learned the pitfalls of talking bluntly about race. His comment that police officers in Cambridge, Mass., ''acted stupidly'' when they arrested a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., caused an uproar, and the ensuing ''beer summit'' at the White House proved a distraction. 
 Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor who represented Mr. Gates and is close to Mr. Obama, said the president had never hesitated to talk about race but is more scripted now. ''I think there is a carefulness -- not a reluctance -- but a carefulness about what should be said going forward,'' he said.
 Professor Ogletree said he ''finds puzzling the idea that a president who happens to be black has to focus on black issues.'' 
 Dr. Height agreed. Having counseled every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt on matters of race, she made a plea in a recent interview for Mr. Obama to be left alone. 
 ''We have never sat down and said to the 43 other presidents: 'How does it feel to be a Caucasian? How do you feel as a white president? Tell me what that means to you,' '' Dr. Height said. ''I am not one to think that he should do more for his people than for other people. I want him to be free to be himself.''

HEADLINE: Protecting Banks in the Boardroom

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
Bank regulators haven't exactly covered themselves in glory. But an earlier defense against bank excesses ought to be their boards. It's not an easy job, but directors could try harder to control risk-taking. Uncomfortable questions are welcome.
 One worth repeating, with the financial crisis slowly fading and 2009 results heralding a possible return to normality for some American and European banks: ''Why are we doing so well?'' Boards often discuss problems. But from the Northern Rock in Britain to Countrywide in the United States, greater scrutiny of fast-growing and highly profitable businesses might have revealed weakening standards and optimistic assumptions. 
Another question that boards need to ask regularly: ''What could make this institution fail?'' Bank bosses should know broadly how the economy, interest rates and the like affect their business. But when the United States government ran stress tests last year, it found that an improbably high proportion of banks believed themselves more resilient than average.
 One way to pinpoint a bank's vulnerability -- whether to a single financial asset class, counterparty or type of financing -- would be to turn the stress test on its head and identify any icebergs that could sink it. Done right, that approach might have highlighted American International Group's troubled credit insurance portfolio and perhaps its related and circular dependence on its credit rating.
 Part-time board members can't be expected to grasp all the ins and outs themselves. But they need to satisfy themselves the person in charge knows how the bank makes money and where its vulnerabilities are. Successive chief executives at A.I.G. seem to have been oblivious to its Achilles' heel. Directors also need to ask similar questions of risk managers and other employees when C.E.O.'s aren't present.
 Of course, all this is difficult. Chief executives -- who also often lead their boards, especially in the United States -- can outmaneuver even highly qualified and dedicated shareholder representatives. And outside directors who ask too many tough questions soon aren't invited back. Still, for the sake of shareholders, directors need to be as critical as possible. Maybe they need a nudge from regulators. More vigilant boards would save the watchdogs trouble.
 Good Match at CIT
 John A. Thain has checked into rehab -- career rehab that is. He has signed on to be chief executive at CIT Group, the midmarket lender. While a step down from the heights Mr. Thain has scaled on Wall Street during his career, this job looks a good match.
 After its quick spell in bankruptcy, CIT needs a motivated financial technocrat, not an expert in the art of corralling bankers with big egos. The combination plays to Mr. Thain's strengths and offers him a chance at redemption, which he deserves. His botched statements about Merrill Lynch's capital needs and expensive decorating taste while he was chairman and chief executive there shouldn't force him into early retirement.
 Success won't come easily. CIT has freshly emerged from bankruptcy and should be able to run its existing loan book down profitably. But figuring out how to generate new business is harder. The brand is tarnished and the firm cannot borrow on the same attractive terms available to rival banks, or even GE Capital. Yet there is a continuing need among small businesses for capital, while competition is limited.
 Mr. Thain's grasp of capital markets will serve him well in his new job. The experience and contacts he gained while running Merrill, the New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs ought to help as he tries to re-establish CIT's financing sources. And Mr. Thain's ability to escape larger strategic traps to the benefit of investors shouldn't be underestimated -- after all, he was partly responsible for persuading Bank of America to buy Merrill for a juicy premium when it was on the verge of collapse in 2008.
 Even if Mr. Thain can't fully solve CIT's problems, his prolific deal-making experience also holds out the possibility he could find safety for the company in the arms of a larger rival. Either way, the patina of success that would accrue from successfully mending CIT would go a long way toward offsetting any dings his reputation suffered while at Merrill. That is, as long as he makes a date with IKEA when it comes to refurbishing his new office.

HEADLINE: For Human Spaceflight, Can Measured Beat Bold?

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Ever since Apollo astronauts flew to the Moon four decades ago, expert task forces and political leaders have, from time to time, pondered what to do next in human spaceflight. They came up with new directions and new visions, set new goals. Some of their hopes rested on machines that never made it to a launching pad. Others got off the ground but never really soared.
 Now, the Obama administration has joined the quest to keep humans flying in space. But will its measured proposals, announced last week, succeed where others fell so far short? 
 It may be too soon to say, but history colors the prospects gray. 
 While astronauts were still taking giant leaps to lunar plains, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration assumed that Apollo was just the grand-opening to an era of wide-ranging space exploration by people. Success had bred confidence and mobilized skills and the infrastructure for greater achievements. The agency's wish list included a permanent base on the Moon, a 12-person space station orbiting Earth and serviced by reusable shuttles flying back and forth, and eventually human expeditions to Mars, possibly by the late 1980s.
 Only the space shuttle won the Nixon administration's approval, in 1972. The shuttles are still flying, but they are confined to low orbit, and the promised economies and reliability are unfulfilled. They are the aging technology of the early space age.
 In 1986, the space program was jolted, but not significantly redirected, by the Challenger disaster. That year, the Reagan administration endorsed the space station. It was given a name, Freedom, but no one seemed to agree on its utility or even its design.
 With weak Congressional support, the project was going nowhere until the Clinton administration reconceived it as an international endeavor including post-cold-war Russia. The station now had a purpose, though more political than technological or scientific. Shuttles and Russian spacecraft regularly ferry supplies and crews for long-duration visits. But humans remain stalled in low orbit.
 Meanwhile, two administrations tried to strike a bolder note vaguely reminiscent of President John F. Kennedy's challenge in 1961 to land men on the Moon ''before this decade is out.''
 In 1989, President George Bush set new goals to rouse the space program out of its enforced lethargy. A fleet of heavy-lift rockets would be developed for both robotic and human missions beyond low orbit. Astronauts would return to the Moon to establish permanent outposts and then fly to Mars, perhaps by 2019. The response, almost immediately, was inaction.
 President George W. Bush made a similar appeal. After the shuttle Columbia's disaster in 2003, he introduced a ''new vision'' to revive the floundering space program. It included post-shuttle propulsion systems and crew-carrying vehicles. The goal was a return of astronauts to the Moon by 2020. Sometime after, to Mars.
 But the costs of fighting wars while cutting taxes left little money to support the undertaking. Although several billion dollars have already been invested in advanced hardware, the goals seem illusory, and public support seems thin.
 Once again, experience brought reminders, so often overlooked, that Apollo was not a realistic model for future endeavors in space exploration. Going to the Moon had been, above all, a campaign in the cold war. The Soviet Union was the feared adversary, even more so after the Sputnik surprise and after Yuri Gagarin's flight made him the first man in space, in spring 1961.
 Early on, the political scientist John M. Logsdon at George Washington University made a study of the decision-making process leading to Apollo. Dr. Logsdon concluded that Apollo was ''a product of a specific time in history'' and a singular crash program responding to a perceived threat to the country. It did not represent a firm commitment by society to open-ended space exploration.
 Norman R. Augustine, an aerospace industry executive, acknowledged as much when he led a task force that contributed to the first President Bush's proposals. ''The heavy driver for the space program used to be competition with the Soviets,'' Mr. Augustine said at the time. ''Today, there is not that clear competition but the fundamental values of exploration that drive us. They are less tangible, but no less important.''
 If one thing is clear and encouraging in President Obama's proposals, it is the recognition of Apollo's exceptionality. Mr. Augustine also served on the committee that advised Mr. Obama, and his point about the changing political matrix has apparently sunk in.
 ''We've been trying to relive Apollo for 40 years, unsuccessfully,'' NASA's deputy administrator, Lori B. Garver, said in an interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times. ''For too long NASA overpromised and underdelivered, and now we will be doing things differently.''
 That remains to be seen. Congressional committees have not begun to examine the proposals and the modest budget increases for NASA. The administration's plan may be ''bold and game-changing,'' in Ms. Garver's words, but several aspects are likely to stir controversy or at least call for closer study.
 In contrast to the past, the new plan sets no definite timetables, cost estimates or destinations. Nor is there extravagant rhetoric about knowledge and adventure. The Kennedy eloquence about sailing ''this new ocean'' was effective primarily because the nation felt the need to demonstrate its technological superiority in war and peace.
 Not having specified goals and targets runs the risk of having a program wander off course. As a first step, the administration proposed scuttling the present plan to return to the Moon by 2020. Development of the rocket and crew capsule for those flights would be stopped, though some of the research might be used in succeeding vehicles.
 NASA officials say that, depending on financing and progress developing new technologies, projections for the timing of the next astronaut ventures might be made in five or six years. The first objective along this ''flexible path'' is just to regain the ability to fly beyond low orbit, forsaken years ago with the decommissioning of the Saturn 5 Moon rocket. Eventually, when the means are available and the national spirit willing, the Moon, asteroids and Mars will be the likeliest destinations.
 Some elements of the new plan may be popular. A pledge to enlist other nations as partners should spread costs. Such a practice with the International Space Station has been encouraging. 
 The proposal to outsource development and ownership of the new flight hardware to private enterprise should win support among conservatives. It also raises questions. Will NASA be able to maintain control over the quality and safety of the new vehicles that, in effect, it will rent for astronaut missions? Will the government be transferring to private hands undue influence over the pursuit of national goals in space?
 The space program has had some great successes since the Moon landings. Never to be forgotten are the robotic explorations of the Sun's family of planets and the cosmic vistas snapped by far-seeing instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope.
 Even if robotic surrogates can go farther and make discoveries at less cost, the Obama space plan, if nothing else, reminds us that banked fires still burn and may yet light the way to distant shores. Humans will probably not rest until they again ride their technologies themselves.

Flush with cash despite the global economic downturn, China's sovereign wealth fund quietly bought more than $9 billion worth of shares last year in some of the biggest American corporations, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup.
 Although most of the stakes were small, the China Investment Corporation, the government's $300 billion investment fund, now owns stock in some of the best-known American brands, including Apple, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Motorola and Visa. 
 The detailed list, which contained holdings totaling $9.6 billion as of Dec. 31, was disclosed Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; it lists stakes only in companies traded in the United States.
 The filing offers a glimpse of how China is trying to diversify its more than $2 trillion in foreign currency holdings with stock, rather than investing almost entirely in United States Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued by governments and by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae.
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China and other officials have repeatedly expressed worry about how the country's holdings of Treasury securities could be hurt by inflation or by mounting United States debt. By buying the securities of international companies, China is trying to spread its fast-growing wealth more widely. It is also seeking to acquire strategic stakes in companies that could feed its hungry economy with a range of commodities.
 The China Investment Corporation, already one of the world's largest sovereign funds, was formed in 2007 with about $200 billion. It now has assets of nearly $300 billion and, according to state-run news media, is expecting another large injection of funds.
 A spokeswoman for the corporation, which is based in Beijing, did not return e-mail messages or phone calls seeking comment. But analysts said the filing showed that the fund had invested only a small portion of its $300 billion in American stocks, and the fund seemed to be following a cautious strategy to diversify globally after initially having put its biggest investments into shoring up the capital of Chinese banks.
 ''This is still a relatively small amount compared to the total size of the fund,'' said Chang Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. 
 The sovereign wealth fund got off to a rocky start in 2007 and early 2008 by acquiring a $3 billion nonvoting stake in the American private equity firm Blackstone and paying $5 billion more for a 9.9 percent stake in Morgan Stanley.
 Shares of both companies plummeted in 2008 during the financial crisis, leading to a storm of criticism directed at the wealth fund. But analysts say the fund performed well in 2009, particularly because it was buying aggressively as the market recovered.
 Exactly when the investment corporation bought the shares of various companies was not disclosed in the filing. Its acquisition of nonvoting units of Blackstone and its early stake of preferred shares in Morgan Stanley are not listed in the filing, apparently because they are not traded equities.
 The filing indicates that the corporation owns about $19 million worth of Bank of America stock, close to $30 million worth of Citigroup shares and about $333 million worth of shares in Visa, as well as holdings in various index funds.
 The fund's largest listed holdings were $1.7 billion worth of shares in Morgan Stanley and nearly $650 million worth of shares in BlackRock, the New York money management fund. 
 The Morgan Stanley stake was acquired last June, when the investment bank issued about $2.2 billion worth of common shares to help repay the United States government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Chinese fund acquired about $1.2 billion worth of shares at that time.
 Some United States politicians in both parties have been nervous about China's growing financial reach, and have been particularly wary that China might seek political influence in the West commensurate with its corporate stakes. Four years ago, Congress discouraged Cnooc, a state-owned Chinese oil company, from buying the oil company Unocal, which instead merged with Chevron.
 Most sovereign wealth funds, with the exception of Norway's, disclose few details about their holdings. But the Chinese fund made its list available for the first time on the S.E.C.'s form 13F, which is filed quarterly by institutional investors and mutual funds in the United States. 
 Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the Chinese sovereign wealth fund's decision to disclose its holdings could limit concerns about secrecy in government holdings.
 ''This should help reassure politicians that Chinese sovereign wealth funds can take minority positions responsibly,'' he said.
 The Chinese fund's holdings outside the United States are substantial and growing. In Canada, it owns a $3.5 billion stake in Teck Resources, a mining and resources company listed in the United States, and a $1 million stake in Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry mobile phones.
 The sovereign wealth fund has also been buying small stakes in Australia's biggest banks and paid $646 million last autumn for a stake in the Noble Group, a diversified commodities company based in Hong Kong with operations around the world in industries like iron ore mining and sugar mills.
 Executives whose companies have accepted investments from the Chinese fund tend to defend it as apolitical.
 Richard S. Elman, the founder and chairman of Noble, said last month that executives of the Chinese fund had been businesslike in their approach to the investment.
 ''They are hugely commercial, and they want results,'' he said. ''They do not interfere in the day-to-day operations.''

HEADLINE: Investigators to Sift Power Plant Rubble for Evidence of Criminal Negligence

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and PATRICK McGEEHAN; Robert Davey, Michael M. Grynbaum and Michael Wilson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Investigators will look for evidence of criminal negligence in the rubble at a Middletown, Conn., power plant that exploded on Sunday, killing five people, officials said Monday. 
 Mayor Sebastian N. Giuliano of Middletown said a search warrant had been issued that gave the local police the authority to comb through the wreckage for signs of what caused the blast at the $985 million plant, which was under construction. And Gov. M. Jodi Rell said she was setting up two panels: one to also investigate the cause, the other to review the state's safety codes and recommend changes if needed.
 At the same time, officials finished recovering the five bodies from the plant, which had been one of the largest construction sites in New England. 
 Mr. Giuliano did not rule out the discovery of additional bodies at the 620-megawatt Kleen Energy Systems plant, where 114 people were working on Sunday, 25 in the immediate vicinity of the explosion. But he said that eight people who were being sought had been located alive. In all, the mayor said, 12 people were injured.
 Some hints emerged about what might have caused the explosion, which was felt as far as 30 miles away. At the time of the blast, the gas lines were apparently being cleared, a procedure known as a blow-down. Mr. Giuliano said the blast occurred underground, outside a building known as the Power Block, and between two generators. 
 S. Derek Phelps, the executive director of the Connecticut Siting Council, which had approved a permit for the plant, said that clearing the gas lines was ''the last thing you do'' to make sure that there were no obstructions. ''The smallest debris can do damage,'' he said.
 ''We hear, this is uncorroborated, there was a flame device proximate enough to it to light the gas,'' Mr. Phelps said.
 For much of Monday, investigators from the federal agency that investigates serious chemical industrial accidents were barred from entering the plant. Don Holmstrom, the lead investigator for the agency, the United States Chemical Safety Board, said that his team had arrived at the plant on Monday morning only to be stopped by the Middletown police. 
 He said the acting chief of police had promised ''he'd let me know when our presence was approved to enter the site,'' even though Mr. Holmstrom said the agency had authority to enter and investigate any such accident and was accustomed to working with local authorities. He added that any delay could hurt the investigation. 
 ''It's very important to be there right away,'' he said.
 Mr. Giuliano, though, said the board's investigators had no role to play at the moment. ''They'd be in the way,'' he said at a news conference, adding that two other federal agencies -- the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- ''don't want them up there.'' 
 The search for survivors was suspended about 2:30 a.m. Monday when rescuers realized that a section of the plant was an unstable mess of twisted beams and cracked flooring. Middletown's deputy fire marshal, Al Santostefano, said rescuers would not go back in until the structure had been shored up.
 A spokesman for the plant's principal owner, Energy Investors Funds, said the company was ''fully cooperating with authorities.'' He expressed ''our enormous sympathy and concern for the workers at the Kleen Energy plant and their families.'' He did not comment on what might have set off the explosion.
 The plant had been expected to start up by the middle of the year, providing enough electricity to power as many as 500,000 homes. State officials had hoped the plant would operate efficiently enough to hold down or reduce electric bills across the state.
 Connecticut regulators said Monday that they did not expect the explosion to have any effect on consumer prices or the reliability of the power grid, but it seemed certain that plant would not go into operation any time soon -- if ever.
 ''I can't see how anything can be done there in terms of bringing it online in less than a couple of years,'' said State Senator John W. Fonfara, the chairman of the General Assembly's Energy and Technology Committee. ''Just the cleanup alone after the investigation is going to take months and months.''
 The plant was designed to generate about one-eighth of Connecticut's daily consumption. But the regional power grid that it would have supplied was not counting on its contribution until June 2011, said Ellen Foley, a spokeswoman for the grid operator, ISO New England. Connecticut Light and Power, which distributes electricity to about 80 percent of the state, has already bought all the power it will need this year and most of what it will need in 2011, said Mitch Gross, a spokesman for the utility. ''The loss or the delay of the facility has no impact on our current supply or the price of power for our current customers,'' he said
 Connecticut Light and Power and United Illuminating, a smaller utility that serves 17 towns in the southwestern part of the state, have contracted for all the power generated by the Kleen Energy plant for 15 years. A spokeswoman for United Illuminating said the company did not know what would become of that contract.
 Mr. Fonfara said the plant would have been the first of its size completed in New England in eight years and would have employed 800 to 1,000 workers. It also would have replaced ''dirtier, more inefficient facilities'' and driven down prices, he said.
 But he said Connecticut would get along without it. ''The lights aren't going to go out, and there aren't going to be brownouts or anything like that,'' he said.
 Others had been counting on the plant to lift the local economy. ''I was very happy they were building that plant here. It was clean energy and I thought, gee, Middletown is moving forward,'' said Julie Butler, 63, a retired social worker. ''Now the money is not going to come.''

HEADLINE: Looking With Anxiety at Toyota's Future, From Two Perspectives

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- When Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, apologized for the recalls that have marred Toyota's reputation, he talked not just about his company's fate, but also his nation's. 
 ''I hope to return Toyota to profit and contribute to the revitalization of Japan,'' he said.
 Once a leading symbol of Japan's rise to global economic might, Toyota has become one of the most visible signs of its decline. And even before the recalls, Japan's rivals from South Korea and China had started overtaking Japan in key industries from semiconductors to flat-panel televisions. And Toyota on Tuesday issued another damaging recall, this time of its popular Prius hybrid. 
 ''At this rate, Japan will sink into the sea,'' said Masatomo Tanaka, a professor at the Institute of Technologists, a university that specializes in training engineers. ''If Toyota is not healthy, then Japan is not healthy.''
 Many economists and business executives say they hope that Toyota's trauma will be the unsettling blow that Japan needs to understand that its reliance on manufacturing and industrial exports, which served the country so well after World War II, is no longer wise. 
 Yukio Noguchi, a professor of finance at Waseda University in Tokyo, said Japan must finally evolve into a postindustrial, service-based economy -- a painful transition that the United States and Great Britain underwent in the 1980s. Others said Japan should focus exclusively on high-end, high-profit products, like robots and fuel cells, rather than mass-produced goods subject to quality-control issues.
 ''Even Toyota can fail. Even Lexus, even Prius,'' said Mr. Noguchi. ''Our world-leading manufacturing industry may no longer be world-leading. This has a strong impact on the national psyche.''
 Toyota looms so large that Japan can seem like a one-company town. Toyota is Japan's largest company by sales ($230 billion last fiscal year), and in recent years has been its most profitable company and biggest taxpayer. 
 Toyota has also been Japan's largest ad buyer, making the major media here afraid to criticize it. In late 2008, the former president of Toyota, Hiroshi Okuda, even threatened to stop buying ad time from what he called overly critical media outlets.
 Toyota long enjoyed near hallowed status here as the greatest practitioner of ''monozukuri,'' a centuries-old ideal of perfection in craftsmanship, seen in pottery and ancient sword-making.
 This pride of craftsmanship turned loose on the factory floor is widely seen as a secret to Japan's postwar ''miracle'' and as a cultural advantage that helped Japanese engineers surpass Detroit's. The possible withering of that ideal has battered Toyota's self-image, leading to widespread angst in the media and new worries about the economy.
 More broadly, it may speed a transition that was already under way, albeit in slow motion, since Japan's long economic stagnation began in the early 1990s. According to the Cabinet Office, manufacturing accounted for 22 percent of Japan's entire economic output in 2008, down from 28 percent in 1990.
 The transition was slowed in the 2000s when a weak yen fueled an export boom that benefited Toyota and gave Japan its longest stretch of economic growth since World War II. However, the vulnerability of that export dependence was exposed in the recent financial downturn. When consumers in the United States and elsewhere cut back on purchases of autos and flat-panel TVs, Japan became the hardest-hit major economy, even though it was not touched by the real estate market and securitization woes.
 However, manufacturing's share of the economy still remains far above the level of 12 percent in the United States. And few economists or journalists here advocate shifting abruptly. Rather, the feeling is that Japan needs to find a new balance by replacing its smokestack industries with more information technology and software, industries in which it is weak. 
 At the same time, Japan can still play to its considerable strength as a center of quality industrial goods, keeping higher-end boutique producers in sophisticated industries like machine tools, alternative-energy technologies and robotics, areas in which Japan is strong. Its companies have also prospered from the new boom of factory construction in places like South Korea and China because much of the advanced machinery used in production is still made in Japan.
 Some economists said there is a danger here as well, and one that is seen in Toyota's travails. They said Japanese companies risk becoming too obsessed with sophisticated engineering, to the point that they overlook points that appeal to consumers, like ease of use and design. This is what happened to Sony, they say, whose digital Walkman is better engineered than Apple's iPod, but far less popular.
 ''Toyota became so proud of its manufacturing systems, and its concepts like 'kaizen' and 'just in time,' but this became arrogance. It forgot about the most important thing: its customers,'' said Ryozo Yoshikawa, a professor of manufacturing management at the University of Tokyo.
 This shift will be hard for Japan, where many policy makers and pundits still seem to cling to the old model of heavy industries and consumer goods. If Japan can pull it off, it could serve as a model. If it cannot, economists warn, the nation will only continue to falter under competition from lower-wage countries. 
 ''I hope that Toyota will change our way of looking at our economy,'' Mr. Noguchi said. ''We cannot survive if we continue to stick to the old type of industries.''

HEADLINE: Dollars Flow Out as Data Flows In

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
John Anderson and Sharon Rapoport estimate they spend $400 a month, or close to $5,000 a year, keeping their family of four entertained at home. 
 There are the $30-a-month data plans on their BlackBerry Tour cellphones. The Roanoke, Va., couple's teenage sons, Seth and Isaac, each have $50 subscriptions for Xbox Live and send thousands of texts each month on their cellphones, requiring their own data plans. 
 DirecTV satellite service, high-speed Internet access and Netflix for movie nights add more. 
 ''We try to be aware of it so it doesn't get out of control,'' said Mr. Anderson, who with his wife founded an advertising agency. ''But, yeah, I would say we're pretty wired.'' 
 It used to be that a basic $25-a-month phone bill was your main telecommunications expense. But by 2004, the average American spent $770.95 annually on services like cable television, Internet connectivity and video games, according to data from the Census Bureau. By 2008, that number rose to $903, outstripping inflation. By the end of this year, it is expected to have grown to $997.07. Add another $1,000 or more for cellphone service and the average family is spending as much on entertainment over devices as they are on dining out or buying gasoline. 
 And those government figures do not take into account movies, music and television shows bought through iTunes, or the data plans that are increasingly mandatory for more sophisticated smartphones.
 For many people, the subscriptions and services for entertainment and communications, which are more often now one and the same, have become indispensable necessities of life, on par with electricity, water and groceries. And for every new device, there seems to be yet another fee. Buyers of the more advanced AppleiPad, to cite the latest example, can buy unlimited data access for $30 a month from AT&T even if they already have a data plan from the carrier. 
 ''You don't really lump these expenses into a discretionary category,'' said Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. ''As the expectation of connectedness increases, it's what is expected for people to be functional in society.'' 
 Americans are transforming their homes into entertainment hubs, which is driving up the amount of money they spend, said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. 
 ''More people are creating experiences in their homes that are very similar to the kinds of public experiences they enjoy in movie theaters and concert halls,'' he said. ''Our homes are bristling with technology.'' 
 Most people think home entertainment is cheaper. ''Every time I want to go to Fenway Park or see the Killers in concert, I'm paying $50 to $100 each time. But once you build and install that home system, its basically pennies per minute of enjoyment,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research.
 But they do not take into consideration the long-term economic effect -- both in the maintenance and operational costs -- of the devices they purchase. ''A subscription model is the perfect drug,'' Mr. McQuivey said. ''People see $15 per month as a very low amount of money but it quickly adds up.''
 Kate Goodall, for example, a 32-year-old director of fund-raising for museums, in Alexandria, Va., said the high costs of home cable and other subscriptions began to eat into her budget. ''We saw the writing on the wall in terms of the cost,'' she said. ''It was getting ridiculous.''
 She and her husband disconnected their cable and home phone line so they could more easily afford frequent dinners out and swimming, ballet and art lessons for their two small sons. Instead, they catch shows like ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' free at Hulu.com and rely on their cellphones as their primary phone lines. 
 Her husband, Mike Hughes, 37, a project manager, has both an Xbox and a Wii game console, but, in an effort to keep their bills down, she would not let him sign up for any gaming subscription services.
 Consumers will have to make tough choices like Ms. Goodall and her husband as the next generation of connected devices -- TVs and various mobile devices -- that have their own data plan or subscription service come to market. The cable TV companies battle the phone companies by bundling cable, landline phone and Internet services, but most wireless carriers do not yet have any programs to bundle the data plans and offer discounts for myriad mobile devices. 
 Ms. Goodall says she dreads the day when her sons, 1 and 4, get bitten by the texting craze, as her 12-year-old nephew has.
 ''We'll probably have to sign our sons up for cellphones even sooner than we'd like because we don't have a home phone,'' she said. ''I'm not looking forward to dealing with that set of issues.''

HEADLINE: In City Real Estate, Old Clans Are Shrewd Again

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
At the height of the boom, the Dursts, the Rudins, the Roses, the LeFraks and other members of New York's royal real estate families were treated like slow-moving dinosaurs on the verge of extinction.
 Although they had spent more than five decades carving their names into the New York skyline, the families were outbid and sometimes outmaneuvered by the newer, flashier speculators and investors who swaggered down Manhattan streets buying one skyscraper after another at record-setting prices.
 But now that some of the record-breakers are desperately trying to fend off lenders or teetering at the edge of bankruptcy, these families are looking like wise veterans. They are in relatively healthy financial shape and eager to do deals. They do not necessarily take pleasure in the downfall of the upstarts, but they do relish the fact that, as one scion said with a bit of exaggeration, ''Now, we're the only ones breathing.'' 
 A group led by the LeFraks is interested in buying Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a complex of 11,227 apartments near the East River whose current owner defaulted on $4.4 billion in loans. The Rudins and other families are looking at the Carlton House, an apartment-hotel building on Madison Avenue that is for sale. The Dursts, who like the Rudins and the LeFraks are in their fourth generation in New York real estate, are looking to buy a stake in the $3 billion skyscraper under construction at 1 World Trade Center.
 ''What the families have a claim to is that they never go away,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''When this economic crisis goes away, they'll still be here. We'll see about the other guys.''
 Not every segment of the city's powerful real estate industry is wobbling. Some publicly traded real estate companies, including Boston Properties, SL Green Realty, Brookfield Properties and Vornado Realty Trust, have recovered from drops in stock share prices 2008 and are stockpiling cash to buy distressed properties at steep discounts. Even though Tishman Speyer Properties, an organization rooted in one of the old families, stumbled with Stuyvesant Town, it sold $10 billion in property at the top of the market and claims returns of 20 percent a year for investors. 
 But some of the others are in deep trouble. The developer Kent Swig lost control of his most high-profile project -- Sheffield57, a condominium conversion project on the Upper West Side that he bought from the Roses in 2005 for $418 million -- and may tumble into personal bankruptcy. Scott Lawlor, chief executive of Broadway Partners, who spent $15 billion buying 28 office buildings in 2006 and 2007, has been forced to drastically retrench.
 Shaya Boymelgreen, who built thousands of luxury condominiums in Manhattan and Brooklyn in recent years, is under siege from lenders and condo owners, while facing eviction from his headquarters. Laurence Gluck, chief executive of Stellar Management, faces foreclosure on Riverton Houses, the middle-class housing complex in Harlem that he bought in 2005. 
 Unlike the real estate families, most of the newcomers used other people's money while taking large management and development fees. Pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors and banks poured billions of dollars into their deals. Lenders provided relatively cheap financing and required little equity. The deals were built on expectations that prices and values would soar forever, or at least until they could resell properties at a profit.
 ''The debt they piled on top of the equity was startling,'' said Douglas Durst, whose family owns 10 prime office buildings in Manhattan. Among them is the 52-story 1 Bryant Park tower on 42nd Street, the largest office tower built during the boom on land assembled over four decades. ''The real estate families use their own equity because they want to earn money on it. They're not looking for fees.'' 
 William C. Rudin, the third-generation chief executive of Rudin Management, which owns 16 office buildings and 20 apartment houses in Manhattan, said: ''We've always underwritten our development based on very conservative standards. With land prices and construction prices going up a couple years ago, we didn't find a lot of opportunities that made sense.''
 Many of the oldest real estate families trace their roots back to the early 1900s, when their patriarchs arrived from Eastern Europe. By the mid-1970s, they had emerged as a powerful political and economic force in New York, even as some of the family empires crumbled during the decade. 
 Their names are chiseled into the stonework at many of the city's institutions, from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (Milstein) to New York University (Stern) to the Museum of Natural History (Rose) to the Guggenheim Museum (LeFrak).
 What distinguishes the families from other real estate players is that they buy property but rarely sell. They usually have relatively low levels of debt on their buildings, and they do a couple of projects every economic cycle rather than go on a binge, a practice adopted after bitter experiences with a deep recession in the 1970s. The families' supremacy was challenged in the 1990s by the rise of publicly traded real estate companies and private equity firms. Land and construction prices began to soar, raising stakes for anyone undertaking a big residential or commercial project. 
 Today, the top three commercial landlords are public companies: SL Green, Vornado and Brookfield, which together account for 55.7 million square feet of office space. The top seven families in commercial real estate have about 41.2 million square feet, according to a compilation by CB Richard Ellis, a real estate broker. Mr. Spinola, of the real estate board, said, ''The pie has gotten a lot bigger, and the families' share has gotten smaller.'' 
 The families are also having to compete for deals with longtime developers like Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, one of the city's most prolific developers, who adopted a corporate model of working with both investors and partners to spread his risk. In the 2006 bidding for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the LeFraks and the Milsteins together offered $3.2 billion, but lost out to a partnership of Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty that paid $5.4 billion. (It is now estimated to be worth $1.9 billion.) 
 No one is immune to the recession, Mr. Rudin said. He is losing his anchor tenant at 32 Avenue of the Americas, AT&T, to a less-expensive building downtown. But the family has reserved the funds that will enable it to operate until it secures a new tenant.
 Adam R. Rose, co-president of Rose Associates, said: ''We take no pleasure in seeing any of our colleagues experience catastrophic events. However, there is a distinct and qualitative difference between a long-term perspective, which yields better decisions, and a short-term perspective, which leads to mistakes.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Two-Edged Bomb

BYLINE: By ADAM B. LOWTHER. 
Adam B. Lowther is a defense analyst at the Air Force Research Institute.

 BODY:
Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.
 WITH Iran having notified the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency on Monday that any day now it will begin enriching its stockpile of uranium in order to power a medical reactor, we should admit that Washington's approach to countering the Islamic Republic is leading nowhere. What's needed, however, may be less of a change of plan than a change in how we view the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. 
 Believe it or not, there are some potential benefits to the United States should Iran build a bomb. (I'm speaking for myself here, and in no way for the Air Force.) Five possibilities come to mind. 
 First, Iran's development of nuclear weapons would give the United States an opportunity to finally defeat violent Sunni-Arab terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Here's why: a nuclear Iran is primarily a threat to its neighbors, not the United States. Thus Washington could offer regional security -- primarily, a Middle East nuclear umbrella -- in exchange for economic, political and social reforms in the autocratic Arab regimes responsible for breeding the discontent that led to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 Until now, the Middle East autocracies have refused to change their ways because they were protected by the wealth of their petroleum reserves. A nuclear Iran alters the regional dynamic significantly, and provides some leverage for us to demand reforms.
 Second, becoming the primary provider of regional security in a nuclear Middle East would give the United States a way to break the OPEC cartel. Forcing an end to the sorts of monopolistic practices that are illegal in the United States would be the price of that nuclear shield, bringing oil prices down significantly and saving billions of dollars a year at the pump. Or, at a minimum, President Obama could trade security for increased production and a lowering of global petroleum prices. 
 Third, Israel has made clear that it feels threatened by Iran's nuclear program. The Palestinians also have a reason for concern, because a nuclear strike against Israel would devastate them as well. This shared danger might serve as a catalyst for reconciliation between the two parties, leading to the peace agreement that has eluded the last five presidents. Paradoxically, any final agreement between Israelis and Palestinians would go a long way to undercutting Tehran's animosity toward Israel, and would ease longstanding tensions in the region. 
 Fourth, a growth in exports of weapons systems, training and advice to our Middle Eastern allies would not only strengthen our current partnership efforts but give the American defense industry a needed shot in the arm. 
 With the likelihood of austere Pentagon budgets in the coming years, Boeing has been making noise about shifting out of the defense industry, which would mean lost American jobs and would also put us in a difficult position should we be threatened by a rising military power like China. A nuclear Iran could forestall such a catastrophe. 
 Last, the United States would be able to stem the flow of dollars to autocratic regimes in the region. It would accomplish this not only by driving down the price of oil and increasing arms exports, but by requiring the beneficiaries of American security to bear a real share of its cost. And in the long run, a victory in the war on terrorism would save taxpayers the tens of billions of dollars a year now spent on overseas counterinsurgency operations.
 What about the downside -- that an unstable, anti-American regime would be able to start a nuclear war? Actually, that's less of a risk than most people think. Unless the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, and his Guardian Council chart a course that no other nuclear power has ever taken, Iran should become more responsible once it acquires nuclear weapons rather than less. The 50-year standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States was called the cold war thanks to the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons. 
 There is reason to believe that the initial shock of a nuclear Iran would soon be followed a new regional dynamic strikingly like that of cold-war Europe. Saudi Arabia and Iraq would be united along with their smaller neighbors by their fear of Iran; the United States would take the lead in creating a stable regional security environment. In addition, our reluctant European allies, and possibly even China and Russia, would have a much harder time justifying sales of goods and technology to Tehran, further isolating the Islamic Republic.
 Iran may think its enrichment plans will put fear into the hearts of Americans. In fact, it should give us hopes of a renaissance of American influence in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: The Worst of the Pain

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
There is a great tendency in this country to refuse to see what is right in front of everybody's eyes.
 While there is now, finally, a great deal of talk among the politicians and in the news media about unemployment, there is still almost a willful refusal to focus on just who is suffering the most from joblessness and underemployment.
 When it comes to employment, there are roughly three broad categories in the United States. The folks in the upper-income group are not suffering much, if at all, from the profound reversals in employment brought about by the Great Recession. Those in the middle have been hit hard. The job losses there have been severe and long-lasting. But for those in the lower-income groups, the scale of the employment crisis has been mind-boggling. 
 What you're not hearing from the politicians and the talking heads is that the joblessness and underemployment in America's low-income households rival their heights in the Great Depression of the 1930s -- and in some instances are worse. The same holds true for some categories of blue-collar workers. Anyone who thinks this devastating problem is going away soon, or that the economy can be put back on track without addressing it, is deluded.
 There has been talk about income inequality over the past several years, but what is happening now is catastrophic. The Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston divided American households into 10 groups based on annual household income. Then it analyzed labor conditions in each of the groups during the fourth quarter of 2009.
 The highest group, with household incomes of $150,000 or more, had an unemployment rate during that quarter of 3.2 percent. The next highest, with incomes of $100,000 to 149,999, had an unemployment rate of 4 percent. 
 Contrast those figures with the unemployment rate of the lowest group, which had annual household incomes of $12,499 or less. The unemployment rate of that group during the fourth quarter of last year was a staggering 30.8 percent. That's more than five points higher than the overall jobless rate at the height of the Depression.
 The next lowest group, with incomes of $12,500 to $20,000, had an unemployment rate of 19.1 percent.
 These are the kinds of jobless rates that push families already struggling on meager incomes into destitution. And such gruesome gaps in the condition of groups at the top and bottom of the economic ladder are unmistakable signs of impending societal instability. This is dangerous stuff. Nothing good can come of vast armies of the unemployed just sitting out there, simmering.
 When the data about underemployment is factored in -- meaning individuals who are working part time but would like to work full time, and those who have stopped looking but would take a job if one were available -- the picture only worsens. In the lowest group, the underemployment rate was 20.6 percent, compared with just 1.6 percent in the highest group.
 The people suffering the most drastic employment reversals in this recession have been those who were in the lower-income groups to begin with -- the young, less well-educated workers, especially black and Hispanic high school dropouts, and certain categories of service workers, such as food preparers and building cleaners. Blue-collar workers were also hammered, especially those in the construction industry.
 This is not to say that the middle class has not been hurt badly by the recession. It has been. In last year's fourth quarter, the group with household incomes of $40,000 to $49,000 had a jobless rate of 9 percent, close to the disastrous national average. The $50,000 to $59,000 group had a 7.8 percent jobless rate, and households earning $60,000 to $75,000 had a jobless rate of 6.4 percent.
 The point here is that those in the lower-income groups are in a much, much deeper hole than the general commentary on the recession would lead people to believe. And none of the policy prescriptions being offered by the administration or the leaders of either party in Congress would in any way substantially alleviate the plight of those groups.
 We talk about the recession as if all of its victims were suffering equally, and all will be helped by some bland, class-and-category-neutral solution. 
 That is so wrong. As the Center for Labor Market Studies explained in its report: ''A true labor market depression faced those in the bottom two deciles of the income distribution; a deep labor market recession prevailed among those in the middle of the distribution, and close to a full employment environment prevailed at the top.''
 Those who believe this grievous economic situation will right itself of its own accord or can be corrected without bold, targeted (and, yes, expensive) government action are still reading from the Ronald Reagan (someday it will trickle down) hymnal.

HEADLINE: Investors Extract A Payout

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Wouldn't it be great if we could turn back the clock to 2007? 
 Life was far simpler then. The Dow was cresting above 14,000, buyouts were booming and ''global financial meltdown'' was not yet the topic of elevator conversations. 
 It seems a consortium of private equity investors misses those heady days so much that it replayed a nifty financial move last week that feels very 2007. 
 It didn't get a lot of coverage, but HCA, the giant hospital chain, announced that it was paying its shareholders a $1.75 billion special dividend.
 Normally, such a large dividend might be a bullish sign about the health care industry -- and perhaps even the broader economy. But look a little closer.
 Recall that HCA, which the family of former Senator Bill Frist founded in 1968 as the Hospital Corporation of America, was taken private in 2006 at the height of the buyout boom for $33 billion. 
 Its buyers included Merrill Lynch, Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and, yes, some of HCA's own managers. Collectively, the group put down $5.5 billion in cash -- the rest was a giant loan from a syndicate of banks.
 So when HCA says it will pay a dividend to its shareholders, what it really means is that its shareholders -- the private equity firms that control the board -- have decided to pay themselves.
 That might be a reasonable thing to do in a bull market with a highly profitable company that has little debt. But just look at HCA's balance sheet: it has a staggering $25.7 billion worth of debt that it still needs to pay off. 
 As Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit, wrote in a report to clients, HCA's $1.75 billion dividend payment last week ''completely offsets the comparatively meager $1.6 billion in debt paid off in 2008-2009.'' 
 Worse, Ms. Bryan noted, ''most of that debt reduction was funded not from HCA's chronically weak free cash flow but by $1.6 billion in asset sales.'' Not one to mince words, she titled her report ''Shell Game.''
 Back in 2007, if you'll recall, private equity firms, buoyed by a peaking market, routinely paid themselves huge dividends. They would often take out new loans to write themselves giant checks, just like homeowners took out second mortgages to buy flat-screen TVs and boats. 
 So when the economy turned against them, the companies owned by private equity firms found themselves with little cushion and were forced to resort to layoffs and to cut back on research and development; some were forced to file for bankruptcy, like the Simmons Company, which makes bedding.
 Now, the dividend is officially back, though none as large as HCA's. Vanguard Health Systems recently paid out $300 million to the Blackstone Group, for example, and Quintiles Transnational paid $275 million to a large consortium that includes Bain and TPG, among others.
 Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with paying dividends to shareholders. Public companies do it routinely. But highly leveraged companies face bigger risks.
 In fairness to HCA and its investors, they say there are signs the hospital business is improving. HCA's revenue is expected to increase to $30 billion for 2009, from $28.4 billion in 2008; and net income is projected to rise to $1 billion, compared with $673 million for 2008. 
 And HCA's leverage ratio has gone down, not up -- from 6.4 times to 5. (Then again, if HCA had used the $1.75 billion to pay down debt instead of its shareholders, the leverage ratio would have dropped to 4.7.)
 ''The distribution balances a return to stockholders with maintenance of a strong balance sheet,'' a spokesman for HCA said. ''This is the first time since we went private in 2006 that we've provided a return to stockholders who invested in HCA at that time.'' The spokesman also said 1,600 HCA employees would receive part of the dividend. 
 Frank G. Morgan, an analyst at RBC, said the dividend reflected HCA's position of strength. 
 ''As the largest hospital operator in the U.S. with 163 acute-care facilities located in 20 states, HCA represents a bellwether for the for-profit hospital industry,'' said Mr. Morgan, suggesting that HCA's announcement was a ''positive early data point for the industry.''
 It also is true that HCA's investors still have skin in the game -- they will be taking out less than a third of their investment in the company, so arguably they have every incentive to want it to succeed.
 Nonetheless, the half-dozen investors and analysts I informally polled about HCA's dividend questioned the rationale of the payment amid an uncertain economy. None of them wanted to be quoted by name. So the microphone goes again to Ms. Bryan of Gimme Credit.
 ''We long have been wary of the quality of HCA's revenue and Ebitda,'' Ms. Bryan said, using the shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ''and now the payout of a fat dividend has slashed the odds that HCA will launch an I.P.O. anytime soon. We also expect further pressure in 2010 as pricing fades for hospital operators and cost inflation outpaces revenue growth.''
 For the sake of the hospitals, let's hope she's wrong.

HEADLINE: U.N. Climate Panel and Its Chief Face a Siege on Their Credibility

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Just over two years ago, Rajendra K. Pachauri seemed destined for a scientist's version of sainthood: A vegetarian economist-engineer who leads the United Nations' climate change panel, he accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the panel, sharing the honor with former Vice President Al Gore.
 But Dr. Pachauri and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are now under intense scrutiny, facing accusations of scientific sloppiness and potential financial conflicts of interest from climate skeptics, right-leaning politicians and even some mainstream scientists. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, called for Dr. Pachauri's resignation last week.
 Critics, writing in Britain's Sunday Telegraph and elsewhere, have accused Dr. Pachauri of profiting from his work as an adviser to businesses, including Deutsche Bank and Pegasus Capital Advisors, a New York investment firm -- a claim he denies. 
 They have also unearthed and publicized problems with the intergovernmental panel's landmark 2007 report on climate change, which concluded that the planet was warming and that humans were likely to blame. 
 The report, they contend, misrepresents the state of scientific knowledge about diverse topics -- including the rate of melting of Himalayan glaciers and the rise in severe storms -- in a way that exaggerates the evidence for climate change.
 With a global climate treaty under negotiation and legislation pending in the United States, the climate panel has found itself in the political cross hairs, its judgments provoking passions normally reserved for issues like abortion and guns. The panel is charged by the United Nations with reviewing research to create periodic reports on climate risks, documents that are often used by governments to guide decisions, and its every conclusion is being dissected under a microscope.
 Several of the recent accusations have proved to be half-truths: While Dr. Pachauri does act as a paid consultant and adviser to many companies, he makes no money from these activities, he said. The payments go to the Energy and Resources Institute, the prestigious nonprofit research center based in Delhi that he founded in 1982 and still leads, where the money finances charitable projects like Lighting a Billion Lives, which provides solar lanterns in rural India. 
 ''My conscience is clear,'' Dr. Pachauri said in a lengthy telephone interview.
 The panel, in reviewing complaints about possible errors in its report, has so far found that one was justified and another was ''baseless.'' The general consensus among mainstream scientists is that the errors are in any case minor and do not undermine the report's conclusions.
 Still, the escalating controversy has led even many of them to conclude that the Nobel-winning panel needs improved scientific standards as well as a policy about what kinds of other work its officers may pursue. 
 ''When I look at Dr. Pachauri's case I see obvious and egregious problems,'' said Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist and professor of environmental science at the University of Colorado. He said that serving as an adviser to financial companies was inappropriate for the chairman of the United Nations' panel, whether Dr. Pachauri received payment directly or not.
 Dr. Pachauri bristles at the accusations, which he says are ''lies'' or ''distortions'' promulgated by groups hoping to undermine climate legislation and a treaty. 
 ''These people want to distort the picture for their own ends,'' Dr. Pachauri said, noting that the report was released two years ago and that the criticisms were only now coming into the limelight. ''What we're doing is not only above-board, but laudable,'' he said. ''These guys want me to resign, but I won't.''
 Dr. Pachauri, 69, said the only work income he received was a salary from the Energy and Resources Institute: about $49,000, according to his 2009 Indian tax return, which he provided to The New York Times. The return also lists $16,000 in other income, most of it interest on accounts in Indian banks.
 Dr. Pachauri acknowledged his role as an adviser and consultant to businesses, but he said that it was his responsibility as the panel's chairman to disseminate its findings to industry. 
 Nonetheless, Christopher Monckton, a leading climate skeptic, called the panel corrupt, adding: ''The chair is an Indian railroad engineer with very substantial direct and indirect financial vested interests in the matters covered in the climate panel's report. What on earth is he doing there?''
 A former adviser to Margaret Thatcher who also assailed Dr. Pachauri in a critique in Copenhagen that has since been widely circulated, Lord Monckton is now the chief policy adviser to the Science and Public Policy Institute, a Washington-based research and education institute that states on its Web site: ''Proved: There is no climate crisis.''
 As the accusations have snowballed in the last six weeks, Dr. Pachauri remains widely admired for his work on the intergovernmental panel, which relies on the collaborative work of hundreds of volunteer scientists to sift through current scientific evidence for its reports. He has served in an elected, unpaid position as chairman of the panel, often known by its initials, I.P.C.C., since 2002.
 ''There is no evidence that outside interests affected Pachauri's leadership of the I.P.C.C. at all,'' said Hal Harvey, chief executive of ClimateWorks, a foundation based in San Francisco that focuses on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The panel's process is so ''robust and transparent'' that it could not be undercut by ''personalities or errors,'' he said.
 He added, ''Anyone who is qualified to chair the I.P.C.C. will have interests in academics, science, politics or business; there are thousands of scientists on the I.P.C.C., and you need their expertise and they all have to come from somewhere.''
 Many government panels in the United States tolerate overt conflicts of interest in order to get expert advice, Mr. Harvey said, noting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase on its board.
 But most scientific agencies have explicit conflict-of-interest policies to ensure that expert advice is impartial. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, asks doctors who serve on drug advisory panels to disclose payments from pharmaceutical companies and can disqualify those whose financial involvement is too great.
 Dr. Pielke, the University of Colorado professor, said the United Nations panel, which has no explicit conflict policy, should do the same, adding, ''You need to make sure that advice is advice and not stealth advocacy.''
 Some critics have said that the intergovernmental panel's chairman should be employed full time by the United Nations while in office, and should eschew outside commitments.
 The accusations of errors in the panel's report -- most originating from two right-leaning British papers, The Sunday Telegraph and The Times of London -- have sullied the group's reputation. They follow a controversy that erupted late last year over e-mail messages and documents released without authorization from a climate research center in Britain. 
 In one case, the report included a sentence that said the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. The sentence was based on a decade-old interview with a glaciologist in a popular magazine; the scientist now says he was misquoted. The panel recently expressed ''regret'' for the error.
 The panel was also criticized for citing a study about financial losses after extreme weather events that found an increase in such losses of 2 percent a year from 1970 to 2005. That study had not been peer reviewed at the time, although it was later on.
 The panel has called the complaint ''baseless,'' noting that the study was cited appropriately and that other scientific data pointed to a recent rise in severe storms. 
 Lord Monckton said the incidents reflected a pattern of willful misrepresentation by scientists with financial and professional interests that render them unsuitable to give neutral advice.
 In response to the recent criticisms, Dr. Pachauri provided an accounting of some of his outside consulting fees paid to the Energy and Resources Institute. Those include about $140,000 from Deutsche Bank, $25,000 from Credit Suisse, $80,000 from Toyota and $48,750 from Yale. He has recently begun work as a strategic adviser for Pegasus, the investment firm, but has not yet attended a meeting, and no money has yet been paid to the Energy and Resources Institute. He has also provided advice free of charge to groups like the Chicago Climate Exchange. 
 The energy institute has financial interests in a number of companies. For example, it was awarded stock by the founders of GloriOil, a start-up based in Houston, in exchange for permission to use a method developed at the institute to extract residual oil from older wells. 
 ''We thought about it long and hard, and decided to get involved in this because the U.S. has the largest number of these wells and it is better than drilling offshore or in Alaska,'' Dr. Pachauri said.
 The institute also provides paid consulting. For example, engineers at the institute are designing two Indian solar parks for the Clinton Climate Initiative. Dr. Pachauri added that research institutes in poorer countries like India could not depend on government largess, as those in the United States did. The institute gets its money from a variety of sources, including the European Union, foundations and private companies.
 ''We have to generate our own resources from our work,'' he said. ''This is an institute that has pulled itself up by its bootstraps.''
 But even some academics who accept that climate change is a problem are concerned about such activities. 
 ''This is not about whether this is a good person or a good cause; it's about the integrity of the scientific process,'' Dr. Pielke said, adding: ''This has become so polarized, it's like you must be in cahoots with the bad guys if you are at all negative about Pachauri.''

HEADLINE: On Health Bill, G.O.P.'s Road Is a New Map

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Republicans take President Obama up on his invitation to hash out their differences over health care this month, they will carry with them a fairly well-developed set of ideas intended to make health insurance more widely available and affordable, by emphasizing tax incentives and state innovations, with no new federal mandates and only a modest expansion of the federal safety net.
 It is not clear that Republicans and the White House are willing to negotiate seriously with each other, and Mr. Obama has rejected Republican demands that he start from scratch in developing health care legislation.
 But Congressional Republicans have laid out principles and alternatives that provide a road map to what a Republican health care bill would look like if they had the power to decide the outcome. 
 The different approaches will be on display Feb. 25, when lawmakers from both parties are scheduled to go to Blair House, across the street from the White House, for a televised clash of health policy ideas. 
 The Republicans rely more on the market and less on government. They would not require employers to provide insurance. They oppose the Democrats' call for a big expansion of Medicaid, which Republicans say would burden states with huge long-term liabilities.
 While the Congressional Budget Office has not analyzed all the Republican proposals, it is clear that they would not provide coverage to anything like the number of people -- more than 30 million -- who would gain insurance under the Democrats' proposals. 
 But Republicans say they can make incremental progress without the economic costs they contend the Democratic plans pose to the nation. As one way to encourage competition and drive down costs, Republican members of Congress want to make it easier for insurance companies to sell their policies across state lines, an idea included in a limited form in the Democratic bills. 
 Republicans would offer federal money as a reward to states that achieve specified reductions in premiums or in the number of people without insurance.
 Republicans would provide federal money to states to establish and expand high-risk pools, for people with chronic illnesses who cannot find private insurance at an affordable price. 
 Republicans also contend that changes in state medical malpractice laws could lower costs and slow the growth of premiums. However, some of these proposals -- like federal limits on damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages -- are potentially in conflict with the Republicans' emphasis on federalism and state autonomy.
 In contrast to the bills passed by the House and the Senate, which would remake the health care system, Republican leaders favor a more modest approach.
 Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said he and his colleagues were skeptical of ''grand legislative policy schemes'' and favored ''a step-by-step approach'' focused on lowering health costs for families and businesses.
 ''It is arrogant to imagine that 100 senators are wise enough to reform comprehensively a health care system that constitutes 17 percent of the world's largest economy and affects 300 million Americans of disparate backgrounds and circumstances,'' Mr. Alexander said. 
 The Republican health care agenda can be inferred from bills they have offered in the last few years and from their criticism of Mr. Obama's proposals and of Democratic bills passed by both houses of Congress last year.
 Republicans want to expand the use of health savings accounts, to cover routine expenses for people who enroll in high-deductible health plans. Democrats denounce such accounts as a tax shelter for higher-income people.
 Many Republicans want to expand the role of private insurance companies in Medicare. Insurers already manage Medicare's prescription drug benefit, and Republicans see that as a model.
 Republicans agree on the need to slow the explosive growth of Medicare, but say the savings should be used to shore up Medicare, not to help finance a new entitlement program.
 Democrats said the Republican proposals would do little to solve the crisis in health care. The proposals are ''as skimpy as a hospital gown,'' said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.
 Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said, ''If the Republicans' health care plan was a plan for a fire department, they would rush into a burning building, and they would rush out and leave everybody behind.''
 Like Democrats, Republicans are divided on some questions, including the taxation of employer-provided health benefits. 
 Some Republicans, like Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, would replace the tax-free treatment of health benefits with a refundable tax credit for the purchase of insurance -- an idea similar to one advanced in the 2008 presidential campaign by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
 Other Republicans say that eliminating the current tax break for employer-provided insurance would amount to a tax increase and should be opposed.
 Some Republicans, like Mr. Coburn and Mr. Ryan, would encourage but not require states to set up health insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, where consumers could compare and buy coverage. The exchanges would require insurers to offer coverage to all applicants, regardless of their age or medical history. Insurers participating in the exchange would have to offer at least the same benefits made available to members of Congress.
 While Republicans generally oppose any new entitlement or tax increase, they do have some areas of potential agreement with Democrats. They agree, for example, on the need to emphasize wellness and preventive health programs; to provide more transparency for price and quality data on doctors and hospitals; and to speed the approval of lower-cost generic versions of high-cost biotechnology medicines.
 Many Republicans would also join Democrats in requiring insurers to let dependent children stay on their parents' policies through age 25 or 26. 
 Democrats and Republicans share another goal: making it easier for small businesses to buy insurance. The House and Senate bills would offer tax credits for two years to businesses with 25 or fewer employees to help them buy coverage.
 Republicans would help small businesses band together and buy insurance through trade associations and professional societies.
 But Democratic lawmakers, like consumer advocates and many state officials, oppose Republican suggestions that such small-business health plans should be exempt from state regulation, including requirements for the coverage of specific services. 
 In a letter to the White House on Monday, the top two House Republicans, Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Eric Cantor of Virginia, said members of their party would be ''reluctant to participate'' in the meeting with Mr. Obama if the bills passed by the House and the Senate were the starting point. The American people have ''soundly rejected'' those bills, they said.
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, welcomed Mr. Obama's invitation. But like many in his party, he expressed concern that the session would be used as ''an arena for political theater.''

HEADLINE: Hasbro Shares Rise Sharply on Higher-Than-Expected Earnings and a Positive Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Strong sales of boys' brands including Transformers and Nerf helped the toymaker Hasbro post a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, sending its shares up more than 12 percent. 
 The company, which owns the G.I. Joe, Tonka and Playskool brands, also said it expected sales and earnings per share to grow this year, although it did not offer specific estimates.
 ''Over all in 2009, the global economic environment did not improve significantly, but it also did not deteriorate further,'' the chief executive, Brian Goldner, said. ''We were well positioned when the consumer came out to shop, and the consumer did come out to shop, albeit late in the fourth quarter.''
 Stock in Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., rose $3.91, to $34.71 a share. 
 Transformers, helped by the ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' movie in June, took in $592 million in revenue in 2009, up 23 percent compared with 2007, when the original ''Transformers'' movie was released. Revenue for G.I. Joe, also helped by a summer blockbuster, totaled more than $125 million. Nerf, Play-Doh and Tonka grew 25 percent during the year.
 Girls' brands were weaker. Mr. Goldner said brands including Playskool and Furreal Friends were lower because the company eliminated higher-priced items in the lines in 2009.
 Hasbro said it earned $165.6 million, or $1.09 a share, on sales of $1.38 billion. A year earlier, it earned 93.6 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $1.23 billion.
 Its profit topped the 81 cents expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The company is working on a joint venture children's network called the Hub with Discovery Communications, scheduled to have its debut in the fall. Programming will include shows based on ''My Little Pony'' and ''Transformers,'' among others.
 Toy tie-ins with movies have traditionally done well for Hasbro, and the company has a full slate of movies coming over the next three years.

HEADLINE: Bills Stalled, Hospitals Fear Rising Unpaid Care

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
President Obama says he aims to keep trying. But what happens if the health care legislation cannot be revived, and tens of millions of uninsured Americans continue without coverage?
 For the nation's hospitals, at least, the cost of doing nothing in Washington translates into tens of billions of dollars each year in medical bills that go unpaid by patients with little or no insurance. 
 Nationwide, the cost of unpaid care for hospitals, which includes charity care as well as money that could not be collected from patients, was around $36 billion in 2008. It is expected to spiral higher. The number of people without insurance in this country could increase to as high as 58 million by 2014, from about 49 million now, according to an estimate by the Urban Institute.
 No wonder hospital systems like Park Nicollet Health Services near Minneapolis worry about their futures if the health care legislation remains stalled. 
 ''Our business model will continue to falter,'' said Dr. David Abelson, chief executive of Park Nicollet, a not-for-profit system that runs a 426-bed hospital and a chain of clinics. 
 Park Nicollet has had to cut back services and lay off hundreds of employees as its level of uncompensated care rose -- to $43 million last year, up from $29 million in 2007. 
 And when the hospital provides care under state and federal programs like Medicaid and Medicare, it is already reimbursed below its costs, Dr. Abelson said. Park Nicollet, whose revenue was $1.2 billion last year, says it expects to lose $120 million on government programs in 2010. 
 Medicaid and Medicare are likely to see sharp budget cuts with or without the legislation -- although the House and Senate bills have other provisions meant to help control medical costs over all.
 For hospitals, unpaid bills can stem from uninsured patients like a man who recently showed up at Park Nicollet's emergency room in withdrawal from alcohol. Besides needing emergency heart surgery, the patient was treated for respiratory failure and alcoholic hepatitis, which involved a five-day stay in the intensive care unit. His care ended up costing $85,000, which the hospital has little hope of recovering. 
 With the ranks of the uninsured growing, hospitals will most likely treat even more patients who cannot afford care. For one thing, hospitals are legally obliged to medically stabilize anyone who shows up in the emergency room. But they also choose to provide charity care for many people who clearly cannot afford to pay their bills. 
 No one knows whether President Obama and Congressional Democrats will eventually regain the momentum they lost after the upset victory by Scott Brown, a Republican, in the Senate race in Massachusetts ended the Democratic caucus's filibuster-proof majority. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, continues to vow that health legislation will pass this year. And in a CBS interview Sunday afternoon, the president said he planned to convene a bipartisan health care session at the White House to try breaking the political impasse.
 Hospital executives hope Ms. Pelosi's and the president's perseverance pays off. 
 ''If nothing happens, it's more of the same, and it will continue to be harder and harder in terms of financial viability,'' said Nickolas A. Vitale, the senior vice president for financial operations for Beaumont Hospitals, a hospital system based in Royal Oak, Mich., whose uncompensated care has increased by 20 percent a year since 2005.
 There is still plenty of debate, to be sure, over how effective the legislation would actually be in expanding coverage for the uninsured. Many of the legislation's most significant aspects would not take place for years -- like the insurance industry overhaul aimed at making it easier for more Americans to find affordable coverage and the federal subsidies meant to bring the cost of a policy within reach of more people. 
 Given the weak economy, moreover, hospitals would probably face a challenging environment over the next few years even if the president signed a health care bill tomorrow. 
 But hospital executives and analysts say that without the legislation, many hospitals will struggle under the burden of caring for greater numbers of people who cannot pay. 
 In the short term, ''it's almost no harm, no foul,'' said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst at CRT Capital in Stamford, Conn. 
 ''But over the longer term, there is plenty of foul,'' Ms. Skolnick added. ''Hospitals should not be the insurers of last resort.''
 Even for many patients who do have coverage under Medicaid or Medicare, some experts say, severe state and federal budget constraints mean hospitals will probably get squeezed by significant government payment cuts, whether or not the overhaul legislation moves forward. 
 Under the proposed legislation, hospitals had already agreed to significant cuts under the Medicare program as part of their deal with the White House to come up with $155 billion of savings over 10 years to help pay for the coverage expansion. 
 Many hospital executives worry that Congress will enact those cuts even in the absence of more comprehensive legislation meant to help ease the burden of caring for so many people who cannot pay. ''If it's just cuts, that's not reform,'' said Richard J. Umbdenstock, the president and chief executive of the American Hospital Association, the industry's main trade group. 
 There could also be greater resistance by the private insurance industry. Under the current system, private insurers pay hospitals more than the government does -- meaning that private insurers and their customers help make up for low payments by government programs. But few expect the private insurers to continue footing the bill for the shortfall. 
 ''If the public payers continue to ratchet down the reimbursement enough,'' hospitals will not be able to charge the private insurers enough to make up the difference, said Michael J. Dowling, the chief executive of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, a large New York hospital system. ''The private sector won't be able to carry it.'' 
 The private insurers are likely to take an increasingly harder line against hospitals, as they try to contain the underlying medical costs that have helped fuel the steady rise in the premiums they charge.
 A recent standoff between United Healthcare, one of the nation's largest health plans, and Continuum Health Partners, a group of five New York hospitals, may foreshadow more widespread disputes to come.
 Meanwhile, the gulf may widen between large, well-capitalized hospital systems and smaller institutions that are clearly struggling, said Lisa Martin, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. Moody's recently released a report on nonprofit hospitals predicting that the next year and a half could be ''one of the toughest environments in decades.''
 ''The smaller to medium-size single-site hospitals are the ones who are going to be most at risk,'' said Ms. Martin, who predicts that some of those hospitals will end up being purchased or absorbed by larger systems. 
 Regardless of what happens in Washington, some hospital executives say the industry should already be working on ways to improve care, like reducing the number of times a patient is readmitted to the hospital, said Mr. Dowling at North Shore-Long Island Jewish. ''Reform at the national level is not the panacea everyone thought it was,'' he said. 
 But executives like Dr. Abelson at Park Nicollet say they are still disappointed that some aspects of the health care legislation may not materialize if the effort dies. He cited proposed experiments aimed at moving the system away from simply paying more for more care to instead rewarding hospitals and doctors for better care.
 ''The various bills contained some pilots in the right direction,'' he said, and Park Nicollet had been interested in participating. ''We were positioning ourselves for reform.''

HEADLINE: North Jersey Finds Popularity as Home for Data Centers

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
The boxy three-story building at 5851 Westside Avenue in North Bergen, N.J., attracts as much attention from passing motorists as a cornfield by the side of an interstate in Iowa.
 No signs proclaim its occupant, and its generic off-white facade and empty parking lot offer few clues as to what prompted developers to rehab the 163,000-square-foot structure in 2008, after it had sat vacant for about a decade. 
 It is only after passing through a thicket of security checkpoints that the facility's identity as a state-of-the-art data center becomes apparent. Filled with hundreds of miles of fiber optic wire and rows of 15-ton diesel generators, it houses the data servers of more than 200 companies, from a video game programmer to a financial services company occupying 3,000 square feet of caged-in cabinet space. It is one of a handful of such centers to have opened in New Jersey since 2008, but analysts predict that at least eight more will open this year alone. 
 With a never-ending stream of new Internet applications, social networking sites, on-demand video and text messaging straining the nation's information storage capabilities, the data center business has become a bright spot in the commercial real estate market. Worldwide demand for data centers is expected to rise 12 percent this year, 14 percent in 2011 and 17 percent in 2012, according to Tier1 Research.
 ''My first pager beeped, and that's all it did,'' said Herb Villa, an engineer for Switch and Data, a data center provider based in Florida that owns the North Bergen facility and 33 others across the country. ''It didn't even have the alphanumeric capability of the later models. Now you have the iPod and everything else. That's the difference, and that's what's driving the new demand.''
 Last month, the social networking site Facebook said it intended to build a 147,000-square-foot data center in the forested central Oregon town of Prineville at a cost of $188.2 million. The storage facility will accommodate some 350 million Facebook members, whose every breathless status update has, until now, been stored in leased space at centers in California and Virginia. 
 Later this year, the New York Stock Exchange is expected to relocate most of its data servers and those of financial customers like Goldman Sachs to a new 400,000-square-foot building in Bergen County. The site, say brokers who are not involved with the deal, will be one of the most heavily fortified data centers in the country.
 Data center providers and industry analysts said that North Jersey was an ideal location for the data needs of New York City's large financial services industry. In a business that does countless transactions in a second, a greater distance would add milliseconds to every action taken online, but if the center is situated too close to Manhattan, construction costs can soar. Michael Boccardi, chief executive of Cervalis, a 10-year-old data center provider with facilities in Connecticut and New York State, said his company chose a site in Passaic County for its first New Jersey facility for those reasons.
 ''We felt that we wanted to be close but not too close, but still within that core 25-mile vicinity of New York City,'' Mr. Boccardi said of the 150,000-square-foot operation, which he said would open by the end of the month and accommodate many of the financial services firms that were affected by Sept. 11. 
 Elsewhere in New Jersey, Credit Suisse is expected to open a 285,000-square-foot data center in Clifton by next year, according to brokers involved in the transaction who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. 
 ''Even though capital constraints are holding a lot of companies back from being able to make significant expenditures, we're tracking about two million square feet of data center space in New Jersey that is in some phase of vertical construction,'' said Michael Pembroke, a senior vice president for leasing and marketing at Russo Development, the group that is leasing facilities to Credit Suisse and the New York Stock Exchange.
 The surge in demand comes as a relief to many of the largest data center providers. Construction slowed at the national level as a result of the global credit crisis over the last several years. Because of the complexities of erecting data centers, which can cost more than $1,200 per square foot, many projects that were announced as long ago as 2007 are only now beginning construction, several brokers said.
 ''I'd go even further and characterize 2007 and most of 2008 as not just slowed down, but certainly on the development side an almost total freeze,'' said Colton Brown, a managing director at FirstService Williams, which has completed approximately 1.5 million square feet of data center transactions over the last four years. ''These are extremely capital-intensive projects, and very few people have had access to the funds to continue building.''
 Mr. Brown, who has brokered deals on behalf of many of the largest data center providers, said that while the commercial real estate market in general was tied to the jobless rate, data centers were less sensitive to high unemployment because they typically housed wires, servers and generators -- but very few employees. He added that new technology had allowed more small and midsize businesses to outsource data services, further driving demand for such space.
 ''Putting that risk onto somebody else is a very appealing option, and something we're seeing more of,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Basically the cost savings are that you don't have to build this stuff out yourself. Instead of spending millions of dollars in building yourself, you can lease space from somebody else.''
 DuPont Fabros Technology, which develops and operates data centers and leases space to companies like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft, halted three construction projects in early 2008 after financing dried up. But after raising more than $175 million through the sale of debt and in the equity markets -- according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- the group was able to restart work on large facilities in Ashburn, Va., and Northern New Jersey late last year. Both projects are expected to begin operating this year.
 Along with other publicly traded data center operators like Digital Realty Trust, DuPont Fabros's stock surged at the end of 2009 in a way that few real estate firms could match. Since December 2008, its share price has risen from under $2 a share to nearly $16 a share
 ''We're still in the beginnings of the growth of new business models that will change the way we do business and change the way we live,'' said Hossein Fateh, chief executive of DuPont Fabros, who pointed to the new AppleiPad. ''That's just going to mean more and more demand for data center space.''

 Historically, the government offered little help, and corporations were reluctant to sponsor those who competed in obscure sports. This reality led many athletes to a surprising destination: jobs with the Indian railway.
 ''The railway, police and military are the big three groups that provide some sort of support system and security for an athlete,'' said Hakimuddin S. Habibulla, a co-founder of GoSports, a sports management and consultancy company based in Bangalore. ''If you are part of one of these public-sector companies, there is the opportunity of getting promotions and getting a basic bonus. But if you're not part of any of these institutions, it's much more difficult.''
 Life is easier on the inside because the railway and other departments of India's sprawling bureaucracy compete for national championships in dozens of sports. Much like American college teams, they recruit to find the best athletes to fill jobs set aside for athletes. 
 Shiva Keshavan, a three-time Olympian who will compete in luge at the Vancouver Games beginning Friday, was never able to pursue his sport full time. After the 2006 Turin Games, where he finished 25th, he ran out of money and did not compete for nearly two years.
 ''I applied to public companies for this kind of honorary job, but winter sports are still far behind,'' Keshavan said. ''Sometimes they say they don't even recognize winter sports.''
 At the railway, athletes often become ticket collectors because they can work day or night, affording them time to train. It also allows them to travel for free around the country. They receive light workloads, shorter hours and perks like coaching and training facilities. But athletic performance is closely monitored; if someone does not measure up, a part-time desk job can quickly become full time.
 The work can be unglamorous. Suma Shirur, an Olympic shooter from Mumbai who was recruited for the railway's team, was given a basic data-entry position.
 ''It wasn't easy to go to the office and stay there for two hours because it was so mundane,'' said Shirur, who graduated from college with a degree in chemistry. ''But I always thought, O.K., this is for my shooting. And I had my goals, so I always had it in mind that I'm only here for my paycheck.''
 The salary was helpful for Shirur, who had a supportive family to fall back on, but for others it is essential.
 ''Most athletes come from lower, middle-class families,'' said G. S. Mander, a vice president of the Indian Olympic Association. ''A job is very important, and the railway is the largest employer of athletes.''
 A steady paycheck is not their only incentive. Successful Indian athletes rarely return home to endorsement deals. Instead, for medals won and records broken at international competitions, they are rewarded with bonuses and promotions.
 Shirur has maneuvered her way up the hierarchy from clerk to chief office superintendent. And when Sushil Kumar returned from the 2008 Beijing Games with a bronze medal in wrestling, he received a $50,000 bonus from the railway. 
 But the Winter Olympic sports remain a tougher sell even to the absorptive Indian bureaucracy.
 After becoming the youngest luge participant ever as a 16-year-old at the 1998 Nagano Games in Japan, Keshavan returned home to the Himalayas and went to work waiting tables. When his sled broke down, he repaired it. If he was injured in a competition, opposing teams would let him consult their trainers. 
 But in 2008, after pitching himself to companies home and abroad, Swiss Air offered to cover Keshavan's travel expenses. Limca, a soft drink company, also chipped in. 
 Keshavan was able to train and compete for a full season, and it paid off in a bronze medal at the Asian Championships. Last year, the Ministry of Sport provided $20,000 to finance his training and hired a full-time coach.
 But Keshavan still works in the off-season, he said, because he cannot make a living competing in luge. He would like to continue after the Vancouver Games and take another shot as a full-time athlete to see if he can bring home an Olympic medal.
 India's appetite for Olympic success -- summer and winter -- is growing, as is the country's commitment. When the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal took his family to the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, they sought Indian athletes to cheer. Distressed by the small number, he donated $10 million to establish the Mittal Champions Trust to kick-start Olympic progress by providing top-notch facilities and coaching.
 ''Initially, many years ago, India lacked the funds and we couldn't get the exposure that we needed,'' said Manisha Malhotra, who runs the trust's day-to-day operations. ''But over the years that has changed.'' 
 In 2008, Abhinav Bindra captured India's first individual Olympic gold medal, in the 10-meter air rifle event. The victory stoked a sense of national pride, raised expectations and got the government's attention. 
 ''Government support improved because in Beijing, we won medals,'' Mander said. ''There's been much done in terms of training and hiring support staff in the last two or three years.'' 
 Financial incentives are also on the rise. Bindra received an estimated $500,000 from a dozen different state and national government bodies, and a free lifetime railway pass.
 Although India has begun rewarding champions, fame and fortune have not trickled down to the world-class athletes who end up as Olympic also-rans, like Shirur.
 She was proud of her performance in the women's air rifle event at the Athens Games.
 ''I finished eighth, and I was happy just to be in the finals, but in India it didn't make a difference,'' said Shirur, who spent $10,000 to compete. ''Unfortunately in India, only a medal matters -- nothing else.''
 Despite India's recent Olympic improvement, corporate sponsors still look to cricket for athlete endorsements.
 ''India in many ways is just coming out of the dark ages when it comes to sports,'' Habibulla of GoSports said. ''It's only now that India's economy has begun looking at sports as an investment.'' 
 That means institutions like the railway will continue to be a significant contributor to the development of athletes, Mander said. 
 ''If you get medals, the government gives you an award, but the most important thing is the job,'' he said. ''It gives security, it gives flexibility. You're looked after by the government and the organization.''

HEADLINE: Illegal Immigrant Population Drops

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
The number of illegal immigrants in the United States declined to 10.8 million in January 2009, a drop of one million since a peak in 2007, according to an estimate Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security. Demographers said the figures, based on census data and the most recent estimate by the department, showed the largest two-year drop in the population of illegal immigrants since 1990, after which it began a period of rapid growth. Homeland Security Department researchers noted that the decline coincided with the recession, while Steven Camarota, a demographer at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said that stepped-up enforcement was also a factor. About 62 percent of illegal immigrants are from Mexico, the report said.

HEADLINE: Airgas Rejects Takeover Bid From Its Rival, Air Products

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Airgas, the industrial gases company, formally rejected a $5.1 billion takeover offer from its rival, Air Products and Chemicals, on Tuesday saying the proposal ''significantly undervalues'' the company. 
 In a letter sent to Air Products' chairman and chief executive, John E. McGlade, Airgas rejected both the current $60-a-share cash bid and a $62-a-share cash-and-stock offer made in December.
 ''Airgas' management and its board are extremely enthusiastic about our company's prospects and are confident of achieving stockholder returns well in excess of what can be derived from Air Products' unsolicited and opportunistic proposal,'' Airgas's chief executive, Peter McCausland, wrote in the letter.
 He added: ''It makes no sense for the Airgas stockholders to transfer the future value of Airgas to Air Products at a bargain-basement price.''
 The letter was largely a formality, since Airgas had rebuffed two previous proposals from Air Products over the last four months and had privately dismissed the latest approach.
 In its response on Tuesday, Airgas questioned the timing of the Air Products offer, which came only days after Airgas gave earnings guidance that fell below analysts' expectations. Airgas contends that its financial health will recover along with the economy and that until 2009, its stock had handily outperformed that of Air Products.
 For now, Airgas contends that it would be better served by remaining independent. People briefed on the company's plans, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that the board did not currently intend to agree to a key Air Products demand: the formation of an independent committee to study the takeover proposal.
 Early last week, advisers to Air Products contacted advisers to Airgas seeking a meeting, according to people briefed on the matter. Airgas's advisers said they would take it to the company's board, which met this week, but no meeting was scheduled. 
 An Air Products spokesman said in a statement: ''After missing its earnings and lowering guidance, it is remarkable that Airgas is asking its shareholders to believe they will receive greater value simply with the passage of time.''
 Shares in Airgas, which is based in Radnor, Pa., rose 1.3 percent on Tuesday to $61.35 before the company issued its formal rejection. Shares in Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., fell 0.6 percent to $67.95.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Orchestra's Ticket Sales Add to Woes

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Orchestra suffered unexpectedly weak ticket sales in the fall, an orchestra member said, yet another blow in a spiraling financial crisis that has been coupled with a leadership vacuum at one of the world's elite orchestras.
 ''The situation is very serious, and the musicians are looking at the situation with management to find the best course of action,'' John Koen, a cellist and the chairman of the players' committee, said. Mr. Koen added that the poor ticket sales made ''a bad situation a little bit worse.'' 
 Meanwhile, he said, $8 million of a planned $15 million emergency fund had been raised from donors to tide over the orchestra. ''The bridge funding should be enough, if we get it, to get us through this temporary crisis,'' Mr. Koen said. 
 The orchestra's new president and chief executive, Allison Vulgamore, on the job for barely a month, faced the board formally for the first time on Monday at a meeting. After a period during which the orchestra had no permanent board chairman, executive or music director, Richard B. Worley was appointed chairman last year, leading to the hiring of Ms. Vulgamore, who came to Philadelphia after a long career at the Atlanta Symphony.
 No music director has been named since the previous one, Christoph Eschenbach, announced his departure in 2006. Charles Dutoit is chief conductor.
 After her appointment was announced in September, Ms. Vulgamore said one of her chief tasks would be to come up with a new business model for the orchestra. But even before the board meeting she had to contend with suggestions that the orchestra might seek protection under bankruptcy laws. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last month that when asked if the orchestra could face a bankruptcy declaration, Mr. Worley said: ''I don't know the answer. I can tell you our effort is to avoid bankruptcy and to achieve a recovery for the orchestra.''
 Ms. Vulgamore said, according to the newspaper, ''It isn't preferable.''
 Orchestra officials seem to have entered a defensive crouch. Ms. Vulgamore did not respond to several messages. Katherine Blodgett, the orchestra's vice president for communications and public relations, did not respond to numerous requests over the past two weeks for information about the orchestra's finances or when the new season's programs would be announced.
 On Tuesday Ms. Blodgett said, ''I don't have anything for you right now,'' adding that Ms. Vulgamore was unavailable.
 In the fall the orchestra reported a deficit of $3.2 million on a budget of about $47 million for last season. That shortfall, the orchestra said at the time, could rise to at least $7.5 million this season. Many American orchestras, which depend on donations, grants and endowment income for most of their expenses, are suffering financial woes in the recession.
 The Inquirer reported that the orchestra's endowment stood at $112 million as of Nov. 30, while assets listed in the orchestra's tax return for the fiscal year ending August 2008 were $143 million. About $5.5 million of the assets were unrestricted, the newspaper said. Unrestricted assets are often used to secure lines of credit.
 Orchestra members too were reluctant to comment. One spoke on condition of anonymity, saying Ms. Vulgamore had told the players not to speak to outsiders.
 ''I really don't know if they have anything up their sleeve,'' said this member. ''With Allison's appointment, I'm praying that she has the insight and the spine to do what needs to be done and take control of the situation.'' The player added, ''It remains to be seen whether there's somebody in control.''
 The board called in a group of industry experts last spring to help guide it out of the crisis. The task force, led by Thomas W. Morris, former executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra, issued a report with recommendations. Mr. Morris declined to comment, but one industry official familiar with matters at the orchestra said the board did not appear inclined to accept the recommendations. The comments were offered anonymously because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter.
 The musicians' stated willingness to cooperate with management is significant because of a recent history of labor troubles at the Philadelphia Orchestra. A year ago the orchestra announced cuts in salary and staff members, and it canceled a European tour scheduled for last summer.
 On Sunday the orchestra came in for some ribbing from a columnist in The Inquirer over the catchphrase of its new advertising campaign, ''Unexpect yourself.''
 ''The phrase -- unnatural, forced and heretofore unused in the English language -- suggests something confined to boudoirs or bathrooms,'' wrote the columnist, Karen Heller.

HEADLINE: China's Exports Surge While Germany's Slip

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and JUDY DEMPSEY; Judy Dempsey reported from Berlin and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
China announced late Wednesday morning that its exports climbed 21 percent in January from a year earlier, while imports surged 85.5 percent. It was the latest sign that world trade is starting to recover from the financial crisis. 
 Imports rose impressively, and in line with economists' expectations, because imports a year ago were so weak. Many Chinese export factories practically stopped buying raw materials then as their orders dried up, but have been restocking since late spring.
 China's exports showed a somewhat smaller increase than expected; the consensus of economists had been that exports increased 28 percent. But the healthy jump in exports last month could still fuel further calls from the United States and the European Union for China to break the peg of its currency, the renminbi, to the dollar and allow the renminbi to appreciate.
 China's exports have recovered more rapidly than most countries' exports in recent months, partly because the low value of the renminbi has kept Chinese goods relatively inexpensive in foreign markets.
 The rebound in Chinese exports has been so rapid that some factory executives in the Pearl River delta region near Hong Kong have begun complaining of shortages of empty steel containers in which to ship their goods. China's trade surplus was $14.17 billion last month, compared with $18.43 billion in December and $39.1 billion in January 2009. 
 The statistics are the latest sign of China's robust economic health even as most of the rest of the world still struggles to recover from the financial crisis. 
 The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced on Tuesday that auto sales in China surged 143 percent from a year earlier and production leaped 124 percent. 
 Car ownership remains extremely popular in China, personal incomes are rising and consumer confidence is strong. Car dealerships in China have weeks-long waiting lists for many models, and months-long waiting lists for some of the most popular models.
 China's snapshot of its January trade data on Wednesday came the morning after Germany released official data confirming that it hads lost its status as the world's leading exporter. 
 Chinese exports amounted to $1.2 trillion in 2009, while German exports totaled $1.1 trillion, the German Federal Statistical Office said. Germany became the top world exporter in 2003, surpassing the United States. The value of goods exported from United States for the first 11 months of 2009 was $947.5 billion.
 Last year Germany also sustained the worst annual decline in its trade balance since figures were first gathered in the 1950s. Although German exports still outpaced imports by 136.1 billion euros, or $187.6 billion, in 2009, the surplus in 2008 was 178.3 billion euros.
 The decline in German exports was most acute inside the European Union, Germany's largest market. Exports to the bloc fell 19.1 percent in 2009, to 503.5 billion euros. Exports to countries not in the European Union fell 17.1 percent, to 299.7 billion euros. 
 German exports to the United States have been particularly hard hit by the global downturn, with sectors including engineering, forest products, furniture and automobiles reporting sharp declines in exports.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Unity? Not So Fast

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
To many Americans who watched the Democrats' family feud over the last few months, it might have seemed as if Republicans were more unified on health care. One luxury of being the minority party in Congress is the ability to avoid having internal disagreements in the spotlight. 
 In reality, Republicans generally do not speak with a single voice on health care policy, any more than Democrats do. Consider the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health benefits.
 Americans who buy health insurance on their own typically pay full price, while those who get coverage through an employer get a nice tax break. Many Republicans favor ending the ''exclusion'' of employer-provided health benefits from taxable income, which they say is unfair and creates a perverse incentive for overspending on health care. Many economists agree. 
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, top right, made ending the exclusion a pillar of his health care plan in the 2008 presidential campaign. He proposed replacing it with a uniform tax credit. Many Republicans in Congress have put forward similar plans, and in many instances those credits would be smaller than the value of benefits now shielded from income taxes, which is why such plans help lower the deficit. 
 But Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, above right, the senior Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, is opposed to ending the exclusion, saying it would be too disruptive.
 Mr. Camp ''believes we need to improve the current system, not upend the way 85 percent of the country receives their health care benefits, which is what taxing employer-provided plans would do,'' said a spokesman, Sage Eastman.
 Mr. Camp was a principal author of the alternate health care legislation that House Republican leaders put forward in November, which was easily defeated. 
 While the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that the Republican alternative would slightly reduce the cost of premiums, the budget office also says the proposal would do little to cover the uninsured.
 Republican leaders nonetheless believe that a scaled-back approach is needed, and they are expected to push for it at President Obama's bipartisan summit meeting on health care on Feb. 25. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

HEADLINE: Europe Watches as Portugal, Its Deficit Rising, Struggles to Restore the Economy

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

DATELINE: LISBON 

 BODY:
Along the hilly, cobbled streets of this moody Atlantic city, known for its melancholy even in good times, people seem to be holding their breath, unsure if Portugal's foundering economy will improve -- or worsen, and weaken Europe's overall financial health. 
 ''We're waiting for the government to do something, but they're totally disorganized,'' said Conceicao Bobiao, 63, a saleswoman in a shoe store off downtown Rossio Square, near monuments to the country's colonial past. 
 One of Western Europe's most introverted and unassuming countries, Portugal was unsuspectingly thrust into the international spotlight last week when markets plummeted on fears that it -- and Spain -- might be seen in the same category as Greece, whose soaring debt, deficit and credibility gap have been undermining confidence in the euro.
 This week, the Socialist government of Prime Minister Jose Socrates scrambled to reassure markets and its domestic constituency that it had what it took to bring its deficit -- which reached 9.3 percent of gross domestic product last year -- below the 3 percent ceiling set by the European monetary union by 2013.
 ''We will do the job in three years,'' Mr. Socrates said Tuesday in an interview in his official residence here. ''It is a difficult job, of course, but I am prepared to do it.''
 But markets and observers are not so sure. Beyond the economic crisis, the Socialist leader faces intense political pressure as he tries to reduce public sector spending. He lost his majority in September's elections and now struggles to keep order with an unruly if unfocused opposition.
 Last week, markets slumped after the commissioner for European economic and monetary affairs, Joaquin Almunia, listed Portugal, Greece and Spain as countries that had shown ''a permanent loss of competitiveness'' since they joined the European economic and monetary union.
 Mr. Socrates, a dapper dresser with an open, expressive face who underlines his points with theatrical hand gestures, seemed at turns deeply concerned with the gravity of his country's problems, and puzzlingly dismissive of data on the European Union.
 He rejected the notion that Portugal lagged behind European Union counterparts in productivity and skilled labor. ''That is a preconceived idea,'' he said. ''It has nothing to do with our economy.''
 Yet after decades of basing its economy on its low labor costs, Portugal was hit hard by the eastward expansion of the European Union and the loosening of trade barriers with Asia. Today, it struggles to compete with its richer European Union neighbors, having experienced flat growth in the past decade.
 ''Countries are like companies; you have to keep one step ahead,'' said Camilo Lourenco, an economic commentator in Lisbon.
 Portugal ''didn't recognize that it was becoming obsolete with E.U. expansion,'' he added. ''No one pays attention until there's a shock.''
 Mr. Lourenco said he did not think the government had the political skill or a coherent plan to bring the deficit in line. ''That's what worries me,'' he said.
 Mr. Socrates attributed the steep rise in Portugal's deficit to a sharp drop in tax revenue, and noted that it was not out of line with that of other European Union countries. France's budget deficit for 2010 is expected to be 8.2 percent of gross domestic product, down from its earlier estimate of 8.5 percent, while Germany's was 3.2 percent for 2009. Last month, Spain announced that its deficit had soared to 11.4 percent of G.D.P., well above its earlier estimates.
 Having a deficit now is ''very normal,'' he said. ''All the developed countries have problems now with their deficits.''
 Some business leaders in Portugal seemed genuinely taken aback by last week's market panic, especially since no new data had been published.
 ''Clearly the markets overreacted,'' said Paulo Moita Macedo, a vice chairman at Millennium bcp, a Portuguese bank, who as Portugal's top tax official from 2004 to 2007 earned plaudits for revamping the tax collecting system. ''But no one disagrees that we need to spend less.''
 Portugal's debt is expected to rise to 85 percent of gross domestic product this year, from 76.6 percent in 2009, because of rising unemployment and government spending on infrastructure projects like dams, hydroelectric power systems and a high-speed rail line to Madrid.
 Portugal's main opposition, the Social Democrats, has criticized the government for throwing borrowed money at problems. Mr. Socrates himself shunned the term ''stimulus spending,'' saying in the interview, ''Not spending, investment.'' 
 The government is hoping its track record will raise confidence. When Portugal's deficit rose above 6 percent in 2005, it brought it below 3 percent by 2007 by cutting public spending. 
 ''We did it in the past -- we will do it again,'' Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ''We are the same guys. We are committed to doing it.''
 But this time the same guys lack a solid majority.
 Last Friday, Parliament sent an anti-austerity message by passing a regional spending bill to nearly double funds to Madeira and the Azores.
 ''I told Parliament that that would be a wrong message to pass to the markets,'' Mr. Teixeira dos Santos said Tuesday. He said he would use all the laws in his power not to apply the increase.
 Mr. Socrates took pains to distinguish Portugal from Greece. He said the country had carried out ''very serious'' structural reforms in recent years, including reducing the public sector, raising the retirement age and changing the social security system. Unlike Greece or Italy, it has also instituted sophisticated e-banking systems in which citizens can file taxes at A.T.M.'s.
 As talk grows of a possible bailout for Greece, Mr. Socrates insisted that Portugal did not need help from the European Union. ''We don't need anything from Brussels,'' he said emphatically.

HEADLINE: Raising Rates and Eyebrows

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
An eye-popping increase in health insurance premiums in California has become a White House talking point.
 Anthem Blue Cross, which is California's largest for-profit health insurer, plans to raise its rates for customers who buy individual coverage by as much as 39 percent by March 1, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times. 
 President Obama spoke about the matter at a news conference Tuesday, citing Anthem's move as an urgent example of why Congress needs to change the health care system.
 ''If we don't act, this is just a preview of coming attractions,'' Mr. Obama said.
 ''Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance,'' he said. ''Millions more will lose their coverage altogether.'' 
 The company's increases also drew a sharp rebuke from Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, who demanded on Monday that Anthem publicly justify them.
 In a letter to the insurer, Ms. Sebelius noted that the company's parent, WellPoint, earned $2.7 billion in the last quarter of 2009, making the rate increases ''even more difficult to understand.''
 Ms. Sebelius said the rates were rising up to 15 times as fast as inflation.
 Steve Poizner, the insurance commissioner in California, has called for a review of Anthem's practices.
 In a statement, the company blamed the recession and rising health care costs for the increases. It said that in the weak economy, many people had dropped their insurance, leaving ''fewer people, often with significantly greater medical needs, in the insured pool.''
 Some industry analysts have suggested that several insurance companies are raising premiums pre-emptively in case Congress passes legislation reducing future profits. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

HEADLINE: Two Parties Join Together, Then Resume Divided Ways

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and CARL HULSE; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and Republican leaders, each eager to show they can put aside partisanship, agreed Wednesday that they had pinpointed a handful of areas -- most of them related to jobs creation -- where the two sides might be able to work together. 
 But as if to punctuate that the talk of bipartisanship goes only so far, Senate Republicans subsequently voted to block Mr. Obama's choice of Craig Becker, a labor lawyer, for the National Labor Relations Board. The move by Republicans served to increase the prospect that the White House would use a recess next week to place stalled nominees in executive branch jobs.
 After a meeting at the White House between the president and Congressional leaders from both parties, both sides made clear that neither end of Pennsylvania Avenue seemed ready to declare an end to political discord yet.
 Within minutes of leaving the White House session, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, complained to reporters stationed outside that ''the American people know that Washington has been on a spending binge for a year now.'' Mr. Boehner said he asked the president ''if you're serious about cutting spending, why don't we do it now?'' 
 Mr. Obama, for his part, demonstrated he could quickly squash the message from Republicans through his own bully pulpit. A mere 20 minutes after Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, recounted how Republicans had been forced to the sidelines while Democrats hashed out their sweeping health care bill, Mr. Obama trumped them with a surprise appearance before the reporters assembled in the White House briefing room.
 ''Being bipartisan cannot mean that Democrats give up everything they believe in, find the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for, and we do those things, and then we have bipartisanship,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's not how it works, you know, in any other realm of life. That's certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle.''
 He called on Republicans to stop blocking his nominees for executive branch jobs and said that if the Senate does not move forward on some by the end of the week, he might resort to using a constitutional provision allowing him to put nominees in their posts without a Senate confirmation vote during the Presidents' Day recess scheduled next week. Those who receive recess appointments now could serve through 2011.
 ''We can't afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well-functioning government,'' the president said.
 Despite the plea, Republicans, with some Democratic help, were able to block final consideration of Mr. Becker's appointment. The vote on an effort to cut off debate on the confirmation of Mr. Becker was 52-33, which is 8 votes short of the 60 needed to force an end to the debate.
 Two Democrats, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, voted with 31 Republicans to reject Mr. Becker, who had served as a top legal adviser to major labor unions. Fifteen senators were absent because of deteriorating weather conditions.
 Republicans said they feared that Mr. Becker would try to use his seat on the board to unilaterally ease union organizing in the workplace; Democrats said Republicans were abusing their power to block presidential appointees because of their deep anti-labor views.
 With the recess at hand, Republicans immediately urged the president not to make an end-run around the Senate in the case of Mr. Becker.
 ''I sincerely hope the White House does not circumvent the will of the Senate by appointing him when the Senate is out of session,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said.
 At the White House, the two sides did muster up some areas that they said they could work together -- on trade policy, environmentally conscious jobs, nuclear power and offshore drilling. Mr. Obama praised Republican leaders for showing up, even quipping that things went so well that Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Mr. McConnell were ''out doing snow angels together on the South Lawn.''
 Mr. Reid said he still hoped the Senate would approve a job-creating measure by the end of the week but with Washington reeling from back-to-back snowstorms that schedule could slip. Mr. McConnell did not explicitly rule out Republican cooperation in passing a bill. But he said Republicans would need an opportunity to examine the still undisclosed details of the measure while other Republicans said they doubted any vote could occur so soon.
 ''My members need to be able to feel like they understand what they are being called upon to support, so the sooner we could get the parameters of the final package, I think the better,'' Mr. McConnell said.
 Aides said that it was shaping up to be a roughly $85 billion package, including a payroll-tax holiday for employers that hire workers who were unemployed for at least 60 days. The measure would also include some infrastructure spending, including a one-year extension of the highway trust fund, and new Build America bonds, to encourage infrastructure spending by local governments. Together those proposals would total about $15 billion.
 The bill would also extend a potpourri of tax breaks, at a cost of $35 billion, as well as provide a three-month extension of unemployment insurance benefits and discounted Cobra insurance coverage for the unemployed. In addition, the package would seek to wrap up some other Congressional business, including a one-year extension of the anti-terror Patriot Act, and provisions related to flood insurance, small business loans and disaster financing for Arkansas and Mississippi.
 The bill would be paid for in part with $50 billion in revenue generated by closing various tax loopholes, Congressional aides said.
 The jockeying between the White House and Congressional Republicans is the latest performance of political theater that, in recent weeks, has been playing out in the public arena and before television cameras. On Sunday, Mr. Obama announced he would convene a half-day bipartisan health care session at the White House to be televised live on Feb. 25, as part of a gambit to allow Americans to watch as Democrats and Republicans try to resolve their political impasse. 
 That announcement came after Mr. Obama surprised his rivals in late January by requesting that a session with House Republicans be open to cameras. That meeting produced a spirited 90-minute question-and-answer session with the president that many in the White House viewed as a success for Mr. Obama.
 Tuesday's meeting was the first in what administration officials say will be monthly bipartisan sessions, which Mr. Obama called for in the State of the Union address. Mr. Obama declared that ''a sense of purpose that transcends petty politics'' must be forged by Democrats and Republicans to address national problems.

HEADLINE: Childhood Obesity Battle Is Taken Up by First Lady

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House, led by Michelle Obama, announced a sweeping initiative on Tuesday aimed at revamping the way American children eat and play -- reshaping school lunches, playgrounds and even medical checkups -- with the goal of eliminating childhood obesity within a generation.
 The ''Let's Move'' campaign, nearly a year in the making, is Mrs. Obama's official debut in a high-profile policy role, and she has already lined up an array of partners in government, medicine, science, business, education and athletics who are pledging to work together to get children off their couches and consuming fresher, healthier food. 
 The three major suppliers of school lunches -- Sodexo, Chartwells Schools Dining Services and Aramark -- pledged Tuesday to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years. Beverage makers promised more consumer-friendly labeling on all cans, bottles, and vending and fountain machines within two years. 
 The American Academy of Pediatrics called on doctors to measure body mass index, an indicator of obesity, in children. Professional athletes from 12 leagues, including football and baseball, have volunteered to promote the message of ''60 Minutes of Play a Day'' through public service announcements; media companies including the Walt Disney Company and NBC have pledged to broadcast them.
 ''We know that solving our obesity challenge won't be easy and it won't be quick, but make no mistake about it -- this problem can be solved,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''This isn't like putting a man on the moon or inventing the Internet. It doesn't take a stroke of genius or a feat of technology. We have everything we need right now to help our kids lead healthy lives.''
 For Mrs. Obama, the campaign is a chance to complete her transition away from being the mom in chief to taking a more active policy role within her husband's administration. But her vision also carries risks. 
 With Republicans casting her husband's White House as an agent of big government, Mrs. Obama must be careful not to cast herself in the role of the food police, chiding parents about how they feed their children. And her campaign could prove contentious if the first lady ruffles feathers within the food industry by complaining about the marketing of junk food, as she did on Tuesday.
 ''The truth is, our kids didn't do this to themselves,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''Our kids didn't choose to make food products with tons of fat and sugar and supersize portions, and then to have those foods marketed to them wherever they turn.''
 The White House rolled out the initiative after months of consultation with a long procession of public health experts, during which Mrs. Obama and her aides concluded that they should steer clear of focusing on the individual behavior of parents and children. 
 Rather, Mrs. Obama is talking about reshaping the nutritional environment in which children grow up -- from installing sidewalks in neighborhoods to encourage students to walk to school, to putting greengrocers in inner cities where fresh fruits and vegetables can be hard to get. Her message Tuesday was one of moderation.
 ''I haven't spoken to one expert about this issue who has said the solution is having government tell us what we can do,'' she said, adding, ''There is a place in this life for cookies and ice cream and burgers and fries, that is a part of childhood. This is just about balance, about really small changes that can add up, like walking to school when you can, replacing soda with water or skim milk, trimming portions just a little.''
 Childhood obesity rates in the United States have tripled over the past three decades, and today nearly one in three children in America are overweight or obese. Health experts blame obesity for a variety of medical conditions, among them heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer and asthma.
 The White House and its allies are also making the case that the obesity epidemic affects national security; obesity is now one of the most common disqualifiers for military service. 
 Though various government agencies have tackled childhood obesity in the past, experts say that they have not worked in coordination and that some policies -- Agriculture Department subsidies for high fructose corn syrup, for instance -- contradicted others.
 Health experts hailed Tuesday's announcement as a welcome shift.
 ''For the first time there is the appearance of a strong and consistent message coming from the very highest levels of government,'' said Dr. David Ludwig, director of the Optimal Weight for Life program at Children's Hospital in Boston. ''Never before has the childhood obesity epidemic become a high priority of both the president and first lady.'' 
 Dr. Ludwig makes the case that childhood obesity is caused by ''a toxic environment'' that promotes overeating of low-quality foods, while inhibiting children from leading active lives -- an argument that seems to have resonated forcefully with Mrs. Obama. 
 Among other research, Mrs. Obama was heavily influenced by a study carried out several years ago in Somerville, Mass., in which a series of numerous but small changes -- for instance, repainting crosswalks with reflective paint so more children could safely walk to school -- resulted in slowing the rate of childhood obesity. The city's mayor, Joseph A. Curtatone, who has promoted a local program called Shape Up Somerville, spoke at Tuesday's event.
 But the kinds of changes Mrs. Obama envisions will be easier said than done, especially in an economy where every penny counts. Lorna Donatone, the Sodexo official who worked with the White House on the obesity initiative, said her company was already trying to substitute healthier school lunch choices -- low-fat cheese on pizza, baked chicken tenders instead of fried -- but faces resistance from school districts who view such moves as too costly.
 ''There's certainly the belief out there that healthy is more expensive,'' she said. ''That's one of the hurdles we've got to get over.''
 Before Mrs. Obama spoke on Tuesday, President Obama began his day by signing an executive order to mandate what he called ''optimal coordination'' between federal agencies and departments, among them the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Labor and Health and Human Services, in support of the initiative.
 ''We think that this has enormous promise,'' the president said. Turning to his wife, he added, ''It's done, honey.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 22, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 10 about a White House campaign against childhood obesity described incorrectly programs that affect producers of high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener. Farm programs subsidize the production of corn, and other programs also affect the supply and the cost of corn, sugar and related commodities. But the Agriculture Department itself does not directly subsidize high fructose corn syrup.

HEADLINE: Hungry in America

 BODY:
More Americans are going hungry in hard times and are increasingly dependent on private charity, according to a new study by Feeding America, a national network of food banks. The study found that 37 million people -- roughly one in eight Americans -- had sought emergency food assistance from the network last year, a 46 percent increase from 2006. 
 As the recession and high unemployment take their toll, there are hungry families all across the country: in cities and suburbs, poor, middle class and even supposedly wealthy communities. 
 At a recent news conference on Long Island -- seen as a place of suburban affluence -- local charities shared stories of families struggling to stay afloat and being forced to choose among food, housing payments and utility bills. In many cases, it seems food was skimped on because hunger was easier to ignore than threatening letters from unpaid landlords or the gas company.
 In the Long Island portion of the Feeding America study, researchers surveyed more than 600 food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters and interviewed people who had sought food at those places. The study concluded that about 280,000 Long Islanders needed help last year, a 21 percent increase from 2006. Only a small percentage of these clients were homeless or elderly. Thirty-nine percent were children under 18. 
 The study found that volunteers are central to the success of emergency feeding programs. On Long Island, 88 percent of food pantries and 92 percent of soup kitchens rely on volunteers. But the news conference revealed that many of the volunteers who collected and served food have become newly hungry and jobless.
 It is reassuring that so many Americans are eager to help their neighbors. But it is also clear that the government safety net is failing. The Feeding America study found that about 30 percent of those seeking help from their facilities also received food stamps. This bolsters what advocates for the poor have said for years, that the food stamp program isn't reaching everyone who is eligible. That must be fixed.

HEADLINE: Overseas Sales Gave McDonald's a Lift in January

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill. 

 BODY:
McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, said Tuesday that a crucial measure of sales rose 2.6 percent in January as strong overseas sales more than offset a decline in the United States. 
 Sales in stores open at least 13 months fell 0.7 percent in the United States and rose 4.3 percent in Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.
 The figure is considered a critical indicator of a restaurant chain's health because it excludes the effects of new restaurants and restaurant closings.
 Total sales rose 9.1 percent, including an 0.1 percent decline in the United States, a 6.7 percent rise in Europe and a 7.2 percent increase in the rest of the world.
 McDonald's has generally fared well in the recession as customers turned to it for cheap meals, but it has started to feel the pinch more acutely in recent months. Still, it has outperformed most of its rivals, who have increasingly been pushing value menus and discounts of their own.
 McDonald's said in the United States its breakfast Dollar Menu and portable Mac Snack Wrap were popular offerings and its free Wi-Fi was also a draw.
 In Europe, sales were stronger in France and Britain and weaker in Germany. Elsewhere, Japan and Australia sales were strong but China was weaker because of the timing of the Chinese New Year.
 McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it would take a $40 million to $50 million tax charge in the first half related to closing 430 restaurants in Japan.

HEADLINE: UBS Reports a Profit, but Clients Are Still Taking Out Cash

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
UBS, the Swiss bank that became a symbol of ravages of the subprime crisis in Europe, failed to stem an outflow of client money even as it posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year on Tuesday.
 UBS shares dropped 5 percent in Zurich after the bank said customers withdrew 45.2 billion Swiss francs ($42 billion), from its wealth management units in the fourth quarter, almost double the 26.6 billion francs of redemptions in the previous three months. The bank said the asset outflows were mainly the result of client advisers leaving UBS and taking their customers with them.
 ''We need to see some stabilization on the outflows and these numbers just don't bode very well,'' said Florian Esterer, a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich. 
 UBS had a net profit of 1.21 billion francs ($1.13 billion) in the fourth quarter, helped by lower costs and a tax credit. The bank had lost 9.56 billion francs in the period a year earlier and 564 million francs in the third quarter. Analysts had expected UBS, the largest wealth manager in Switzerland, to report a profit of 326 million francs.
 UBS benefited from a tax credit of 480 million francs mainly attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets, principally in the United States.
 The profit followed wide-ranging restructuring under the chief executive, Oswald J. Grubel, who came out of retirement a year ago to help UBS after successfully reviving an unprofitable Credit Suisse seven years earlier.
 UBS has reported losses of $57.3 billion during the credit crisis, the most of any European bank. As a result, it has cut about 16 percent of its work force, reduced costs, shrunk its balance sheet and appointed a handful of new directors.
 But the outlook remains cloudy. Aside from volatile markets, UBS, like other global banks, faces regulatory uncertainties as governments debate measures to prevent another financial crisis. UBS is also embroiled in a tax fight with the United States.
 An agreement with the Justice Department, under which UBS would disclose names and account details for at least 4,450 wealthy Americans suspected of tax evasion, was recently thrown into doubt after a Swiss court declared large parts of it illegal. The Swiss intend to resume negotiations with Washington.
 A swift solution to the American tax case would, along with the return to profit, help restore the bank's credibility with clients, especially in its private banking division.
 ''We have taken decisive action to transform UBS, and it is now a focused, efficient and resilient firm,'' Mr. Grubel said in a statement Tuesday.
 UBS said, however, that its private banking operations in the ''immediate future still expects to report outflows, with some pressure on margins.''
 ''One of the sore points is clearly that we still are losing assets, '' Mr. Grubel said, partly because of competition, and partly because of market changes. 
 Some analysts had pointed to a tax amnesty in Italy as contributing to money outflows at the end of 2009 from Swiss banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer.
 The investment banking division, which is at the heart of the reorganization program, had a pretax profit of 297 million francs in the quarter in contrast to a loss of 1.37 billion francs in the third quarter.
 Some analysts see the possibility for a lasting return to profit at UBS. Analysts at JPMorgan, led by Kian Abouhossein, recently upgraded UBS to overweight from neutral in a research note.
 While the Swiss bank is still suffering from tightening credit spreads and customer outflows, JPMorgan said steady improvements are expected from its fixed-income, currency and commodity units over the first half of this year, and at its equity trading unit later in 2010.

HEADLINE: It's All About Schools

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Sana, Yemen 

 BODY:
 I took part in a ''qat chew'' the other day at the home of a Yemeni official. Never done that before. Qat is the mildly hallucinogenic leaf drug that Yemeni men stuff in their cheek after work -- and sometimes during. My hosts insisted that qat actually makes your senses sharper and that you could chew and chisel the top of a mosque minaret at the same time. I quit after 15 minutes, but the Yemeni officials, lawmakers and businessmen I was with chewed on for three hours -- and they made a lot of sense along the way. 
 Most had been educated in America or had kids studying there, and they were all bemoaning how the decline of the Yemeni education system, the proliferation of exclusively religious schools here and the falloff in scholarships for Yemeni kids to study in America were producing a very different Yemeni generation than their own. They spoke fondly of U.S. schools that were based on merit, taught them to think freely and prepared them with the skills to thrive. 
 So here is my new rule of thumb: For every Predator missile we fire at an Al Qaeda target here, we should help Yemen build 50 new modern schools that teach science and math and critical thinking -- to boys and girls.
 If we stick to something close to that ratio of targeted killings to targeted kindergartens, we have a chance to prevent Yemen from becoming an Al Qaeda breeding ground. Because right now there are some 300,000 college-educated Yemenis out of work -- partly because of poor training and partly because there are no jobs -- 15,000 schoolchildren not attending any classes, 65 percent of teachers with only high school degrees and thousands of kids learning little more than religious doctrines. 
 And no wonder. Beginning in the 1970s, the trend in Yemen, Morocco, Egypt and the Persian Gulf ''was to Islamicize education as a way to fight the left and pro-communists -- with the blessing of the U.S.,'' explained Lahcen Haddad, a professor at the University of Rabat in Morocco and an expert on governance with Management Systems International, a U.S. development contractor. Then, in 1979, after the Saudi ruling family was shaken by an attack in Mecca from its own Wahabi fundamentalists, the Saudi regime, to fend off the anger of its Wahabis, ''gave them free rein to Islamicize education and social life in Saudi Arabia and neighboring states.'' 
 ''Missions -- cultural and religious, semi-official and private -- roamed Islamic countries to spread the word,'' said Haddad. ''Cheap books followed, and students were brought to Saudi to learn from Wahabi preachers and teachers in the different religious universities that mushroomed in the '80s.'' 
 Small, economically deprived Yemen was an easy target. Uncritically accepting of the ''truths'' of Wahabism became the core curriculum in many Yemeni schools, Haddad added, and ''it destroyed the opportunity to build the basic skills necessary to train the right labor force -- skills like problem-solving, communication, critical thinking, debate, organization and teamwork.'' 
 America's last great ideological foe, Soviet Marxism, produced its share of violent radicals, but it also produced Andrei Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn -- because it believed in science, physics, math and the classics of literature. Islamism is not producing any Sakharovs. 
 May Yamani, the author and daughter of the former Saudi oil minister Ahmad Zaki Yamani, minced no words, writing in The Beirut Daily Star: ''Saudi Arabia exported both its Wahabism and Al Qaeda to Yemen by funding thousands of madrassas, where fanaticism is taught.'' 
 Ahmed Sofan, a Yemeni parliamentarian, told me that back in the 1970s if you visited a village in his rural constituency, most of the women would be unveiled and working alongside the men. No more, he said, ''because we now have this Wahabi sense of religious conservatism where women are supposed to be inside and be veiled.''
 Added Abdul Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister: Growing up, ''we studied Darwinism in my high school without challenge.'' Not anymore. ''The East Asian miracle,'' he added, ''wasn't possible without women. In the Arab world, if half our society is excluded, how will we ever catch up with those new tigers?''
 The Yemeni journalist Mohammed al-Qadhi reported in The National newspaper that there may be 10,000 religious-based schools educating Yemeni youth today. He quoted a top Yemeni education official as saying, ''We are now obliging these schools to teach moderation to protect our students against extremism.''
 In other words, we are now fighting for the Middle East of the 2020s and 2030s. Huge chunks of this generation are lost. When I went to see Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, at his Sana palace, he was in a reflective mood: ''I would wish that this arms race could end and instead we could have a race for development.''
 It is the only way Yemen will have a future. So, yes, fire those Predators where we must, but help build schools and fund scholarships to America wherever we can. And please, please, let's end our addiction to oil, which is what gives the Saudi religious ministry and charities the money to spread anti-modernist thinking across this region.

HEADLINE: Daring to Change the 'Warner Way'

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Jeff Robinov, president of the Warner Brothers Pictures Group, arrived at the fashionable Tower Bar here on a recent weekend. Other members of Hollywood's A-list were quickly ushered to tables in the dining room, but Mr. Robinov had to wait -- and wait. He finally ordered off the bar menu.
 The Tower Bar may want to have a talk with its headwaiter. While little known outside of the clubby film industry, Mr. Robinov, 51, has become one of the most powerful people in moviedom over the last two years and is becoming even more so. He is the heir apparent for the company's top movie job when Alan F. Horn, chief operating officer of Warner Brothers Entertainment and overlord of film production, retires next year.
 With its corporate gentility and stability in a highly unstable business, Warner has long been Hollywood's gold standard. By sticking to ''the Warner way'' -- star-driven pictures, effective marketing -- and keeping executive churn to a minimum, the studio of Batman and Harry Potter has sold more than $1 billion in tickets at the domestic box office for an unparalleled nine years running. 
 But Mr. Robinov, taking notice of changing industry economics and shifting consumer tastes, has been modifying that blueprint. His strategy involves making fewer but more ambitious movies, cutting back on sweetheart producer deals and at long last integrating its corporate sibling DC Comics more tightly into the movie division.
 Mr. Robinov, in close alliance with his president of worldwide marketing, Sue Kroll, is also moving Warner out of its stately comfort zone by pursuing more provocative advertising campaigns (''Rock Out With Your Glock Out'' is the slogan for a forthcoming title) and raunchy comedies like ''The Hangover.'' Mr. Robinov pressed to make ''The Hangover'' over Mr. Horn's objections. The $35 million movie, co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has sold about $467 million in tickets.
 ''There are movies that don't necessarily speak to my generation,'' Mr. Horn, 66, said, ''but Warner needs to speak to all audiences.''
 Mr. Robinov has more on his hands than just continuing to show Hollywood who's boss. The studio's slimmed-down corporate parent, Time Warner, is relying more than ever on its motion picture arm to mint profits that will impress investors. And he must accomplish that without the Harry Potter franchise, which ends next year.
 Operating income for the studio rose 61 percent to $436 million in the fourth quarter. Even so, Wall Street's attention is currently focused elsewhere, namely on 20th Century Fox's ''Avatar,'' which has become the top-grossing movie of all time (in dollars not adjusted for inflation).
 Premium-price 3-D tickets are one reason ''Avatar'' has attracted over $2 billion at the global box office, and Warner is hopping on the 3-D bandwagon in a big way. Last week it announced plans to release ''Clash of the Titans'' and the final two ''Harry Potter'' films in 3-D. Warner will have as many as nine 3-D releases next year, according to Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution.
 Driven by its need to replace Harry Potter, not to mention the continued appeal of superheroes, Warner recently announced a major reorganization of DC Comics. The goal is to quickly and more fully exploit its characters, something Time Warner's corporate bureaucracy has hampered in the past.
 The Walt Disney Company's $4 billion purchase of Marvel Entertainment just over a month ago has increased the pressure on Warner to succeed this time. Warner is expected to announce a DC slate in the coming months populated by characters like the Flash and Wonder Woman.
 Central to Mr. Robinov's approach to DC is to avoid cookie-cutter representations and take risks when it comes to hiring directors and choosing a cast. Fully backing a filmmaker's vision has become a hallmark of his style, ranging from the odd ''Watchmen,'' which was a modest success, to the candy-colored ''Speed Racer,'' which was a flaming disaster, to ''The Dark Knight,'' a home run. 
 ''He is trying not to cling to the things that have worked in the past,'' said Christopher Nolan, who directed ''The Dark Knight'' and is working on another Batman sequel. 
 Another part of Mr. Robinov's vision for the studio involves Ms. Kroll, his hard-driving marketing chief, who has been charged with instilling electricity and nimbleness in campaigns.
 She was behind the arresting visuals for ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' which opened at No. 1 at the box office despite its art house aura. For the forthcoming comedy ''Valentine's Day,'' which is showing such strong advance interest that producers are already racing to put together a similar movie built around New Year's Eve, Ms. Kroll found an elegant way to showcase 18 stars on one billboard. 
 ''She's a monster: creative, brilliant, tireless,'' Mr. Robinov said.
 Ms. Kroll has definitely shaken up Warner's sleepy marketing division. Soon after her promotion in 2008, she decided late on a Friday that the trailer for ''10,000 B.C.'' needed to be more visceral. She tracked staff members down at home, had an editing company stay open for the weekend and hired midnight couriers. Mr. Fellman mobilized the distribution team to push exhibitors to immediately accept a new trailer. Within two days, the two executives had accomplished what usually takes weeks.
 ''I have a very cavalier attitude that anything is possible,'' she said. ''You've got to be relentless and you've got to be fearless.''
 While it tinkers with its formula, Warner Brothers Entertainment, the studio's umbrella company, is also confronting the distracting issue of corporate succession for only the fifth time since 1967, when the Warner family ceded control. Speculating about who will replace Mr. Horn and Barry M. Meyer, the company's departing chairman, has become one of Hollywood's favorite parlor games.
 While Mr. Robinov is widely seen as Mr. Horn's heir, it is less clear what the corporation might do with Mr. Meyer's post -- with speculation running the gamut from simply replacing him to splitting his job among a handful of executives.
 There are three princes vying for the roles: Mr. Robinov; Bruce Rosenblum, president of the television group; and Kevin Tsujihara, president of home entertainment. The uncertainty has set off political maneuvering inside the studio.
 Time Warner's chairman, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, declined to comment about succession except to say, ''We have a real preference for our own people.''
 He added: ''We've shown that it is possible to be consistently successful in a business that is supposed to be enormously volatile.''
 Mr. Meyer, 66, said slow succession -- the opposite of what Walt Disney Studios has recently set in motion -- was the proper course for a business that has long lead times for its products and turns on subjective decisions. ''If you inject jolting management changes into that process, it's a recipe for destruction,'' he said. ''We are trying to evolve the system.'' 
 Getting to know Mr. Robinov has been difficult for people inside Warner and out. A former agent at International Creative Management, the buttoned-down but brooding executive rarely grants interviews and dislikes the type of personal showboating often associated with Hollywood moguls. 
 In a knife-in-the-back industry, Mr. Robinov is known for wielding a blade in the front, something that has resulted in more than a few wounded egos. ''As an agent, all I wanted was an answer,'' Mr. Robinov said of his blunt style. ''Sometimes it's a hard message to hear and sometimes it's a hard one to give.''
 Mr. Robinov's superiors say he is learning how to maneuver more delicately. ''He has become less of an acquired taste,'' Mr. Meyer said.
 Told of that comment, an unsmiling Mr. Robinov said, ''Haters, they're all haters.'' Was he joking? He was. ''I'm a complicated cat,'' he said with a shrug.
 His office is largely barren except for a plastic Bob's Big Boy doll, which he declined to explain to a visitor. A colleague later said that Mr. Robinov likes to take people to lunch at a Big Boy diner in Burbank when he is either promoting or firing them.
 There have been quite a few personnel changes -- the president of motion picture music was jettisoned in December -- as Mr. Robinov has shaped his team. Another recent change involved the president of production, Kevin McCormick, who stepped down to become a producer. 
 The restructuring will most likely continue, particularly with producer deals. Up until recently, producers who delivered big hits in years past were kept on the payroll regardless of their recent track record. But Mr. Robinov says that era is over, pointing to a 20 percent reduction in producer deals since 2008. He declined to say which producers might be facing less bountiful deals going forward.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Horn are starting a victory lap. Mr. Horn is particularly proud of accomplishments that include better coordinating the production, distribution and marketing divisions and lining up outside partners like Legendary Pictures to reduce risk.
 ''Every ship picks up barnacles over time, but as Barry and I ride into the sunset, I firmly believe we're leaving it better than we found it, and we found it in pretty great shape,'' Mr. Horn said.

HEADLINE: Fed to Reveal Its Strategy For Raising Interest Rates

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, having survived a surprising challenge to his second term as Federal Reserve chairman, now faces the delicate task of beginning to pull the central bank out of its extraordinary effort to prop up the economy.
 The main question is when and how the Fed should start raising short-term interest rates, which have been at a record low for more than a year. Related is the issue of how to manage, and eventually shrink, the record $2.2 trillion balance sheet that the Fed amassed as it pumped vast sums of money into the economy, starting in 2008. On Wednesday morning, the Fed will release a statement outlining Mr. Bernanke's views on moving away from its exceptionally easy monetary policy. 
 As a policy tool, Mr. Bernanke is expected to consider a little-known mechanism -- referred to as the interest rate on excess reserves -- that gives the Fed leverage over $1.1 trillion in bank deposits. 
 Most of those deposits were created as the Fed gobbled up mortgage-backed securities and Treasury notes and bonds during the financial crisis. The banks in turn parked the funds at the Fed as reserves. In the months and years ahead, the Fed wants to make sure that banks do not reduce their reserves too quickly, because it could create inflationary pressures as banks step up their lending. 
 To achieve its goal, according to Fed officials and speeches, the central bank will raise the interest rate on excess reserves, now 0.25 percent. It also plans to lift its target for the fed funds rate -- what banks charge one another for overnight loans and the centerpiece of its policy statements since 1994. But officials stress that rates will remain quite low for months to come. 
 ''We're in a different situation than ever before, and the tools we are using are entirely new,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who now works at the Potomac Research Group, an investment advisory firm. 
 Mr. Gramley predicted that Mr. Bernanke would try to reassure the markets that the new tools would work. ''There's an awful lot of talk that we're going to have inflation down the road,'' he said. ''But this Fed is determined to maintain price stability. They've said that over and over again, and they want to communicate that to the markets.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke has used the term ''exit strategy'' to describe his task. Much like the American military's withdrawal from Iraq, the Fed's plan has few precedents and carries much uncertainty. At a minimum, officials have signaled, it will have to be carried out delicately, be flexible when circumstances change, and, most likely, be gradual.
 With unemployment at 9.7 percent, the Fed may be months away from raising rates, but it is discussing the plan now to prepare the markets and tamp down inflation fears, said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former director of monetary affairs for the Fed.
 ''The reason they're starting to talk about the exit now is to reassure investors, so that they aren't pressed to head for the exit prematurely,'' said Mr. Reinhart, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''Chairman Bernanke has to walk a very, very fine line.'' 
 If the Fed raises interest rates too hastily, it could choke off the fragile recovery. If it dallies, it might set off market jitters about rising prices. 
 But that decision occurs in the context of an economy whose normal rules have been reshaped. As Mr. Bernanke put it in a speech last April, ''we no longer live in a world in which central bank policies are confined to adjusting the short-term interest rate.'' 
 The Fed's balance sheet has nearly tripled since the summer of 2007. At the end of that year, the Fed found new ways to lend to banks, and in early 2008, it began to cut interest rates aggressively, pushing the target rate for fed funds to nearly zero in December 2008. 
 By that month, the Fed's balance sheet had ballooned to $2.2 trillion as the central bank doled out loans to commercial banks, issuers of commercial paper and foreign central banks. The American International Group, the bailed-out insurance giant, and JPMorgan Chase, which bought Bear Stearns, also received aid.
 Many of those programs are winding down. Two of the biggest -- the Fed's purchase of $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and of about $175 billion in debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae -- are to be completed by March 31.
 The Fed in essence created new money to buy those securities, and now holds $1.1 trillion in reserves that the banks can demand when they wish. ''The Fed's great worry is that instead of holding onto these reserves, the banks would decide they'd rather take the money they're tying up and lend it out,'' said Anil K. Kashyap, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's business school. If they did that, ''you'd see broad measures of money growing quickly, and presumably that would be the start to having some inflation.''
 In the short term, that prospect seems remote, as banks have been wary and tightfisted in lending since the financial crisis erupted. But in the long run, a huge balance sheet carries risks.
 The ability to charge an interest rate on excess reserves was created in 2006, after decades of discussion, when Congress granted the Fed such authority. (One reason it took so long is that the interest payments will reduce the amount the Fed turns over to the Treasury each year.) The tool -- which is used by other central banks, like those in England and Canada -- was to become available in 2011, but Congress moved up the date during the crisis. The Fed started paying the interest in October 2008. 
 Mr. Bernanke has argued that the new rate will eventually serve as an interest-rate floor, with the discount rate -- the rate at which the Fed lends directly to banks -- functioning as the ceiling, and the fed funds rate fluctuating in between them. 
 Looking longer term, Mr. Bernanke has four other tools that could be used gingerly to tighten monetary policy. The first is reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, in which the Fed would sell securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a slightly higher price at a later date. The second is term deposits, analogous to the certificates of deposit banks offer to customers. Third, the Treasury could sell bills and deposit the proceeds at the Fed.
 Finally, the Fed could sell some of its long-term securities, including those backed by mortgages, taking more money out of the system. That strategy would carry risk given that the Fed's ownership of such securities is helping keep mortgage rates low and support the housing market.
 Mr. Bernanke's statement was initially to be presented at a House hearing scheduled for Wednesday. After the hearing was postponed because of snow, he decided to release it anyway.

HEADLINE: Time's Up

 BODY:
Over the last four years, the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran stop producing nuclear fuel. Iran is still churning out enriched uranium and has now told United Nations inspectors that it is raising the level of enrichment -- moving slightly closer to bomb-grade quality. 
 President Obama was right to offer to negotiate with Tehran. Washington and its allies were right to look for possible compromises even after Tehran was caught -- again -- hiding an enrichment plant. 
 Enough is enough. Iran needs to understand that its nuclear ambition comes with a very high cost. 
 President Obama said on Tuesday that the United States and its allies are ''moving along fairly quickly'' on a new sanctions resolution. He also said it would take several weeks to draft a proposal. That is not reassuring. Once a resolution is written, the negotiating process typically drags on for weeks, if not months.
 Iran is in such economic and political turmoil that its government may be more vulnerable to outside pressure. Security forces have expanded a crackdown on the political opposition, arresting hundreds of people ahead of Thursday's anniversary of the Iranian revolution. 
 American officials say they are eager to impose sanctions that would inflict maximum damage on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which runs the nuclear program and a large chunk of the Iranian economy. The plan, as we understand it, is to block their banking, their shipping, their insurance. American officials also say they want to minimize the additional suffering of the Iranian people. That makes sense to us, although squaring the circle won't be easy.
 If the Security Council is to move ahead with sanctions that bite, Washington and its allies are going to have to step up the pressure on Russia and China -- Iran's two enablers, both with a veto -- to go along. 
 Russia has signaled support for another resolution. If history is any guide, we fear Russia will sharply whittle down the impact. China, eager to buy ever more oil from Iran, is an even bigger obstacle. China needs to understand that ensuring reliable oil supplies would become a lot harder if the Middle East is roiled by a nuclear-armed Iran.
 The more the Security Council temporizes, compromises and weakens these resolutions, the more defiant and ambitious Iran becomes. If the Security Council can't act swiftly, or decisively, the United States and its allies will have to come up with their own tough sanctions. They should be making a backup plan right now.

How much does Phil McNally love 3-D?
 So much that he legally listed his name on his British driver's license, and later on his Social Security card and American license, as ''Phil Captain III D McNally.''
 ''Apparently you can't have numbers in your name in the U.K., so I had to do Roman numerals,'' the DreamWorks global stereoscopic supervisor told me. ''My dad wasn't impressed. Parents are very possessive of the names they give you.'' 
 Captain 3-D, a 42-year-old Northern Ireland native, is also known as the resident ''hurl-o-meter'' at DreamWorks, the guy who goes through every frame to adjust the amount of depth, dial the intensity up or down, and fix the right-eye/left-eye camera settings so that moviegoers can enjoy dragons skydiving past them without having to turn their popcorn bags into motion-sickness bags.
 ''I am certain that it is not good to be in a business in which the result of what you do is to make people hurl,'' says Jeffrey Katzenberg, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation. 
 Because 3-D gels in the brain, the Captain spends his time seeking an equipoise where objects can fly around without making you dizzy -- a synchronicity that has a technical name that sounds like a spy thriller: ''the zero parallax setting.''
 As we realized watching James Cameron's ''Avatar'' explode into the highest-grossing film of all time, 3-D technology has come a long way since it was the butt of jokes on ''I Love Lucy'' and a gimmick with polarized glasses in the '50s horror classics ''House of Wax'' and ''Creature From the Black Lagoon.''
 ''I've always referred to it as my father's 3-D,'' Katzenberg says with a grin, ''where we used to wear those goofy red-and-blue glasses that you didn't want to actually turn and have somebody that you know, care about, or lust after look at you because you would be deeply humiliated, right?''
 I had coffee with Katzenberg in Los Angeles recently because ever since he was ''blown away'' by seeing ''The Polar Express'' in an Imax theater, he has emerged as one of his industry's biggest 3-D boosters, even when it meant rooting for Cameron's blockbuster for another studio.
 He knows that a 3-D revolution would be great for his business by spurring people to desert their home entertainment centers and actually go into theaters. It's rare in this economy, he notes, for people to opt for ''the more expensive, higher-end experience first.''
 Echoing the King of the World, Captain 3-D observes that ''the struggle of movies has always been to transport viewers to a virtual world.'' Directors simply have to get past their denial. ''They've spent their whole lives eliminating 3-D to make theatrical 2-D,'' he said, ''and now they've got to go from real-life 3-D into theatrical 3-D.''
 Katzenberg says that ''if you look at the history of film, there have now been three great revolutions. The first was silent to talkies. The second was black-and-white to color, 70 years ago. And this is the third great revolution, a quantum leap. We're at the top of the waterfall with 3-D. And this is going to cascade down into virtually every facet of our lives where we are encountering video imagery or even photography.''
 The 3-D market is popping. Studios are fighting over 3-D theater space and are well aware that the handful of new 3-D movies made in the last year represented a disproportionate chunk of the box office. Burberry is planning to live-stream a catwalk from London in 3-D. ESPN and Discovery Channel both plan on beaming 3-D into homes, and the porn industry is nuzzling the new technology. Tinto Brass, the 76-year-old Italian director of ''Caligula,'' said he wants to overhaul his original and make the first 3-D porn feature. (What's next? A chain of adult movie theatres called Cl-Imax?) 
 Katzenberg envisions a world where you can process so many pixels into space that we'll all be watching 3-D TVs (without glasses in 10 to 20 years) and seeing every big-scale movie -- not to mention every poster or painting you walk by on a wall -- in 3-D.
 Even Sandra Bullock comedies or dramas like ''The Godfather''?
 ''Absolutely,'' he replied.
 But both Katzenberg and the Captain concede that some movies may be too action-packed or intense -- yes, they're talking about you, Michael Bay and Martin Scorsese -- to be experienced in 3-D because, as McNally says, ''carrying that much data into the brain is not an enjoyable situation.''
 Like his boss, the Captain thinks we are on the cusp of being immersed in a virtual world akin to lucid dreaming or the Star Trek holodeck, ''where you start with a blank room and you are transported to a whole world of all the senses.''
 Just as we had to be dragged into acknowledging that sound and color made movies more realistic, now we must get accustomed to films where, with apologies to a colleague, the world is not flat.

 BODY:
KAYSEN--Carl. It is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the passing of its distinguished Fellow and co-chair of its Committee on International Security Studies (CISS), Carl Kaysen. 
A noted economist, Carl taught at Harvard University and, since 1976, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was the David W. Skinner Professor of Political Economy and directed the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. As Deputy Special Assistant for National Security Affairs under President John F. Kennedy, he oversaw foreign economic policy and advised on national security and disarmament issues. Among the most trusted members of Kennedy's inner circle, he helped to shape the U.S. responses to crises in Berlin and Congo. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis he was known as "the Vice President in charge of the rest of the world," and in 1963 he participated in U.S.-Soviet negotiations that resulted in the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He brought his breadth of experience, as well as his characteristic wisdom and calm, to his work with CISS, through which he continued actively to address challenges to global peace and security. Most recently, he helped to shape the Academy's international projects on the Global Nuclear Future and on Cybersecurity. He authored or edited numerous Academy publications, including major Academy studies on topics ranging the war in Iraq to corporate governance. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Ruth and his daughters Susanna and Jesse. A memorial service at the Academy will be announced. Louis W. Cabot, Chairman pro tem Leslie Berlowitz, Chief Executive Officer John Reed, Treasurer Jerrold Meinwald, Secretary John Steinbruner, Cochair of CISS

HEADLINE: Where Faulkner Found His People

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The climactic moment in William Faulkner's 1942 novel ''Go Down, Moses'' comes when Isaac McCaslin finally decides to open his grandfather's leather farm ledgers with their ''scarred and cracked backs'' and ''yellowed pages scrawled in fading ink'' -- proof of his family's slave-owning past. Now, what appears to be the document on which Faulkner modeled that ledger as well as the source for myriad names, incidents and details that populate his fictionalized Yoknapatawpha County has been discovered. 
 The original manuscript, a diary from the mid-1800s, was written by Francis Terry Leak, a wealthy plantation owner in Mississippi whose great-grandson Edgar Wiggin Francisco Jr. was a friend of Faulkner's since childhood. Mr. Francisco's son, Edgar Wiggin Francisco III, now 79, recalls the writer's frequent visits to the family homestead in Holly Springs, Miss., throughout the 1930s, saying Faulkner was fascinated with the diary's several volumes. Mr. Francisco said he saw them in Faulker's hands and remembers that he ''was always taking copious notes.'' 
 Specialists have been stunned and intrigued not only by this peephole into Faulkner's working process, but also by material that may have inspired this Nobel-prize-winning author, considered by many to be one of the greatest American novelists of the 20th century. 
 ''I think it's one of the most sensational literary discoveries of recent decades,'' said John Lowe, an English professor at Louisiana State University who is writing a book on Faulkner. He was one of a handful of experts who met Dr. Francisco at the hand-hewn log house in Holly Springs last month. There they saw the windowpane where a cousin, Ludie Baugh, etched the letters L-U-D-I-E into the glass while watching Confederate soldiers march by -- a scene that appears in several Faulkner works. 
 During the gathering Dr. Francisco, known in childhood as Little Eddie, described how Faulkner stood in front of that window and said, '' 'She's still here,' like she was a ghost,'' Professor Lowe recalled.
 Dr. Francisco, speaking by telephone from his home in Atlanta, remembered hearing Faulkner rant as he read Leak's pro-slavery and pro-Confederacy views: ''Faulkner became very angry. He would curse the man and take notes and curse the man and take more notes.''
 Sally Wolff-King, a scholar of Southern literature at Emory University who uncovered the connection between the author and the journal, called it ''a once-in-a-lifetime literary find.'' 
 ''The diary and a number of family stories seem to have provided the philosophical and thematic power for some of his major works,'' she added.
 Names of slaves owned by Leak -- Caruthers, Moses, Isaac, Sam, Toney, Mollie, Edmund and Worsham -- all appear in some form in ''Go Down, Moses.'' Other recorded names, like Candis (Candace in the book) and Ben, show up in ''The Sound and The Fury'' (1929) while Old Rose, Henry, Ellen and Milly are characters in ''Absalom, Absalom!'' (1936). Charles Bonner, a well-known Civil War physician mentioned in the diary, would also seem to be the namesake of Charles Bon in ''Absalom.''
 Scholars found Faulkner's decision to give his white characters the names of slaves particularly arresting. Professor Wolff-King said she believes he was ''trying to recreate the slaves lives and give them a voice.''
 Dr. Francisco says he is still very uncomfortable that his family's connection to Faulkner has come to light. ''I wouldn't have done it at all,'' he said about publicizing the diary. ''My wife urged me until I finally did it,'' he said of Anne Salyerds Francisco, his wife of 50 years. ''She pushed and Sally pulled.''
 ''There were long-repressed things that Faulkner uncovered that I didn't know were in the family,'' Dr. Francisco explained, adding that his father never talked about Leak and his slave-owning past. ''I just bottled all that up and forgot about it.''
 Dr. Francisco said that neither he nor his father ever read much of Faulkner's work, including ''Go Down, Moses.'' 
 ''I tried to read that book years ago,'' he said, ''but I got so angry I threw it across the room, and it stayed there for months.'' He said he now might give it another go.
 The mothers of Faulkner and of Dr. Francisco's father were close. The boys went to each other's childhood birthday parties. Later they double dated and became hunting and drinking buddies, remaining friends until their 40s, when they drifted apart, a situation probably encouraged by Mr. Francisco's wife, who did not approve of Faulkner's drinking, smoking and cursing. 
 Professor Wolff-King had been working on a book about people who knew Faulkner and ended up connecting with Dr. Francisco because he was an alumnus of Emory. When she visited his home in Atlanta, his wife suggested he show the professor a typescript copy of the ledger. Included was a facsimile of a page that listed dollar amounts paid for individual slaves. 
 ''At that moment I realized this diary may not only have influenced the ledger and slave sale record in 'Go Down, Moses' but also likely served an important source for much of William Faulkner's work,'' said Professor Wolff-King, who has spent 30 years studying the writer. 
 A short preview of her findings is in the fall 2009 issue of The Southern Literary Journal; her book ''Ledgers of History: William Faulkner, an Almost Forgotten Friendship, and an Antebellum Diary,'' is due out in June from Louisiana State University Press.
 Professor Lowe reviewed the manuscript before publication. To protect against leaks the editor arranged a meeting in a coffee shop. ''He gave me the manuscript in a plain brown wrapper, and I was sworn to secrecy,'' he said. 
 ''I was electrified when I was reading it,'' he said. ''Faulkner had a very intense and intellectual relationship with Dr. Francisco's father,'' which seems to have formed ''the basis of some of the conversations you find in 'Absalom, Absalom!' and 'Go Down, Moses.' '' 
 The Leak papers are not unfamiliar to scholars. The family donated the journal, which includes the plantation accounts as well as descriptive sections, to the University of North Carolina in 1946 and received a typescript copy of the material that runs 1,800 pages. The original documents have been used by Southern economists and social historians for their insights into Mississippi's plantation life, but no one has previously been aware that Faulkner, who died in 1962, had any connection to them.
 Professor Wolff-King argues that elements and terms from the diary repeatedly surface in Faulkner's work, including the ticking sound of a watch that Quentin Compson is obsessed with in ''The Sound and the Fury''; descriptions of building a plantation match Thomas Sutpen's in ''Absalom, Absalom!'' 
 Noel Polk, the editor of The Mississippi Quarterly and among the deans of Faulkner scholars, said, ''I was surprised at the discovery of what is so clearly a major piece of information about his life, and maybe his work.''
 He and others said it was still too early for them to gauge just how significant the diary is without reading Professor Wolff-King's book and examining the ledgers themselves, especially when it comes to the more common details about the antebellum and Civil War eras. 
 ''Almost every document that you can come up with that Faulkner used is interesting, but the question is what do you do with it,'' Judith L. Sensibar, whose biography ''Faulkner andLove: The Women Who Shaped His Art'' was published last year. What does it tell us, for instance, about his ''obsession with the ways in which slavery has disfigured the lives of both the slaves and their masters?'' she asked. 
 Although literary experts have been taken aback by this unexpected find, Faulkner more than anyone would have understood how the past can unpredictably poke its nose into the present.

HEADLINE: Food Stamps Finding New Acceptance as Enrollment Surges

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
A decade ago, New York City officials were so reluctant to give out food stamps, they made people register one day and return the next just to get an application. The welfare commissioner said the program caused dependency and the poor were ''better off'' without it.
 Now the city urges the needy to seek aid (in languages from Albanian to Yiddish). Neighborhood groups recruit clients at churches and grocery stores, with materials that all but proclaim a civic duty to apply -- to ''help New York farmers, grocers, and businesses.'' There is even a program on Rikers Island to enroll inmates leaving the jail. 
 ''Applying for food stamps is easier than ever,'' city posters say. 
 The same is true nationwide. After a U-turn in the politics of poverty, food stamps, a program once scorned as ''welfare,'' enjoys broad new support. Following deep cuts in the 1990s, Congress reversed course to expand eligibility, cut red tape and burnish the program's image, with a special effort to enroll the working poor. These changes, combined with soaring unemployment, have pushed enrollment to record highs, with one in eight Americans now getting aid.
 ''I've seen a remarkable shift,'' said Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican and prominent food stamp supporter. ''People now see that it's necessary to have a strong food stamp program.''
 The revival began a decade ago, after tough welfare laws chased millions of people from the cash rolls, many into low-wage jobs as fast-food workers, maids, and nursing aides. Newly sympathetic officials saw food stamps as a way to help them. For states, the program had another appeal: the benefits are federally paid.
 But support also turned on chance developments, including natural disasters (which showed the program's value in emergencies) and the rise of plastic benefit cards (which eased stigma and fraud). The program has commercial allies, in farmers and grocery stores, and it got an unexpected boost from President George W. Bush, whose food stamp administrator, Eric Bost, proved an ardent supporter. 
 ''I assure you, food stamps is not welfare,'' Mr. Bost said in a recent interview.
 Still, some critics see it as welfare in disguise and advocate more restraints. 
 So far their voices have been muted, unlike in the 1990s when members of Congress likened permissive welfare laws to feeding alligators and wolves. But last month, a Republican candidate for governor in South Carolina, Andre Bauer, criticized food stamps by saying his grandmother ''told me as a small child to quit feeding stray animals. You know why? Because they breed.''
 Mr. Bauer, the lieutenant governor, apologized for his phrasing but said, ''somebody has to have the gumption to talk about the cycle of dependency.''
 The drive to enroll the needy can be seen in the case of Monica Bostick-Thomas, 45, a Harlem widow who works part-time as a school crossing guard. Since her husband died three years ago, she has scraped by on an annual income of about $15,000.
 But she did not seek help until she got a call from the Food Bank of New York City, one of the city's outreach partners. Last year, she balked, doubting she qualified. This year, when the group called again, she agreed to apply. A big woman with a broad smile, Ms. Bostick-Thomas swept into the group's office a few days later, talking up her daughters' college degrees and bemoaning the cost of oxtail meat. 
 ''I'm not saying I go hungry,'' Ms. Bostick-Thomas said. ''But I can't always eat what I want.''
 The worker projected a benefit of $147 a month. ''That's going to help!'' she said. ''I wouldn't have gone and applied on my own.''
 Since its founding in 1964, the food stamp program has swung between seasons of bipartisan support and conservative attack. George McGovern, a Democrat, and Bob Dole, a Republican, were prominent Senate backers. But Ronald Reagan told stories about the ''strapping young buck'' who used food stamps to buy a ''T-bone steak.'' 
 By the 1990s, the program was swept up in President Bill Clinton's pledge to ''end welfare.'' While he meant cash aid, Congressional Republicans labeled food stamps welfare, too. The 1996 law that restricted cash benefits included major cuts in food stamps benefits and eligibility. Some states went further and pushed eligible people away.
 But as attention shifted to poor workers, food stamps won new support. Wisconsin's former governor, Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, boasted of cutting the cash rolls, but advertised the food stamp rise. ''Leading the Way to Make Work Pay,'' a 2000 news release said.
 States eased limits on people with cars and required fewer office visits from people with jobs. The federal government now gives bonuses to states that enroll the most eligible people.
 A self-reinforcing cycle kicked in: outreach attracted more workers, and workers built support for outreach. In a given month, nearly 90 percent of food stamp recipients still have incomes below the federal poverty line, according to the Department of Agriculture. But among families with children, the share working rose to 47 percent in 2008, from 26 percent in the mid-1990s, and the share getting cash welfare fell by two-thirds. 
 In 2008, the program got an upbeat new name: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- SNAP. By contrast, cash welfare remains stigmatized, and the rolls have scarcely budged.
 Nowhere have attitudes swung as far as in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his welfare commissioner, Jason A. Turner, laid siege in the late 1990s to what they called the welfare capital of the world. After bitter fights, a federal judge made the city end delays in handing out food stamp applications. But attitudes remained stern.
 ''I count food stamps as being part of welfare,'' Mr. Turner said at the time. ''You're better off without either one.''
 Since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office eight years ago, the rolls have doubled, to 1.6 million people, with most of the increase coming in his second term after critics accused him of neglecting the poor. 
 He intensified outreach. He reduced paperwork. He hired a new welfare commissioner, Robert Doar, with orders to improve service for the working poor.
 ''If you're working, I want to help you, and that's how the mayor feels,'' Mr. Doar said. 
 Albany made a parallel push to enroll the working poor, setting an explicit goal for caseload growth. ''This is all federal money -- it drives dollars to local economies,'' said Russell Sykes, a senior program official.
 But Mr. Turner, now a consultant in Milwaukee, warns that the aid encourages the poor to work less and therefore remain in need. ''It's going to be very difficult with large swaths of the lower middle class tasting the fruits of dependency to be weaned from this,'' he said.
 The tension between self-reliance and relief can be seen at the food bank's office in Harlem, where the city lets outreach workers file applications. 
 Juan Diego Castro, 24, is a college graduate and Americorps volunteer whose immigrant parents warned him ''not to be a burden on this country.'' He has a monthly stipend of about $2,500 and initially thought food stamps should go to needier people, like the tenants he organizes. ''My concern was if I'm taking food stamps and I have a job, is it morally correct?'' he said.
 But federal law eases eligibility for Americorps members, and a food bank worker urged him and fellow volunteers to apply, arguing that there was enough aid to go around and that use would demonstrate continuing need. ''That meeting definitely turned us around,'' Mr. Castro said.
 While Mr. Castro seemed contemplative, Alba Catano, 44, appeared dejected. A Colombian immigrant, she has spent a dozen years on a night janitorial crew but fell and missed three months of work after knee surgery.
 Last November, she limped into a storefront church in Queens, where a food bank worker was taking applications beside the pews. 
 About her lost wages, she struck a stoic pose, saying her san cocho -- Colombian soup -- had less meat and more plantains. But her composure cracked when she talked of the effect on her 10-year-old daughter.
 ''My refrigerator is empty,'' Ms. Catano said.
 Last month, Ms. Catano was back at work, with a benefit of $170 a month and no qualms about joining 38 million Americans eating with government aid. ''I had the feeling that working people were not eligible,'' she said. ''But then they told me, 'No, no, the program has improved.' ''

HEADLINE: Envisioning Shakespeare At Home In New York

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The news that the Royal Shakespeare Company will install a classical theater inside the Park Avenue Armory for a six-week residency in the summer of 2011 inspires both gratitude and chagrin. 
 The cause for gratitude is obvious. New Yorkers will get to gorge on a big hunk of the greatest playwright in the English language, courtesy of one of the world's leading theater companies. The chagrin derives from the dispiriting reflection that the chance to see five Shakespeare plays in rep is virtually unheard of in this, the country's theatrical capital. Sometimes we don't see that many major Shakespeare productions here in a year. And once again we must turn to traveling Britons for a serious immersion in the classics. 
 But the visit could provide a greater opportunity that I hope will be seized by the city's cultural leaders. Or, failing that, a philanthropist with a dream and a big checkbook. 
 As has been reported, with the assistance of the Lincoln Center Festival and Ohio State University -- of all unlikely institutions, and go Bucks! -- the Royal Shakespeare Company will build a replica of its new 900-seat theater inside the armory for the duration of its stay. After the residency the company plans to pack up and store the theater, ''probably in the U.S. but location and details still to be resolved,'' then reuse it for productions in the United States and Britain, a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail message.
 My proposal (fanfare please, with million-dollar donations) is that it be left in place, instantly turning the wonderful armory space into the site for large-scale classical work that New York sorely needs. It has long rankled that both Washington and Chicago have major theaters devoted to classical work -- ''Shakespeare Theaters'' in fact. Here's a chance for New York to establish its own equivalent, a classical repertory company of international stature. 
 The Royal Shakespeare Company would be spared the trouble of finding somewhere to put the massive thing. (I don't think Manhattan Mini Storage would quite do.) And the company could be a partner and participant in the new venture, offering advice and expertise as well as presenting visiting productions -- making for a more ambitious, formalized version of the Bridge Project, Sam Mendes's partnership between American and British actors on classic plays, currently in residence at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. I was struck by the news, in The New York Times, about the armory plan, that 40 percent of the Royal Shakespeare Company's fundraising now comes from the United States. 
 We've got a year and change to get this modest plan under way. And we've got an ally, I would like to hope, in the new National Endowment for the Arts chief, Rocco Landesman, a former theater industry executive. (That Peoria brouhaha might pose a problem of course.) The dream is quixotic, yes, given the dreary economy and the shrinking in both personal and corporate giving that has resulted. Realistically, the chances of recruiting enough dollars to start a new theater company are slim.
 But for heaven's sake, people, it's not every day that somebody wanders into town and -- presto! -- builds a classical auditorium from the ground up. The heavy lifting, construction-wise, has already been accounted for. Let's seize the day. 
 As it happens I have become increasingly enamored of the armory over the past few years, as Lincoln Center has taken to producing musical and theatrical work there. It's a gloriously dramatic building, acoustically workable and just slightly down-at-heels, recalling the beautifully tarnished grandeur of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater. The temporary structures that have been built for the German opera ''Die Soldaten'' in 2008 and last summer's productions of Ariane Mnouchkine's ''Ephemeres'' and Declan Donnellan's ''Boris Godunov'' worked well.
 More recently Lincoln Center presented the elaborate German whatnot ''Stifters Dinge,'' a machine-driven musical theater work that also benefited from the majesty of the space. The model illustrations of the planned Royal Shakespeare replica, with seating on three levels, a proscenium and a traditional Shakespearean thrust stage, look inviting and suitable for the space's large scale. 
 The location is also in some ways ideal. The Upper East Side has many attractions -- the museums, the splurge-worthy restaurants, Barneys -- but it's a bit of a wasteland when it comes to the performing arts. The only major performance space in the vicinity is the 92nd Street Y, which primarily presents lectures and concerts. The armory could also be reconfigured to accommodate smaller-scale work. The temporary structure will of course be built in the armory's cavernous Drill Hall, but as anyone who has poked around the building before or after performances knows, there are plenty of other rooms that could be transformed, I think with minimal expense, into performing spaces. 
 Various plans to establish a classical theater in New York have been bruited for many years. The one that came to fruition, Tony Randall's Broadway-based National Actors Theater, gradually fizzled over the course of a decade. A bold plan to transform Castle Williams on Governors Island is intriguing but hasn't gotten much traction despite a design by the prominent architect Norman Foster. (Certainly in terms of attracting audiences, Park Avenue is a surer bet.)
 Probably the active ingredient needed to implement any such plan is an impresario with a passion and a dream -- a Joe Papp, in other words. Papp built the New York Shakespeare Festival and subsequently the Public Theater beginning with a shoestring budget in a church auditorium on the Lower East Side. But a new Joe Papp does not emerge as necessity demands. 
 It's also true that the theatrical environment today is much different from what it was in Papp's day. A new-model Papp would have a tougher time getting a foothold. The city already has a handful of well-established not-for-profit theater companies -- including the Public -- that produce full seasons of work on Broadway and off, and probably aren't looking for any competition for fund-raising dollars. 
 But classical work is represented only rarely in their seasons. The Roundabout Theater Company produces Shaw with some regularity, and 20th-century American classics, but no Shakespeare. Lincoln Center Theater has done just three Shakespeare productions in the last decade. And while the Public still produces Shakespeare plays in Central Park -- though not exclusively -- under the artistic director Oskar Eustis the company has staged only a single Shakespeare play at its Astor Place site. (The Public also produced the Philip Seymour Hoffman ''Othello'' off site, and hosted a Wooster Group riff on ''Hamlet.'')
 If you lived in Washington, this season alone you would have had the opportunity to see ''As You Like It,'' ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' ''Richard II'' and ''Henry V,'' as well as productions of plays by Shaw, Corneille and Ben Jonson -- all at the Shakespeare Theater. No major New York company comes close to doing the same, and the city's theatrical culture is the poorer for it, increasingly obsessed with exploiting established movie stars, not nurturing talented stage actors.
 Failing a full-scale repertory company, perhaps an ad hoc coalition of established theaters and visiting troupes could put the new venue to use. With the Royal Shakespeare, the Lincoln Center Festival and Lincoln Center Theater in the lead, seasons of national and international productions ofclassical theater could be produced or presented. 
 I last visited the armory just a couple of weeks ago, not for a performance but to stroll through the Winter Antiques Show. I noted, with some astonishment, that some unknown buyer was prepared to purchase a weathervane in the shape of a pig for upwards of $100,000. If there are still deep-pocketed New Yorkers able to drop six figures on a decorative pig, surely it's not too absurd to imagine that a way could be found to capitalize on the unique opportunity presented by the classical space being erected in the heart of the moneyed Upper East Side.

HEADLINE: In Canada, 'Complete Coverage' Is Not Hyperbole

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Olympics are in Canada for the third time, and the country's broadcasters are planning a live media overload unlike anything seen over the United States border.
 The coverage from Vancouver fits Canada's unabashed efforts to win as many gold medals as possible -- it has never won gold on its soil -- especially in men's hockey, in which anything less than victory will be viewed as a national failure.
 When Canada hosted the Olympics in Calgary in 1988 and in Montreal in 1976, the Internet and digital ages did not exist. The growth of new media has set the stage for broadcasters with enough money to expand far beyond traditional television coverage. Then, add the pressure of carrying a homeland Olympics. 
 ''There's no question that the Games transcend sport the moment they're in your country,'' said Keith Pelley, the president of the consortium that was formed by the Canadian television network CTV and Rogers Media to exploit every medium possible to showcase the Vancouver Games. To Pelley, the operating philosophy in Vancouver will be simple.
 ''Everything live,'' he said. ''Watch what you want, when you want, how you want, and provide experience on TV, V.O.D., online, mobile and in theaters. We've combined the live component Canadians are familiar with from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with NBC's high production level.''
 The live mantra -- East Coast, West Coast or Arctic Circle -- differs from NBC's. NBC is embracing a mostly live schedule, except in the West, where the Games will again be on videotape, even though Vancouver is three time zones from the East. 
 To NBC, the East Coast is where most people live, and local ratings bolster its belief that Westerners want to see the prime-time Olympics when they are at home.
 As always, there is a large financial gap between the rights fees paid by NBC and the Canadian broadcaster. The former is paying $820 million, the latter $90 million.
 CTV-Rogers unseated CBC, which had carried every Olympics from 1996 to 2008 in Canada and paid just $28 million for the rights to the 2006 Turin Games.
 CBC, a public broadcaster, is ''always careful with our business decisions,'' the spokesman Jeff Keay said. But the consortium was not as restrained financially, or at least it wasn't five years ago, well before the recession, when it won its bid for the 2010 and 2012 Games.
 Pelley said that the aggressive CTV-Rogers bid is not profitable; NBC is expected to lose $250 million because of the recession and what looks like an overbid. Pelley said: ''We're in the fourth quarter and have to play a good game to make money. If Canada wins a couple of medals early -- and if you believe independent studies that two-thirds of Canadians will watch the Olympics, unheard of numbers -- that will bode well for us.''
 The Olympic blizzard planned by the CTV-Rogers partnership includes:
 Coverage on 12 networks, chief among them the English-language CTV, TSN and Rogers SportsNet; and the French-language V and RDS. The remaining channels will show events in nearly two dozen other languages, from Gujarati and Inuktitut to Portuguese and Urdu.
 (People in cities near the border with the United States, especially in the West, who watch CTV coverage, will be able to follow the tradition of learning what happened before NBC shows it.).
 Fourteen video streams from the five dominant English and French networks, and nine from the International Olympic Committee's world-broadcasting feed. ''If you want the fourth sheet of women's curling or the 48th skier going downhill, you don't have to worry about us going to commercial,'' said Alon Marcovici, the consortium's vice president of digital media.
 (Americans will not be able to see the geo-protected Web streaming, and NBC's live streaming is confined to hockey and curling. Of course, some sites invariably pop up during the Olympics to show pirated live video.)
 Showings in 64 theaters nationwide, an option exploited with the closed-circuit rights in the consortium's Olympic package. Fans can buy a 17-day passport or individual tickets and companies can rent out theaters. 
 ''We're letting the theater managers decide which events are most important to their communities,'' Marcovici said. ''In the West, the manager might show curling; in Quebec, it might be short-track speedskating.''
 A YouTube channel designed to feed off Canadians' love of the site. ''More than half the Canadian online experience is consumed at YouTube,'' Marcovici said. 
 The overall media plan is designed to satisfy a broad spectrum of viewing habits. 
 ''People shouldn't have to change their media consumption experience,'' he said. ''So if you get your entertainment through Xbox, iTunes, online, radio, TV -- go ahead. If the audience is there, let's make it easier. Fish where the fish are.''
 The CTV-Rogers consortium is driven by promoting homegrown stars in the hope that they will win medals. ''The No. 1 show on CBC from Beijing was Simon Whitfield's silver medal,'' Pelley said, referring to the triathlete. 
 From Vancouver, CTV-Rogers is pushing hockey's Sidney Crosby, the skier Manuel Osborne-Paradis and the speedskater Christine Nesbitt, much as NBC wants Lindsey Vonn, Shaun White and Apolo Anton Ohno to vindicate its outsize promotion of them. 
 But the undisputed star in Canada is the men's hockey team, sort of the 2010 equivalent of American basketball's 1992 Dream Team. ''This country will shut down if we win,'' Pelley said. ''One of our biggest challenges is not to be a cheerleader.''

HEADLINE: Concern Aired Over Banks' Real Estate Loans

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A huge wave of mortgage failures on commercial real estate could hit next year, causing banks to lose as much as $300 billion, imperiling lending for small businesses and hindering the economic recovery, a Congressional panel is warning.
 In a report to be released on Thursday, the Congressional Oversight Panel, which is responsible for reviewing the Treasury's $700 billion bailout program, said commercial loan losses could jeopardize the stability of many banks, particularly the nation's midsize and smaller banks, contributing to prolonged weakness throughout the economy. 
 The panel's chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren, has been pressing the Treasury to compel thousands of banks to undergo stress tests like the ones that the Federal Reserve required of 19 of the country's biggest financial institutions early last year. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has called that idea impractical. 
 He acknowledged, however, that many community banks had greater exposure than the largest banks to a downturn in commercial real estate. 
 From 2010 to 2014, about $1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans will reach the end of their terms, according to the report, a copy of which was provided by the panel to The New York Times. 
 Commercial property values have fallen more than 40 percent since the start of 2007, and nearly half of the loans coming due are ''underwater,'' meaning the borrower owes more than the property is worth, according to the report. Vacancy rates are as varied as 8 percent for multifamily housing to 18 percent for office buildings, and rents have fallen 40 percent for office space and 33 percent for retail space, the report states.
 A spokesman for the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, a trade group, said it could not comment on the report until it was released. 
 Told of the report's findings, Camden R. Fine, the chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers Association, said he believed the warnings were exaggerated. 
 ''We believe that the Congressional Oversight Panel overstates the threat commercial real estate loans present to the vast majority of community banks nationwide,'' he said. ''While there are certain specific areas of the country where commercial real estate is very weak, in other regions of the country commercial real estate is stable.'' 
 Mr. Fine said he thought that more than 90 percent of an estimated 8,000 community banks ''are strong, stable and growing.'' 
 Ms. Warren, in an interview, said the report was intended to sound an alarm rather than make particular policy recommendations. 
 ''There are a lot of the tools in the toolbox that might be used to deal with the problem, and the effectiveness depends on how fast the policy makers get started,'' she said. ''There is no single fix here. It's a big bubble that has to come down, and that means substantial losses for investors, and for the banks that lent them money.'' 
 She added: ''It's important to worry about the contagion effect. Much of this is about how to manage the losses, and how to keep them confined.'' 
 The Treasury did not have a formal response to the report, because officials had not seen it. 
 Ms. Warren said, ''The Treasury needs to make sure it's got its arms around this problem and is working with banking regulators to assess the impact of the problem and to have emergency plans in place.''

HEADLINE: Bagel-nomics: For $177, You Also Get the Kitchen Sink?

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It would be difficult to order a nearly $200 bagel sandwich at Bits Bites & Baguettes -- difficult, but certainly not impossible. You would have to get creative. The bagel would have to get messy.
 ''Anything can go on a bagel,'' a manager said on Wednesday from behind the counter on Park Place, a short walk from City Hall. ''We can put the whole menu on a bagel.'' 
 A bagel with one egg and cheese is $1.75. A bagel with one egg and ham, bacon or sausage costs $2.15. The Bits Best Bagel Platter -- a bagel of your choice with sliced Nova lox, whitefish salad or baked salmon salad, cream cheese, lettuce, tomato and Bermuda onion -- runs $8.95. 
 If you ordered a Bits Best Bagel Platter and asked them to throw on extra toppings, like avocado, bacon, sun-dried tomato, steak fries, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks, that would still come to only $25.80. 
 Such an exercise in bagel-nomics was necessary and noteworthy on Wednesday, the day after Councilman Larry B. Seabrook was charged with money laundering, extortion and fraud. 
 Among the items in the 13-count federal indictment was the curious case of the $177 bagel sandwich and soda. Mr. Seabrook, a Bronx Democrat and former assemblyman and former state senator, bought a bagel sandwich and diet soda for $7 one day and submitted a doctored receipt that inflated the cost to $177, according to the indictment. 
 (Prosecutors did not specify where he bought the bagel, saying only that it was near City Hall. A person familiar with the councilman's culinary predilections that day said the receipt came from Bits Bites & Baguettes. The person did not want to be named because the establishment was not identified in the indictment. )
 Mr. Seabrook submitted the receipt to the North East Bronx Community Democratic Club, seeking reimbursement for club-related expenses. Among other charges, he was accused by prosecutors of steering corrupt payments to the political club, which he controlled, and then taking the money for his own use, often by submitting bogus receipts. Mr. Seabrook has pleaded not guilty.
 Chuck Lee, 49, the owner of Andy's Deli on Broadway near City Hall, had a typical reaction when asked, as other bagel experts were on Wednesday, just how far-fetched a $177 bagel-and-soda order could be. ''One hundred seventy-seven bucks?'' he shrieked. ''In this kind of recession?'' Then he burst out laughing. 
 Bagel sandwiches are not as cheap as they used to be. Yet they remain, like the pizza slice, a symbol of working-class New York, and are priced accordingly. Even high-end establishments keep the cost in the double digits. 
 At the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, where the city's power brokers eat their power breakfasts, the most you can spend on a bagel is $28, for a toasted H & H bagel with smoked salmon, tomato, red onion and cream cheese. 
 The most expensive bagel at Norma's, the restaurant at Le Parker Meridien Hotel on West 56th Street, has three layers, five ounces of smoked salmon and three kinds of caviar, for $23. Norma's also is the home of the $1,000 lobster-and-caviar frittata, an Italian omelet (''Norma dares you to expense this,'' the menu reads), so it seemed reasonable to ask Steven Pipes, the hotel's managing director, what their $177 bagel sandwich might look like.
 Mr. Pipes proposed a menu addition called the Larry B. Bagel Special: an H & H bagel with cream cheese and scrambled eggs, served open-faced with a third of an ounce of white Alba truffles, which cost $6,000 to $10,000 per pound. At $177, would anyone really order it? ''Absolutely,'' Mr. Pipes said. ''Especially if it's a politician.''

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Could Lose Its Edge, a Report Warns

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's economy is sputtering and risks permanently stalling, according to an annual report by a group of researchers in the region. 
 Part of the toll on Silicon Valley has resulted from the recession. The region, the center of the global technology industry, lost 90,000 jobs from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. Unemployment is higher than national levels and the worst in the region since 2005, when technology companies were still recovering from the dot-com implosion. 
 The drop in the number of midlevel jobs -- the engineers who drive much of the Valley's growth -- has been sharpest. And when companies do hire, they are cautiously hiring independent contractors instead of regular employees, and are hiring abroad, according to the ''2010 Index of Silicon Valley'' report, which was produced by the Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, two local nonprofit groups. 
 Other economic indicators are also gloomy, the report found. 
 ''We show no evidence that the recovery has arrived,'' said Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture.
 One of the Valley's measures of success -- akin to the size of bonuses on Wall Street or box-office sales in Hollywood -- has been the number of patents received and the number of initial public offerings of stock in technology companies. Patent registrations dipped slightly in 2008, and initial public offerings have dropped to the lowest levels since the 1970s. 
 Venture capital financing of start-ups sank 37 percent from 2008 to 2009. And vacancies in commercial real estate jumped 33 percent. 
 The report's pessimism is by no means the prevailing view in the San Francisco Bay Area, where stalwarts like Apple and start-ups like Twitter continue to pump out new products and new ideas.
 ''Innovation continues unabated,'' even though venture financing is difficult to raise right now, said Timothy Draper, founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a Menlo Park venture capital firm. ''Moore's Law persists, as $1,000 worth of computer power doubles every 15 months or so, and innovators continue to march along.''
 Still, if Silicon Valley's traditional advantages weaken, residents may no longer be willing to put up with its ultra-expensive homes and poor public schools, said John Kao, chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation in San Francisco.
 ''It's like SoHo, which started out as a low-key, cheap place to do art, and now it's expensive and an artist wouldn't go to SoHo,'' he said. ''It's the same threat here. So far people have stayed, but entrepreneurs have many other options today.'' 
 Even when the trauma of the financial crisis subsides, Silicon Valley will still be at risk because of deeper, long-term challenges, the report said. 
 Sixty percent of the region's scientists and engineers are foreign-born, but foreign immigration to the region dropped 34 percent over the last year. The home countries of foreigners are increasingly luring them back, while the United States government's policies have made it harder for them to stay, the report said.
 To combat the brain drain, California must do a better job educating local students, said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, who also serves as an adviser to the annual study. ''We're not going to be able to live on global talent forever,'' Mr. Levy said.
 However, 5 percent fewer high school graduates are meeting requirements for entrance to state universities, the number of science and engineering degrees has leveled off and state general fund spending on higher education dropped 17 percent last year, according to the report. 
 The report's authors said that green technology could be the way out of the region's, and perhaps the nation's, downturn. From 2006 to 2008, patent registrations in green technology in Silicon Valley increased 7 percent. From 2004 to 2008, green jobs increased 24 percent. 
 A green Silicon Valley would be a very different place than the current one, which was built on semiconductors and software and is now home to Web innovators like Google and Facebook. 
 Factories that once made chips would have to be revamped to make solar panels, and venture capital firms are unlikely to be able to provide enough money to build such capital-intensive companies, Mr. Hancock said. Venture financing of green technology companies slid 37 percent last year. 
 With green technology, ''it's not whiz-bang software guys in garages, but utility-scale projects you must do with a federal partner,'' Mr. Hancock said. 
 Yet Silicon Valley is failing to compete as intensely as other communities for federal stimulus grants and loans, said Emmett D. Carson, chief of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. 
 Silicon Valley's poor economic health will affect the nation as a whole, said Judy Estrin, former chief technology officer of Cisco Systems and author of the book ''Closing the Innovation Gap.'' 
 ''Silicon Valley is both a barometer of the rest of the country and a spark for the rest of the country, and if we don't protect that innovation culture here, it's going to be hard to sustain an innovation culture in the country,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Big Enough To Open With Olympics

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
TO say that the folks on Madison Avenue who create television commercials have been busy lately is like saying New Orleans was pleased when the Saints won the Super Bowl. The debut of scores of campaigns, tied to the start of the Olympics on Friday, is part of what may be the most concentrated period of big-budget, big-name marketing efforts in years.
 Super Bowl XLIV on Sunday was part of the frenetic stretch, which continues this weekend with the Winter Games and other sports programming, like the National Basketball Association All-Star Game and the Daytona 500. The TV marketing blitz, which began with the coverage of the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 17, is to run through the Academy Awards on March 7 and conclude with the finale of the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament on April 5.
 All those events have something in common other than high prices for commercial time: They are all broadcast live, part of a trend known as big-event television, which prizes programs that can attract large, involved audiences at a time when consumers have generally been atomized into tiny niche markets. 
 The viewership of the Super Bowl, which Nielsen says was the most-watched TV program ever, showed the potential for reaching big, engaged crowds. So did the ratings for shows like the Golden Globes and Grammys.
 ''We're delighted with this prospect,'' said Marc Pritchard, global chief marketing officer at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, which became an official sponsor of the United States Olympic teams for the Winter Games and the 2012 Summer Games in London. ''We like programs that bring families together.''
 During the NBC coverage of the Olympics, Procter will introduce what it calls its first corporate image campaign for the United States. ''This is a world-class event,'' Mr. Pritchard said, ''and we want to do some world-class brand building.''
 The campaign, which carries the theme ''Thanks, Mom,'' is being created by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The ads promote Procter as a company that is a ''proud sponsor of moms,'' helping the mothers who help Olympic athletes -- and all children -- do their best.
 In one commercial, viewers see the athletes the way their mothers still see them, as boys and girls. Another spot, set to the song ''You'll Never Walk Alone,'' shows mothers performing prosaic, though important, tasks for their children.
 ''We tried to avoid getting overly cheesy and Hallmark-y,'' said Jason Bagley, a creative director at Wieden & Kennedy. ''We wanted to capture that emotion without going over the top.''
 Dozens of advertisers will present emotional commercials, among them Visa, which is feting the Winter Games in a campaign to run in 21 countries from the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group.
 ''There is a need for inspiration'' because of economic conditions, said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing officer at Visa in San Francisco, ''and the campaign celebrates human achievement.''
 At the same time, the economy mandates ''a greater focus on value,'' he added, so the campaign, which carries the theme ''Go world,'' will include promotions like a contest to win tickets to the Winter Games for life. 
 Mr. Lucio declined to predict ''what the audiences are going to be like'' for the coverage of the Olympics, but with ''a lot more people spending time at home,'' he said, there could be robust ratings.
 ''I can hope for a U.S.-Canada hockey final,'' he added, laughing.
 Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer at Coca-Cola North America in Atlanta, suggested another possible audience builder.
 ''All this snow's going to help me,'' she said of the recent bad weather in major markets. ''Everyone's stuck inside after they bought enough food and enough Coke to last a month.''
 The Coca-Cola campaign will be extensive, as usual, befitting a company that has for decades been a sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. The initiative will branch beyond TV with a focus on digital and social media, including themed content on Web sites like mycoke.com and mycokerewards.com; a presence on Facebook; and a light-hearted campaign online, centered on a make-believe International Federation of Snowball Throwing (snowballthrowing.com).
 Another appeal of the Olympics is a belief that it ''aligns with our values,'' said Daryl Evans, vice president for consumer advertising and marketing communications at the Atlanta office of AT&T, a sponsor of Team USA for more than 20 years.
 ''We certainly want to be in large events because they give us broad exposure,'' he said, but an added value is ''athletes trying to push the boundaries,'' which he compared to AT&T's ''trying to push the technology boundaries so people can live their everyday lives a little better.''
 The AT&T Olympic campaign carries the theme ''Here's to possibilities.'' It was created by the Atlanta and New York offices of another Omnicom agency, BBDO Worldwide. There will also be interactive aspects, like a Web portal where fans can post messages for their favorite athletes.
 Another BBDO agency, Juniper Park in Toronto, is creating a campaign for SunChips, sold by the Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo. It will introduce what Frito-Lay says is the first 100 percent compostable snack-chip bag made from plants, which will be phased in during the next year.
 ''We're new to the Olympics,'' said Gannon Jones, vice president for portfolio marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex. ''We targeted the Games to launch this news for us because we think it's an ideal stage.''
 One reason is the location, Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Jones said, which means the Games will take place ''in a good time zone'' for American viewers.
 ''You don't get the tape-delay hangover,'' he added, referring to the declines in viewership when Olympic events are shown later rather than shown live.
 Frito-Lay is one of many marketers buying commercials during coverage of the Winter Games but not official sponsors. Another is Liberty Mutual, which will run spots created by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 ''There is obviously strong brand association with advertising during the Winter Olympics,'' said Greg Winter, a vice president at Hill, Holliday, because the athletes demonstrate ''strength, determination and honor.''

HEADLINE: The Mortgage Crisis: Suggestions for Some Relief

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''No Aid or Rebound in Sight, More Homeowners Just Walk Away'' (front page, Feb. 3):
 There is a simple solution to the problem of real estate owners walking away from their mortgages: an immediate end to foreclosures -- all foreclosures. 
 Just as the banks themselves fed the real estate bubble by selling derivative securities based on subprime loans, and pushed subprime loans to feed the derivatives market, the act of foreclosing on properties and selling them at bargain prices is driving all real estate values down. 
 Foreclosure drives the supply of property up and prices down, while constricting demand. Willing buyers no longer have the means or the credit for a purchase. 
 Ending foreclosures would break the cycle and motivate homeowners to hang on until prices recovered.
 Eric Weiss Jersey City, Feb. 3, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your article highlights both the risk of strategic default by borrowers with deep negative equity and the challenges in crafting an appropriate public policy response. 
 The Treasury Department's program to mitigate the foreclosure crisis is ironically frustrating solutions to the negative equity problem. It focuses on modifying mortgages primarily by reducing interest rates so homeowners can meet monthly payments, but the program's mandated process fails to require mortgage servicers to consider writing down principal. 
 Thus, not only do servicers carry out the program without focusing on principal reduction, worse, servicers are actually discouraged from reducing principal. By creating a uniform mortgage modification process where one did not exist, Treasury's process has unintentionally become the new de facto industry standard. 
 Under it, servicers now fear legal liability to the mortgage lenders for cutting principal outside of the standard. Even with changes to the Treasury's program to address this issue, lenders and investors will still be reluctant to reduce principal for fear of taking an immediate writedown on their books. 
 A market-based suggestion: Lenders should provide homeowners with a cash credit each month for as long as the homeowner makes monthly payments, which the homeowner can gain access to after the mortgage is paid off or refinanced. Thus, the homeowner will have an incentive to stay in the home and keep making payments while the lender avoids a near-term writedown. 
 No one wins in foreclosure. American families deserve better options.

HEADLINE: 'I am a downhiller. That doesn't mean I'm stupid. It means I'm crazy.'

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
Behold the downhill racer, the fearless daredevil oblivious to the dangers of skiing 80, if not 90, miles an hour.
 ''Actually, it never leaves your mind that something could go very wrong and you know it would happen very quickly,'' said Andrew Weibrecht, who will ski for the United States at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. ''I don't know that any of us are ever entirely comfortable in the start house of a downhill. We freely acknowledge that we get scared.''
 His teammate Marco Sullivan said some of his most disastrous race moments had lingered in his mind for months.
 ''The worst feeling is when you hit a jump off balance and suddenly you're in the air and totally helpless,'' Sullivan said. ''You're just waiting for a big impact. They tell you to relax so you'll land soft. How do you relax when you're flying upside down at 70 miles an hour?'' 
 Scott Macartney, a two-time Olympian, laughed when he was asked what it took to be a downhill racer. ''Well, first they gather together all the extremely talented skiers,'' he said. ''Then they take the dumb ones and make them downhillers.''
 But the Swiss ski champion Didier Cuche disagreed. ''I am a downhiller,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean I'm stupid. It means I'm crazy.''
 The downhill, the original extreme winter sport, is no less daunting all these years later. In the last quarter-century, the Winter Olympics have added a host of risky and perilous sports to modernize the event lineup, but their presence has not diminished the primal appeal, and inherent jeopardy, of men and women skiing as fast as they can down a slick mountain slope. It has also not reduced the hazard.
 A gathering of downhillers in gym shorts would reveal a bevy of gruesome knee scars. Head injuries, broken vertebrae and dislocations are so common in this fraternity that they are discussed casually, the way a child might explain away a scraped knee after recess.
 ''You blow out your knee and it's like a rite of passage,'' Sullivan said. ''Everyone goes, 'O.K., you're part of the group now.' Kind of sick, but part of the game.''
 Nine years ago, the American T. J. Lanning was the world's top-ranked 17-year-old. His racing future could not have been brighter. When he was 19, he sustained his first major injury when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. It took him nearly a year to recover, and shortly after he returned he missed the junior world championships with a season-ending ankle injury. 
 The next year he ruptured two disks in his back, requiring surgery and a longer recovery. He made another comeback, but a broken nose, a bone bruise in his leg and a knee meniscus tear sidelined him again in 2008. In January 2009, he was finally climbing the international rankings when he tore his A.C.L. again.
 ''After every injury you wonder if you can come back,'' Lanning said in mid-November. ''But all of us, we always come back. My mom said to me: 'I don't want you to come back anymore. I'm tired of you getting hurt.'
 ''But I told her, 'It hurts me more to not be able to ski than it hurts me to get injured.' ''
 Less than two weeks after that interview, Lanning was speeding down a World Cup downhill course in Canada when he caught a ski edge and tumbled headfirst into the protective nets at the race course's perimeter. Lanning fractured a vertebra in his neck and dislocated his left knee, which was surgically repaired in late January. As he has been informing his followers on Twitter, he is ''stoked'' about his comeback.
 Sarah Schleper, an American who will be participating in her fourth Olympics at Vancouver, said: ''People ask me, 'Why do you do this?' And I tell them that for most of us, skiing has been the one thing we've done our whole lives. It is who we are. So then people ask, 'But if you keep getting hurt at something, wouldn't a normal person stop doing that?' And that's a tougher question to answer.''
 It is part of the ski racing culture to endure the travails for as long as possible.
 ''Our careers are not that long,'' said Cuche, who at 35 will be one of the oldest downhillers in the Vancouver Games. He is expected to race with a splint protecting a recently broken thumb. ''We know we must squeeze out every year that we can because sooner or later there will probably be an injury we cannot make a return from.''
 In the downhill, though, the crashes can be so horrific, the comeback is more than physical. In 2008, Macartney flew off the final jump of the renowned downhill at Kitzbuhel, Austria, at roughly 90 m.p.h. Twisting awkwardly as he flew 200 feet in the air, Macartney landed on his side and smacked his head to the snow. His helmet broke off, and he slid for several hundred feet -- facedown and unconscious -- until he was across the finish line. There, his body went into convulsions. The crash became a YouTube sensation, with more than a million views. Macartney sustained severe head trauma.
 Even his teammates wondered whether Macartney should, or if he would, come back. With an economics degree from Dartmouth, Macartney, 30 at the time, had other options.
 ''It was a battle, but I found a way to be comfortable at high speeds again,'' Macartney said late last year, after he had returned to racing. ''But you don't just hop on skis a few months later and cruise down the hill at 70. It's a long process.''
 The United States ski team has a defined program for its racers recovering from serious injury that includes psychological counseling.
 ''The physical rehab is hard, but you get used to that,'' Macartney said. ''The mental side can be more taxing. That's the conversation with yourself about why you do this.
 ''But you take it in steps. You start with little slalom drill turns at 15 miles an hour, and you work progressively from there. By the time you're back in a downhill course, you start skiing just sections and not the whole thing. You add another section or element every day. Eventually, if you are lucky, you're at full speed stripped down in your speed suit.''
 Macartney did not have a strong season this winter and failed to make the United States team for Vancouver. He did finish the 2010 Kitzbuhel downhill, and stood at the finish with a broad smile as the crowd cheered.
 ''That's the thing,'' Sullivan said. ''It's all about scaring yourself silly and staring fear in the face. But when you're at the finish and you look back up at the race course and think about what you've done, you say, 'Wow, that was awesome.' ''

HEADLINE: Two Charities Start Fund to Help Haitians in New York

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
It will be years before the impact of Haiti's earthquake on Haitians in New York can be fully measured. But as the local population rushes to respond -- increasing remittances to relatives in Haiti, welcoming others who are fleeing the destruction, or mourning the dead -- two of the city's major charities are pitching in to help. 
 On Thursday, the Brooklyn Community Foundation and the United Way of New York City will announce the start of the NYC Haitian Community Hope and Healing Fund. The fund will issue grants to local nonprofit groups that help Haitians with a variety of services, including immigration assistance, literacy and other educational programs, employment training, and grief counseling. 
 The initiative, which its organizers say is unique among the Haitian diaspora in the United States, is driven in part by the expectation that the number of Haitians in New York will surge as people flee the quake's destruction. The Obama administration's offer of temporary legal status to many illegal Haitian immigrants could also bring thousands of people out of the shadows to seek formal educations and legal work.
 ''There are going to be many Haitians coming to our communities, and we have to make sure that the social service providers are going to be strong,'' said Gordon J. Campbell, president and chief executive of the United Way of New York City. 
 But while the fund is intended to address immediate needs, its administrators also hope it will help to strengthen organizations for the long term with job training, institutional development and building improvements. Many Haitian social service groups in New York are operating on shoestring budgets, overwhelmed by both the recession and the surge in their clients' demands since the earthquake.
 Strengthening those groups, the fund administrators say, will help New York's Haitians work together and give them a more visible presence and a greater sense of community.
 ''This will give us a chance to take inventory of the services and the needs of the community,'' said Carine Jocelyn, executive director of Diaspora Community Services, which is based in Brooklyn, and a co-chairwoman of the new fund's community advisory committee. ''It gives us a chance to dialogue and maybe even collaborate.''
 Marilyn Gelber, president of the Brooklyn Community Foundation, said she had seen this dynamic taking root. At the earliest meetings to discuss the fund, which were attended by the directors of numerous community-based Haitian groups, there were ''people who maybe should've known each other and didn't know each other,'' she said. 
 About $250,000 has been pledged to the fund, most of it from the two sponsoring foundations, with additional support from the Altman Foundation, Capital One Bank and St. Francis College. The administrators hope that private corporations and other groups, as well as individuals, will step forward with contributions. 
 The grants will go as high as $50,000, Mr. Campbell said. Applications will be available on the fund's Web site (www.hopeandhealingfund.org) on Thursday and will be evaluated by both the United Way and the Brooklyn Community Foundation. 
 The fund is expected to exist for three to five years, Ms. Gelber said, but its lifespan will depend on the size of the contributions.
 ''We're not looking at this as immediate relief and we're gone,'' she said.

HEADLINE: When New York Met the World

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
GEOGRAPHY has always been a convenient form of branding in Manhattan, where Madison Avenue, Broadway and Wall Street are shorthand for career tracks as much as they are addresses. 
 As the home of New York Fashion Week, Bryant Park is, to much of the world, synonymous with fashion. That is a fitting distinction since its wide-open lawn is also commonly referred to on Seventh Avenue, where famous designers like Donna Karan, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera have their offices, as the backyard of the garment district. So when the New York catwalks were centralized under a big tent there in 1993, it made a poignant narrative to show the clothes just a couple of blocks from where they were being created. 
 Sure, there were plenty of people then, as there are now, who thought it was perfectly appalling that a bunch of fashion designers should be allowed to take over just about the only patch of open green space in Midtown for their invitation-only affair. It may not have been obvious why fashion mattered to the thousands of tourists and commuters who walked by each day, irritated by the traffic, excited by the celebrities, bemused by the outfits. 
 But now, after a prolonged dispute between the designers and the park management, the Fashion Week that begins in Bryant Park today will be the last, before the event moves to Lincoln Center in the fall. 
 Its entrance, on Avenue of the Americas at 41st Street, is printed with dozens of quotations from designers, editors and publicists, all expressing the belief that showing collectively in Bryant Park is what made New York City a global fashion capital. One from Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, hangs over the front door: ''Bryant Park became the beacon of what New York fashion stands for -- an industry that's fearless, tireless and always moving forward.''
 And yet few have missed the symbolism that this move away from Bryant Park is happening at a moment when the garment district, from 34th to 40th Streets between Broadway and Ninth Avenue, is in a profound state of decline.
 Manufacturers who made their homes there selling buttons, trims, fabrics and threads, making samples, producing dresses and suits in factories along the side streets, have been disappearing at an alarming rate over the last decade. Most of the production of clothes moved to cheaper factories overseas long ago. The recession, and pressure from landlords who want to convert factory buildings into luxury apartments, hotels and office space, has caused more of them to flee the district.
 And now go the tents, the most visible image of the work that still goes on in the neighborhood. 
 ''It's sad that the tents are moving because they do validate the garment center,'' said Nanette Lepore, who produces 85 percent of her collection within five blocks of her office. ''The tents give you an image of strength.'' Ms. Lepore, along with designers like Anna Sui and Yeohlee, have been leading a ''Save the Garment District'' campaign for more than a year in response to city proposals that would end protective zoning for its manufacturers.
 ''I love the fact that Bryant Park was where they chose to do the shows because I love the garment center,'' Ms. Sui said. ''And to this day, we still wheel the racks to the show ourselves.''
 Although it was once the largest source of manufacturing jobs in the city (representing more than 200,000 workers in the 1970s), there was little respect then for New York fashion in the rest of the world. Apart from a handful of major brands, very few New York designers had been exposed to an international audience, and hardly any had stores overseas. 
 That is, not until the designers decided to show their collections together in a central location, as a major media event, as their counterparts in Paris and Milan had done for decades. Their first season, in which virtually every major designer showed in the park, drew coverage from CNN, CBS, NBC, the BBC, VH-1 and MTV. Now organizers of Fashion Week typically receive 3,000 requests for media credentials each season. 
 ''Fashion in the '80s in New York was still very provincial,'' said Stan Herman, the designer who was president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America at the time. ''We had designers, but we had no cohesiveness. We were just a way station for fashion.''
 The catalyst for banding together was a Michael Kors show, in 1991, in a raw Chelsea loft, when the booming music caused the walls to shake and a big chunk of the ceiling to fall onto the runway, clipping Suzy Menkes, the fashion editor of the International Herald Tribune, on her well-regarded head. She made only brief mention of the incident in her review. But, angered that no one seemed to take it very seriously, she slammed the chaotic disorganization of the New York shows in comments to Women's Wear Daily. 
 ''She called us second-raters,'' Mr. Herman said. ''Everybody looked at each other and said, 'We've really got to do something about this.' She was one of the few editors from Europe who came to America.''
 Persuading the designers to show in one place, however, was as much of a challenge as securing the use of the park, a task that fell to Fern Mallis, who was then the executive director of the council and the person widely credited with conceiving the event. She described a meeting at which several young but reluctant designers kept asking whether Calvin Klein had agreed to show there. Mr. Klein happened to be in the room and announced his support. 
 ''This was the most important thing we could do for our industry,'' Ms. Mallis said. ''It was the right moment for American fashion.'' But Ms. Mallis has also faced criticism.
 As the event grew larger, from 42 shows under 2 tents and inside the New York Public Library in 1993 to more than 65 in 3 tents this season (hundreds more designers show independently), corporate sponsorship took on more prominence. Sponsors like Mercedes-Benz, Olympus, General Motors, M.A.C., Evian, Fiji, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, Delta, the Bermuda Department of Tourism and Kohler, the toilet maker, paid handsomely to feature their products and messages in the limelight of Fashion Week. In 2001, the fashion council sold its runway operations to IMG, the global marketing company. That, in turn, led to sniping that Fashion Week had come to resemble a trade show, or a car dealership. Many of New York's marquee designers now show their collections elsewhere.
 THE complaints may be somewhat unfair. What is not often noted is how closely the explosion of marketing noise around Fashion Week mirrored the increasing globalization and corporate slickness of fashion itself over the last two decades. Without a lot of money and marketing behind them, it is harder for new designers to construct and produce a small collection on their own. ''It's important to maintain the dream that it is possible to become a designer,'' Ms. Sui said. ''But how do you do that? The only thing that made it possible for me was that I had accessibility to this area and really figured out my resources.'' If the local button-makers and fabric suppliers and factories all close, she said, ''everything cannot just be available over the Internet.''
 Can Lincoln Center, already associated with so many things besides fashion, ever give fashion designers the same sense of belonging as did Bryant Park? It bothers many of them no end that their craft is perceived a lesser (if not the least) form of art, that the costume galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art are in the basement, or that an appreciation of style is often remarked upon as a liability to politicians, athletes and intellectuals.
 Designers are making the best of it.
 ''When you think of Lincoln Center, you think of the arts, the music, the dance and the opera, so I think being there will elevate and celebrate fashion as an art,'' said Donna Karan, who happened to be the very first designer to have a runway show in Bryant Park when the tents opened on Halloween in 1993. Many of her peers, in interviews and in the comments plastered on the front of the tents, repeated the belief that Lincoln Center will legitimize them, not just as designers, but as artists.
 Not one of them mentioned that the new location is home to another seasonal event that takes place under a big tent, one that is perhaps an even more apt metaphor for Fashion Week. 
 That is, of course, the Big Apple Circus.

HEADLINE: Shares Toss and Turn for Most of the Day

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A heap of uncertainty greeted Wall Street on Wednesday, setting the stage for an up-and-down day that left investors searching for a sense of direction.
 Back-room wrangling over the European debt crisis, talk of a stimulus exit plan from the Federal Reserve and snowstorms in the New York City area collided to help send shares modestly lower, draining the energy of a boisterous rally the day before.
 Expectations of blizzard conditions kept many traders home and led to a day of light trading, which usually heightens market movements. 
 Adding to the uncertainty, there was no clear resolution to the debt crisis in Europe, where deficits in Greece and other struggling countries threaten the stability of the Continent's monetary union. Diplomats tried to reassure investors that a plan was afoot, but that did not seem to rid the markets of anxiety. 
 Further complicating the picture, the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, outlined plans to wean the American economy off extraordinary stimulus efforts.
 By day's end, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,038.38, after rising 1.52 percent the day before -- its largest gain in three months. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.39 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,068.13, while the Nasdaq index fell 3 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,147.87.
 It was a day of volatility. Stocks fell in early trading, but by afternoon the major indexes were hopping in and out of positive territory. Banks and other financial firms were in the only sector to post gains; JPMorgan Chase increased 1.25 percent, and Wells Fargo rose 1.76 percent.
 Much of the focus was on Europe, where conflicting headlines and stern denials dampened expectations that the Continent's wealthier nations would move swiftly to help Greece pay back its debt and avert a broader crisis.
 But investors on both sides of the Atlantic said they were still confident that European leaders would eventually work out a rescue plan. The leaders of the 27 European Union countries are scheduled to meet on Thursday.
 ''Investors are wanting to get some sense of stability -- some sense that the problems in Greece and Portugal and perhaps Spain are not going to spread and pull down the entire euro zone, and with it the global economy,'' said Bruce A. Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company. 
 European markets eked out small gains. The FTSE 100 in London closed 0.39 percent higher, the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 0.63 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.69 percent.
 The euro slid against the dollar, reaching $1.3736, after making gains during Tuesday's rally. 
 In the United States, investors were shaken by signs that the government might begin to reduce emergency stimulus efforts.
 In written testimony intended for a House hearing, Mr. Bernanke signaled that short-term interest rates would eventually rise and the Fed would need to rein in costly programs to buy assets like mortgage-backed securities and even vast sums of Treasury bonds and notes.
 While Mr. Bernanke did not provide a firm timetable, and his comments offered little in terms of new information, his words still rattled investors, who have quaked at any talk of withdrawing the very efforts that have helped fuel the market's fast-paced rise in the last year.
 ''There is a moment of reckoning coming where we learn if the economy, without any artificial stimulation, is as strong as it seems to be,'' Randy Cass, founder of the investment research firm First Coverage, said. ''The market is evenly divided between those who think the growth is real and sustainable, and those who believe that once the artificial enhancers are taken away, it will stumble.''
 Also weighing on the market was a report on the trade deficit in the United States, which widened more than expected as demand for imports surged. 
 The deficit was $40.2 billion in December, up 10.4 percent from November. That was far greater than Wall Street's expectations of a $35.8 billion gap.
 In the bond market, the price of the 10-year note fell 12/32, to 97 14/32, while the yield rose to 3.69 percent, from 3.65 percent.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of the 10-year note:

HEADLINE: Museum Creates New Jerusalem Divide

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
In a dispute that reflects the religious and political divides in this contested city, representatives of long-established Palestinian families petitioned the United Nations on Wednesday for help in trying to stop Israel and the Simon Wiesenthal Center from constructing a museum on part of a centuries-old Muslim cemetery.
 It was the latest challenge to the Center for Human Dignity -- Museum of Tolerance being built here by the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. The project has been plagued by stinging criticism and other problems since 2004, when the sponsors began digging up a 50-year-old parking lot built over part of the cemetery. 
 At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday, Palestinian campaigners, represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit organization in New York, presented their arguments for preserving the burial site, known as the Mamilla Cemetery, or in Arabic, Ma'man Allah. News conferences were also held in Geneva and Los Angeles.
 In Jerusalem, Jamal Nusseibeh, son of the prominent Palestinian philosophy professor Sari Nusseibeh, said at least one of his ancestors was buried in the cemetery, which lies in what is now the predominantly Jewish western part of the city.
 The cemetery, he said, is ''part of the very rich fabric of Jerusalem.'' The thought that anyone would want to wipe it out, he said, was ''very hard to understand.''
 Sixty Palestinians who say they are descendants of those buried in the cemetery have signed the petition, including Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Arab studies at Columbia University, and Abdul Qader Husseini, son of the late Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian leader in Jerusalem.
 The petitioners have asked the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, the director general of Unesco and other United Nations officials to act urgently to stop the desecration of ancient graves and to declare the cemetery a protected heritage site.
 Much of the cemetery has already been swallowed by development in recent decades. Israel built the parking lot over some of it in the 1960s. A school, a road and a large park now cover other parts. 
 Construction in Jerusalem is always accompanied by historical excavation. In the case of the museum, after ground was broken in 2004, excavators found evidence of layers of graves dating from the 11th century. A total of 250 skeletons were exhumed, and 200 more graves were exposed. The excavators estimated that the site held some 2,000 graves in all. 
 Responding to the latest protests, Rabbi Marvin Hier, the dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a statement: ''The Museum of Tolerance project is not being built on the Mamilla Cemetery. It is being built on Jerusalem's former municipal car park, where every day for nearly half a century, thousands of Muslims, Christians and Jews parked their cars without any protest whatsoever from the Muslim community.''
 Rabbi Hier added that Israel's Antiquities Authority had determined that there were no longer any bones or remains on the site, where infrastructure work was under way. The remains found there have been interred in a nearby Muslim cemetery, he said.
 In 2008, after three years of deliberations and noting that no objections had been filed when the parking lot was originally built, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the museum project could go ahead. The case against it was brought by a Muslim group backed by Sheik Raed Salah, the leader of the fiery northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel.
 Supporters of the museum said then that the fight was a political ploy by Muslim extremists trying to gain a foothold in the center of West Jerusalem. The Palestinian campaigners have argued that it is about respect for the living and the dignity and sanctity of the dead.
 Adnan Husseini, the Palestinian Authority governor of Jerusalem, said he could not understand how an American institution accepted the idea of building a museum ''on the bodies of others.'' 
 The museum, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Web site, is intended to confront issues like ''global anti-Semitism, extremism, hate, human dignity and responsibility, and promoting unity and respect among Jews and people of all faiths.''
 Almost everything about the project has been disputed.
 When the parking lot was built, for example, Israel said it got authorization from a Muslim cleric who said that a Muslim cemetery lost its sanctity if it was not in use for 37 years. The last burials in Mamilla were probably in the 1930s.
 But in a letter to Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and critic of the museum project, Ahmad Natour, the president of the Shariah High Court of Appeals, Israel's religious court for Muslim issues, stated that the sanctity of Muslim cemeteries was ''eternal'' and ''cannot be changed until Judgment Day.'' He added that the cleric in question, at the time he ''authorized'' the parking lot, was enmeshed in charges of criminal fraud, and that he was convicted. 
 The architect Frank Gehry, who drew the original designs for the museum, recently withdrew from the project after the Simon Wiesenthal Center said it needed to redesign the museum to reflect new economic realities. After a colleague was quoted as saying the project was ''politically sensitive,'' Mr. Gehry said publicly that his withdrawal was not for political reasons but because his staff and resources were committed to other projects.

 CORRECTION:
A picture last Thursday with an article about Palestinian efforts to halt the construction of the Center for Human Dignity -- Museum of Tolerance by the Simon Wiesenthal Center because it would occupy part of a centuries-old Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem was published in error. The photograph showed several graves in a section of the cemetery that will not be affected by the construction.

HEADLINE: Journey Through Paperwork Greets Russians Hoping for a European Getaway

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The winter holidays have only just ended here, but many Russians are already planning their next European getaway, buying plane tickets and reserving hotels. 
 They are also compiling bank statements, gathering insurance forms, paying fees, taking photographs, making photocopies, waiting in long lines and being interrogated by embassy officials -- all to receive a European visa, a kind of permission slip to enter the rest of the Continent that like little else underscores the walls still dividing Russia from the West. 
 While Estonians and Bulgarians, Latvians and Poles can traipse about Europe unimpeded by the borders and bureaucracy that once bound them to Moscow, Russians must seek permission. To obtain a visa is frustrating and at times degrading, travelers here say, leaving many wondering why Russians seem so unwelcome. 
 ''Maybe Russia is just too big, or maybe it is because of our past conflicts,'' Mikhail Poponin, 21, a professional skateboarder, said while lining up in subzero temperatures outside the Estonian Embassy for a visa. ''Maybe they just think that Russia is a backward country.'' 
 In Russia, internal restrictions on foreign travel melted away with the Soviet collapse, and the freedom to go abroad, especially to the 27 countries of the European Union, is cherished. The European Union, however, has been a reluctant host. 
 Russian officials have been pressing their European counterparts for years to at least ease restrictions on Russian travelers. The visa issue has attracted renewed attention in recent weeks as European officials have suggested that they are now willing to consider doing so.
 The Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said in a visit to Moscow that Spain, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, would use its position to push for a less restrictive visa policy. 
 European officials have made similar promises in the past, though most have gone unfulfilled. 
 A visa to enter the European Union can cost as little as $50, but it is not the money that tends to bother many Russians. It is the suggestion that perhaps Russians could be up to no good. Travelers must provide bank statements showing they can afford the vacation. They must show proof of employment and hotel reservations and plane tickets purchased beforehand, the implication being that every applicant is a possible illegal immigrant. 
 But after asking for extensive amounts of paperwork, the Europeans end up rejecting very few applicants.
 Europeans (as well as Americans) have to obtain visas to enter Russia, but the process for getting a basic tourist visa often is much simpler. An interview, for example, is not required.
 ''The current visa regime represents a clear illustration of the fact that Russia and the European Union are actually not the partners that they often declare themselves to be,'' said Arkady Moshes, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. ''For the common Russian citizen, nothing more clearly represents this lack of partnership like the visa regime. It is not just symbolic. It really affects people.'' 
 The European Union now includes former Warsaw Pact countries like Poland and Romania. But most galling to many Russians is the need to get permission to enter Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, former Soviet republics that are also now European Union members. In Soviet times, all three countries were freely visited on weekend outings and family vacations. 
 Albina L. Marshalkina, a 70-year-old pensioner, traveled by slow economy trains two days to Moscow from her home Veliki Novgord to apply for a visa at the Estonian Embassy. The train ride, along with piles of paperwork, fees and a weeklong wait for a visa now separate Ms. Marshalkina from her daughter and grandchildren in Estonia. A tense political relationship between Estonia and Russia has made any unilateral easing of the visa process unlikely. 
 ''They are there and we are here, and it is so difficult for us to go there and expensive,'' she said, bundled against a frigid wind outside the embassy. ''I am not concerned with what is going on in Estonia. Let them solve their own problems, but let us see our children and grandchildren. Open the border.'' 
 The reasons for keeping the visa policy in place vary. For one, there is little political will in Europe to change it. While citizens of the European Union also need a visa to go to Russia, few are rushing to get there. 
 Many European member countries also have serious misgivings about large numbers of Russians freely entering the bloc, said Fernando M. Valenzuela, the head of the European Union delegation to Russia.
 ''We know that all these visa things are connected to issues of illegal immigration, or organized crime and drug trafficking, et cetera, '' he said. 
 While the Spanish government seeks to raise the issue within the European Union during its presidency, he added, no discussion of the matter has begun.
 Europe is certainly not the only destination for Russians with wanderlust. Turkey and Egypt are hugely popular travel spots, where Russians can easily get visas at the airport. Israel lifted all visa restrictions for Russians in 2008. 
 Still, people are willing to put up with the process of getting to Europe, where many now conduct business. But the hassle can be trying. 
 ''I need to immediately go on a business trip and I have a visa, but my assistant, who I need to bring with me, has to wait six days for a visa,'' said Vladimir Drigant, 60, who was at the French Embassy visa center helping his grandson with a tourist visa for a separate trip. 
 Later, Mr. Drigant's grandson walked by, looking dejected. He did not have photocopies of all 37 pages in his passport as required, and he was told to come back another day.

HEADLINE: U.S. Penalizes Companies Tied to Iran Corps

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Wednesday on a commander and four companies linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, underscoring the Obama administration's determination to single out the elite corps as a way to curb Iran's nuclear program. 
 The Treasury said it froze the assets of four affiliates of a sprawling construction conglomerate owned by the Revolutionary Guards, as well as those of Gen. Rostam Qasemi, who oversees the companies, because they are accused of being involved in Iran's effort to manufacture nuclear weapons.
 The designations, which come two and a half years after the United States first imposed sanctions on the corps, illustrate the scope and limitations of the president's pressure campaign.
 As the administration marshals support for new United Nations sanctions against Iran, it plans to publicly single out an array of companies, banks and entities controlled by the Revolutionary Guards to highlight the extent to which the organization controls the Iranian economy.
 But the Guards have found ways to circumvent existing sanctions by setting up subsidiaries and front companies that allow the organization to continue to deal with banks, shipping companies and suppliers outside Iran. The latest measures are meant to close those loopholes.
 In this case, the conglomerate, Khatam al-Anbiya, has been under Treasury sanctions since 2007. A senior administration official said the company had dug a network of underground tunnels that house elements of Iran's nuclear program.
 The new sanctions are aimed at four entities that handle mining and engineering projects on behalf of Khatam al-Anbiya, including some with links to the nuclear program. They are Fater Engineering Institute, Imensazen Consultant Engineers Institute, Makin Institute and Rahab Institute.
 ''As the I.R.G.C. consolidates control over broad swaths of the Iranian economy, displacing ordinary Iranian businessmen in favor of a select group of insiders, it is hiding behind companies like Khatam al-Anbiya and its affiliates to maintain vital ties to the outside world,'' said the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, Stuart A. Levey.

HEADLINE: Needing Some Good News, The L.P.G.A. Adds a Sponsor

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The L.P.G.A. said Wednesday that Kia Motors America would sponsor its newest tournament next month, welcome news after a rough 2009, when the tour lost events, sponsors and top management. 
 Kia, a South Korean automaker that has a growing presence in the United States market, also formed a partnership with Michelle Wie, the most recognizable player on the tour. Wie will become the official spokeswoman for the company and have the Kia name on her golf bag.
 The L.P.G.A. declined to say how much the deals were worth. But as title sponsor of the Kia Classic, Kia will help cover the cost of the event, which will be held next month at La Costa Resort and Spa Golf Course near San Diego. J-Golf, a South Korean broadcaster, will also pay for part of the event, which has a $1.7 million purse.
 The deals, which were first reported by Sports Business Journal, further solidified the link between the L.P.G.A, South Korean companies and South Korean and Korean-American players. Last year, the tour signed a record five-year televisions rights deal with J-Golf, which will broadcast L.P.G.A events in South Korea.
 Signing Kia also represents a sign of recovery for the tour, which has been plagued by turmoil the last two years. There will be 26 L.P.G.A.-sanctioned tournaments this year, eight fewer than in 2008. Several sponsors, including, Anheuser-Busch, left because of the weak economy; prize money declined as well.
 The L.P.G.A. reduced its staff to save money and Carolyn Bivens resigned as commissioner, one year before her contract was to expire. Bivens drew fire for instituting a policy that would have penalized foreign-born players if they did not speak English. That policy was dropped.
 Bivens's replacement, Michael Whan, has worked to stabilize the association's finances. He brought in Wegmans, the grocery store chain, to replace McDonald's as the sponsor of the L.P.G.A. Championship in June. And a new event, the Sybase Match Play Championship, will be held in Gladstone, N.J., in May. Hana Bank will sponsor another event in South Korea.
 Over all, sponsorship revenue is slightly ahead of last year.
 ''From a business perspective, three-quarters of the way through last year, we had hit bottom,'' said David Higdon, a spokesman for the association. ''Now, it couldn't be more of a reverse.''

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Several Gambles in Bid to Defuse Nuclear Standoff With Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama adds economic pressure and military containment to force Iran's leadership to negotiate on its nuclear program, he is taking three big bets on his ability to defuse an increasingly tense confrontation.
 Each will be a test of phase two of his engagement effort after a year in which little in his dealings with Iran has gone the way that the White House expected.
 Mr. Obama's first bet is that he can accomplish what President George W. Bush tried, and failed, to do: to win global agreement on a set of sanctions that are strong enough to convince Iran's divided leadership that its nuclear ambitions are not worth the price. But for Mr. Obama, that effort is complicated by the fear that sanctions could crush a resilient antigovernment movement that appears on the verge of taking to the streets again. 
 His second gamble is that he can win over the reluctant Chinese, by convincing them that sanctions are a better alternative than the instability and oil cutoffs that would very likely arise if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities. Mr. Obama's own aides concede that they have diminishing hopes of winning that argument with China. 
 And finally, Mr. Obama is relying on his ability to dissuade Israel from carrying out an attack, as it did in 2007 when it destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction in Syria. For now, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while worried that Mr. Obama may go soft on Iran, seems to believe that the Iranian government is so fragile that truly harsh sanctions might crack it. But Iran's announcement in recent days that it was raising its enrichment of uranium to a level much closer to weapons-grade may well change that calculation.
 ''The next step is sanctions,'' Mr. Obama said bluntly during a brief news conference at the White House on Tuesday, just before the Treasury Department named several companies belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the protector of the government and overseer of part of the nuclear effort. ''They have made their choice so far, although the door is still open.''
 Domestic politics, as well as global strategy, lie behind Mr. Obama's new stress on the ''dual-track'' approach -- backing up a year of futile diplomatic outreach with the threat of yet another round of sanctions. Other elements of the strategy that the White House does not discuss publicly are: the placement of antimissile defenses in four countries around the Persian Gulf, and stepped-up covert action against the country's nuclear program. 
 But his aides are still countering arguments, dating from the 2008 campaign, that his determination to engage Iran was naive from the start. Instead, they argued that it would be impossible to exert real pressure on Iran now unless Mr. Obama made a bona fide effort to conduct a sustained dialogue with a country that Washington has only talked to in fits and starts over the past 31 years. 
 ''He had to build up political capital,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, who was the State Department's lead Iran negotiator during Mr. Bush's second term, and who argued -- unsuccessfully -- for a strategy similar to the one Mr. Obama has pursued. ''The reality is that Iran is more isolated today because of this strategy, and because of their own behavior, than they were a year ago.''
 But ''isolating'' a country diplomatically does not necessarily translate into changing its behavior. North Korea, Cuba and Myanmar have been economically isolated for decades, with little effect.
 ''The history of sanctions suggests it is nearly impossible to craft them to compel a government to change on an issue it sees as vital to national security,'' said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''They can affect a government's calculations, but it's no solution.''
 That was certainly the Bush administration's experience. Starting in 2006, the United States led the drive at the United Nations Security Council to pass ever escalating economic sanctions. 
 The list of sanctions is now six pages long. But none have accomplished the central goal: forcing compliance with the Security Council's demand that Iran halt uranium enrichment. Mr. Obama's team acknowledges the potential political liability of passing a fourth round that proves equally ineffective. Some are scaling back expectations for what they once called ''crippling sanctions.'' 
 ''This is about driving them back to negotiations,'' said one senior official, ''because the real goal here is to avoid war.''
 Still, Mr. Obama is moving with characteristic caution. During the campaign he raised the specter of cutting off refined petroleum supplies to Iran, which cannot refine enough oil to keep cars rolling and factories running. But Mr. Obama has backed away from that step, at least for now, for fear of the popular backlash it could set off. 
 ''What you've been hearing on the streets is 'Death to the dictator,' not 'Death to America,' '' one of Mr. Obama's top strategists said in an interview in December. ''We'd be foolish to do anything to change that.'' 
 Mr. Obama's second challenge is to get the Chinese to agree to any real sanctions at all. To overcome China's traditional allergy to sanctions, Mr. Obama has sent aides to Beijing to convince Chinese officials that there is something worse than sanctioning Iran: letting war break out between Israel and Iran.
 They have described the prospect of oil cutoffs in the Persian Gulf, and instability that would threaten China's daily shipments if Israel believed Iran was nearing nuclear weapons capability and attacked. They have tried to convince the Chinese that their business links to Saudi Arabia -- which is deeply worried about Iran's rising military power -- are more valuable than links to Tehran.
 But so far the Chinese are unmoved. Given the tensions between Beijing and Washington on other issues -- currency rates, cyberattacks, arms sales to Taiwan, a forthcoming meeting between Mr. Obama and the Dalai Lama of Tibet -- Beijing appears in no mood to cooperate. 
 Top officials -- from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, to the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones -- have visited Israel to argue that they should give sanctions time.
 The Israelis, officials report, now seemed convinced that the Iranian government is fragile, and that the sanctions might work. They have indicated, with no promises, that they will back off for a while.
 Mr. Haass, who has called in recent weeks for more active American support of the protesters in Iran, returned from Israel in recent days convinced that Mr. Obama had some time. 
 ''I think we can get through 2010 without a military strike,'' he said. ''But 2011 could be more dicey.''

HEADLINE: Bernanke's How-To on the Fed's Plan to Tighten Interest Rates Lacks a When

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''At some point.'' ''At the appropriate time.'' ''When the time comes.''
 On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, outlined a strategy -- but not a timetable -- for scaling back the extraordinary measures it began taking in 2007 to prop up the economy as financial markets teetered on collapse. 
 The Federal Reserve has eased borrowing by lowering short-term interest rates to nearly zero and built up a $2.2 trillion balance sheet by scooping up assets like mortgage-backed securities and even vast sums of Treasury bonds and notes. 
 Eventually, to avoid inflation, both actions will have to be reined in. But Mr. Bernanke, in a 10-page statement, provided few hints as to how long that period will be. 
 ''Although at present the U.S. economy continues to require the support of highly accommodative monetary policies, at some point the Federal Reserve will need to tighten financial conditions by raising short-term interest rates and reducing the quantity of bank reserves outstanding,'' he wrote. 
 ''We have spent considerable effort in developing the tools we will need to remove policy accommodation, and we are fully confident that at the appropriate time we will be able to do so effectively.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke, however, did provide new details of a major concern: how, as the recovery proceeds, to gradually shrink the balance sheet, which along with a vast array of assets also includes $1.1 trillion that banks are holding with the Fed. 
 Mr. Bernanke suggested that a new policy tool -- the interest rate on excess reserves, which the Fed began paying in October 2008 -- would be a vital part of the Fed's strategy.
 Increasing that interest rate, he said, will have the effect of pushing up other short-term interest rates, including the benchmark fed funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
 It is even possible, Mr. Bernanke said, that the Fed ''could for a time use the interest rate paid on reserves, in combination with targets for reserve quantities,'' to communicate its policy stance to the markets. Since 1994, the fed funds rate has been the much-watched centerpiece of statements by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's crucial policy-making arm. 
 Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, which requested Mr. Bernanke's statement, noted on Wednesday that many in Congress never approved of the Fed's extraordinary actions in the first place. 
 ''An intervention creates an artificial condition in which the system becomes increasingly dependent on government action,'' he said in a statement. ''As with any addiction, an altered state is created where the only choices are permanent addiction or a sometimes painful withdrawal.''
 For days, economists have been trying to forecast what Mr. Bernanke would say about the sequence of steps and the combination of tools the Fed will use to tighten credit. On that subject, Mr. Bernanke offered only hints of his thinking. 
 ''One possible sequence would involve the Federal Reserve continuing to test its tools for draining reserves on a limited basis, in order to further ensure preparedness and to give market participants a period of time to become familiar with their operation,'' he wrote. 
 ''As the time for the removal of policy accommodation draws near, those operations could be scaled up to drain more significant volumes of reserve balances to provide tighter control over short-term interest rates. The actual firming of policy would then be implemented through an increase in the interest rate paid on reserves.''
 But Mr. Bernanke suggested that ''if economic and financial developments were to require a more rapid exit from the current highly accommodative policy'' -- that is, if fears emerge about inflation -- the Fed ''could increase the interest rate paid on reserves at about the same time it commences significant draining operations.''
 Along with raising the interest rate on reserves, Mr. Bernanke discussed three other options for draining reserves. The first involves reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities from its portfolio with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date.
 The second involves term deposits -- similar to certificates of deposit -- to banks. That would convert part of the banks' reserves into deposits that could not be used for short-term liquidity needs and would not be counted as reserves.
 A third tool involves redeeming or selling securities. That strategy could carry risk, as the Fed's large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities is helping to prop up the housing market and keep mortgage-interest rates low.
 As part of its special lending programs to inject liquidity into the market, the Fed modified its discount window -- the traditional program for direct lending to banks -- to make terms more generous and to make nonbanks eligible for borrowing. That effort is winding down, and Mr. Bernanke said that ''before long, we expect to consider a modest increase in the spread'' between the discount rate -- the rate at which the Fed directly lends to banks -- and the fed funds rate. He emphasized that the change ''should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy.''
 Mr. Bernanke's statement elicited mixed views from economists. 
 Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, said that despite Mr. Bernanke's efforts to be reassuring, the prospect for serious inflation was real. ''We could go from here to hyperinflation, basically overnight, because we've increased the basic supply of money by a factor of three,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kotlikoff also was skeptical about Mr. Bernanke's proposed solution. ''The Fed printed more than $1 trillion in new money and then went out and handed it to the banks, and now they're trying to bribe those banks not to actually release it into the public stream -- that's what these interest rates on reserves are,'' he said, adding, that that interest also amounted to a free subsidy to banks. 
 Ricardo Reis, an economist at Columbia University, was more sympathetic, describing Mr. Bernanke's actions as innovative and necessary.
 ''The Fed can now return to having a 'boring' balance sheet with mostly government securities as assets, and bank reserves and cash as liabilities,'' he said. ''The increase in reserves plus the payment of interest on reserves -- two innovations of the past two years -- are good things. They should remain.''
 Mr. Bernanke did note that the balance sheet would shrink on its own, over time, as assets like mortgage-backed securities and debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prepaid or mature. ''In the long run, the Federal Reserve anticipates that its balance sheet will shrink toward more historically normal levels and that most or all of its security holdings will be Treasury securities,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Black Leaders Push Obama for Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama promised civil rights leaders on Wednesday to push hard and work with Congress to address the high unemployment rate, particularly among the urban and rural poor.
 But Mr. Obama and the three other black men who met with him for more than an hour in the Oval Office did not focus on programs for African-Americans or limit their talks to issues of concern primarily to blacks, participants said. 
 Instead, the group -- which included Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Marc H. Morial, president of the National Urban League; and the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network -- discussed how the economic crisis was affecting all manner of poor people.
 ''In these times, it didn't make sense to talk about race-based initiatives,'' Mr. Jealous said in an interview after the meeting. ''It made more sense to target poor areas.'' He added, ''When you're on the ground, the poor black community is the same as the poor white community.''
 Some black scholars, editorial writers and others have criticized Mr. Obama for not specifically aiming programs at African-Americans hard hit by the recession. But as he did today, Mr. Obama has said that broader efforts to help the disadvantaged will also benefit blacks.
 The meeting was the only item on an otherwise empty calendar at the White House on Wednesday, as Washington was hit by heavy snow and high winds. Dorothy Height, chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women, had planned to attend the session but was unable to make it.
 Mr. Jealous and Mr. Sharpton said much of the conversation involved how to get Republican leaders to support Mr. Obama's jobs proposals. Mr. Sharpton said that he had recently spoken with Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, about getting Republican Congressional leaders to meet with civil rights leaders to talk about passing jobs legislation. 
 Mr. Obama has proposed using $30 billion of repaid bailout loans to help community banks increase lending to small businesses, part of a broader effort to stimulate job creation as the unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent, and around 15 percent for blacks. 
 But critics say the plan is misguided because community banks have enough capital already but are not lending readily because they have trouble finding worthy borrowers. Some Republicans have criticized the plan because, under current law, repaid bailout money is supposed to pay down the deficit.
 Mr. Obama wants Congress to change the law. Administration officials argue that most if not all of the money will eventually be repaid, meaning the $30 billion would have relatively little impact on the deficit over time.

HEADLINE: The Grotesque Vocabulary in Congo

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BUKAVU, Congo 

 BODY:
 I've learned some new words.
 One is ''autocannibalism,'' coined in French but equally appropriate in English. It describes what happens when a militia here in eastern Congo's endless war cuts flesh from living victims and forces them to eat it.
 Another is ''re-rape.'' The need for that term arose because doctors were seeing women and girls raped, re-raped and re-raped again, here in the world capital of murder, rape, mutilation. 
 This grotesque vocabulary helps answer a question that I've had from readers: Why Congo? After a previous visit to eastern Congo, a reader named Jim D. objected. ''Yes there are horrible things happening in Africa,'' he wrote on my blog. ''None are anything we can do anything about by ourselves.'' 
 ''My question is why do you not concentrate on this nation's poor,'' he asked. ''Yes, Africa suffers, but you need to look in your own house first.''
 Jim D. has a legitimate complaint, echoed by other readers: We have enormous needs at home, and we shouldn't let foreign crises distract us from them. 
 But do we really need to say that we can't address suffering in Congo or Haiti, or anywhere else, because we have our own needs? Particularly when the Congo war has claimed so many lives (perhaps more than six million), isn't it time for the U.S. to lead a major, global diplomatic push for peace?
 Sometimes it's said that women and children bear the brunt of the brutality in Congo. That's not quite right; a United Nations official estimates that the population here in South Kivu Province is 55 percent female because so many men have been executed. Women are less likely to be killed but more likely to be tortured.
 So can anything be done about this abattoir, or is Jim D. right that it is just one more tragedy to which we must wearily resign ourselves?
 One answer is simple: Some people are already showing that it is possible to make a difference here. International Rescue Committee is helping rape survivors recover. The World Food Program averts starvation with its food distributions. And Eve Ensler, author of ''The Vagina Monologues,'' is working with Unicef to build a City of Joy here to train women -- some of them shattered by war -- to transform their communities. City of Joy will teach legal rights, self-defense and skills for economic empowerment, and a team of female construction workers is helping build it right now.
 ''The intention is to transform pain into power,'' explained Christine Schuler Deschryver, who manages the project in Congo.
 As for whether it is possible to end the war itself, it helps to understand why Congolese civilians are subjected to autocannibalism and re-rape. It's not just mindless savagery. Rather, after talking to survivors and perpetrators alike over the years, I've come to believe that the atrocities are calculated and strategic, serving two main purposes.
 First, they terrorize populations and shatter traditional structures of authority.
 Second, they create cohesiveness among the misfit, often youthful soldiers typically employed by warlords. If commanders can get their troops to commit unspeakable atrocities, those soldiers are less likely ever to return to society.
 So don't think of wartime atrocities as some ineluctable Lord of the Flies reversion to life in a natural state but as a calculated military strategy. We can change those calculations by holding commanders accountable.
 A four-step approach would be:
 Pressure on Rwanda to stop funding its pet Tutsi militia in Congo. Rwanda also should publish a list of those facing criminal charges for its 1994 genocide so that more Hutu militiamen not on the list might go back. A Rwandan war shouldn't be fought in Congo.
 An international regime to monitor mineral exports from Congo so that warlords do not monetize their militias by exporting minerals through Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. Legislation to do this, backed by an advocacy group called the Enough Project, is pending in Congress.
 A major push to demobilize Rwandan Hutu fighters and return as many as possible to civilian life in Rwanda or settlements in Congo or Burundi. That should be coupled with a crackdown on leaders in Congo and those who direct action from Europe and the United States. 
 A drive to professionalize the Congolese Army and end the impunity for murder, torture and rape, starting with the arrest of Jean Bosco Ntaganda on his warrant for war crimes.
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to eastern Congo last year was a landmark, but it needs more follow-up from the Obama administration. What is required isn't some new formula but much greater political will. Otherwise, the fighting will go on for years to come -- and this lovely, lush land will spawn even more horrific vocabulary.

HEADLINE: E-Book's Cost Is Going Up

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and BRAD STONE

 BODY:
In the battle over the pricing of electronic books, publishers appear to have won the first round. The price of many new releases and best sellers is about to go up, to as much as $14.99 from $9.99.
 But there may be an insurgency waiting to pounce: e-book buyers.
 Over the last year, the most voracious readers of e-books have shown a reflexive hostility to prices higher than the $9.99 set by Amazon.com and other online retailers for popular titles. 
 When digital editions have cost more, or have been delayed until after the release of hardcover versions, these raucous readers have organized impromptu boycotts and gone to the Web sites of Amazon and Barnes & Noble to leave one-star ratings and negative comments for those books and their authors. 
 ''This book has been on the shelves for three weeks and is already in the remainder bins,'' wrote Wayne Fogel of The Villages, Fla., when he left a one-star review of Catherine Coulter's book ''KnockOut'' on Amazon. ''$14.82 for the Kindle version is unbelievable. Some listings Amazon should refuse when the authors are trying to rip off Amazon's customers.'' 
 The angry commenters on Amazon and online message boards could just be a vocal minority. But now, with e-books scheduled to cost $12.99 to $14.99 under new deals that publishers negotiated with Apple and Amazon, a broader swath of customers may resist the new pricing. The higher prices will go into effect within the next few months.
 Predicting the behavior of consumers is always tricky. In the case of e-books, publishers are hoping that a vast majority of people who have not yet tried e-reading devices will not have any expectation of the low pricing now available from Amazon and others, including Barnes & Noble and Sony. They argue that new e-book shoppers will welcome the chance to buy digital editions at a level significantly lower than the typical price tag on a hardcover book.
 ''With the iPad, the whole notion of e-book reading is probably going to become way more mainstream than it ever has,'' said Harvey Chute, who runs KindleBoards, a popular discussion forum for readers of electronic books. ''And a majority of people may be coming to it new, and may only see that they are getting $7 off the price they would see at a bookstore.''
 But some e-book buyers say that since publishers do not have to pay to print, store or distribute e-books, they should be much cheaper than print books. 
 ''I just don't want to be extorted,'' said Joshua Levitsky, a computer technician and Kindle owner in New York. ''I want to pay what it's worth. If it costs them nothing to print the paper book, which I can't believe, then they should be the same price. But I just don't see how it can be the same price.''
 Just what e-books are worth is a matter of debate. Publishers argue that printing and distribution represents a small proportion of the total cost of making a book. 
 ''There are people who don't always understand what goes into an author writing and an editor editing and a publishing house with hundreds of men and women working on these books,'' said Mark Gompertz, executive vice president of digital publishing at Simon & Schuster. ''If you want something that has no quality to it, fine, but we're out to bring out things of quality, regardless of what type of book it is.''
 To consumers who do not pay much attention to the economics of publishing, though, such arguments are trumped by the fact that e-books have been available for $9.99 for more than a year. 
 ''As far as I'm concerned, Amazon has committed to the $9.99 price,'' said Wilma Sanders, a 70-year-old retiree who has homes in Plymouth, Mass., and Marco Island, Fla. She said that if e-book prices rose, she would stop buying. ''I'm still a library-goer. There are enough good books out there that I don't need to pay more than I want to. I already can't keep up with what I have.''
 Authors have been taken aback by some of the vehemence of the reader protests.
 ''The sense of entitlement of the American consumer is absolutely astonishing,'' said Douglas Preston, whose novel ''Impact'' reached as high as No. 4 on The New York Times's hardcover fiction best-seller list earlier this month. ''It's the Wal-Mart mentality, which in my view is very unhealthy for our country. It's this notion of not wanting to pay the real price of something.'' 
 Amazon commenters attacked Mr. Preston after his publisher delayed the e-book version of his novel by four months to protect hardcover sales. Mr. Preston said he was not sure whether the protests were denting his sales. But, he said, ''It gives me pause when I get 50 e-mails saying 'I'm never buying one of your books ever again. I'm moving on, you greedy, greedy author.'''
 One reason consumers may be sensitive to pricing is that they have so many other types of entertainment to occupy their time. 
 ''Entertainment and media companies keep forgetting that consumers have a choice. They can decide not to buy the book at all,'' said David Pakman, a venture capitalist and former chief executive of the digital music store eMusic. ''They can play a video game, use an iPod Touch.'' He added: ''If you don't get the price tag right and make it convenient, they just go elsewhere.''
 John Wagoner, a 63-year-old accountant and Kindle owner in Plano, Tex., said that if e-book prices went much higher than $13 he would simply commit his time and dollars to other activities.
 ''They're just books,'' said Mr. Wagoner, who left an angry one-star review on the Amazon page for Mr. Preston's novel. ''I do other things other than reading.'' 
 Some analysts say that if consumers balk at price increases, piracy could grow rapidly. 
 Joel Waldfogel, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, saw a comparison with movies, a business where he has studied digital piracy rates. With movies, he said, piracy tends to displace paid consumption. ''The real cost of consuming a movie is the two hours of undivided attention you spend,'' Mr. Waldfogel said. ''If people are able to steal a bunch more, they will purchase less, simply because there isn't time to do all of it.''
 Similarly, with books, he said, ''I would be scared to death about a culture of piracy taking hold. I wouldn't mess around with price increases.''
 Publishers say price levels are not settled by any means and that now, having reached agreements where publishers -- rather than retailers -- set consumer prices, they have an opportunity to test different situations. 
 ''We may introduce a book at $14.95 for a year and then move the book to $9.99 when we would have put out the trade paperback edition,'' said Dominique Raccah, chief executive of Sourcebooks, an independent publisher. ''I suspect you're going to see a fair amount of experimentation.'' 
 Some e-book buyers are not interested in experiments. Mr. Fogel, who left the one-star review of the Kindle edition of Ms. Coulter's novel, said he would not pay more than $9.99 for a book.
 ''There are too many very, very good books I haven't gotten around to reading yet,'' said Mr. Fogel, a 68-year-old retired management consultant. He added that publishers were likely to see ''supply and demand turn back on them.''
 ''I think there's going to be a general resentment'' of higher prices, he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Producer Prices Jumped Sharply in January

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The rate of inflation at factories and other producers more than doubled last month in China, with producer prices climbing at the fastest pace in 15 months while the money supply continued to grow briskly. 
 The sudden acceleration partly reflects the low level of commodity prices a year ago during the depths of the global financial crisis, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
 But the acceleration in prices at the factory gate was also the latest indication that China might be forced to continue tightening controls on bank lending, economists said. 
 The Chinese government typically does that through some combination of administrative controls on the volume of bank loans as well as higher interest rates for bills issued by the central bank.
 Producer prices were up 4.3 percent in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday morning. In December, the increase from a year earlier was just 1.9 percent.
 As recently as October, China was still experiencing gradual deflation at the producer level.
 However, consumer prices were up 1.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with a year-over-year increase of 1.9 percent in December, in a sign that factories and stores had not yet tried to pass on increases to retail customers.
 A broad measure of money supply, M2, grew 26 percent in January from a year earlier, China's central bank announced separately on Thursday.
 Rising prices in China could lessen tensions somewhat between the United States and China over the balance of trade between the two nations.

HEADLINE: Latest Data Hints at a Recovery in World Trade

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Export and import statistics released Wednesday for the United States and China offered the latest signs that world trade was starting to recover from the global financial crisis. 
 China said its exports climbed 21 percent in January from a year earlier, while imports surged 85.5 percent. The healthy jump in exports could fuel further calls from the United States and the European Union for China to break the peg of its currency, the renminbi, to the dollar and allow the renminbi to appreciate.
 In the United States, foreign demand for American goods like meat and auto parts increased in December. Exports rose 3.3 percent, to $142.7 billion, continuing an upward trend. That was not enough, however, to offset the 4.8 percent increase in imports, which totaled $182.9 billion. The increase in imports suggested that American businesses and consumers were growing more confident about spending. 
 ''That's consistent with the rebound in manufacturing activity,'' said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas. ''Companies have to increase production to meet demand, and that requires a lot of imported goods, so in the near term we will probably see further widening.''
 Over all, for December, the gap between the value of American imports and exports was $40.2 billion -- its highest level in a year -- up 10.4 percent from November. Wall Street analysts had expected the deficit to grow to $35.8 billion.
 The larger-than-expected trade gap could mean that the government will have to revise its estimate for economic expansion in the fourth quarter of last year. Last month, the government said the economy expanded at a rate of 5.7 percent from October to December -- the fastest pace in six years -- aided by a narrowing gap between imports and exports. 
 A weak dollar has made American products, like airplanes and microchips, cheaper for many foreign buyers. ''Exports will continue to be boosted by better economic conditions abroad,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
 A surge in exports helped narrow the politically important trade gap with China, which retreated 10.3 percent.
 Oil imports rose sharply in December, contributing to the swelling trade gap, reaching $28.1 billion, from $24.4 billion in November. 
 In recent months, steep rises in oil prices have often been a central reason for the widening trade deficit. But that was not the case in December. Prices increased only slightly in December -- up 66 cents to $73.20 a barrel -- indicating that much of the growth in imports was the result of businesses simply importing more oil. Excluding petroleum goods, the trade deficit in December was little changed from November. 
 China's exports have recovered more rapidly, partly because the low value of the renminbi has kept Chinese goods relatively inexpensive in foreign markets. The rebound has been so rapid in fact that some factory executives in the Pearl River delta region near Hong Kong have begun complaining of shortages of steel containers in which to ship their goods. Container shipping companies have begun to raise rates and remove discounts.
 ''With the export recovery taking hold more strongly, the outlook for export manufacturing, ports and container shipping sectors appears to be brighter, compared to last year,'' Jing Ulrich, the chairman of China equities and commodities at J.P. Morgan, said in a research note.
 China's imports in January rose impressively, in line with economists' expectations, because imports a year ago were so weak. Many Chinese export factories nearly stopped buying raw materials then as their orders dried up, but they have been restocking since late spring.
 Exports and imports both benefited this year from the timing of Chinese New Year, which will be Sunday. It fell on Jan. 26 last year, and a weeklong holiday at the end of January last year helped curtail economic activity in China.
 The China trade surplus was $14.17 billion last month, compared with $18.43 billion in December and $39.1 billion in January of last year, according to figures released Wednesday by the General Administration of Customs in China.

HEADLINE: When Children Are Overweight, Changes for the Whole Family

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
AS Michelle Obamareminded us this week, the forces behind childhood obesity are insidious.
 Parents are busy. Fast food is cheap and easy (and children love it). Technology can help keep children sedentary. Children's TV networks advertise junk food. Two-thirds of adults are overweight. And on and on.
As a result, one of three children in this country is overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Overweight children are at risk of developing serious and costly health problems that used to be primarily the province of middle-age adults, like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. A recent C.D.C. study found that 22 percent of overweight (and 43 percent of obese) young people had, abnormal blood lipid levels, like high triglycerides, which are risk factors for heart disease. 
 And how is this a ''Patient Money'' topic? 
 For starters, obesity is expensive. People who are overweight tend to have more chronic illnesses than those who are not, and those illnesses can require intense medical attention. 
 And while Ms. Obama's campaign to address childhood obesity focuses on influences outside the household, parental intervention is important, too -- home economics, in other words. That can include making good choices about what goes on the grocery list and on the table, as well as finding and paying for the right professional help, when necessary. 
 The United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts, reported in January that some specific obesity programs were effective. The task force recommends that children aged 6 to 18 have their body mass index -- B.M.I. -- measured and, if they are found to be overweight, be referred to a weight-loss program. 
 Comprehensive weight-loss programs for children can be scarce and expensive, though, and many insurers provide scant coverage for obesity treatment. But parents can begin their own intervention programs, making changes that do not cost a lot of money and will pay off over the long term. 
 ''The family is the underutilized weapon in the fight against childhood obesity,'' says Dr. David Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital Boston. 
 FACE THE FACTS Parents are often lovingly blind when it comes to their children. What seems like harmless baby fat to you may be problem pounds for your child. 
 Anthony Brookins, a single father in Boston, saw that his son, Kris, was a little plump but figured ''he'd grow out of it.'' 
 But when Mr. Brookins noticed a dark ring around his son's neck, he took Kris -- then 11 -- to the doctor and learned that his son was 30 pounds overweight. That ring was a sign he had early-stage Type 2 diabetes. 
 ''I was shocked,'' Mr. Brookins said.
 Your pediatrician can tell you your child's body mass index -- a formula that considers height, weight, age and gender -- at the annual checkup. Many public schools also routinely screen children and send home explanatory notes to parents. You can also plug your child's stats into the B.M.I. calculator on the C.D.C.'s Web site.
 Your child is considered overweight if he or she falls in the 85th to 94th percentiles of the B.M.I. growth charts, and obese if he is in the 95th percentile or higher. If your child is over the 85th percentile, it is important to address the problem quickly. 
 And for children, weight loss is not quite so daunting. 
 ''It's easier for kids to lose weight than for adults,'' says Dr. Ludwig, who is also the author of ''Ending the Food Fight'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007). ''Because children are still growing, they may only have to keep their weight the same, or slow the rate of growth to reduce their B.M.I.''
 GET NUTRITION ADVICE ''Most families are under a high degree of stress,'' said Dr. Sandra G. Hassink, director of the Pediatric Weight Management Clinic at the A. I. Dupont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del. ''They rely on convenience and fast foods to help them cope with time and other constraints.'' 
 Unfortunately, children who eat fast food tend to consume more total calories, drink less milk and eat fewer fruits and vegetables and less fiber than those who do not, according to a study published in the January 2004 issue of the medical journal Pediatrics. 
 To begin changing your family's habits, consider seeing a registered dietitian who can evaluate the family's eating patterns and give you recipes for healthy low-cost meals. 
 Call your insurer to find out whether it will cover dietitian visits for children. Some do. 
 If you pay out of pocket, it will cost from $50 for a simple consultation to as much as $250 if the dietitian is working with multiple family members and developing a month's worth of menus, according to the American Dietetic Association.
 Ask your pediatrician if there are programs at local hospitals or schools. Comprehensive weight-loss programs can be scarce and expensive, and there is no central clearinghouse for them. (If you want to consider that path, call the large hospitals in your area and ask if they have such a program or can refer you to one.) But local hospitals sometimes offer effective ones on a smaller scale. 
 New York Hospital Queens, for instance, offers Fit Kids, which counsels families on nutrition and offers exercise classes for children three days a week -- all at no cost.
 When Kris Brookins was found to have insulin resistance, his pediatrician referred him to the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children's Hospital Boston. The program, which helps families find coverage through their insurers or by other means, says it doesn't turn anyone away. 
 In the Children's Hospital program, Kris and his dad learned about nutrition and portion sizes. Kris gave up pizza and fried-chicken meals and began eating more steamed vegetables and fish. The changes helped Kris reduce his B.M.I. by 20 percent over the course of a year, while also helping the family reduce its food budget. 
 ENCOURAGE ACTIVITYChildren are less active than they used to be. They now spend, on average, 7 hours and 38 minutes each day using computers, iPods and cellphones and watching television, according to a January report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
 To help reverse the trend, parents can set a limit on how much time children spend sitting in front of the television or using their computers for entertainment. The Kaiser report found that when parents set limits, ''children consumed nearly three hours less media per day than those with no rules.''
 As an alternative, make sure your children have something fun and active to do with their free time. Families can consider joining the local YMCA, which is typically more affordable than a gym and offers more programs for children. And it helps to be in the habit of taking your children outside to play more often. ''When I ask parents at my clinic, 'Does your child ever go outside?' I get 'no' a lot,'' Dr. Hassink said. 
 When outdoors is not an option, become inventive. Buy a fold-up Ping-Pong table. Or maybe dance or exercise to your children's favorite music for half an hour before dinner. 
 A FAMILY AFFAIRIt is nearly impossible for your child to change habits if the rest of the family does not. You cannot reasonably tell a child he is allowed only one soda a week if you keep two-liter bottles of Coke and Sprite in the refrigerator. 
 ''Without the help of parents, we are setting a child up for failure,'' says Dr. Anthony Porto, a pediatric gastroenterologist at New York Hospital Queens and the director of the Fit Kids program.
 Most children reactwell to change, Dr. Porto says, as long as they do not see it as a punishment. If you explain to your children that by eating better and exercising more, they will have more stamina to play sports and will take fewer trips to the doctor, your children may actually embrace your healthy lifestyle plan.

HEADLINE: Greek Civil Servants Strike Over Austerity Measures

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and NIKI KITSANTONIS

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
Striking civil servants brought public services to a halt across Greece on Wednesday, in a largely peaceful one-day protest against the tough austerity measures officials have said are necessary to stave off a mounting financial crisis. 
 Greece has been under intense pressure from other members of the European Union to cut its huge budget deficit and is in danger of failing to refinance some $28 billion in debt coming due in April and May. Fears of default in Greece and other struggling European countries have roiled financial markets around the world in recent weeks.
But the Greek government's proposals for deep spending cuts to rein in the deficit have met significant resistance. 
 ''We won't pay for their crisis!'' loudspeakers blared from Klafthmonos Square, otherwise known as ''the square of the crying people,'' where disenchanted Greek workers have come for centuries to express their discontent. ''Not one euro to be sacrificed to the bankers!''
 In Greece, commentators said the economic problems had exposed a general ignorance about the harsh realities of the global economy, while laying bare the strong sense of entitlement in a country where one out of three Greeks is employed in a civil service that guarantees jobs for life. 
 ''People in other countries like Germany, France and the United States learned about the workings of the economy the hard way, by seeing their jobs on the line,'' said Babis Papadimitriou, an economic analyst at the Skai radio and television group. ''This hasn't been the case in Greece.''
 But relatively modest public demonstrations Wednesday -- one in the square and another nearby -- were tinged with a sense of resignation that megaphones were no match for volatile financial markets. 
 Indeed, even many of those protesting said they realized they needed to make sacrifices, or risk falling over what Prime Minister George Papandreou, a Socialist, called the ''edge of the cliff'' last week. Others expressed hope that the European Union would rescue their proud democracy from becoming the next Iceland.
 ''We feel humiliated and we understand that things cannot remain the same as they were before,'' said Vasiliki Revithi, 56, a biochemist at the National Organization for Medicines, noting that a monthly cut of about $950 to her salary would mean no new car and cheaper makeup. ''But we gave the world democracy, and we expect the European Union to support us.'' 
 The crisis in Greece is a credibility test for the euro zone, the 16-nation bloc where a one-size-fits-all monetary policy has underlined the challenges of managing disparate economies during an economic downturn. Last week, the anxieties spread to Portugal and Spain, where investors increasingly fear that bloated budgets will not be slimmed. Late last year, Greece stunned investors by saying that its government deficit would be 12.7 percent of its gross domestic product, not the 3.7 percent the previous government had forecast earlier.
 The government of Mr. Papandreou appears determined, however belatedly, to challenge a national consensus in which the state has been expected to provide for its citizens from cradle to grave. 
 ''We are ready to take any necessary measures to make sure the deficit goal is met,'' he said after meeting with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, on Wednesday.
 The government has announced $2.75 billion in public spending cuts. It also aims to raise another $6.87 billion from new taxes and measures aimed at fighting tax evasion, which analysts said deprived the federal budget of $44.2 billion last year. It has frozen salaries, increased the average retirement age among men and women to 63 by 2015 and introducing a higher gas tax. 
 While the changes have hardly been embraced, analysts said they believed that Wednesday's strikes would not expand into widespread social unrest, provided that the government's austerity measures produced results. The measures have been approved by the two main political parties. Passage appears certain in Parliament, where the Socialists hold more than half the seats.
 Yannis Stournaras, director of the Greek Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, a leading economic analysis group, argued that a majority of Greeks realized that the future of the country was at stake. 
 ''Greeks would rather see their wages reduced for a few years than to lose their deposits at the bank,'' he said. ''No one wants for the country to commit suicide.'' 
 He also expressed cautious optimism that European Union leaders, who are to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss Greece's economic woes, would not allow the country to default because the credibility of the euro zone as a whole was at stake. 
 ''If the markets turn bad and deprive Greece of liquidity, we can end up with another Lehman Brothers in which the failure of a coordinated response led to collapse,'' Mr. Stournaras said. ''It will open a Pandora's Box. The question is who would be next, a small country or a big country. If it's a big country, then the euro will be in big trouble. I don't believe European leaders will allow this to happen.'' 
 Analysts said that Mr. Papandreou was determined not to be the first Greek prime minister since World War II to bring the country to economic disaster. 
 But whatever the political will, however, some economists cautioned that Greece remained at the mercy of investors. Michalis Massourakis, chief economist at a major bank in Athens, Alpha Bank, said the government's austerity measures -- and the tepid response from Brussels thus -- had not been sufficiently swift to ease jittery investors.
 Noting that the government needed to balance the need for swift action with public sentiment, he added, ''The government's reforms have not kept up with the expectations of the market, because this is not something that can happen in a democracy.''

HEADLINE: Top Pay List For Bankers: Fresh Names

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The list of the biggest earners in finance usually reads like a Who's Who of Wall Street. But these days, it reads more like a Who's That?
 It turns out that some of the highest-paid financial executives in America work far from the canyons of Lower Manhattan, at companies that have largely avoided the outcry over the return of hefty paydays on Wall Street. 
 Topping the list is John G. Stumpf, head of Wells Fargo, the bank based in San Francisco, according to an analysis of 2009 compensation in the industry. Mr. Stumpf was paid a personal best of $18.7 million in cash and stock for 2009 -- up 64 percent from 2007, just before the financial crisis struck. 
 Mr. Stumpf is making twice as much as Lloyd C. Blankfein, his counterpart at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Blankfein -- who for many Americans has come to symbolize this new period of Wall Street riches -- was paid $9.7 million for 2009, less than some expected. 
 It is a stunning reversal in the old pecking order of pay. Big names on Wall Street like Mr. Blankfein usually take home far more than staid bankers like Mr. Stumpf, whose bank's biggest business is making home mortgages and loans to corporations.
 But since the bailout, the rules of banker pay are bending. Some of the industry's biggest names are being paid less than relative unknowns. Chief executives, who are usually at the top of the pay heap, are taking home roughly the same amounts as executives who work for them -- and sometimes less. 
 Mr. Stumpf and other executives have moved up the pay ladder partly because the likes of Mr. Blankfein have moved down. And for all the focus on what top executives earn, what is most startling is how many six-, seven- and eight-figure sums are being awarded to Wall Street bankers and traders whose pay often is unnoticed -- if it is disclosed at all. 
 How much senior executives earn, in cash and stock, is made public in corporate filings. This year, the results are surprising, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. 
 Leaders in the pay sweepstakes include the heads of the credit card giants Visa, Mastercard Worldwide, Capital One Financial and American Express. Joseph W. Saunders, who runs Visa, was paid about $15.5 million, a figure that vastly eclipses the compensation for top executives at Bank of America and Citigroup. 
 Ajay Banga, the president of MasterCard Worldwide; Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of the giant money management company BlackRock; and Richard B. Handler, the boss at the Jefferies Group, a midsize investment bank that is virtually unknown outside financial circles, were each paid about $13 million. Executives at certain discount brokerages, insurance companies and regional banks were close behind. 
 The big money, as ever, is in Wall Street trading. But pay for employees with few executive responsibilities is typically exempted from disclosure requirements. Brokers and asset managers also land windfalls that are often undisclosed. 
 ''There are probably thousands of people that are in the Millionaire Club -- or even the Ten Millionaire Club -- that have gotten no heat,'' said Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant. 
 To be sure, a handful of prominent companies dominate the well-paid list. Senior managers from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs occupy many of the top spots. Few of those executives are boldface names, however. 
 While Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, appears to be the second-highest-paid banker, at $17.6 million, one of his subordinates collected nearly as much: Ina R. Drew, JPMorgan's chief investment officer.
 Ms. Drew, whose correct calls on interest rates helped the bank earn several billion dollars of profit, was paid about $13 million.
 Despite the spotlight on Mr. Blankfein's pay at Goldman, little was said about how much Gordon Nixon of Royal Bank of Canada received. His paycheck was roughly the same amount as Mr. Blankfein's, $9.7 million, though he is hardly a household name. 
 The Equilar analysis provides an early peek at 2009 pay and is not a comprehensive review. For consistency, any stock or options that were subject to performance hurdles were valued at the target levels; in practice, many executives receive larger payouts for surpassing the company's financial goals. 
 Wells Fargo posted strong results, even as it struggled to contend with rising mortgage and commercial real estate losses and accepted a bailout from the government in 2008. 
 As it rebounded last year, the bank dribbled out the details of its large stock grants for Mr. Stumpf. In August, Wells announced that he would receive $900,000 in salary and about $6.5 million in various types of restricted stock. On New Year's Eve, Wells issued a statement saying that Mr. Stumpf would receive another allotment of so-called performance shares -- worth up to $15.4 million. 
 That means his pay package could easily top $24 million in a year in which Wells was among the last of the big banks to repay the bailout money. 
 ''We believe we have the very best leadership team in financial services today, and a key to retaining that talent for the long term is to compensate our senior leaders competitively and to align their interests with those of our shareholders,'' Stephen W. Sanger, who leads Wells Fargo's compensation committee, said in a statement last December. 
 On pay, Wall Street seems to have reverted to its old ways. James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's new chief executive, could receive $11 million to $13 million, even though the company posted an annual loss. 
 Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said that Mr. Gorman received that compensation because, as president, he was responsible for integrating the vast Smith Barney brokerage unit and was the prospective chief executive.
 Bank of America's highest-paid executive was the chief architect of its ill-fated acquisition of Merrill Lynch, Gregory L. Curl. He was awarded more than $9.2 million in stock, most of which will be paid out monthly over the next three years.
 Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America's new chief executive, will be paid about $6.1 million, thanks to a similar large stock grant.
 Jefferies Group, a midsize investment bank that had a strong year, rewarded its top executives handsomely. And more pay is coming down the pike. In mid-January, Mr. Handler received a $39 million stock grant and another executive received about $29 million. The stock award, subject to certain performance goals, is payable over the next three years and will come on top of any salary and bonuses the executives get.
 One of the highest-compensated financial executives for 2009 was paid well when he was employed -- and then even more when he quit. After leaving Visa in July, Hans Morris, the company's president, collected an exit package valued at $24 million. 
 ''The ride is essentially over, and he is still getting grants,'' said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant.

HEADLINE: The Challenge of China

 BODY:
Relations between the United States and China have turned chilly in recent months as the two countries wrangle over Taiwan, Tibet, Iran and China's continued manipulation of its currency. 
 President Obama is right to press Beijing to behave more responsibly -- toward its own people and internationally. China is certainly pushing its sense of grievance too far and underestimating the fear and resentment its growing power is provoking in Asia and the West. 
 There is little hope of progress -- on the global economy, global warming or Iran's nuclear ambitions -- unless Washington and Beijing work harder to manage their differences. 
 President Obama's decision last month to sell Taiwan $6.4 billion in helicopters, Patriot missiles and other defensive items elicited a particularly harsh reaction: Beijing has publicly threatened to punish American arms companies that sell to Taiwan, presumably by cutting off access to China's huge market. 
 The sales could not have been a surprise to China's leadership. Mr. Obama told President Hu Jintao of his intentions at their summit in November in Beijing. The arms were part of a package approved by former President George W. Bush, and Mr. Obama left out the most controversial items: F-16 jets and diesel submarines.
 Rather than encouraging Taiwan's independence, as Beijing claims, the arms sales will give Taiwan's president, Ma Ying-jeou, the confidence to continue his efforts to improve relations with the mainland. It is absurd for China to think that any Taiwanese leader would not want to bolster his country's defenses when Beijing is modernizing its arsenal and stationing more than 1,000 missiles across the Taiwan Strait. 
 Beijing's threat to punish American companies is a dangerous game, especially at a time when criticism is rampant -- around the world and on Capitol Hill -- about China's unfair trade practices.
 Beijing is also complaining bitterly about President Obama's planned meeting this month with the Dalai Lama, warning it would ''damage trust and cooperation'' between the two countries. American presidents have regularly met with the respected Tibetan religious leader. And China's leaders would have more chance of calming tensions in Tibet if they sought serious compromise with the Dalai Lama, who has advocated greater autonomy for the region, not independence, as Beijing speciously claims.
 China is alienating not only the United States but also France, Britain and Germany by resisting tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran. Beijing's view is frustratingly shortsighted. Any conflict over Iran's nuclear program would drive up oil prices and disrupt China's purchases.
 The Obama administration is smart to try to line up backup suppliers for China -- talking to Saudi Arabia and others -- as part of its bid to get Beijing to support tougher sanctions. 
 The administration also was smart not to overreact when Beijing declared that the Taiwan arms sales will ''cause seriously negative effects'' on contacts and cooperation between the two countries. Administration officials expect the Chinese to cancel some high-level meetings. But they say they are working to ensure that midlevel military exchanges continue and that this year's summit in Washington with President Hu goes forward.
 American officials say they see signs that Beijing doesn't want to push things too hard. Outside experts worry that China may overplay its hand. That would not be in anyone's interest.

HEADLINE: Arizona, in Switch, Pulls Out Of Regional Emissions Plan

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
Citing financial worries, the State of Arizona has backed out of a broad regional effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the West through a cap-and-trade system. 
 In an executive order issued last week, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said a cap-and-trade system -- which would impose mandatory caps on emissions and allow pollution credits to be traded among companies -- would cripple Arizona's economy. 
 Instead, the state will support initiatives to expand the use of solar power, nuclear power and other renewable energy sources, said Benjamin Grumbles, the head of the state's environmental agency. 
 ''The governor thought it was important to be clear and honest and let the W.C.I. partners know that we don't think that now is the time to implement a cap-and-trade program,'' Mr. Grumbles said, referring to the regional effort, the Western Climate Initiative. 
 ''Green and grow is our approach now,'' he said.
 The governor's decision was reported Thursday by The Arizona Republic.
 The Western Climate Initiative is made up of seven Western states -- Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington -- and four Canadian provinces. Its regional cap-and-trade program is set to begin on a limited scale in 2012. 
 For now, California is the only state in the group that is poised to open a cap-and-trade marketplace by 2012, but the coalition has said it hopes the program will be in full force by 2015. 
 The caps would apply to 90 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted by the states and provinces. The group's goal is to achieve a 15 percent reduction from 2005 emissions levels by 2020.
 In the first regional cap-and-trade effort in the United States, a coalition of 10 Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states making up the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative similarly aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent by 2018. 
 Such regional efforts are viewed as a means of compensating for the halting nature of the federal government's steps toward instituting a full regulatory system for greenhouse gases.
 Arizona, a founding member of the Western initiative, plans to maintain its voting status within the group, Mr. Grumbles said.
 Although it is best known for its cap-and-trade plans, the initiative also promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency, efforts the state will continue to support, Mr. Grumbles said.
 Environmental groups criticized Arizona's decision to back off on the cap-and-trade element. ''It's ridiculous and sad and embarrassing all in one,'' said Sandra Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's chapter in Phoenix. ''We think that all the tools should be on the table for reducing emissions.''
 ''Arizona is one of the parts of the country that's going to suffer the most,'' she said. ''Hotter and drier -- that's not what we need.''
 Laura E. Sanchez, a lawyer with the National Resource Defense Council's air and energy program, also called the move a step backward. But she said it would not necessarily deal a major blow to the program. 
 ''It's a state by state rollout -- each state has to go through their process of getting their cap-and-trade proposal implemented,'' she said. ''I don't necessarily think any one state's actions will have an effect on another state's actions.''
 Mr. Grumbles maintained that Arizona would continue to embrace a long-term clean energy strategy. 
 ''The governor believes that Arizona can become the solar powerhouse of the nation,'' he said. ''So we are absolutely committed to advancing the solar industry, as well as wind and geothermal.''

HEADLINE: A Frigid Hamptons Market Thaws to Lukewarm

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
PRESIDENTS' DAY weekend is when New Yorkers typically take advantage of the three-day break to: a) fly somewhere warm; b) hit the slopes; or c) look at houses in the Hamptons.
 If you answered ''c,'' you've probably already booked a weekend full of appointments to find a desperate seller ready to make a deal, or a summer rental before the best decks and pools get snapped up.
 So how is the Hamptons real estate market doing, a year after freezing solid?
 A lot better than many people expected. Sales picked up significantly in the second half of 2009, as sellers dropped their prices and buyers made more realistic -- as opposed to ''lowball'' -- offers. 
 But even though list prices have fallen from the lofty levels homeowners once hoped to get, actual sales figures have not dropped off a cliff. The median sales price of a Hamptons home was $825,000 last year, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal company that compiles market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman. Although that's down 15 percent from the peak of $975,000 in 2007, it's only a 3 percent decline from 2008 and roughly where prices were in 2006.
 ''If you had asked me last year at this time where the market was going, I would have said: 'Do you have a spare room? I might need to move in,' '' said Paul Brennan, regional manager for Douglas Elliman's Hamptons office. ''But disaster has not happened. We did much better in '09 than we ever would have anticipated.''
 According to Miller Samuel's data 409 homes sold in the Hamptons in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with 145 in the first quarter, with a steady pick-up in between. The year ended with 1,124 sales, still quite a dip from the roughly 2,300 deals done annually in the Hamptons between 2000 and 2007.
 As Mr. Brennan pointed out, the current figures represent contracts that were signed in the summer and fall, since there is a lag before deals close. And since the busy second half of the year reversed the typical pattern -- which usually sees a flurry of deals early in the year so buyers can settle in before summer -- he is not sure the recent burst of activity will hold up.
 ''Right now I'm not seeing the same strength in the market,'' he said. ''But rentals seem to be active, and that's a good sign.''
 Other brokers agreed with that assessment of the rental market, saying they've been getting calls from clients interested in looking at houses in December and January, which is usually a slow time. Presidents' Day weekend typically kicks off the search for a summer home, though agents say they've even had midweek showings recently as some renters jump the gun.
 Rick Hoffman, Corcoran's regional senior vice president for the East End, said he expected prices for summer rentals to be in the same range as last year, which was not the usual bonanza for landlords -- despite rents in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many renters could only afford a Hamptons escape for a month instead of the usual Memorial Day to Labor Day contract, and it was not uncommon for renters to ask for and sometimes get 20 percent or 30 percent discounts.
 ''I think landlords realize last year was a difficult season, and they're not trying to raise prices,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''And we're advising them not to.'' 
 Whether prices will be as negotiable as they were last year is anyone's guess, brokers said, although the burst of early interest suggests anyone picky about decor or proximity to the ocean might want to head out to the East End soon.
 But ''if it's just about the money, come late,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''You might find something that no one else wanted, and the landlord may be willing to discount.''
 Early inquiries from renters about the summer season prompted Gerry Logue aggressively to drop the price of the three-bedroom home in Sag Harbor he had been trying to sell since mid-2008. Although he had lowered the price several times, landing at $1,495,000 last fall, it wasn't until he reduced it to $1,195,000 in January that the offers started flooding in.
 ''My goal was to do a major shift to move the house,'' Mr. Logue said. ''When I dropped it, I got tons of interest with multiple offers, and then a deal happened within a week.''
 That deal is now in contract at a price he said he is happy with, though given that he had done a major renovation and is selling the contents too -- including the silverware and towels -- he thinks the buyers are getting a good deal.
 ''It's a huge value for this house,'' Mr. Logue said. ''They can literally show up with their toothbrushes.''
 That kind of turnkey property is what Louise Phanstiel and her husband were hoping to find when they were looking at houses in East Hampton last August. Retirees who live in Los Angeles, they did not want to get involved in a long-distance renovation but found most of the homes they looked at needed a lot of work -- and seemed overpriced.
 ''In my opinion nobody really seemed to price things to move and actually a lot of these homes had been on the market quite a while,'' Ms. Phanstiel said.
 Ultimately they bought a new house in Amagansett that a builder was just completing, for a price she described as fair for both parties.
 ''There were other people bidding on the house, and they were way under bidding it,'' she said. ''We met him at a good point, and he came down a bit, and we got it done.''
 John Gicking, the couple's broker at Sotheby's International Realty in East Hampton, said that flexibility on both sides has been the key to putting together deals in this market.
 ''Buyers are paying a little bit more than they expected, and sellers are accepting a little less than they would like,'' Mr. Gicking said. ''Anytime someone draws a line in the sand -- whether it's a buyer or a seller -- the deal is not getting done.''
 He said most of the deals he has completed recently have gone into contract within 10 percent of the asking price, though he pointed out that some of those homes had earlier price reductions.
 According to Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, that is in line with the 13.5 percent listing discount his firm found in the Hamptons in the fourth quarter -- the range between the sales price and the last asking price.
 Mr. Miller said he expects market activity in the Hamptons to continue at the same level through the spring, kept in check by close to 10 percent unemployment and a tight lending environment.
 ''In many ways the Hamptons is outperforming expectations during the downturn,'' he said, though he does not anticipate Wall Street bankers will swoop in and heat things up. 
 ''Do I think we'll see a little bump in the spring because of bonuses? Sure, that's a seasonal pattern,'' he said. ''But do I think it's going to create some sort of housing boom? No way.''

HEADLINE: If Iran Gets Nuclear Weapons ...

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Iran's Two-Edged Bomb'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 9), Adam B. Lowther proposes five Pollyannaish results of a nuclear-armed Iran. Let me propose a sixth, and far more likely, hellish scenario.
 The Arab regimes in the area, realizing that an American nuclear umbrella would not be completely effective, especially against dirty bombs, become more beholden to Iran, rather than to the United States. This could raise oil prices, make the Palestinians less likely to seek peace and increase the authoritarian nature of Arab regimes. 
 Yes, it would give the American defense industry a shot in the arm, but at an extraordinarily high cost. The risks are simply not worth it.
 The Obama and Bush administrations were correct in concluding that a nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable.
 Alan M. Dershowitz Cambridge, Mass., Feb. 9, 2010
 The writer is a professor at Harvard Law School.
 To the Editor:
 Adam B. Lowther's sunny assessment of a potentially nuclear Iran is dangerously naive. Mr. Lowther does not even mention the nightmarish and very real possibility of the emergence of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. 
 Which is more likely: that the Sunni Arab states rush to the United States for protection, as Mr. Lowther predicts, or that they develop their own nuclear weapons and remain indifferent to the West's calls for reform?
 Further, the idea that common fear of Iranian nuclear arms could help Israelis and Palestinians reconcile after decades of conflict is completely devoid of historical basis. A society as fragmented as that of the Palestinians will not suddenly act collectively like a state and make peace with Israel based on a common enemy. A nuclear Iran will serve only to empower its proxies in Hamas and Hezbollah, each of whom has a stake in perpetual conflict with Israel.
 Ben Linden Washington, Feb. 9, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Adam B. Lowther posits that the prospect of a nuclear Iran will encourage the leaders of the Arab countries to embrace democracy, compel the Middle East to join the United States in defeating Al Qaeda and lead to an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, while also inducing Iranian leaders to act responsibly. This goes against common sense.
 If anything, the region's leaders have reacted against the rise of Iranian power by becoming more repressive, while the appearance of a stronger Iran and a weaker United States can only embolden Al Qaeda and its allies.
 Karim Pakravan Chicago, Feb. 9, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Adam B. Lowther makes the intriguing and counterintuitive argument that a nuclear-armed Iran could be a stabilizing development in the Middle East. He reasons that the enhanced threat posed by an armed Iran will force all players in the region to act more responsibly and cautiously.
 Without judging the merits of Mr. Lowther's thesis, I note its parallel to the argument of our domestic gun lobby that the best way to make America safer is to put more guns in the hands of everyone.
 George Kovac Coconut Grove, Fla., Feb. 9, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Adam B. Lowther chastises ''the autocratic Arab regimes responsible for breeding the discontent that led to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,'' without mentioning the United States' role in protecting those Islamic dictatorships.
 His closing statement -- ''Iran may think its enrichment plans will put fear into the hearts of Americans. In fact, it should give us hopes of a renaissance of American influence in the Middle East'' -- demonstrates how little he appreciates the resentment that American actions have caused in the region.
 If the United States genuinely wishes to increase its regional influence, it should focus its efforts on curbing Israel's extremist and expansionist policies.
 Hamid Varzi Tehran, Feb. 10, 2010
 To the Editor:
 While reading Adam B. Lowther's article, I couldn't help but think of Barbara W. Tuchman's book ''The Guns of August'' and its description of a series of miscalculations by the great powers of the day that led to World War I.
 His argument that a nuclear-armed Iran may be a blessing in disguise to the United States, and even to Israel, seems to be grounded in the premise that Iran is ruled by a regime that makes rational decisions. In the light of its actions, it is a highly questionable assumption.
 A nuclear-armed Iran, with a record of support for terrorist organizations, would hardly be a force for stabilization in the Middle East.
 Frank Shatz Williamsburg, Va., Feb. 9, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Time's Up'' (editorial, Feb. 10):
 The urgent need for stronger sanctions against Iran should be obvious. Yet some key powers have been unwilling to put aside narrow interests and unite in confronting this threat to peace and security.
 It has been two years since the last Security Council sanctions resolution. Iran has ignored that measure as defiantly as it snubbed earlier United Nations and International Atomic Energy Agency actions. Tehran has also spurned overtures by the United States and its partners to resolve the issue. 
 Meanwhile, Iran has stayed the course by concealing uranium enrichment facilities, building a network of tunnels housing a variety of nuclear equipment, and developing long-range missiles. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which is up for renewal this year, is imperiled by Iran's stance.
 One sanction option, often mentioned but not yet carried out, would have direct impact by curtailing Iran's oil imports. Yes, one of the world's top oil producers imports at least 40 percent of its refined petroleum. That is an Achilles' heel if there ever was one, and there are others. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, for instance, has become a state within a state, and its economic interests depend on external links.
 The nuclear clock is ticking. A nuclear Iran would be a global game-changer. It's high time, in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's words, for truly crippling sanctions. 
 Richard Sideman President American Jewish Committee New York, Feb. 10, 2010

HEADLINE: The Dream, Without The Drive

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Entourage written backward doesn't quite spell garmento, but that is the gist of ''How to Make It in America,'' a new series on HBO beginning Sunday that comes from the producers of ''Entourage.'' Here they have reversed the premise to look at guys from the neighborhood who haven't left the neighborhood. 
 Instead of exploiting instant fame and wealth in Hollywood, these New York slackers are dodging creditors and cops, hoping for a break in the garment business, or at least enough cash to pay the rent. 
 Failure isn't as much fun as success, probably because there is so much more of it. Dreams aren't the same as drive, and self-pity is less attractive than hard work. Accordingly, it takes a while to care about Ben (Bryan Greenberg), a mopey Fashion Institute of Technology dropout who folds jeans at Barneys and moons over his ex-girlfriend, Rachel (Lake Bell). His best friend, Cam (Victor Rasuk), has more energy, but he wastes it on lame projects like selling designer skateboards and bootleg leather goods. 
 The two pals have some tenuous fashion and art-scene connections, mostly rich girls with downtown lofts. They have ambition, sort of, but first they have to repay a loan from Cam's cousin, Rene (Luis Guzman), an ex-con who views physical harm as collateral.
 Appealingly, the heroes inhabit a more multicultural milieu than the one on ''Entourage.'' But the grittier, graffiti-and-bodega backdrop is not necessarily as winning as palm trees and swimming pools. ''Entourage'' was a Cinderella story for guys that provided a new and amusingly wry look at show business -- and the culture of young stars and their posses -- through the eyes of losers from Queens who luck out. 
 Twenty-somethings trying to make it, or depressed about not making it, is a more familiar and well-explored subject, from ''Reality Bites'' to ''Clerks.'' Even ''Bored to Death,'' a recent HBO series about Brooklyn slackers, got bored with ennui and put its dope-smoking hero to work as a private detective.
 ''How to Make It in America'' picks up steam as its heroes pick themselves up by their sneaker laces and try to start their own business, in this case a line of retro 1970s designer jeans. Theirs is not a Horatio Alger or even a Ralph Lifshitz to Ralph Lauren business model; this is a recession-era, empire-in-decline morality tale. They can turn a quick deal -- Cam coaxes Ben into helping him move a shipment of leather coats bought off the back of a truck. But persistent effort isn't worth the trouble. 
 Attitude and connections are the best way to make it in America, a point slyly reinforced with visual cues, like a party in a cool Lower East Side apartment on Hester Street, a location that was once a symbol of the immigrant work ethic. At a restaurant a friend introduces Ben and Cam to the designer John Varvatos, and over drinks they wheedle a consultation. Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein were Bronx kids who hustled to apprentice to designers and manufacturers; Ben and Cam hustle to avoid being apprentices.
 ''Everybody has ideas, but nobody wants to put in the work,'' the rich father of a friend tells Cam after Cam tries to sell him on a new venture that he describes as ''Cold Stone Creamery, but for doughnuts.''
 The series has great music (the theme song is Aloe Blacc's ''I Need a Dollar'') and there are some snarky asides about hipster New York. A female friend tries to get Ben interested in a new girl, Jane, saying, ''Oh, she's cute, she has short hair and she writes for Nylon, and she will definitely sleep with you.'' 
 The series takes off when secondary characters fill in the blank spots. Mr. Guzman is poker-faced and quite funny as a small-time mobster in a Dominican neighborhood who buys into a franchise for an energy drink, Rasta Monsta. Ben finds a potential backer when he runs into a high school classmate, David (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a nerd who has reaped a hedge-fund fortune. David, who looks a little like the goofy heir played by Tommy Noonan in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' is worth millions, but he can't get past the bouncer at a hot downtown club, Avenue. Ben, who plays basketball with the bouncer, can, and that is a quid pro quo he can take to the bank.
 Rachel dumped Ben, but she still isn't completely over him, even though she has a handsome new boyfriend, Darren (Jason Pendergraft), a hotelier, and a promising job with an interior designer. Her boss, Edie (Martha Plimpton), perks Rachel up when Rachel returns morose and insecure from a lunch with a college friend who is combating the spread of AIDS in Africa.
 ''Any ambitious do-gooder with airfare can feel like they are making a difference in Africa,'' Edie says airily, waving a joint. ''It's Africa.'' She assures her protegee that the true heroes are the ones helping hard-working New Yorkers make the most out of tiny apartments. ''I still want you to go to Africa and help out,'' she says. ''Just do it on your Christmas break.''
 When Ben shakes his hangdog complacency and gives the jeans project his full attention, ''How to Make It in America'' finds its stride -- not the ''Entourage'' strut but a garment-district shuffle. 
 Any movement is better than idleness. Hard work may not pay off anymore in real life, but it is still the stuff of fiction.

HEADLINE: Prospect of Aid for Greece Gives Wall Street a Boost

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A promise by European leaders to come to the aid of their weaker brethren calmed American markets on Thursday, helping stocks overcome an early wave of pessimism.
 Hopes were lifted on Wall Street as European leaders gathered in Brussels to plan how to help Greece pay its debts and preserve the stability of the Continent's monetary union. 
 In the end, officials offered only vague talk of solidarity and a simple statement: ''There is an accord.'' But after initially scoffing at the lack of detail, investors turned euphoric over the prospect that Europe might be moving toward a formal plan to avert a default. 
 ''Any kind of concrete decisions or news is better than uncertainty,'' Stephen J. Carl, head equity trader for the Williams Capital Group, said.
 Simmering debt woes in Europe have hung over the market since last week, when the situation in Greece became acute. Volatility has permeated global markets in the last few days, as rumors of a plan to rescue Greece were reported, rescinded, confirmed and sternly denied. 
 On Monday, for instance, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below 10,000 points on fears about Europe; on Tuesday, it climbed by the largest amount in three months. 
 ''People aren't sure which way to go,'' said Douglas S. Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. ''They're confident something is going to happen, they're not sure what form it will take.''
 The soothing refrains from Brussels on Thursday helped quell some of the anxiety, as a morning of timid trading gave way to a lively afternoon rally. 
 The major indexes reached a turning point after Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain told reporters that he believed the plan to aid Greece would bring stability to Europe. In addition, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said the European Union would closely monitor Greece's pledges to reduce its deficit.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 105.81 points, or 1.05 percent, to close the day at 10,144.19. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 10.34 points, 0.97 percent, to 1,078.47, helped by gains in energy stocks, while the Nasdaq rose 29.54 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,177.41.
 A better-than-expected report on the United States labor market contributed to the enthusiasm. The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims fell last week by 43,000, to 440,000, the Labor Department said, beating expectations of a 15,000 decline.
 As they try to gauge the strength of the recovery, investors are watching data on unemployment more closely than perhaps any other economic indicator. The unemployment rate fell to 9.7 percent in January from 10 percent in December, but the economy still shed 20,000 jobs. 
 After days of uncertainty, some investors said they were seeking more tangible assurance that Europe's monetary union was not in jeopardy, should Greece and Europe's other struggling nations -- including Portugal and Spain -- flirt with default.
 ''We are not looking for a 1,200-page document -- just a unified front, a sense that everyone has skin in the game,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management. 
 Europe's financial ministers were scheduled to meet on Monday to work out the details of the plan to aid Greece, which will probably be led by wealthier nations like France and Germany. The plan may involve loan guarantees by other countries that use the euro, and it will probably require Athens to continue, or tighten, austerity measures.
 In Europe, markets greeted the reassurance from European leaders with trepidation. The CAC 40 in France dropped 0.52 percent and the DAX in Germany declined 0.59 percent, as investors wondered how the finances of those countries would be affected if they played a central role in helping Greece. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.57 percent.
 The euro dropped to $1.3686 against the dollar.
 In the United States, shares of Philip Morris rose $1.86, or 3.97 percent, to close at $48.67 after the tobacco company reported a $12 billion stock buyback plan. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 99 8/32, while the yield rose to 3.72 percent, from 3.69 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Alexander McQueen, Brazen Designer, Dies at 40

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON and CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Alexander McQueen, the renegade British fashion designer known for producing some of the most provocative collections of the last two decades, was found dead on Thursday morning in his London home, the police there said. He was 40.
 Mr. McQueen's family did not make a statement about the cause of death, but a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said it was not being treated as suspicious. A representative of Mr. McQueen, who would not speak for attribution, said the cause was apparently suicide.
 Mr. McQueen's death stunned the hundreds of international magazine editors and store buyers who had just convened in Manhattan for the first day of the fall collections at New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park.
 Mr. McQueen often showed a dark streak in his collections, commenting on brutality toward women and what he saw as the inanity of the fashion world, and it carried over into his personal life. Though he had an acknowledged history of drug abuse and wild behavior, close friends said they were surprised by the news of his death. He had been deeply affected, in 2007, by the suicide of Isabella Blow, the eccentric stylist who had championed him, and he was said to be devastated by the death of his mother, Joyce, on Feb. 2, after a long illness. 
 ''Creativity is a very fragile thing, and Lee was very fragile,'' said the milliner Philip Treacy, who had worked with Mr. McQueen. He said he last saw the designer two weeks ago, when Mr. McQueen was preparing the fall collection that was to be presented in Paris on March 9.
 ''It's not easy being Mr. McQueen,'' Mr. Treacy said. ''We're all human. His mum had just died. And his mum was a great supporter of his talent.''
 At the beginning of his career, Mr. McQueen became a sensation for showing his clothes on ravaged-looking models who appeared to have been physically abused, institutionalized or cosmetically altered, all while peppering his audience with rude comments. ''I'm not interested in being liked,'' he said. He once mooned the audience of his show.
 But he was enormously creative and intelligent, and he seemed to sense that the fashion industry needed to have its buttons pushed. His fall 2009 collection was the talk of Paris when, reacting to the recession, Mr. McQueen showed exaggerated versions of all of his past work on a runway strewn with a garbage heap of props from his former stage sets. He was suggesting that fashion was in ruins.
 ''The turnover of fashion is just so quick and so throwaway, and I think that is a big part of the problem,'' he said. ''There is no longevity.''
 In his work, Mr. McQueen drew on Orientalism, classicism and English eccentrics, and also his ideas about the future, combining them in ways that were complex and perplexing.
 As designers have done for centuries, Mr. McQueen altered the shape of the body using corsetry and anatomically correct breast plates as a recurring motif. More recently, his work took on increasingly futuristic tones, with designs that combined soft draping with molding, or ones in which a dress seemed to morph into a coat. At his last show, in October, the models wore platform shoes that looked like the hulls of ships.
 Lee Alexander McQueen was born in London on March 17, 1969. His father was a taxi driver; his mother was a social science teacher. His father wanted him to become an electrician or a plumber, but Lee, as he was always known, knew he wanted to work in fashion. His father, Ron McQueen, survives him, as do five siblings.
 Aware of his homosexuality at an early age (he said he knew at age 8), he was taunted by other children, who called him ''McQueer.'' He left school at 16 and found an apprenticeship on Savile Row working for the tailors Anderson & Sheppard and then Gieves & Hawkes. In a story he repeated on some occasions but at other times denied, he was bored one day and wrote a derogatory slur in the lining of a jacket destined for the Prince of Wales.
 By the time he was 21, Mr. McQueen had also worked for Angels & Bermans, the theatrical costume company, and for the designers Koji Tatsuno and Romeo Gigli. He then pursued a master's degree at the Central St. Martins design college, where his graduate collection caught the attention of Ms. Blow. She acquired every piece of that collection and took him under her wing.
 As he struck out on his own, Mr. McQueen was immediately recognized for his brashness. The models in his October 1993 collection walked the runway with their middle fingers extended, and their dresses were hand-printed to appear as if they were covered with blood; some of it looked fresh. He also showed trousers cut so low that they were called ''bumsters.'' Criticized at the time because some did not cover the rear, the trousers were credited with initiating a low-rise trend that eventually caught on with every mainstream jeans maker in the world.
 ''His was a hard show to take, but at least it offered one solution to the identity crisis of London fashion,'' wrote Amy M. Spindler, then the fashion critic of The New York Times.
 In March 1995, at his most controversial, Mr. McQueen dedicated his fall collection to ''the highland rape,'' a pointed statement about the ravaging of Scotland by England. The models appeared to be brutalized, wearing lacy dresses with hems and bodices ripped open, their hair tangled and their eyes blanked out with opaque contact lenses. This had come on the heels of a spring collection that, paradoxically, was full of precisely tailored suits and crisp shirts.
 He was called an enfant terrible and the hooligan of English fashion. The monstrous, sometimes sadistic, styling of his collections became a hallmark, as when he showed models wearing horns on their shoulders. A collection in 2000 was shown on models with their heads bandaged, stumbling inside a large glass-walled room with the audience on the outside as if its members were looking into a mental ward. But many of these motifs were actually based on historic scenes, from the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch to the films of Stanley Kubrick. Mr. McQueen once said he had sewn locks of human hair into his jackets as a nod to Jack the Ripper.
 ''Nicey nicey just doesn't do it for me,'' he said.
 In 1996, Mr. McQueen received an offer from LVMH, the luxury conglomerate, to be the designer of the white-glove couture label founded by Hubert de Givenchy, whose elegant little black dresses had been immortalized by Audrey Hepburn. Mr. McQueen, who succeeded John Galliano in the role, stoked the fires of the French press, however, when he dismissed Mr. de Givenchy's past work as ''irrelevant.'' But the move enabled Mr. McQueen, who had struggled financially, to do something he had always wanted: to buy a house for his mother.
 Though he worked for Givenchy until 2001, his tenure did not produce remarkable notices, other than frequent reports of bickering between him and management. His departure was typically confrontational. He shocked his employers by selling the majority stake of the Alexander McQueen label to LVMH's biggest rival, the Gucci Group. The investment allowed him to show his own clothes in Paris, alongside the major French houses.
 He had since opened stores in New York, London, Milan, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, licensed his name for fragrances and a lower-priced line called McQ, and made collections of sneakers and suitcases for the athletic company Puma. The deal with Gucci, he said, enabled him to turn his company into a commercially successful venture while retaining his design independence. The first shoes he showed for Puma, for example, included an image of his bare foot imbedded in the clear soles, and the suitcase was molded in the shape of a spine.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With U.S. Listings Scarce, Markets Try to Lure Chinese I.P.O.'s

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Last April, when global financial markets were collapsing, a Chinese Web site named Sohu.com made a bold move to spin off its online gaming unit and list it on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 The bet paid off: Changyou.com, the unit, became one of the year's most popular I.P.O.'s, setting off a flurry of Chinese stock offerings that raised more than $55 billion and turned China into the world's No. 1 source of companies going public.
 With that kind of money up for grabs, Wall Street investment banks, in one of their worst dry spells for I.P.O.'s, are scrambling to get more business from China, despite the risks of buying shares of Chinese companies and growing concerns that a bubble may be forming in Chinese listings.
 The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, where the number of I.P.O.'s withered last year from hundreds a decade ago, also are stepping up plans to lure even more Chinese listings to the United States from exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. 
 ''Last quarter was one of the busiest quarters in years,'' Robert H. McCooey Jr., who is in charge of new listings at Nasdaq, said of Chinese listings. ''And my sense is we'll have another strong year this year.''
 Global private equity companies, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, New York hedge fund managers and global investors are setting up joint ventures with the Chinese government or finding other means to vie for a piece of what the American investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. called ''the China miracle.''
 Over the last five years, Chinese companies have raised about $210 billion globally through initial public offerings, according to Dealogic, which tracks global initial public offerings. American companies, by contrast, have raised $184 billion, Dealogic said. The global economic crisis sharply cut the number of new listings in the United States and around the world last year, with the exception of China: In 2009, 11 of the 14 foreign public offerings made on United States exchanges were of mainland Chinese companies, according to Renaissance Capital, which also monitors I.P.O.'s. 
 As the recession ebbs, investors are betting that the market for I.P.O.'s in the United States, Europe and Latin America will rebound this year. But no country is likely to produce more lucrative listings than China, where hundreds of companies are expected to raise tens of billions of dollars going public this year. 
 Just two companies -- the Asian arm of American International Group and the Agricultural Bank of China -- that could go public this year are expected to raise a total of $30 billion to $40 billion, about what American companies raise in a decent year. 
 ''A fund manager with a global portfolio is being reckless if he doesn't have exposure to China,'' says Mark Machin, co-head of Asian investment banking at Goldman Sachs. ''It's going to be the world's second-largest economy.''
 The Carlyle Group, one of the world's biggest private equity funds, said this month that it would join the Beijing municipal government to create an investment fund denominated in renminbi. The Blackstone Group recently set up a venture with the Shanghai government.
 Mr. Ross said he recently invested $100 million in a state-owned Chinese company called Longyuan Electric Power Group before its $2.6 billion listing in Shanghai last year. ''Chinese companies deserve a premium, a multiple over Western companies,'' he said.
 Investors are motivated by stories about how companies like Naspers, a media and entertainment group in South Africa, invested $30 million in Tencent, a Chinese Internet company, for a 36 percent stake in 2001. Today, that stake is worth more than $13 billion. At the same time, performance can be sketchy. The top three initial public offerings listed in the United States last year were Chinese companies, including Changyou.com -- but three of the five worst performers were also Chinese companies with riskier profiles, according to Renaissance Capital. 
 New stock listings have pumped billions of dollars into China, capitalized scores of companies and helped create a class of billionaires. According to Forbes, China had 79 billionaires in 2009, up from just one in 2003. Most of that money is tied to shares of newly listed companies.
 That is one reason Chinese investors -- largely restricted by law to buying on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges -- are also keen on I.P.O. shares, which almost always have a big first-day price increase. 
 In 2009, for example, shares of newly listed companies on those two exchanges jumped, on average, 74 percent on the first day of trading in China. That was the smallest share price increase in three years. In 2007, the average jump was 193 percent. To accommodate the soaring number of smaller Chinese companies interested in going public, China last fall opened a Nasdaq-like stock exchange called ChiNext.
 It has been a huge hit. On its opening day last October, shares of all 28 companies were in such demand that the exchange temporarily suspended trading so investors could catch their breath.
 With domestic I.P.O. listings drying up, American exchanges have been strengthening their ties with China. In 2007, the New York Stock Exchange opened an office in China and has even been loosening its listing standards to lure more Chinese listings to Wall Street.
 That has elicited concern from some analysts who say it could allow lower-quality companies to go public. Critics have long warned about unknowns that already come with investing in Chinese companies: insider trading scandals, the lack of transparency, poor regulatory oversight, volatile prices and a lack of clarity on shareholder rights.
 ''Are you really getting disclosure?'' asked Carl E. Walter, a Beijing-based investment banker and co-author of ''Privatizing China: Inside China's Stock Markets.'' ''Do you really know who the investors are in these companies when they all act through nominees?'' he said, referring to surrogates. Chinese regulators are trying to take steps to deal with market weaknesses here. Late last month, for instance, regulators criticized financial institutions for ''irresponsible'' pricing of I.P.O.'s, saying it had helped fuel stock speculation, even though recent offerings had slumped in early trading.
 In the United States, officials at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which also has been aggressive in recruiting Chinese companies, insist investors have strong protections. 
 ''The N.Y.S.E. lowered the financial requirement -- actually we prefer to say making it more flexible,'' said Michael Yang, the chief representative in China for the New York Stock Exchange Euronext. ''But we never lower down other requirements, including corporate governance, transparency, disclosure, financial report, etc.''
 Mr. Yang said the changes would allow smaller, fast-growing companies to join the exchange.
 Listings on the two exchanges raised $27 billion last year, down from about $31 billion in 2008 and a record $65 billion in 2007. The New York Stock Exchange Euronext's acquisition of the American Stock Exchange in 2008 has also helped attract smaller Chinese companies eager to tap America's investing public.
 Mr. McCooey at Nasdaq said public offerings had helped companies realize their value and their dreams. He points to companies like Sohu.com, which listed on Nasdaq in 2000. The company's shares plummeted to about $35 million in 2002. But in 2008, a lengthy effort to develop the Changyou.com gaming unit began to pay off, creating a casual game so popular that Sohu executives decided to spin it offinto a separate listed company.
 ''I'm relieved,'' said Charles Zhang, the chairman of Sohu, who just ordered a private jet. Sohu still retains a 70 percent stake in Changyou, which is now valued about $1.7 billion. ''I don't have to worry about our gaming strategy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With Redesigned Models, BMW Tries to Unseat Audi

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

DATELINE: ESTORIL, Portugal 

 BODY:
There was not much sign of Portugal's debt crisis as a fleet of shiny gray BMW sedans set out one by one from an elegant seaside hotel near here Thursday morning. As the cars sped through whitewashed coastal villages, the sun broke through low clouds and gray-green Atlantic swells rolled lazily to shore.
 The drivers could press a button that put the new BMW 5 Series cars into ''sport plus'' mode, stiffening the suspension, to better attack the narrow, winding road. What downturn?
 Bayerische Motoren Werke managers are in fact hoping that the relatively balmy February weather east of Lisbon was a better reflection of the state of the global economy than the deficit and political crisis afflicting the country. 
 The redesigned 5 Series, which BMW showed to journalists Thursday, is the beginning of a major model effort that BMW hopes will enable it to reclaim its position as the best-selling premium automaker in Europe -- a spot it lost to a resurgent Audi last year.
 BMW's portfolio for 2010 includes a redesign of the midsize X3 sport utility vehicle, a four-wheel-drive version of the compact Mini, a new Ghost sedan from Rolls-Royce (also a BMW brand), and fresh takes on existing models like a new convertible version of the 3 Series.
 ''The new models will give us a tailwind as we accelerate out of the crisis,'' BMW's chief financial officer, Friedrich Eichiner, said, chatting with a group of journalists at a dinner Wednesday. 
 BMW managers, who traveled here from the company's headquarters in Munich, are proud that they saw the downturn coming in early 2008. They dialed back costs and production, allowing the company to come through the crisis relatively undamaged. Now they hope the timing of the new models is equally good, catching an upswing just as it begins.
 Despite a 10.4 percent plunge in sales, BMW will post a pretax profit for 2009, Mr. Eichiner said. He also said its car division would return to profit for the fourth quarter after a loss of 76 million euros, or $107 million, in the third quarter. For 2008, BMW reported a net profit of 384 million euros ($524 million) on sales of 44.3 billion euros ($60.4 billion).
 Still, Mr. Eichiner remains cautious about the year ahead. He frets, for example, about the danger of a commercial real estate crisis in the United States, which could deal a fresh blow to banks in BMW's largest market.
 At a time of consolidation across the industry, some analysts have also questioned whether BMW, with sales of a little more than one million vehicles a year, will be able to remain competitive in the long term.
 ''There are risks in the air,'' Mr. Eichiner said.
 The 5 Series, which has not gone through a complete redesign since 2003, is critical to BMW's goal of achieving an 8 percent profit on car sales. The sporty but comfortable sedan, a beloved company car for European business executives, is BMW's second-best-selling model line by units, after the smaller and significantly less expensive 3 Series.
 BMW does not disclose earnings by model line, but it is a safe bet that the 5 Series carries a healthy profit margin.
 ''The 5 Series is one of the two backbones of the portfolio,'' along with the 3 Series, said Christoph Sturmer, an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in Frankfurt.
 The 5 Series, which goes on sale in Europe on March 20 and the United States on June 19, is coming to market at a more auspicious time than the comparable Mercedes E Class, which rival Daimler, based in Stuttgart, released last year.
 ''BMW is lucky because they hit the right side of the recession,'' Mr. Sturmer said.
 Mr. Eichiner conceded that this year's product offensive was the result of production decisions set years ago, rather than any strategic brilliance.
 ''Five years ago who saw the crisis?'' he asked. ''It's luck.''
 But he also said that not having many new models last year was a problem, as BMW struggled to entice buyers during the downturn. ''Last year I would have been happy to have a new 5,'' he said with a smile, adding, ''I'm happy I have a 5 now that the crisis is over.''
 Of course, the success of the 5 Series depends on whether buyers like it.
 The starting price in Germany will be 39,950 euros ($54,490), and nearly all the cars sold in the United States are likely to be priced above $50,000. The car's exterior design is reminiscent of BMW's top-of-the-line 7 Series, but with accents like slightly angled taillights that give the car a slightly racier look.
 Inside, the 5 Series is stuffed with technology previously reserved for the 7 Series, like optional pivoting rear wheels, controlled by software, that allow a shorter turning radius or crisp lane changes at high speed. Other options include a navigation display that projects directions, driving speed and other data on the windshield.
 BMW said it cut production costs for the 5 Series, which will be made in Dingolfing, Germany, by 15 percent by borrowing parts from the 7 Series, like aluminum axles. The only drawback, Mr. Sturmer, the analyst points out, is that the cars look similar and could drain sales from the costlier 7 Series model.
 ''A little bit more differentiation might have done them good,'' he said.
 The 5 Series is BMW's most crucial new product this year, but the company will also be placing hopes on other vehicles.
 The four-wheel-drive Mini sounds incongruous but looks surprisingly convincing based on prototypes that the company has allowed journalists to see. At the high end, the new Ghost from Rolls-Royce will be sold for less than existing models of the superluxury unit, as BMW tries to attract buyers merely rich as opposed to very rich.
 In 2010 BMW also plans a new two-door coupe version of the 3 Series before a complete redesign of that series next year, as well as a facelift of the 5 Series sport utility vehicle.
 The latest generation of the X3, due in the fall, will be made in Spartanburg, S.C., as BMW tries to insulate itself from swings in the exchange rate.
 If there is an upside to Portugal's financial crisis for BMW and other European exporters, it is that worries about debt there and in Greece and Spain have helped push down the euro versus the dollar, making sales in the United States market more profitable.
 Despite continuing anxiety about the direction of the global economy, Mr. Eichiner said, ''we're definitely feeling better.''

HEADLINE: Questions About Biofuels' Environmental Costs Could Alter Europe's Policies

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
A top European farm official has suggested that yet-to-be-released studies by the European Commission could be used to ''kill'' heavily promoted and subsidized biofuels by focusing on their total environmental impact.
 The suggestion, written in the margins of internal correspondence seen by The International Herald Tribune, could foreshadow a further retreat from the biofuel-friendly policies that the commission once called crucial in the fight against climate change. 
 The industry has already been dogged by contentions that the main justification for policies supporting biofuels -- that they are greener than fossil-based products -- is unsound. Many environmental advocates claim that a large number of fuels grown from crops do not merit public subsidies or production incentives.
 European governments agreed in December 2008 that only biofuels that reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent compared with fossil fuels should qualify for meeting the trade bloc's current goal.
 But at the time, the governments directed the commission to investigate indirect land use change and, depending on the findings, to decide whether any changes needed to be made about which biofuels counted toward the goal.
 The commission's studies are intended to determine the volume of emissions created when forest or land is cleared to replace food production lost to biofuel crops. Converting land can release large amounts of greenhouse gases when vegetation is cleared. Plowing also exposes carbon stored in the soil to the air. In the lumbering jargon of emissions experts, these effects are known as indirect land use change, or I.L.U.C.
 In a memorandum, Jean-Luc Demarty, the top civil servant in the agriculture department at the European Commission, wrote to a colleague in December that ''an unguided use of I.L.U.C. would kill biofuels in the E.U.'' 
 His words suggest that most of the models in the studies used for calculating emissions would rule out fuels made from crops currently produced in the European Union. That, he added in the handwritten note, ''is probably the objective'' of those who oppose incentives for some forms of biofuels.
 Mr. Demarty declined to comment on Thursday, but other officials did not dispute the authenticity of the note. 
 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that a number of biofuels would still meet emissions limits even after land-use changes resulting from increased biofuel demand.
 But in the case of corn-based ethanol, the agency said that manufacturers would need to use ''advanced efficient technologies'' during production to meet American limits.
 In Europe, commission officials are seeking to protect influential agricultural and industrial interests while maintaining a credible climate policy.
 A spokeswoman for the European Commission, Marlene Holzner, declined to comment on what she termed internal working documents.
 A group of environmental activists and lawyers made the European Commission document available to The International Herald Tribune this week. They contend the studies will support the case for using fewer biofuels and want the commission to release them.
 Transport and Environment, a nonprofit group based in Brussels, first requested that the studies be released nearly four months ago.
 Ms. Holzner said that the request's ''wide scope'' meant it was ''not possible to check all the relevant material'' within the normal deadline for releasing documents. Under European Union rules, the commission has an obligation to respond to information requests, but may not necessarily grant them. Ms. Holzner, however, said a ''first batch'' of studies should be made available next week.
 European governments agreed in December 2008 that only biofuels that reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent compared with fossil fuels should qualify for meeting the trade bloc's current target.
 But at the time, the governments directed the commission to investigate indirect land use change and, depending on the findings, decide whether any changes needed to be made about which biofuels counted toward the target.
 Amandine Lecourt, the spokeswoman for the European Biodiesel Board, said negative effects on emissions from indirect land use change were ''still unproved.''

HEADLINE: Administration Rejects Health Insurer's Defense of Huge Rate Increases

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Anthem Blue Cross, the California health insurance company that was criticized by the Obama administration for raising its premiums, said Thursday that the increases of up to 39 percent were driven by rising health care costs.
 But Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, declared the explanation inadequate, especially in light of the profits made by Anthem's parent company, WellPoint Inc.
 ''It remains difficult to understand how a company that made $2.7 billion in the last quarter of 2009 alone can justify massive increases that will leave consumers with nothing but bad options,'' she said. Those options, she suggested, were to pay more for coverage, cut back on benefits or join the ranks of the uninsured. 
 Her comments came on a day when a health care advocacy group reported that WellPoint and the four other biggest health insurance companies had collectively reported a record profit for 2009, even as they covered fewer customers.
 In a letter to Ms. Sebelius, Brian A. Sassi, an executive with WellPoint Inc., wrote that the company was ''confident that our rates reflect anticipated medical costs and are established consistent with actuarial principles and state law.'' 
 Anthem's rate increases, set to take effect March 1, have galvanized some Democrats in Washington, including President Obama, who say they provide an example of why Congress needs to break its political logjam and pass legislation to overhaul the health care system.
 The report released Thursday said the five biggest insurance companies had an average profit last year of 5.2 percent -- for a combined total of $12.2 billion. This was an increase of $4.4 billion, or 56 percent, compared with 2008, according to the report, prepared by Health Care for America Now, a coalition of liberal and labor groups advocating for the passage of an overhaul of the health care system. 
 The companies are WellPoint, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. The data in the report were based on company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 The insurance industry said the report was incomplete. ''Comparing the profits of individual companies today to where they were at the bottom of a recession a year ago does not tell the whole story,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group.
 Historically, Mr. Zirkelbach said, the average profit margin for the industry has been relatively low, 3 percent to 5 percent. For example, he said, if a company made a 2 percent profit last year during the recession and is making 4 percent now, its profits would have increased by 100 percent but the profit would still only be 4 percent.
 ''For every dollar spent on health care in America, less than one penny goes toward health plan profits,'' he said. ''Health plan profits are well below other industries within the health care sector.''
 David Palombi, a spokesman for WellPoint, said Anthem's profit margin in California ''is in line with, or below, many of its competitors, including our two large not-for-profit competitors.''
 WellPoint's net income for 2009 was $4.7 billion, but Mr. Palombi said that included $2.2 billion resulting from a one-time gain from the sale of an asset.
 While the insurance companies posted substantial profits, they said they have had to increase premiums to keep up with the rising costs of medical care. 
 In her statement, Ms. Sebelius said she was skeptical of this explanation. ''High health care costs alone cannot account for a premium increase that is 10 times higher than national health spending growth,'' she said.
 The insurers said they had also lost some of their healthiest customers, many of whom dropped their insurance during the economic downturn. Mr. Sassi of WellPoint said the loss of these customers had left ''an insured pool that utilizes significantly more services per individual than under better economic times.'' 
 But critics say the substantial increase in premiums is contributing to the industry's profits, as are a host of other practices.
 Insurance companies last year continued to try to purge their most costly customers, which are often small businesses with older workers, said Richard Kirsch, national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now.
 Another reason for the robust profits, Mr. Kirsch said, is that the companies reduced the percentage of their premiums that they spent on actual medical care and devoted more to administrative costs and profits.
 A third factor, he said, is that the insurers continued to attract more customers to public programs like Medicare Advantage, in which the federal government pays private insurers 14 percent more than it pays Medicare to cover the same people.
 The report said that the insurance industry's long-term strategy was to shift responsibility for the care of millions of older, sicker and lower-income customers to taxpayer-supported programs, like Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program. Those programs in turn are increasingly hiring the big insurance companies -- and paying them -- to manage the coverage.
 Although the insurance companies lost 2.7 million customers last year during the recession, Mr. Kirsch said, they raised their premiums so much that they still made substantial profits. ''This is a business that is recession-proof because they can raise their prices even when they're losing customers,'' he said.
 The next step in the health care debate is a bipartisan summit at the White House on Feb. 25.

HEADLINE: $4.2 Billion Loss in 2009 Is Reported by Renault

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Renault, the French automaker, posted a 3.1 billion euro annual loss on Thursday on a sharp decrease in sales. It also declined to offer a 2010 earnings forecast, saying conditions would remain ''difficult.'' 
 Renault's loss, equivalent to about $4.2 billion, was in contrast to a 571 million euro profit in 2008. Revenue fell almost 11 percent, to 33.7 billion euros, for a second consecutive year of decline, as unit sales fell 3.1 percent, to 2.3 million vehicles. 
 Carlos Ghosn, Renault's chief executive and chairman, said in a statement that the company had ''proved its resilience,'' despite the poor market, by meeting a goal for ''significantly positive free cash flow,'' meaning the company had continued to generate sufficient funds to service its debt. Renault's operating loss widened last year to 955 million euros, from a 117 million euro loss in 2008. The company managed to cut its net financial debt to 5.9 billion euros, a reduction of 2 billion euros.
 The economic situation ''will remain difficult in 2010 with a 10 percent fall in the European market,'' Mr. Ghosn added. 
 Renault said the market had improved over the year after a poor start, helped by government cash-for-clunkers programs, and said it gained share in 11 of its 15 largest markets. 
 Though Renault, based near Paris, ranks No. 3 in Western Europe -- behind Volkswagen, of Germany, and Renault's French rival, PSA Peugeot Citroen. It has not been active in the United States for years.
 Mr. Ghosn is also chief executive of Nissan, a Japanese carmaker in which Renault owns a 44 percent stake. Nissan on Tuesday reported consolidated net income of 45 billion yen ($501 million) for the three months that ended Dec. 31, and changed its forecast for an annual loss to a profit for the business year ending March 31.
 Mr. Ghosn is pushing hard for the introduction of electric cars. Nissan and Renault have teamed up with Better Place, a grid infrastructure company, to provide mass-market electric cars to Israel and Denmark beginning in 2011. 
 The 2009 loss was the first annual loss in the 13 years since Renault was privatized. In February 2009, Renault and Peugeot each received 3 billion euros in government loans to help them through the credit crisis in exchange for a pledge to protect French jobs. 
 Peugeot on Wednesday reported a 1.2 billion euro net loss on sales of 48.4 billion euros, down 11 percent. 
 For 2010, Renault said it was pinning its hopes on six new models and said it would maintain tight controls on costs.
 The automaker's shares fell 1.78 euros, or 5.4 percent, to close at 31 euros Thursday. Shares have fallen almost 22 percent from their recent closing peak of 39.70 euros on Jan. 7.
 Michael Tyndall, an auto industry specialist in London for Nomura International, said the share price decline partly reflected investors' disappointment with Renault's operating results, as well as the company's reticence about disposing of its 20 percent stake in the Volvo truck business at current prices. 
 Uncertainty about the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and Renault's own relatively heavy debt burden was also weighing on the stock, he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Advisers Predict Unemployment of 8.2% by 2012

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration projected Thursday that the unemployment rate would fall this year by only a little, if at all, and would remain well over 6 percent until 2015. 
 The forecast was the most closely watched element of the annual Economic Report of the President, a 458-page document outlining the White House's outlook and policies on areas as diverse as savings and investment, health care and climate change.
 The report projected that an average of 95,000 jobs would be added to the payrolls each month this year -- barely enough to keep up with the normal number of jobs the economy would have to create to meet the growth in the labor force and keep the unemployment rate steady. 
 Although the Labor Department has estimated that unemployment fell to 9.7 percent last month, the new report projected that the average rate for the year would be 10 percent. That would fall to 9.2 percent next year, the report said, and to 8.2 percent in 2012, when President Obama would be up for re-election. 
 The report also estimated that the nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, would grow 3 percent this year, in line with the projections for global growth of 3.1 percent by the International Monetary Fund, and 3.4 percent by the 30-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 The president's Council of Economic Advisers, which prepares the report, was criticized last year for failing to foresee that unemployment would reach 10 percent, as it did in the fall. But Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the council, said last year's report had been ''remarkably accurate'' in its G.D.P. forecast.
 ''The usual relationship between G.D.P. growth and the unemployment rate has broken down somewhat,'' Ms. Romer, who is on leave from the University of California, Berkeley, told reporters at the White House. ''The unemployment rate has risen much more than one would have predicted.''
 Asked whether the advisers felt pressure to offer gloomy predictions because the president has been pushing Congress to pass a jobs bill, she said: ''The truth is, we don't have a crystal ball. Every year, we try to do an honest, reasonable, conservative forecast.''
 While the report sought to provide empirical support for the administration's objectives, it also contained some implicit criticisms of the handling of the economy under Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush. 
 ''After a half-decade of higher growth in the 1990s, the real income of the typical American family actually fell between 2000 and 2006,'' it added. 
 The report said consumption and foreign borrowing, rather than investment and net exports, fed the last decade's economic expansion. It said, ''The long-term fiscal outlook the administration inherited'' was ''more troubling'' than recent deficits. 
 And while the report described the rising cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security as the ''main reason'' deficits are projected to balloon over time, it also said that ''the policy choices of the previous administration contribute a substantial amount'' to that growth.
 The deficit, relative to the size of the economy, stands at its highest level since World War II. The report argued that while deficit growth would be unsustainable because it could undermine global investors' willingness to buy American debt, huge short-term deficits are manageable.
 ''It is essential that the United States follow a fiscal policy that stabilizes the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at a feasible level,'' the report concluded. On that measure, the debt of the United States is proportionally lower than that of Belgium, Italy or Japan, but somewhat higher than that of Germany, Britain or France. 
 The report offered three primary prescriptions for bringing the deficits under control: curbing the rising cost of health care; undoing many of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts adopted under Mr. Bush; and eliminating wasteful spending. 
 The report asserted that, from a historical perspective, effective tax rates for high-income Americans reached their lowest point in at least a half-century in 2008.
 Mr. Obama has urged raising personal income tax rates for those making at least $250,000 a year to the levels of the late 1990s, along with other changes, starting in 2011. The tax increases would raise nearly $1 trillion over 10 years, the report said. 
 The report represents a consensus view from Ms. Romer and the council's two other members, Austan Goolsbee and Cecilia E. Rouse.

HEADLINE: Alcatel-Lucent Posts Profit, but Slow Sales Depress Shares

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Alcatel-Lucent, the struggling French-American network equipment maker, on Thursday reported its first real quarterly profit since its 2006 merger. But its stock fell sharply amid concerns over declining sales. 
 The company, based in Paris, said it earned 46 million euros ($63.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2009, after a 3.9 billion euro loss a year earlier. Sales fell during the period by 20 percent to 3.97 billion euros, from 4.95 billion euros.
 The profit was Alcatel-Lucent's first without help from asset sales since the merger of Lucent Technologies and Alcatel, a combination that has led to more than 8 billion euros in losses and extensive write-downs.
 Alcatel-Lucent's stock fell 11.8 percent in Paris on Thursday as the decline in sales exceeded that reported by its main competitors, Ericsson of Sweden and NokiaSiemens, the Finnish-German venture.
 Sales at Ericsson fell 13 percent in the quarter, and those at Nokia Siemens dropped 16 percent in the same period.
 Odon de Laporte, an analyst in London at Cheuvreux, a brokerage house owned by Credit Agricole, said investors were concerned that the decline might signal trouble in the American market, which accounts for a third of Alcatel-Lucent's sales and profit.
 ''There is a concern that Alcatel-Lucent is not keeping up in the U.S. market,'' Mr. De Laporte said. ''But over all, I am positive on the company. They have secured two key relationships there, and their profit margins are improving.''
 On Wednesday, AT&T, the largest mobile operator in the United States, named Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson as its two main suppliers for the next generation of wireless network gear, using what is called Long Term Evolution technology. Verizon Wireless, the second-largest operator in the United States, selected Alcatel-Lucent as a supplier of that technology in 2009.
 Ben Verwaayen, the Alcatel-Lucent chief executive since December 2008, said cost-cutting and such new contracts should help the company return to full-year net profitability by 2011.
 ''In 2011, we want to declare victory and be a normal company again,'' Mr. Verwaayen said in an interview.
 Mr. Verwaayen built a reputation as an aggressive cost-cutter as chief executive of the British phone operator BT from 2002 to 2008, where his austerity programs helped BT emerge from a financial crisis.
 He is applying a similar remedy to Alcatel-Lucent, having already cut costs by 960 million euros last year, more than his previously announced goal of 750 million euros. The leaner operation will give Alcatel-Lucent traction as the market improves, he said.
 For 2010, Mr. Verwaayen forecast industry sales would rise as much as 5 percent, after an 8 to 12 percent decline in 2009. The estimate is more optimistic than those of his rivals, which have not given such specific forecasts.
 The drop in fourth-quarter sales, Mr. Verwaayen said, ''was not what we had hoped for but was not disastrous.'' He added: ''The balance sheet is much better than it has been in a long time.''

HEADLINE: In Shift, Chavez Gives Oil Contracts to West

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
After clashing with foreign oil companies in recent years, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has shifted strategy and awarded contracts to Western oil companies, hoping to increase his nation's flagging oil production and pull the country out of a sharp economic downturn.
 Chevron, the American oil giant, led a group of companies that won one of the concessions on Wednesday night, showing the resilience of trade ties between the nations. The United States remains the largest consumer of Venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of political relations over the last decade. 
 Venezuela quietly began courting Western oil companies again in 2008 after nationalizing some of their assets, imposing higher royalties on them and subjecting their executives to raids by tax authorities. Even now, Venezuela is considered one of the riskiest countries in which to do business of any kind, and a number of major Western oil companies stayed out of the bidding. 
 But the oil companies that participated are hoping to increase their access to the coveted Orinoco Belt, an area the size of Costa Rica in southern Venezuela that may contain one of the world's largest recoverable oil reserves. The United States Geological Survey described the Orinoco Belt last month in a report as the largest petroleum accumulation it had assessed, containing an estimated 513 billion barrels of recoverable oil.
 Facing a decline in oil revenues and a dearth of foreign investment, Mr. Chavez seemed eager to address any lingering concerns the Western oil companies might have about operating in his country. 
 ''Dear friends, partners, allies, you know you have all the guarantees of our Constitution and our laws,'' Mr. Chavez said Wednesday night in a ceremony at his palace, broadcast on state television, in which he thanked the foreign companies for bidding.
 In an unusual display of warmth given his friction with Washington, Mr. Chavez happily greeted a senior Chevron executive in attendance, Ali Moshiri, the company's president of African and Latin American operations. Mr. Chavez conceded that differences remained with the Obama administration, but he also extended an invitation for President Obama to visit Venezuela's southern oil region, telling Mr. Moshiri, ''You bring him here.''
 Some foreign oil companies that had shown interest in the auction -- including Royal Dutch/Shell, Brazil's Petrobras and Total of France -- opted not to bid. Mr. Chavez is moving ahead with nationalizations in other industries, like the seizure last month of stores controlled by the French retailer Casino, which appears to have scared foreign investors.
 Chevron, which maintains the warmest relations with Mr. Chavez of any American oil company, led a group that includes the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, winning access to one area in the Orinoco Belt. The Spanish oil company Repsol YPF led another group that won a separate contract in a partnership with the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation of India and Petronas of Malaysia.
 A contract for a third area in the Orinoco Belt was not awarded, reflecting the reluctance of other oil companies to take part in the auction. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to cede control in their ventures to Petroleos de Venezuela, Mr. Chavez's national oil company, in addition to securing all the financing for their projects, which could require as much as $30 billion.
 If the two oil projects led by Chevron and Repsol are completed, they will each increase Venezuela's oil production by about 400,000 barrels a day, a crucial amount for the long-term economic viability of Mr. Chavez's government, which relies on oil for more than 90 percent of its export income.
 The dependence on oil has grown more acute during Mr. Chavez's 11 years in power. Grappling with a steep drop in oil income since 2008, Mr. Chavez was forced last month to devalue the nation's currency, the bolivar. Venezuela is also struggling with a galloping inflation rate of 27 percent, the highest in Latin America, and intensifying electricity blackouts.
 ''It's not that Chavez is suddenly embracing a market system or respect for property,'' said Roger Tissot, an expert on Venezuela's energy industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm specializing in Latin America. ''He's like a chameleon who can change his stripes when he realizes Venezuela's long-term economic survival is at stake.'' 
 Some private energy executives here doubt that the oil projects will materialize, given the technical challenges of extracting the Orinoco Belt's oil, which is heavy in impurities and hard to refine, and the uncertainty of doing business in Venezuela. Moreover, Mr. Chavez announced only the award of the deals; final operating agreements must still be negotiated and signed. Recent attempts to reach other oil production ventures with companies from China, Belarus, Russia, Italy and Vietnam have advanced slowly, if at all.
 But concessions made by Petroleos de Venezuela and the oil companies during the bidding process suggested the seriousness of both sides, some energy analysts said. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to pay signing fees of about $500 million and $1 billion, respectively, as part of their bids. Some of the fees may be payable in installments, and possibly with vouchers used to offset losses from nationalizations.
 ''Chavez was clear in stating that Venezuela and the companies need each other,'' said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm here. ''When you decide to put down bonuses of $500 million and $1 billion, you are very serious about developing these projects.''
 Chevron in particular has a long history of doing business in Venezuela, opting to stay in the country in 2007 and become a minority partner with Petroleos de Venezuela after the government took control of foreign oil projects. Other American companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, clashed with Mr. Chavez and left.

HEADLINE: A Trail of Broken Pipes

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
State and local governments across the country may have to replace their water systems because of defective pipes, according to a whistle-blower lawsuit unsealed this week.
 The whistle-blower, John Hendrix, accuses his former employer, one of the world's largest pipe manufacturers, of falsifying test results about the quality of its products. Pipes that should last 50 years are in some cases rupturing in their very first year, according to Mr. Hendrix and some state documents. This can lead to explosions, leaks, fires and other dangers.
 Officials of the company, JM Eagle, dispute the allegations and say that the tests were done correctly. 
 Mr. Hendrix said he uncovered the problem after he was asked to oversee the certification of a new manufacturing process that put the pipes through a prescribed battery of tests. He concluded that JM Eagle had been selling substandard plastic pipe since 1996, and that it had subsequently manipulated test results. 
 When he told his superiors of his concerns, they said the problems were a normal ''business risk,'' according to the complaint. When he pressed harder, he was fired. 
 Mr. Hendrix, 31, of Clifton, N.J., then began a whistle-blower lawsuit under federal and state statutes that allow private citizens to file on behalf of government agencies if they suspect a fraud. In his lawsuit, he asserts that less than half of JM Eagle's pipe would have qualified for sale if it had been properly tested. ''It became apparent to me that this was being done intentionally,'' he said in an interview. 
 Some states, cities and water districts have already experienced leaking, cracking and exploding pipes made of PVC, or polyvinyl chloride. Many are now joining Mr. Hendrix's lawsuit, filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California. 
 Nevada, Virginia, Delaware, Tennessee and more than 40 water authorities in California have decided to take part. 
 ''We will hold anyone who cheats Nevada taxpayers accountable,'' said Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada's attorney general. Nevada recently spent $5 million replacing a three-quarter-mile section of a water main that supplies a large prison south of Las Vegas. The original pipe, made by JM Eagle, had been rupturing several times a year, baffling state officials and costing tens of thousands of dollars a year to repair. Other states and cities are still reviewing the allegations and deciding whether to participate. The cost of repairing or replacing the defective pipes is not known, but could run into many millions of dollars for each of the affected systems. 
 JM Eagle, a successor to Johns Manville that was once based in Livingston, N.J., and now has its headquarters in Los Angeles, has operated a dozen manufacturing plants across the country, claiming about 60 percent of the nation's market for new water pipes. It also sells to Mexico and Canada, suggesting problems could be more widespread. 
 A company spokesman, Marcus Galindo, said the company ''stands 100 percent behind the quality of our products.'' He said that the company would not have been able to gain such a large share of the market if it had not been satisfying its customers year after year. 
 He said he believed that Mr. Hendrix had ''cherry-picked'' testing documents and e-mail messages to give the impression that the company had not followed proper testing procedures. Some of the requirements were ambiguous, he said, and Mr. Hendrix was interpreting them so strictly ''no manufacturer could have met that standard.'' Mr. Galindo said JM Eagle had worked with the relevant industrial associations to clarify the ambiguous language. 
 If Mr. Hendrix's allegations are borne out, it is not clear who will pay to repair the faulty water systems. 
 Standing behind JM Eagle is the Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's biggest diversified industrial company, with factories spinning out textiles, semiconductors, oil, detergents and plastics in Asia and the United States. Its founder, Wang Yung-ching, was known as the ''god of management'' in Taiwan, and was revered as a rags-to-riches legend who helped the province become one of Asia's ''tiger'' economies. 
 At the time of his death last year at 91, Mr. Wang was Taiwan's second-richest man. But he left no will, and his nine children have been quarreling in state court in Newark over who should gather the assets of his vast estate and who will pay its debts. 
 His youngest son, Walter Wang, has asked the court to let him handle the estate, but his siblings have made rival claims. Walter Wang has been chief executive of JM Eagle since 1990, when his father appointed him at age 25. 
 Another large company with exposure to JM Eagle's problems is the American International Group, which has provided some insurance to the company, according to Mr. Hendrix. The insurer has been trying to raise money to pay back its bailout by the government in 2008. Any large claim by municipal governments would be a setback. 
 JM Eagle was created in 1982, after the bankruptcy of Johns Manville, the first major corporation to seek protection from asbestos claims by filing for bankruptcy. The elder Mr. Wang bought the pipe division out of bankruptcy that year, renamed it JM Manufacturing and added it to his empire. (The company became JM Eagle after acquiring PW Eagle in 2007.) 
 PVC pipe had been just a small part of Johns Manville's business, but Mr. Wang made his acquisition at a time when the plastic was fast catching on among cities replacing their older, decaying water systems. For several years, managers stayed on at the company and participated in the development of new standards for plastic pipes. 
 Mr. Hendrix said in his complaint that after Walter Wang became chief executive in 1990, many of the longtimers resigned or retired, and people who had minimal backgrounds in engineering or failure analysis replaced them.
 JM Eagle also put a premium on cutting costs, Mr. Hendrix said, hiring people like him straight out of college. It even maintained a boarding house near Livingston for Taiwanese employees who could not afford suburban New York housing on their modest salaries.
 One of his first jobs was to field customer complaints, which he said came in at the rate of at least one a day. He said he was trained to look for ways to attribute leaks and ruptures to the governments and contractors who installed and maintained the pipes.
 Only when he was assigned to oversee certain tests did Mr. Hendrix begin to think the complaints stemmed from the company's own cost-cutting measures. He said he realized JM Eagle had started buying a lower grade of raw materials from Formosa and had speeded up its production lines without reporting the changes to the certification agencies as required. 
 The more he learned, he said, the harder it became for him to tell customers their problems were the result of their own errors on construction sites. 
 Yet that was the response Gus Nunez, manager of the Nevada Public Works Board, said he got when he asked JM Eagle for help finding out why a pipe carrying water to a cluster of prisons south of Las Vegas kept breaking. 
 ''The pipe was coming apart and blowing up, probably an average of three or so times a year,'' Mr. Nunez said. The pipe ran underground, and each new rupture sent water blowing up through the ground like a geyser. Every time it happened, Mr. Nunez said, crews had to turn off the water supply to the prisons, go look for the leak and try to repair it. 
 Finally they brought in specialists from the company to try to identify the problem, he said.
 Mr. Nunez said the specialists faulted the materials supporting the pipe and the installers. ''They said: Well, we think some of the bedding may be defective. It looks like maybe when the contractor put the pipe together, they may have pushed it too far and caused a stress on the pipe that it wasn't designed for.'' 
 Not long after that, he said, the state heard about Mr. Hendrix's lawsuit, and asked to review his information. 
 The state gave up on fixing the existing main. It disconnected it and built a new pipeline. The new installation cost about $5 million, said Susan Stewart, the state's deputy attorney general and construction law counsel for the Public Works Board. That does not count the cost of the many unsuccessful repairs.
 Ms. Stewart said Nevada and its local governments have spent $57 million on PVC pipe in recent years, all from JM Eagle, now in use in prisons, universities, government offices and local water projects. 
 ''We have something in the ground that, had we known what it was, we would not have bought it,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''No way. At any price.''

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100211 
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100211
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20100211
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'TINO SEHGAL,' through March 10. If you've ever wanted to see the interior of the Guggenheim in its pristine state, now's the time. For the solo exhibition of the young European artist Tino Sehgal, the great spiraling rotunda, recently ablaze with Kandinskys, has been cleared out. Yet the space isn't empty. On the rotunda's ground floor, a man and a woman perform an ever-changing, slow-motion amorous embrace. On the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away. You're invited to join the conversation, be part of the art, in this deeply refreshing, there-but-not-there show. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Holland Cotter)20100211
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20100211
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ALIAS MAN RAY: THE ART OF REINVENTION,' through March 14. This show, a traditional retrospective with an irresistible biographical hook, gives roots to an artist who preferred to be seen as rootless. Born Emmanuel Radnitzky to Jewish emigres from Russia, Man Ray reinvented himself as one of the luminaries of the interwar avant-garde. Yet his garment industry background had a material hold on him, visible in references to mannequins, coat hangers and patterns. More than 200 works, including paintings, photographs, films, assemblages and his signature rayographs, link Man Ray's frequent shifts between mediums to a more profound condition of restlessness. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' ongoing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kind of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' ongoing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100211
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100211
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)20100211
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Anibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. ( Rosenberg)20100211
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived in New York in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20100211
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100211
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20100211
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'GABRIEL OROZCO,' through March 1. Gabriel Orozco's delightful 1993 solo debut at the Museum of Modern Art was a barely-there affair of a few photographs, a ball of clay, a hammock and some fresh fruit. His one-man gallery show the next year was sparser still, with four plastic Dannon yogurt cups nailed to the walls of the gallery's otherwise empty space. Mr. Orozco has since gotten considerable mileage out of this early thinking-light phase. Tapped by museums in Chicago, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Mexico City, where he was raised, he has become an object of admiring critical scrutiny, and a hero to many young artists. Why? The question lingers, only half-answered, after seeing this retrospective, a taut, attractive but oddly conventional-looking survey, heavy on painting and sculpture. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100211
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100211
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100211
 THE ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'THE ORIGINS OF EL GRECO: ICON PAINTING IN VENETIAN CRETE,' through Feb. 27. With its ensemble of some 40 religious images, including 6 by Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, this glowing show is essentially a triple-layered visual essay. It roughs out the complex texture of a specific, cosmopolitan, East-meets-West island culture. It tells the story of a great artist who emerged from that culture, lived outside it and lastingly belonged to it. And it begins to suggest the variety and charisma of icons as a genre: spiritually instrumental objects that lie outside and beyond ordinary definitions of art. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street , (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org. (Cotter)20100211
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20100211
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through March 13. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100211
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VISIONS OF THE COSMOS: FROM THE MILKY OCEAN TO AN EVOLVING UNIVERSE,' through May 10. This exhibition sets up a thought-provoking compare-contrast exercise between Western and Eastern ways of picturing the universe. On one side, myths about the cosmos are vividly imagined in Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist paintings and sculptures. On the other side, the West's progressively more empirically based beliefs are represented mainly by illustrations in antique books, with astronomical photographs made by high-tech machines like the Hubble Space Telescope representing current scientific knowledge. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)20100211
 SCULPTURE CENTER : 'LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE,' through March 30. Inspired by a Kafka short story, this exhibition says a lot about the state of contemporary art. It presents an international array of artists who riff on familiar conventions of modern art. Kitty Kraus's squared-off lengths of men's suit fabric lying flat on the floor evoke Carl Andre but with a feminist twist. Don't miss the funny, magical films by the team of Joao Maria Gusmao and Pedro Paiva in the basement. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20100211
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100211
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: '30 SECONDS OFF AN INCH,' through March 14. This exhibition of 60 disparate artworks by 42 contemporary artists from several generations might be called revisionist. It takes a refreshingly visual, even formal, approach to art that is usually plumbed for political and social meanings based largely on the artist's identity. Its curator, Naomi Beckwith, wants to emphasize the meanings -- social and otherwise -- embedded in the actual objects on view. Her success is mixed, partly because she doesn't spend much time explaining the experiential nature of her selections in the catalog, and also because she includes too many familiar, established artists. But she makes many excellent choices, introduces some promising young talent and displays a visual intelligence that is often rare in her chosen profession. 144 West 125th Street , (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)20100211
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MASTER DRAWINGS,' through Feb. 20. The local private dealer Margot Gordon and Crispian Riley-Smith, who has a gallery in London, place Italian and Dutch or German sheets, mostly from the 16th and 17th centuries, on facing walls. Heads and figures, whether in portraits, studies from the nude or religious scenes dominate the Italian side (along with a rare Mantegna), as does a certain freedom and even flourish of line. On the opposite side hang mostly landscapes, city views, skating scenes, the occasional animal or plant -- almost always rendered with a distinct reserve, if not meticulousness. The resulting encapsulation of sensibility elucidates. Shepherd & Derom Galleries, 58 East 79th Street , (212) 861-4050, shepherdgallery.com. (Smith)20100211
 Galleries: Chelsea
 INKA ESSENHIGH: 'THE OLD NEW AGE,' through Feb. 20. Ms. Essenhigh's sweet, painted visions of enchanted forests, a ghostly coastal scene and a nature goddess with a flowing green cape passing among the trees are animated by a childlike infatuation with pagan myth and magic. Is she expressing sincere pantheistic faith or toying with New Age cliches? Both: the life of her work is in the tension between skepticism and belief. 303 Gallery, 547 West 21st Street , (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)20100211
 CHRISTIAN HOLSTAD: 'THE WORLD'S GONE BEAUTIFUL,' through March 6. Christian Holstad was part of a wave of young, busy-handed, crafts-oriented artists who gained attention in the mid-2000s, when the art market was trying to leave identity politics and consumerist critique behind. As it turned out, his work was about both, but he was talking about them in a new way, from the vantage point of a child antsy with adult appetites; many of them are evident in this recession-conscious show of soft-sculpture shopping carts and sex-food-and-religion collages. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street , (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Cotter)20100211
 MARKUS SCHINWALD, through Feb. 20. If you want to feel the wind on your eyeballs, drop by the New York debut of this young Austrian, who divides his time between Vienna and Los Angeles and fittingly pits the Victorian against the modern in his work. Dark, generic, suggestively altered 19th-century portraits and figure paintings dot the walls, while white-on-white beams traverse the space like the real-life, enlarged scaffolding of a Mondrian painting. Other works bring to mind Martin Kippenberger and Sarah Lucas. The initial effect is dazzling, verging on cynical, an ambitious machine too full of other artists' ghosts. Yvon Lambert, 550 West 21st Street , (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com. (Smith)20100211
 CHARLES STEFFEN: 'DRAWING NUDES IS LIKE SAYING A PRAYER, AMEN,' through Feb. 27. Rendered in serpentine lines, the naked women drawn late in life by this Chicago outsider artist have bug eyes and a stocky corpulence, like sexed-up troll dolls. Grotesque and cute, they call to mind the cartoons of Gahan Wilson and Basil Wolverton. Steffen (1927-1995) drew his other favorite subject, sunflowers, with a lovely, naturalistic touch. His women with sunflower heads are like deities for a nature religion. Edlin Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street , (212) 206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Johnson)20100211
 Last Chance
 'DEMONS, YARNS & TALES: TAPESTRIES BY CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS'; closes on Saturday. All bets are off when artists translate their work from one form into another, especially if the end result is the mad, magical, labor-intensive domain of tapestry. The 13 tapestries here -- commissioned by Banners of Persuasion, an offshoot of the Rug Company of London -- are from Paul Noble, Grayson Perry, Fred Tomaselli, Kara Walker and others. Some artists' ideas are deadened; others are enhanced. The display is wildly uneven but always illuminating, and several efforts are certifiable showstoppers. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea , (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Smith)20100211
 JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: 'HARD EDGE CLASSICIST PAINTINGS FROM THE 1950'S TO THE 1970'S' ; closes on Saturday. With abstract painting again in the art world's eye, the time is right to renew an acquaintance with the American artist John McLaughlin, and this survey of 14 pristine geometric paintings is the first New York survey in some time. Self-taught in the sense that he had no formal training, Mr. McLaughlin didn't begin painting until he was in his 40s, by which time he had been a dealer of Japanese art for years and an avid admirer of European abstract artists, particularly Malevich and Mondrian. All of these East/West sources figure into his quirky, spare, unmystical pictures, each seemingly intent on being as concrete and as unlimited as possible. Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street , (212) 445-0444, agvdgallery.com. (Cotter)20100211
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PAUL SIETSEMA'; closes on Monday. Acute self-consciousness is a salient feature of contemporary art, and few artists are more ingeniously self-reflective than this Los Angelino. Made with much technical finesse, his large drawings reproduce old photographs, newspapers and studio detritus. The grainy black-and-white film meditates on apparently ancient artifacts that Mr. Sietsema actually made by hand. What is real, we are invited to wonder, what can we count on in these epistemologically slippery, hyper-mediated times? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20100211
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION'; closes on Monday. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point for many viewers will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20100211
 PEARLSTEIN/HELD: 'FIVE DECADES'; closes on Saturday. Tracing a friendship between New York painters who worked in seemingly antithetical styles, this exhibition reveals a shared obsession with spatial illusion: the bugaboo of the painting-is-dead crowd. One created space with images of mostly nude bodies, seen from odd, distorting angles increasingly encroached upon by objects and other complications. The other cultivated an ever-expanding, more intricate, more radiantly colored geometric labyrinth. Their common ground is as richly worth exploring as their individual canvases. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea , (212) 242-2772, bettycuninghamgallery.com. (Smith)20100211
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VICTORIOUS ONES: JAIN IMAGES OF PERFECTION'; closes on Monday. Although Mohandas Gandhi learned from Jainism, an Indian religion that takes nonviolence as its first principle, in the West we still know little about it or its art. But now there are two exquisite shows of Jain art in New York. The smaller, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through March 28, is made up mostly of tiny, jewel-like manuscript paintings depicting the lives of savior-heroes called jinas. The Rubin Museum has, in addition to large-scale paintings, three dozen splendid sculptures of the same figures. Together the exhibitions give an in-depth view of a great art tradition and a complex faith. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)20100211
 JOEL SHAPIRO: 'WORKS: 1969-1979'; closes on Saturday. This show reintroduces the early work of a Post-Minimalist sculptor who swam against the mainstream of macho scale, abstract form, ''real space'' (as the Minimalists admiringly put it) or hermetic meaning. Mr. Shapiro's 1970s works are small without being miniature, representational -- and even symbolic -- yet bluntly involved with sculpture's materials, methods and traditions. Their plain cast-iron or balsa-wood forms announce chairs, factories, bridges, boats, houses and a fallen, somewhat figurative tree in ways that distort space but also tug at the emotions, signaling distance and loss, fragility and finality. Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea , (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)20100211
 'VENICE. THREE VISIONS IN GLASS'; closes on Saturday. The pitfalls lurking in the gap between art and craft are tellingly, if inadvertently, illuminated in side-by-side exhibitions of three artists who work in glass in Venice, the European city most associated with this astounding material. Cristiano Bianchin and Laura de Santillana push their medium in the direction of installation art and painting, but rarely look more than derivative. Yoichi Ohira sticks closest to traditional processes and vessel forms. Alternating between intricately colored vases and sturdier ones in carved clear glass, he also makes the strongest impression. Barry Friedman, 515 West 26th Street, Chelsea , (212) 239-8600, barryfriedmanltd.com. (Smith)20100211
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OMER FAST: NOSTALGIA'; closes on Sunday. Omer Fast -- who has a powerful, discomforting solo show at the Whitney Museum and another at Postmasters gallery in Chelsea (through Saturday) -- was born in Jerusalem in 1972, lives in Berlin and studied art in New York City. In past videos and films he has tackled subjects like the Holocaust, interracial machismo and the war in Iraq. In his new work he adds immigration and terrorism to the list, working a tense terrain that encompasses references to documentary, comedy and action films, and that leaves his own moral position ambiguous. He's really good, and getting better. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100211

HEADLINE: In the Calculations of Online Dating, Love Can Be Cruel

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Heidi Funai sat perched at the swank bar at Circa in San Francisco's Marina district, the city's mecca for straight singles. As men sidled up, she noted which ones might be there to mingle and which wore wedding bands.
 ''The real world is a lot of work,'' said Ms. Funai, an attractive 30-something with shoulder-length, wavy blond hair freed from her Vespa helmet. 
She had scootered into the real world to talk about the virtual realm of online dating. Ms. Funai once found love online, and now that she is back to search again, she has noticed a disheartening trend: it is getting increasingly cruel out there in cyberdating.
 ''The social contract is broken with online dating'' in a way that does not exist in real life, Ms. Funai said. She has used online dating sites for nearly a decade -- and she does not like what she sees happening.
 Since the current recession began, the popularity of online dating has surged -- memberships are up and new matchmaking portals have emerged to take advantage of the demand -- industry growth of up to 30 percent is expected in the next year or two, according to the tracking site DatingService.com. This has also led to an increase in behavior that would earn a slap in person, but has become de rigueur on the Internet.
 Never-answered messages, explicit requests for sex, fake bios, outdated photos and insults are ubiquitous. Ms. Funai said men in their 50s had contacted her, completely unsolicited, just to say she was too old. ''They wouldn't do that in person,'' she said, ''but online ...''
 It is love in the time of ones and zeros, the rudimentary language of computers. In the digital age, everything must at some point be reduced to this basic construct of choice: One or zero. Yes or no. On or off. Subscribers to online dating sites are forced to come up with a list of their desires. Red hair? Yes or no. Over 30 O.K.? Please check a box.
 The result is that millions are now trained to be dismissive based on detailed and sometimes arbitrary criteria. Combine this growth in fantasy checklists with the anonymity of the Web, and it gets ugly.
 Laurie Davis, an online dating analyst at eFlirtexpert.com has observed the problem -- with men. ''They forget about the chivalry factor sometimes when they date online,'' Ms. Davis said.
 Who comes up with these measures? In most cases, it is the Web site's owners. At OkCupid.com, however, it is left up to members to suggest dating criteria, and the result is an astonishing example of the need by some to quantify the ideal mate. 
 Sam Yagan, OkCupid.com's co-founder and a Stanford M.B.A. alumnus, said the site started with this premise: Can you use math and data analytics to match people up? With the goal of creating a screening process that was ''more human than a checkbox,'' Mr. Yagan said, the site takes thoughts from its 4.2 million monthly users to build the questions. Users answer as many as they like -- the average is 233. 
 With such a high number of expectations, no wonder some become disgruntled.
 And that might explain what is happening in the gay community and its rapid embrace of the iPhone application Grindr. When activated, a grid of dozens of tiny succinct profiles fills the phone screen, using GPS technology to tell users how far away they are from each another.
 ''17 feet away,'' the message said one evening when fired up at a cafe in the Castro district -- a disproportionate number of men were then seen holding their phones and looking over their shoulders. Less than a year old and limited to gay men, Grindr already has 500,000 users.
 ''We keep it PG-13,'' said Joel Simkhai, the company's founder. Although some use the application to facilitate casual hook-ups, no lewd language or photos are allowed.
 There is also the reality that users stand a good chance of actually seeing each other in person, not hiding anonymously behind a keyboard, enforcing accountability for one's conduct.
 ''It's more consistent with real life,'' Mr. Simkhai said, ''a little less in your face.''
 A version for heterosexuals is in the works.
 But even this emerging slice of the online dating world is not immune from random acts of malice. Almost as soon as Grindr was created, a rogue Web site started called Guys I Blocked On Grindr, dedicated to publicly burning men considered undesirable.
 Perhaps there is no way to separate the more public forms of love and the more public forms of cruelty.
 Still, Ms. Funai will continue to try to navigate the minefield of online dating, although as a tech marketing manager, she knows that applying ones and zeroes to relationships is problematic. 
 ''What everyone is looking for is chemistry,'' she said, ''and that's not quantifiable.''

HEADLINE: Economics And School

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Below are excerpts from some of the most provocative posts on The New York Times Bay Area blog this week: 
 nytimes.com/BayArea
SUPPLY-SIDE SAN FRANCISCO In recent weeks Mayor Gavin Newsom's staff has been aggressively pitching the liberal wing of the Board of Supervisors its version of supply-side economics, the free-market, business-friendly policies most often associated with -- whisper it softly around these parts -- the Reagan era. 
 Back in January, the mayor proposed three tax-exemption measures for businesses in his State of the City speech. The most contested caps payroll tax levels for two years, to encourage businesses to hire.
 Ted Egan, the city economist, said in a study that the tax break would create 1,430 new jobs in 2010 and 2,900 new jobs in 2011. But when San Francisco is straining to close the half-billion-dollar budget deficit, the policy would also cost roughly $72 million in forgone tax revenue over two years. Supervisor John Avalos, the head of the board's budget committee, has not yet set a vote on the measure. GERRY SHIH
 SCHOOL CHARTER EXTENSION The FAME charter school in Fremont appears to be heading toward a five-year renewal of its charter in March. The Alameda County Board of Education voted unanimously Tuesday to continue offering its support. The school has been the subject of controversy since a state audit uncovered questionable financial practices and the Fremont Unified School District voiced its opposition to the renewal of the school charter. 
 A vocal opponent of FAME on the Board of Education, Yvonne Cerrato, was not present. The board appeared to move past some of the concerns voiced by Fremont officials, as several board members and officials -- including the Alameda County official in charge of the FAME investigation, Carlene Naylor, an associate superintendent -- sounded firmly in support of the school. The school must meet several conditions by March 1. These include discontinuing the practice of taking high-fee, high-interest short-term loans from either relatives of the director or the school's board members. GERRY SHIH

HEADLINE: Seeing Trouble in Greece, Baltic States Rethink Euro Plans

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: RIGA, Latvia 

 BODY:
The tiny Baltic states have pursued closer integration with Europe with enormous zeal. But the price of monetary union may be giving them pause.
 Economists and ordinary citizens alike are watching the protests rumbling through the streets of Athens and the slow response to Greece's problems coming out of Brussels. 
 ''Countries like Estonia and Latvia were once desperate to get in,'' said Alf Vanags, director of the Baltic International Center for Economic Policy Studies in Riga. ''The euro is not looking so attractive now.'' 
 Latvia has been on track to adopt the euro in 2014, as has Lithuania, with Estonia eyeing its inclusion by 2011. 
 These governments have reason to fear that, like Athens, they will be caught in a vise: unable to pay for expensive social programs demanded by citizens while staying within the euro zone's debt limits. 
 Enthusiastic for years about adopting the euro, Latvia had undertaken painful austerity measures. Even as the global economy contracted, the government slashed spending. The program included cuts of 50 percent or more in the salaries of public-sector employees and a 40 percent reduction in hospital budgets.
 The result, many economists say, has been deepening unemployment and the worst recession of any country in the 27-nation European Union.
 Latvia's gross domestic product has declined by an estimated 24 percent since the recession began -- a steeper drop than America's during the Great Depression. 
 To keep a faltering country's economy in line with the euro ''is a tall and very unpleasant order,'' Mr. Vanags said.
 One of the constraints of joining the euro zone would be that Latvia would be unable to devalue its currency by printing more money. The current members of the euro zone that are weaker, like Spain and Portugal, are feeling such constraints now. 
 Despite some negative effects, devaluations have helped many countries over the years, giving a lift to their economies by making foreign goods more expensive and domestic goods more attractive.
 Latvia has already taken some steps that limit its ability to bolster its economy. Since 2004, the Latvian central bank has pegged its currency, the lat, to the euro, to prepare for adhering to the common currency. 
 In 2008, Latvia accepted austerity as a condition of a bailout led by the International Monetary Fund that allowed it to remain on track to adopt the euro. After sharply cutting salaries in the public sector, the government encouraged the private sector to do the same. The policy, in fact, worked to balance the trade deficit. But the country is now being severely hurt by the very policies needed to get into the euro zone.
 Andris Liepins, deputy minister of economy in Latvia, said in an interview that Latvia remained committed to a currency peg and to adopting the euro. ''Greece's problems are temporary,'' he said. ''Greece needs the same reforms as Latvia.''
 The austerity programs imposed by the I.M.F., Mr. Liepins said, would help Latvia's economy restructure over the long term, by cutting health care outlays and encouraging companies to become more efficient. Devaluing the currency would help only in the short term, he said. It would also push more homeowners to default on their mortgages, which are often denominated in foreign currencies. ''We would lose competitiveness as an economy,'' he said. 
 The policies should be judged three or four years from now, he said, when policies like encouraging outsourcing has made companies more competitive while creating opportunity for new small business. 
 Latvia's economy contracted an extraordinary 18 percent in 2009, according to preliminary figures. If the number holds, it would mark the sharpest contraction in the world, though it followed what was widely regarded as an unsustainable burst of growth just before the global crisis. 
 Casting about for ways to raise cash during the crisis, the Latvian government grasped at times at unconventional methods. 
 In January, it auctioned off a ghost town along with an abandoned Soviet radar base called Skrunda-1 for 1.5 million lats ($2.89 million). 
 A Russian company bought it. 
 The economy began growing slowly in the fourth quarter of last year. Rating agencies also noted an improved outlook on the country's creditworthiness. 
 Still, the government's reliance on layoffs and deep wage cuts has not been popular. 
 But the response has been more measured in the Baltic countries so far than in Greece, struggling with public employee strikes and protests. 
 Slava Ushakov, who had a small business, sympathizes with the employees of the Greek government. When his business failed in the recession, Mr. Ushakov took a job chipping ice from city sidewalks under a government work program. 
 When he slipped and broke a rib, his already meager pay was docked for the days that he had missed. So now he comes to work injured. ''I just wrapped it,'' Mr. Ushakov said, lifting his sweater and gingerly touching bandages.
 The work program, designed by the World Bank and partly financed by the European Union, pays Mr. Ushakov 100 lats ($192) a month. Still, the jobs are coveted, in a sign of the depth of troubles in Europe's most recession-plagued economy. 
 ''I am still working every day,'' Mr. Ushakov said. He added that these days in Latvia, ''if you want to buy a chicken, you have to think pretty highly of yourself.''

HEADLINE: At Pop-Ups, Chefs Take Chances With Little Risk

BYLINE: By GREGORY DICUM

 BODY:
Lung Shan is an unremarkable Chinese restaurant in the Mission District. But on Thursday and Saturday nights it's rocked by an invasion of diners and chefs with much more than sweet and sour pork on their minds. 
 On those nights, Lung Shan becomes Mission Street Food, one of a number of pop-up restaurants that have opened in the Bay Area over the last couple of years in spaces not normally used for fine dining.
On a recent Thursday, Tommy Halvorson, the chef that night, ignored Lung Shan's huge woks as he worked pans crammed onto its small stove. Behind him, Anthony Myint assembled sea urchin into sashimi with young coconut and candied pecans ($8). 
 Mr. Myint is the impresario behind Mission Street Food (2234 Mission Street near 18th Street, missionstreetfood.com). Each week he presses a different guest chef into service to feed the horde in the kitschily downscale dining room.
 ''The food here is creative and interesting,'' said Nick Lanham, a graduate student dining at a big table of friends. ''They go a little bit further. They can try out crazy stuff here.'' 
 That night, Mr. Myint featured small plates of chicken-fried beef jerky ($7), and Mr. Halvorson made gnocchi with Himalayan truffles ($8).
 By taking advantage of underused kitchens, pop-ups allow young chefs, many with experience in San Francisco's most highly regarded restaurants, to experiment without the risk of bankruptcy. And unlike underground supper clubs, they're completely legal.
 ''We just started with our own money,'' said Mark Bright, a sommelier who, along with the chef Joshua Skenes, runs Saison, a Friday through Sunday restaurant that operates out of a commercial kitchen behind Stable Cafe on Folsom Street (2124 Folsom Street near 17th Street, (415) 828-7990, saisonsf.com, reservations required). They started within two weeks of finding the space last July. 
 ''Even in this economic climate people are really out there trying to make things happen,'' said Mr. Halvorson, who also runs a pop-up called EAT on Monday at 111 Minna, a SOMA art gallery (111 Minna Street at Second Street, (415) 375-2321, eatat111minna.blogspot.com). ''Instead of crying because the bank won't give me $2 million to open a restaurant,'' he said, ''this is a way I can do it.''
 The most venerable of the lot might be Radio Africa & Kitchen, operated Thursday and Friday nights at Coffee Bar, a stylish cafe in the Mission (1890 Bryant Street at the corner of Florida and Mariposa Streets, (415) 420-2486, radioafricakitchen.com). Eskender Aseged has been cooking what he calls ''Red Sea meets Mediterranean'' for small gatherings since he came to the United States from his native Ethiopia more than two decades ago. When Coffee Bar opened three years ago, the owner invited Mr. Aseged to open Radio Africa & Kitchen there. (Coffee Bar also hosts another, more sporadic pop-up called Jet Set Chef -- thejetsetchef.com.)
 Mr. Aseged hopes one day to open his own restaurant, but he is in no hurry. A recent menu featured Tanzanian-style octopus ($18) and roasted leg of lamb with berbere sauce ($18). 
 A more casual pop-up is Pal's Takeaway, a counter inside a corner store that offers a few carefully considered sandwiches each day for lunch. Though it is invisible from the street, Pal's consistently draws crowds for things like five-spice roasted chicken sandwiches ($8) and homemade pickled vegetables ($4). (Inside Tony's Market, 2751 24th Street at Hampshire Street, (415) 203-4911, palstakeaway.com)
 Flexibility keeps these chefs loyal to the pop-up concept. Mr.Myint says his primary motivation is to use food to raise money for various causes. Thus far, Mission Street Food has had more than 60 guest chefs and, in 2009, contributed $22,000 to charities. 
 Last year Mr. Myint, whose brawny hands are covered in the burns and scars of his six years as a cook, also started Mission Burger, which serves juicy, sloppy burgers from the grill at Duc Loi, a Vietnamese supermarket ($8, which includes a dollar for charity, 2200 Mission Street at 18th Street, (415) 551-1772). Now he works seven days a week.
 At Saison, Mr. Skenes wanted to be able to riff on each week's best available ingredients, which means spending Mondays and Tuesdays calling farmers and suppliers and combing markets, then creating a seven- to eight-course prix fixe menu ($80, plus $50 for wine). Recent menu items include poularde in almond milk and flights of fish with hojiblanca olive oil. He also serves a $180 10- to 12-course meal (plus $60 for wine) for two or four people each night at the chef's table, nestled in the center of the action between the stoves and the walk-in freezer. 
 For his part, Mr. Myint is exploring a permanent restaurant, but he is seeking money in a manner true to the scrappy pop-up ethos: at the start of the month he announced on his blog that he's looking for 100 people to invest $500 each. ''There has been kind of a lot of response,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Programmer Indicted in Theft of Goldman Software

BYLINE: By JACK LYNCH

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors said Thursday that Sergey Aleynikov, a former computer programmer at Goldman Sachs, had been indicted on charges that he stole proprietary software that the firm uses to make rapid-fire trades in the financial markets. 
 The indictment accuses Mr. Aleynikov of theft of trade secrets, transporting stolen property in foreign commerce and unauthorized computer access. If convicted, Mr. Aleynikov would face up to 25 years in prison, the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan said.
 Mr. Aleynikov, who worked at Goldman until June 5, 2009, has pleaded not guilty to charges of theft and transporting trade secrets aboard. He left Goldman to join Teza Technologies, which hired him to develop its own version of a high-speed trading platform, prosecutors said.
 Court documents filed in July said Mr. Aleynikov was suspected of stealing Goldman's proprietary computer code that allows the firm to ''engage in sophisticated high-speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets.''
 Prosecutors say that Mr. Aleynikov, on his last day at Goldman, transferred substantial portions of Goldman's code to an outside computer server in Germany.
 Mr. Aleynikov ''encrypted the files and transferred them over the Internet without informing Goldman Sachs,'' the United States Attorney's Office said in a statement. ''After transferring the files, he deleted the program he used to encrypt the files and deleted his computer's 'bash history,' which records the most recent commands executed on his computer.''
 Prosecutors also asserted that Mr. Aleynikov, during time he was at Goldman, transferred thousands of files of computer code related to Goldman's proprietary trading program to his home computers.
 Prosecutors said Mr. Aleynikov flew to Chicago on July 2 to attend meetings at Teza's offices, bringing his laptop computer and another storage device that contained Goldman Sachs's proprietary source code. He was arrested on his return on July 3 as he got off a plane at Newark Liberty International Airport.
 ''In today's information age, a theft of valuable intellectual property represents a serious breach of economic security,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: How Not to Write a Jobs Bill

 BODY:
The jobs bill emerging in the Senate is pathetic, both as a response to joblessness and as an example of legislation deemed capable of winning bipartisan support. 
 An $85 billion proposal put forward Thursday morning by Max Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and by Charles Grassley, the committee's top Republican, scarcely began to grapple with the $266 billion in provisions for jobs and stimulus that President Obama proposed in his budget. It was not even in the same league as the modest House-passed $154 billion jobs bill. 
 Worse, about half of the proposal had nothing to do with new jobs. The single largest chunk, about $31 billion, went to renew expiring tax breaks that are generally useful but unrelated to jobs. Another $10 billion would renew an expiring Medicare payment formula so doctors wouldn't face a pay cut. 
 And, by Thursday afternoon, many Democrats said they could not support the lopsided proposal. So the majority leader, Harry Reid, decided to hold a vote on a stripped-down, $15 billion version in late February. The rest of the package, plus many other job-creation ideas, would be left for another day. 
 With 14.8 million Americans unemployed -- more than 40 percent of them for more than six months -- the smaller package is so puny as to be meaningless. Most of the $15 billion would cover the cost of a payroll tax holiday in 2010 for employers that hire unemployed workers. Since there are more than six unemployed workers for every job opening, a tax break for hiring is worth a try. But the proposed credit is too small to have a noticeable impact. At best, it would create about 250,000 additional jobs from April through the end of the year, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com. 
 An even bigger problem is that the hiring credit is unlikely to work as intended unless it's paired with other federal support to generate and maintain consumer demand -- mainly extended unemployment benefits and more fiscal aid to states. No matter what Congress does to lower the cost of labor, employers won't hire unless they believe demand will be sufficient to sell whatever the business produces. Absent unemployment benefits (which will expire at the end of February if Congress does not extend them) and aid to hard-pressed states, there are, as yet, no compelling signs that consumer demand will hold up this year. 
 At a minimum, a credible jobs package must extend unemployment benefits through 2010. Piecemeal extensions only ensure that lawmakers will have to return to the issue repeatedly, creating avoidable uncertainty for unemployed workers and for businesses that rely on the consumer demand generated by jobless benefits. 
 A credible package also must provide fiscal aid to states, which continue to be slammed by falling tax revenues just as more people need help. Without more aid, states will have to cut spending and raise taxes to close an estimated $142 billion budget gap for fiscal year 2011, which starts on July 1 for most states. Last year's gap was $125 billion. Next year's is anticipated to be $118 million.
 What senators don't understand or choose to ignore is that state budget cuts mean layoffs. State and local governments are among the nation's largest employers, responsible for 15 percent of the labor force, about the same share as the health care sector and far larger than manufacturing or the financial sector. Since August 2008, states and localities have eliminated 151,000 jobs. 
 State budget cuts also end or reduce payments to private contractors and to recipients of social programs. That reduces demand, which leads to more job loss.
 The $15 billion Senate proposal may win Republican votes, but better-than-nothing is not nearly good enough. Neither is a pledge to do more later. A full response to joblessness is already overdue.

HEADLINE: Cyberspying Fears Help Fuel China's Drive to Curb Internet

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Zhang Jing and Xiyun Yang contributed research from Beijing.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Deep inside a Chinese military engineering institute in September 2008, a researcher took a break from his duties and decided -- against official policy -- to check his private e-mail messages. Among the new arrivals was an electronic holiday greeting card that purported to be from a state defense office.
 The researcher clicked on the card to open it. Within minutes, secretly implanted computer code enabled an unnamed foreign intelligence agency to tap into the databases of the institute in the city of Luoyang in central China and spirit away top-secret information on Chinese submarines.
 So reported Global Times, a Communist Party-backed newspaper with a nationalist bent, in a little-noticed December article. The paper described the episode as ''a major security breach'' and quoted one government official who complained that such attacks were ''ubiquitous'' in China. 
 The information could not be independently confirmed, and such leaks in the Chinese news media often serve the propaganda or lobbying goals of government officials.
 Nonetheless, the story is one sign that while much of the rest of the world frets about Chinese cyberspying abroad, China is increasingly alarmed about the threat that the Internet poses to its security and political stability.
 In the view of both political analysts and technology experts here and in the United States, China's attempts to tighten its grip on Internet use are driven in part by the conviction that the West -- and particularly the United States -- is wielding communications innovations from malware to Twitter to weaken it militarily and to stir dissent internally.
 ''The United States has already done it, many times,'' said Song Xiaojun, one of the authors of ''Unhappy China,'' a 2009 book advocating a muscular Chinese foreign policy, which the party's propaganda department is said to promote. He cited the so-called color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia as examples. ''It is not really regime change, directly,'' he said. ''It is more like they use the Internet to sow chaos.''
 State media have vented those concerns more vociferously since Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton last month criticized China for censorship and called for an investigation of Google's assertion that its databases had been the target of a sophisticated attack from China. ''China wants to make clear that it too is under serious attack from spies on the Internet,'' said Cheng Gang, author of the Global Times article.
 Despite China's robust technological abilities, its cyberdefenses are almost certainly more porous than those of the United States, American experts say. To cite one glaring example, even Chinese government computers are frequently equipped with pirated software from Microsoft, they say. That means many users miss out on security upgrades, available to paying users, that fix security breaches exploited by hackers.
 Cybersecurity is a growing concern for most governments. While the United States probably has tighter defenses than China, for example, experts say it relies more heavily on computers to run its infrastructure and so is more vulnerable to an attack.
 But for China, worries about how foreign forces might employ the Internet and other communications advances to unseat the Communist Party are a salient factor in the government's 15-year effort to control those technologies. Chinese leaders are constantly trying to balance the economic and social benefits of online freedoms and open communications against the desire to preserve social stability and prevent organized political opposition.
 A distinct shift in favor of more comprehensive controls began nearly two years ago and hardened over the past six months, analysts say. 
 New policies are intended to replace foreign hardware and software with homegrown systems that can be more easily controlled and protected. Officials are also expanding the reach and resources of state-controlled media outlets so they dominate Chinese cyberspace with their blogs, videos and news. At the same time, the government is beefing up its security apparatus. Officials have justified stronger measures by citing various internal threats that they say escalated online. Among them: the March 2008 riots in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa; reported attempts to disrupt the August 2008 Olympic Games and the amassing of more than 10,000 signatures supporting a petition for human rights and democratic freedoms, an example of how democracy advocates could organize online.
 Especially alarming to officials, analysts say, was the role of the Internet in ethnic riots last July that left nearly 200 people dead and more than 1,700 injured -- the worst ethnic violence in recent Chinese history. Government reports asserted that terrorists, separatists and religious extremists from within and outside the country used the Internet to recruit Uighur youth to travel to Urumqi, the capital of western China's Xinjiang region, to attack ethnic Han citizens.
 In August, security and propaganda officials briefed China's ruling Politburo on their view of how the Xinjiang riots developed, according to one media executive with high-level government ties. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution for discussing delicate political topics. 
 China's leaders also reviewed how Iranian antigovernment activists used Twitter and other new communication tools to organize large street demonstrations against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over the summer. He said Chinese leaders saw the Iranian protests as an example of how the United States could use the new forms of online communication in a fashion that could one day be turned against China. 
 ''How did the unrest after the Iranian elections come about?'' People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, asked in a Jan. 24 editorial. ''It was because online warfare launched by America, via YouTube video and Twitter micro-blogging, spread rumors, created splits, stirred up and sowed discord.''
 Since the unrest in Iran and Xinjiang, Chinese leaders accelerated a raft of new initiatives, including closing thousands of Web sites, tightening censorship of text messages for lewd or ''unhealthy'' content and planning to converge China's Internet, phone and state television networks. They are also carefully cultivating homegrown alternatives to foreign computer technologies and foreign-based Web sites like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, all of which Chinese censors now block. The government says it needs the new controls to fight pornography, piracy and other illegal activity.
 In November, nearly 300 government officials and technicians gathered in Beijing for a seminar that stressed China's vulnerability in cyberspace.
 ''It is a long-existing reality that the West is stronger than us in terms of information security,'' said the seminar training manual, posted on the Web site of the Ministry of Public Security. 
 ''Most of the key technology and products in the information security sphere are held in the hands of Western countries, which leaves China's important information systems exposed to a bigger chance of being attacked and controlled by hostile forces,'' the manual said.
 The risks of dependence on foreign-made software became clear in 2008 after Microsoft deployed a new antipiracy program aimed at detecting and discouraging unauthorized users of its Windows operating system. In China, where an estimated four-fifths of computer software is pirated, the program caused millions of computer screens to go dark every hour and led to a public outcry. 
 New government procurement rules require state buyers to give preference to Chinese-made computers and communication products, among other supplies and services. But James Mulvenon, director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, a Washington-based consulting firm, said such orders were typically ignored.
 James A. Lewis, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research group, said China was caught between contradictory goals. The authorities want to keep using superior Western software so they can engage in espionage and defend themselves against foreign infiltration. ''But at the same time they want to use indigenous software, which is not up to par,'' he said.
 But China is pushing hard to catch up. Mr. Mulvenon describes China as ''absolutely the world leader'' in development of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) -- the successor to the current Internet. 
 Some suggest China aims to develop a more autonomous system equipped with stronger firewalls and filters. China's leaders ''have always had the ambition to develop the capability of one big domestic Intranet that they could manage more easily, if need be,'' one Communist Party newspaper editor said. But others suggest China is merely trying, like other nations, to respond to the reality that the existing IPv4 global Internet, in which the United States commands a disproportionate share of addresses, will soon run out of space.
 The clearest evidence of China's determination to wield greater control was the virtual communications blackout imposed over Xinjiang for six months after the July riots. Nineteen million residents in a region more than twice as big as Texas were deprived of text-messaging service, international phone calls and Internet access to all but a few government-controlled Web sites. The damage to tourism and business, not to mention the disruption to everyday life, was significant.
 Hu Yong, a Beijing-based media expert, said the government was no longer as worried as it once was about the economic impact of electronic communication controls.
 ''Now that is more secondary to their concerns about political and social stability,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What's Next, Mr. President?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
By 2008, Americans were disgusted with their government. They were sick of partisan gridlock and general incompetence. Along came Barack Obama offering to usher in a new era. It was time, he said, to put away childish things.
 There were actually two elements to the Obama campaign. First, he promised a less partisan government. Second, he promised a more activist government. His postpartisan style was accompanied by conventional Democratic policy substance. It was clear voters wanted the first element, but it was never clear how many wanted the second.
 Obama was inaugurated in the midst of an economic crisis, and the activist policy proposals took precedence. If, a year ago, you had been asked to describe the administration's goals in one sentence it would have been this: Barack Obama will usher in the third great wave of Democratic reform. Franklin Roosevelt had the New Deal. Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Obama would take the third step, transforming health care, energy, education, financial regulation and many other sectors of American life. 
 A distinct Obama governing style emerged, which was half Harvard Economics Department and half Boss Daley. The administration is staffed by smart pragmatists who are optimistic about the government's ability to devise comprehensive plans. Their proposals were processed by Congressional Old Bulls who made sure the legislation served Democratic interest groups.
 The stimulus package, the cap-and-trade legislation and the health care bill were all blends of expert planning and political power-broking. This project would have permanently changed government's role in national life.
 It was not to be. Voters are in no mood for a wave of domestic transformation. The economy is already introducing enough insecurity into their lives. Unlike 1932 and 1965, Americans do not trust Washington to take them on a leap of faith, especially if it means more spending.
 The country has reacted harshly to the course the administration ended up embracing. Obama is still admired personally, but every major proposal -- from the stimulus to health care -- is quite unpopular. Independent voters have swung against the administration. Voters are not reacting to the particulars of each bill. They are reacting against the total activist onslaught.
 A president can't lead a social transformation without a visceral bond with the center of the electorate and without being in step with the rhythm of the times. Obama is lacking these things. As a result, the original Obama project, the third Democratic wave, is dead.
 The administration resists this conclusion, just as it took the Bush administration a while to recognize that Social Security reform, and the larger privatization dream, was dead. But federal activism will not mark the next three years.
 The next challenge is to find a new project, a new one-sentence description of what this administration hopes to achieve. It is obvious: President Obama will show that this nation is governable once again. He should return to the other element in his original campaign.
 That would mean first leading a campaign of brazen honesty with the American people. He could lay out the fiscal realities and explain that voters cannot continue to demand programs they are unwilling to pay for.
 Second, he could propose some incremental changes in a range of areas and prove Washington can at least take small steps. Senator Lamar Alexander has been arguing that, given the climate of distrust, this is not a good period to push big, comprehensive reforms. He's right.
 Third, Obama could serve as a one-man model for bipartisan behavior. Right now, the Republicans have no political incentive to deal on anything. But the president could at least exemplify the kind of behavior voters want to see in their leaders. For example, he could take several of the Republican health care reform ideas -- like malpractice reform and lifting the regulatory barriers on state-based experimentation -- and proactively embrace them as part of a genuine compromise offer.
 Fourth, he could continue to champion his fiscal commission. Republicans are being completely hypocritical on this, unwilling to embrace an idea they once supported because it might lead to tax increases. If he really put aside the publicity gimmicks, he could illustrate the difference between responsible government and the permanent campaign.
 Fifth, it's time to have a constitutional debate. We might require amendments of one sort or another to fix the broken political system. 
 We can spend the next few years engaging in kabuki bipartisanship, in which each party puts on pseudo-events to show that the other party is rigid and rotten, or somebody can break the mold. We can spend the next three or seven years squabbling about the shrinking puddle of discretionary spending, or somebody can break out of the fiscal vice.
 It would be an incredible legacy: Barack Obama restored America's faith in its own institutions.

HEADLINE: Senators Strike Bipartisan Deal On Job Creation

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Key Democrats and Republicans in the Senate reached a rare bipartisan agreement on Thursday on steps to spur job creation. But Democratic leaders said they would move ahead on only some elements as the two parties maneuvered to address both the struggling economy and voter unrest over gridlock in Washington.
 Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, said he would take four core job-creating initiatives from the bipartisan proposal -- including tax breaks for businesses that hire unemployed workers and increased public works spending -- and seek to move those rapidly through the Senate. 
 ''We feel that the American people need a message,'' Mr. Reid said. ''The message that they need is that we're doing something about jobs.''
 Yet his decision to embrace only portions of the bipartisan plan developed by Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, caught some lawmakers by surprise and threatened to undermine Republican support for the proposal even as members of Congress and the White House sought ways of working together across party lines after months of deep partisan division. 
 The White House projected Thursday that unemployment would fall this year by only a little, if at all, and would remain well over 6 percent until 2015. 
 While Mr. Reid stripped out of the bipartisan bill some tax breaks and other provisions intended to win Republican support, as well as special-interest provisions to win the backing of specific senators, the scaled-back package retained a combination of tax cuts and spending with the potential to win support from both parties. 
 The centerpiece is a payroll tax holiday that would waive the 6.2 percent Social Security tax for any employer who hires a worker who has been out of a job for at least 60 days. In addition, the bill would provide a $1,000 income tax credit for every new employee retained for at least 52 weeks. 
 It would also extend a tax break that would allow businesses to write off up to $250,000 in capital investments in 2010 rather than depreciating the costs over time, and reauthorize spending on road and transit programs through the end of the year. And it would allow state and local governments to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of the interest paid on bonds that finance public works projects.
 The cost of the package laid out by Mr. Reid would be at least $15 billion over the next decade. 
 Hours before Mr. Reid's announcement, Mr. Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Mr. Grassley, the senior Republican on the panel, had unveiled a broader, $85 billion agreement that also included an array of other provisions intended to generate support. They included extended unemployment benefits and health care for the unemployed as well as the renewal of an array of tax breaks that are due to expire.
 That proposal had drawn backing from top Republicans and Democrats as well as the White House. Some of the authors of its provisions, including Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said they were left perplexed by Mr. Reid's decision to scale it back and were now unsure they could support any bill.
 ''Needless to say, Senator Hatch is deeply disappointed that the majority leader has abandoned a genuine bipartisan compromise only hours after it was unveiled in favor of business-as-usual, partisan gamesmanship,'' said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. Hatch, who helped write a provision suspending the payroll tax for companies that hire out-of-work people. 
 Democrats said Mr. Reid's hand was forced by objections from rank-and-file Democrats that the measure was not focused tightly enough on job creation and included too many corporate tax breaks they viewed as concessions to Republicans. 
 At the same time, they said, Republican leaders had made no firm commitment to support the measure and they feared they could face conservative attacks for extraneous provisions like disaster aid for Arkansas and Mississippi.
 ''I would prefer a jobs bill that simply focuses on some specific job-creating initiatives,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.
 The dust-up over the jobs bill reflects the difficulties the parties are finding in working together even as lawmakers from both sides realize that voters want to see more cooperation and less confrontation. And both sides are making overtures. 
 Also on Thursday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking Committee, and Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said they would cooperate in trying to overhaul regulation of the financial services industry after earlier bipartisan talks seemed to falter.
 The administration also continues to work to find Republican support for Mr. Obama's plan to create a bipartisan commission to rein in the budget deficit. In an interview with Bloomberg Business Week published Thursday, the president said he would set no preconditions on steps the commission might propose to bring the budget back toward balance, even if it meant consideration of tax increases on the middle class -- a step Mr. Obama vowed during the 2008 presidential campaign not to support.
 At the White House, Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's spokesman, encouraged lawmakers to find a way to work together.
 ''The American people want to see Washington put aside partisan differences and make progress on jobs,'' Mr. Gibbs said.
 Republicans were more receptive to the bipartisan jobs proposal than they have been to Democratic initiatives this year, but the leadership had not pledged its backing on the floor. On Thursday, before Mr. Reid pared back the bill, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called it a work in progress.
 The hesitation by top Republicans and the prospect that they would want to propose politically charged amendments made Democrats question whether the opposition was serious about cooperating and reminded them of Republican overtures on health care that later fell through. 
 Some Democrats noted that Mr. Baucus had spent months negotiating with Mr. Grassley on health care legislation only to come away empty-handed, ultimately costing the Senate valuable time on the issue.
 Mr. Reid said he still hoped to win some Republican backing for the trimmed-down jobs measure since they had professed to support the individual provisions.
 ''Republicans are going to have to make a choice,'' he said.
 But Republicans said that it was Mr. Reid who had made a choice, the wrong one.
 ''The majority leader pulled the rug out from work to build broad-based support for tax relief and other efforts to help the private sector recover from the economic crisis,'' said Jill Kozeny, a spokeswoman for Mr. Grassley.

New tax breaks for businesses: n Exempt employers from Social Security payroll taxes -- equal to 6.2 percent of wages up to a limit of $106,800 -- for hiring workers in 2010 who have been unemployed for at leaset 60 days. Provide a $1,000 income tax credit for new workers retained for a continuous 52 weeks.

HEADLINE: Obama Fares Better in Poll Than G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Adam Nagourney reported from Washington and Megan Thee-Brenan from New York. Reporting was contributed by Marjorie Connelly, Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
At a time of deepening political disaffection and intensified distress about the economy, President Obama enjoys an edge over Republicans in the battle for public support, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 While the president is showing signs of vulnerability on his handling of the economy -- a majority of respondents say he has yet to offer a clear plan for creating jobs -- Americans blame former President George W. Bush, Wall Street and Congress much more than they do Mr. Obama for the nation's economic problems and the budget deficit, the poll found.
 They credit Mr. Obama more than Republicans with making an effort at bipartisanship, and they back the White House's policies on a variety of disputed issues, including allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military and repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. 
 The poll suggests that both parties face a toxic environment as they prepare for the elections in November. Public disapproval of Congress is at a historic high, and huge numbers of Americans think Congress is beholden to special interests. Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans say members of Congress deserve re-election. 
 As the party in power, Democrats face a particular risk from any wave of voter discontent; unfavorable views of the Democratic Party are as high as they have been since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, though Republicans continue to register an even worse showing. The percentage of Americans who approve of Mr. Obama's job performance, 46 percent, is as low as it has been since he took office.
 Still, the poll suggests that Mr. Obama and his party have an opportunity to deflect the anger and anxiety if they can frame the election not as a referendum on the president and his party, but as a choice between them and a Republican approach that yielded results under Mr. Bush that much of the nation still blames for the country's woes. That is what the White House has been trying to do since the beginning of the year.
 For all the erosion in support for Mr. Obama, Americans say he better understands their needs and problems and has made more of an effort to be bipartisan than Congressional Republicans, the poll found.
 ''It feels like an attempt to sabotage the majority and to regain control of power rather than working on a compromise,'' John Smith, a Republican from Greenville, S.C., said of his party after participating in the poll.
 Americans say that Mr. Obama is far less likely to favor special interests over the American people than Congress. Mr. Obama and his party continue to have an edge over Republicans on which party would do better in dealing with health care and job creation. But Republicans have gained an edge on handling of the economy. 
 The public has lost much of its enthusiasm for a health care overhaul, and how Mr. Obama has managed it. He gets low marks for his handling of the deficit and the economy. And the fact that 56 percent of respondents think that Mr. Obama does not have a plan to create jobs is a distressing bit of news for a White House that in recent weeks had made an intensive effort to present Mr. Obama as concerned with the economy.
 But the public backs other elements of Mr. Obama's agenda. By a two-to-one ratio, Americans support an end to tax cuts for the wealthy, and Americans favor allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military. 
 The Tea Party movement, which has grown out of the strain of discontent, so far commands relatively little public support; 18 percent of respondents said they considered themselves supporters of the movement, while 55 percent said they had heard little or nothing about it. 
 The level of dissatisfaction with both political parties -- and the fact that 56 percent of Americans in the poll want a smaller government -- suggests that the Tea Party movement has an opportunity to draw more support. The poll found that 51 percent of Americans now view the Democratic Party unfavorably, nearly matching the highest in the history of the Times/CBS News poll. At the same time, 57 percent have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party.
 The nationwide telephone poll of 1,084 adults was taken from Feb. 5 through 10 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all adults.
 The poll found substantial pessimism: 62 percent of respondents said the country was heading in the wrong direction. And 70 percent of those polled said they thought it was going to take two years or longer for the effects of the recession that technically ended last year to fade away. 
 Three-quarters of the public disapproves of Congress, matching the highest level measured by the New York Times/CBS News Poll since it began asking the question in 1977. Four out of five voters thought Congress was more interested in serving special interests than voters.
 ''I think Congress and the Senate need to be completely revamped,'' said Michael Wish, 30, a Democrat from Medina, Ohio. He added, ''The old way of doing things is no longer working.''
 Americans appear hungry for an end to partisan infighting in Washington, so much so that half of respondents said the Senate should change the filibuster rules that Republicans have used to block Mr. Obama's agenda. Almost 60 percent said both Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans should compromise in the interest of consensus.
 But Mr. Obama is seen as making more of an effort to do that: 62 percent said Mr. Obama was trying to work with Congressional Republicans, while the same percentage said that Republicans were not trying to work with Mr. Obama.
 ''Obama is certainly trying,'' said Bonnie Ewasiuk, 60, of Woodbridge, Va. ''I'm a Republican so I don't like to go against the party, but Obama has reached out and had meetings and I don't think the Republicans are going to be responsive. All you see from them is negativity.''
 More than half of respondents said that Mr. Obama had not spent enough time trying to fix the economy, and nearly half said he had spent too much time trying to pass a health care bill.
 He scored better on other measures, particularly in comparison with Republicans; 60 percent said the president understood their problems, compared with 42 percent who said the same thing about Congressional Democrats and 35 percent for Congressional Republicans.

 Views of the Tea Party Movement (A18) GRAPHIC: How the Poll Was Conducted: The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 5 through 10 with 1,084 adults throughout the United States. The sample of land-line telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 69,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. To increase coverage, this land-line sample was supplemented by respondents reached through random dialing of cellphone numbers. The two samples were then combined. Interviewers made multiple efforts to reach every phone number in the survey, calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times, both day and evening. The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age, education and number of adults in the household. In addition, the land-line respondents were weighted to take account of the number of telephone lines into the residence, while the cellphone respondents were weighted according to whether they were reachable only by cellphone or also by land line. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results. Complete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/polls. (A18)

HEADLINE: Republicans And Medicare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Don't cut Medicare. The reform bills passed by the House and Senate cut Medicare by approximately $500 billion. This is wrong.'' So declared Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, in a recent op-ed article written with John Goodman, the president of the National Center for Policy Analysis.
 And irony died. 
 Now, Mr. Gingrich was just repeating the current party line. Furious denunciations of any effort to seek cost savings in Medicare -- death panels! -- have been central to Republican efforts to demonize health reform. What's amazing, however, is that they're getting away with it.
 Why is this amazing? It's not just the fact that Republicans are now posing as staunch defenders of a program they have hated ever since the days when Ronald Reagan warned that Medicare would destroy America's freedom. Nor is it even the fact that, as House speaker, Mr. Gingrich personally tried to ram through deep cuts in Medicare -- and, in 1995, went so far as to shut down the federal government in an attempt to bully Bill Clinton into accepting those cuts. 
 After all, you could explain this about-face by supposing that Republicans have had a change of heart, that they have finally realized just how much good Medicare does. And if you believe that, I've got some mortgage-backed securities you might want to buy.
 No, what's truly mind-boggling is this: Even as Republicans denounce modest proposals to rein in Medicare's rising costs, they are, themselves, seeking to dismantle the whole program. And the process of dismantling would begin with spending cuts of about $650 billion over the next decade. Math is hard, but I do believe that's more than the roughly $400 billion (not $500 billion) in Medicare savings projected for the Democratic health bills.
 What I'm talking about here is the ''Roadmap for America's Future,'' the budget plan recently released by Representative Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee. Other leading Republicans have been bobbing and weaving on the official status of this proposal, but it's pretty clear that Mr. Ryan's vision does, in fact, represent what the G.O.P. would try to do if it returns to power. 
 The broad picture that emerges from the ''roadmap'' is of an economic agenda that hasn't changed one iota in response to the economic failures of the Bush years. In particular, Mr. Ryan offers a plan for Social Security privatization that is basically identical to the Bush proposals of five years ago.
 But what's really worth noting, given the way the G.O.P. has campaigned against health care reform, is what Mr. Ryan proposes doing with and to Medicare.
 In the Ryan proposal, nobody currently under the age of 55 would be covered by Medicare as it now exists. Instead, people would receive vouchers and be told to buy their own insurance. And even this new, privatized version of Medicare would erode over time because the value of these vouchers would almost surely lag ever further behind the actual cost of health insurance. By the time Americans now in their 20s or 30s reached the age of eligibility, there wouldn't be much of a Medicare program left.
 But what about those who already are covered by Medicare, or will enter the program over the next decade? You're safe, says the roadmap; you'll still be eligible for traditional Medicare. Except, that is, for the fact that the plan ''strengthens the current program with changes such as income-relating drug benefit premiums to ensure long-term sustainability.''
 If this sounds like deliberately confusing gobbledygook, that's because it is. Fortunately, the Congressional Budget Office, which has done an evaluation of the roadmap, offers a translation: ''Some higher-income enrollees would pay higher premiums, and some program payments would be reduced.'' In short, there would be Medicare cuts.
 And it's possible to back out the size of those cuts from the budget office analysis, which compares the Ryan proposal with a ''baseline'' representing current policy. As I've already said, the total over the next decade comes to about $650 billion -- substantially bigger than the Medicare savings in the Democratic bills.
 The bottom line, then, is that the crusade against health reform has relied, crucially, on utter hypocrisy: Republicans who hate Medicare, tried to slash Medicare in the past, and still aim to dismantle the program over time, have been scoring political points by denouncing proposals for modest cost savings -- savings that are substantially smaller than the spending cuts buried in their own proposals.
 And if Democrats don't get their act together and push the almost-completed reform across the goal line, this breathtaking act of staggering hypocrisy will succeed.

HEADLINE: Zuckerman Is Said to Be Weighing Bid for Senate Seat Held by Gillibrand

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Could another media mogul be looking to make a splash in New York politics? 
 Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the real estate tycoon and publisher of The Daily News, is considering a bid for the Senate seat now held by Kirsten E. Gillibrand, according to two people told of the discussions. 
 Mr. Zuckerman regards Ms. Gillibrand as vulnerable to a challenge and is hoping that, at a time of economic tumult and political unrest, his background as an outsider to government, and his record as a business executive, will appeal to the state's electorate, these people said. 
 He would be the latest boldface name to weigh a run for the seat this fall; a former Tennessee congressman, Harold E. Ford Jr., is mulling a primary run against Ms. Gillibrand, a fellow Democrat, and will make a decision in the next few weeks. 
 The discussions were preliminary, the two people cautioned, with many details of a possible candidacy yet to be worked out. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were meant to be private and Mr. Zuckerman had not made up his mind.
 Mr. Zuckerman is considering whether to commission a poll to test the viability of a candidacy, one of the people said.
 A Zuckerman spokesman, Ken Frydman, declined to address any discussions that Mr. Zuckerman might have had about a Senate run, or any plans to conduct a poll. 
 Mr. Frydman said Mr. Zuckerman was unavailable for comment on Friday afternoon, but he added in a statement that the publisher ''is not interested in running for public office.'' 
 Mr. Zuckerman, 72, has long sought a national platform. He has cut a wide swath through the media landscape, buying and selling magazines like The Atlantic and writing a regular column for U.S. News & World Report, which he owns. 
 Though not currently enrolled in a party, he is known as a Democrat. But if he ran for the Senate, it would very likely be as a Republican or independent so he could avoid a costly primary. 
 As a candidate, Mr. Zuckerman would be following the path of a close friend and fellow media executive, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican to run for office.
 Mr. Zuckerman, whose fortune is estimated to be about $2 billion, owes most of his wealth to the real estate industry. He co-founded Boston Properties, which owns and manages office buildings in New York and elsewhere, in 1970, and is now chairman of the board. He bought The Daily News in 1993.
 If he enters the race, Mr. Zuckerman would quite likely have to relinquish management of the newspaper, one of New York City's three biggest dailies, much the way Mr. Bloomberg handed over day-to-day control of his company, Bloomberg L.P., when he ran for mayor in 2001. 
 Mr. Zuckerman is an outspoken supporter of Israel, and over the last few years, he has become a high-profile student of the national economy, raising his visibility through television appearances on shows like ''Meet the Press'' and in newspaper and magazine opinion articles. He recently attended a White House economic forum. 
 Mr. Zuckerman, a resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was born in Quebec. He is now an American citizen.

HEADLINE: Two Florists Fight Back as Sweet Smell of Success Turns Sour

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
They came to New York from places a half-world apart: Jorge Calle is from Ecuador and Seung Yoon Park, known as Justin, is from Korea. But they followed similar paths in this city of immigrants, marrying, working, saving money and eventually buying flower shops 15 blocks apart in Queens.
 And business was good even as the economy soured. But about a year ago things started going downhill: supermarkets and delis all around them began, one after another, selling flowers from sidewalk stands for as little as a quarter of the prices that the two florists charged. 
 ''There's so much competition, they're killing flower shops and they're killing each other,'' said Mr. Park, 52, who bought Woodside Florist on Roosevelt Avenue, under the No. 7 train's stop at 61st Street, in 2003. The store has been around since 1923.
 For months, all the two florists did was lament their plight, a situation repeated throughout the city. But with Mr. Park struggling to pay rent, Mr. Calle drawing from his savings to pay his workers and their once brisk Valentine's Day sales dragging, they decided to fight back. 
 They hired a lawyer recommended by a wholesale flower merchant. They spoke out at community board meetings. They wrote to their councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer, and filed complaints with the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, homing in on supermarket owners who they claimed were renting sidewalk space to third-party vendors, which is illegal.
 It is a sort of little guy vs. big guy battle that they have waged in obscurity, using little more than pencil, paper and patience. Mr. Calle, who owns Flowers by Giorgie on Greenpoint Avenue near 46th Street, in Sunnyside, and Mr. Park said they never had much hope they could come out winners. But as it turns out, they might indeed enjoy a measure of victory in the end.
 City officials are investigating their complaints. The city allows grocers to sell produce, flowers, candy, soft drinks, ice cream and cigarettes from sidewalk stands outside their stores, but they must first obtain what are known as stoop-line-stand licenses, and they are the only ones allowed to operate the stands. The stands must provide receipts that list the business's name, address and license number, which Mr. Calle and Mr. Park say the stands near their flower shops do not do.
 Shin Jong-Un, who said he was the owner of a sidewalk flower stand near Mr. Calle's shop, said that he rents the space from the adjacent Key Food supermarket.
 Asked if he knew that renting the sidewalk space was probably illegal, he replied, ''My English not so good'' and would not answer any more questions. The supermarket's owner could not be reached for comment.
 Many supermarkets, like Key Food, are trying to be creative about finding new ways to generate revenue ''because of the cost of doing business in the city,'' said Nelson Eusebio, executive director of the National Supermarket Association. But, he added, they should abide by the law.
 From his store, Mr. Park can see the big sign hanging from the stand outside Food Dynasty on Roosevelt Avenue, a half-block away, advertising 24 roses for $10; he charges $3 per rose, The price is standard among florists in Queens, he said, and enough to cover his expenses and support his family. 
 He has not cut his prices, and as a result, he said, he has lost a lot of customers. Mr. Calle, on the other hand, lowered his price to $10 to match Mr. Jong-Un's just to keep people coming into his shop, he said. ''We still sell a lot, but for almost 50 percent of the price we used to sell for,'' Mr. Calle, 45, said. ''If I only make 50 cents or $1 for each person that comes here, I cannot survive.''
 Mr. Van Bramer had been in office barely a month when he first heard about the florists' complaints and wondered how many others might be in the same predicament. He assigned a constituent liaison to investigate. The task included buying flowers from one of the stands and asking for a receipt, which the sales clerk could not provide, he said. 
 ''These are tough times, so we want to make sure that if there's competition, it is legal and it is fair,'' Mr. Van Bramer said.
 Elizabeth Miller, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Affairs Department, said that after Mr. Park complained, inspectors issued a violation against a vendor near his shop for taking payments outside the store. (City rules require that even if a product is sold at a sidewalk stand, it has to be paid for inside.) Ms. Miller said she could not comment on any other investigations.
 Mr. Calle has worked with flowers for most of his 20 years in New York, but it was only five years ago that he was able to buy his own shop, where he employs five people, including his wife, Carmen. At the time, he signed an agreement that he would not sell greeting cards, because someone else on the block already sold them.
 ''We're all small-business owners and we should all help one another,'' he explained.
 Mr. Park moved to New York in 1980 to study psychology, but said that he did not have the money and language skills required to do so. Instead, he sold life insurance and satellite TV subscriptions and owned a gift shop and a greeting-card store in Brooklyn before he bought his flower shop, where he works with his wife, Yearn Sun Park. 
 ''I thought I could semiretire, silly me,'' he said. ''Now I'm stuck here.''
 Mrs. Park was quietly shaving dried leaves off flower stems, but then she spoke up, her voice crackling as if she were about to cry.
 ''We don't feel comfortable doing this, complaining,'' she said. ''But otherwise, how do we go on?''

HEADLINE: Getting Faster With Age: Sam Shepard's New Velocity

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
When Sam Shepard directed the original 1985 Off Broadway production of his play ''A Lie of the Mind,'' about emotionally scarred young men and the damaged women in their lives, the production ran six hours at first. His latest play, ''Ages of the Moon,'' about two emotionally scarred men in their 60s (the damaged women remain offstage) lasts about 80 minutes.
 Time, in other words, has started slipping away in the Shepard canon, and the playwright could not be more at peace with that.
 ''I see my older plays as clunky relatives to the ones I'm doing now, to be honest, and I don't have a great deal of interest in those older plays,'' Mr. Shepard, who is also an actor, said in an interview over a late lunch in Manhattan recently. He added, ''I've come to feel that if I can't make something happen in under an hour and a half, it's not going to happen in a compelling way in a three-hour play.'' 
 Mr. Shepard, who won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1979 for his play ''Buried Child,'' and is also the author of ''True West'' and more than 40 other plays, has always been a writer of economy, even when his men of few words take three acts to say them. Now, at 66, he has increasingly delved into punchy, pithy reflection, with ''Ages of the Moon'' -- at the Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea through March 21 -- centered on a pair of friends, Ames and Byron, speaking about loss and regret from the vantage point of later life. It's easy to imagine Shepard himself on the play's front porch, staring into the past as the moon begins to rise.
 ''Ages'' is part of a busy, ruminative winter for Mr. Shepard. ''A Lie of the Mind'' is receiving its first revival Off Broadway, directed by Ethan Hawke and opening on Thursday at the Acorn Theater. Last month Alfred A. Knopf published a new collection of his short stories, poems and narrative sketches, ''Day Out of Days,'' that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks he has carried with him over the years. And soon he will begin filming his latest movie, playing an older Butch Cassidy in ''Blackthorn,'' a kind of sequel set 15 years after the events of ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
 Having a new play and a major revival at the same time is an unusual experience for most writers, but it has been a profitable learning moment for Mr. Shepard: an opportunity to reflect on where he has been, and where he is today.
 ''I have to admit, with this experience with 'Lie of the Mind,' I've come to see it as a bit of an awkward play,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''If you were to talk about it in terms of cars, it's like an old, broken-down Buick that you kind of hold together to just get down the road. All of the characters are in a fractured place, broken into pieces, and the pieces don't really fit together. So it feels kind of rickety to me now.''
 ''Whereas this new play, 'Ages,' is like a Porsche,'' he continued. ''It's sleek, it does exactly what you want it to do, and it can speed up but also shows off great brakes.''
 The critics haven't been entirely enamored of ''Ages of the Moon''; when it opened in late January, Ben Brantley of The New York Times found that ''the show doesn't exert that unsettling visceral charge you associate with Mr. Shepard at his best.'' 
 Still, the review continued, ''it is a poignant and honest continuation of themes that have always been present in the work of one of this country's most important dramatists, here reconsidered in the light and shadow of time past.'' 
 Amid the introspection in ''Ages of the Moon'' is the largely unspoken but obvious role that alcohol has played in Ames's dissipation. 
 In the interview Mr. Shepard said he got sober in late January 2009, a few weeks after he was stopped in central Illinois and charged with speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty a month later and was ordered to pay a fine, finish an alcohol treatment program and perform community service. 
 ''I continue to struggle with it,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''You sometimes use the excuse, 'I'm a writer, dammit, I can do anything I want,' but that doesn't work. In my later plays, especially, alcohol is there -- not as a moral issue, but as a disaster. And in my case, it's a real disaster.''
 These days Mr. Shepard is a grounded, hands-on presence in the rehearsal room. The actor Stephen Rea, who stars with Sean McGinley in ''Ages,'' said Mr. Shepard was like a technician, fine-tuning the dialogue with precision.
 ''He is very, very clear about what works and what doesn't,'' said Mr. Rea, who plays Ames. ''Recently he added a short line because he knew a laugh was needed, and he knew we weren't getting the laugh with the line that had been there.'' 
 Mr. Rea declined to reveal the line, saying it would give away a key part of the play. ''It's just two words, but now we get a laugh,'' he added. ''Sam hears his plays musically, and the laughter is part of the music.''
 Mr. Shepard himself describes his writing process as a composer might discuss creating a score. Both forms at their heart tell a story, through tempo and pacing and cadence, he said. In his work, conflict and violence, especially, take on an almost lyrical quality in the signature confrontations he stages among family members and friends. 
 ''For me, playwriting is and has always been like making a chair,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''Your concerns are balance, form, timing, lights, space, music. If you don't have these essentials, you might as well be writing a theoretical essay, not a play.''
 ''Violence and conflict are part of the music,'' he added. ''There's no way to escape the fact that we've grown up in a violent culture, we just can't get away from it, it's part of our heritage. I think part of it is that we've always felt somewhat helpless in the face of this vast continent. Helplessness is answered in many ways, but one of them is violence.''
 Neil Pepe, the artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company, said he wanted to produce ''Ages of the Moon'' -- the Atlantic's first Shepard work -- because he was drawn to its two characters as shades of the archetypal Shepard men who have dominated his plays for the last 45 years.
 ''It was so exciting to me that Sam was getting into this new territory of older male characters dealing with regrets and whether they went the right way,'' Mr. Pepe said. ''There's a wonderful stillness and simplicity in these reflections, such as a speech that Sean has at the end about the play -- it's classic, beautifully executed Shepard.''
 In that speech Byron discloses some shocking news to Ames, then comforts himself by recalling a recent, ruminative walk around his hometown. ''Magpies were squawking in the cottonwoods, and a little black-haired boy was throwing rocks at an oil can,'' Byron says. 
 Referring to his wife, he continues: ''I carried her out by the highway, and we watched the cars and trucks sailing by, heading out to El Paso, south to Mexico, or limping into town with red dust from somewhere covering their windshields. We just stood there while they all floated by in every direction. One old man in a stake truck stopped, asked if we needed a ride. I told him no -- we lived there.''
 Mr. Shepard, who has lived with the actress Jessica Lange since the 1980s, is already at work on a new play, one with 12 characters that will likely be longer than the 80-minute ''Ages,'' but not by much. He said that ''Ages'' and his short stories captured where he was as a writer today, more than 30 years after the fertile 1970s period when most Shepard scholars say he did his greatest work.
 ''There is this aura that the three-act play is the important one, it's the one that you do to win the Pulitzer,'' he said. ''Some part of you falls for that, and then after a while you don't fall for that. What I'm after is something different than supplying people with the idea that I'm writing an important play. At this point, I'm writing for me.''

HEADLINE: An Enigmatic Land of Great Expectations

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. 

 BODY:
It is unlikely that anything resembling the impressive Levine Museum of the New South would exist anywhere else. A museum of the New North or the New East would be merely peculiar, but here the term ''New South'' has a venerable heritage, recalling unrealized hopes and great expectations. There is also much at stake in trying to understand just what the term really means. 
 It came into use in the aftermath of the Civil War, signifying the changes that had to take place in the Old South. A rural agricultural world dependent on slave labor had to remake itself under the tutelage and dominance of the industrial North. This imposition of liberal modernity and urban life incorporated a demand for social transformation, an urgent call for restructuring the economy and a conviction that the South's deepest beliefs must be jettisoned. It called for a full-scale reinvention. But there was little follow-through, so in the decades that followed Reconstruction, the process was punctuated by reversions and rebellions. The New South was always contested terrain. 
 Is there another region of the United States, in fact, where such reinvention was so necessary yet so regularly fraught with violence, nostalgia, outrage and controversy? Even now, when Newness is firmly established, you can find remnants of old tensions. In Greensboro, N.C., this month, the International Civil Rights Center and Museum opened, thrusting the visitor back into the full horrors of Southern Jim Crow segregation in the first half of the 20th century -- laws and customs that undid the Reconstruction's conception of the New South with a vengeance. The museum reminds us of the cost and pain involved in revoking them in turn.
 But a short walk away, at the Greensboro Historical Museum, vengeance takes another form by conjuring the issue out of existence. Race is almost completely erased, not through egalitarian vision but through gauzy, nostalgic reconstructions. A new exhibition at this museum is planned for later this year, but in the meantime, one show here imagines a seemingly pastoral past, depicting daily life in 1902 Greensboro. In one scene a well-dressed black man stands in a plaza before the town's courthouse; you can walk into re-creations of Greensboro's first movie theater, its main drugstore and its one-room schoolhouse -- all said to capture the birth of the ''New South'' city. 
 This is less than convincing, and another exhibition -- the largest in the museum -- goes even further awry, as far as New South ideals are concerned. It is drawn from what may be the world's largest collection of Confederate firearms: more than 140 Civil War rifles and guns are displayed from Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia, Oklahoma, Texas and other states. The racks of rifles and artifacts seem to invoke the former power of the Old South, aggressively turning away from any hint of the New.
 So the achievement of the Levine Museum of the New South, which opened in 1991, should not be underestimated. Its main permanent exhibition, ''Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers: Charlotte and the Carolina Piedmont in the New South,'' is an attempt to recount the history of the South, beginning with the years after the Civil War, when Charlotte was a rural backwater with just over 2,000 citizens. 
 Then came the railroad and the first factories, the development of local textile mills (some, like Cannon, with still-familiar names), the expansion of trade, urbanization, the civil rights movement, busing controversies and, finally, contemporary Charlotte: a city of immigration, banking and business. 
 Along the way, the show offers a cotton gin and samples of seed cotton; selections of 19th-century banjo and fiddle music; and accounts of racism, child labor and strikes. There are also mill-hand songs, celebrations of Charlotte's black musicians and white folk culture, and reports of religious belief and political dissent.
 The Levine's president, Emily Zimmern, pointed out in an interview at the museum that in coming months the exhibition was being revised and that the final galleries would require particular attention: the show's concluding section currently notes the triumph of banking in Charlotte -- a business that is not quite what it used to be. (Bank of America, a major presence here, has less luster; and Wachovia, headquartered in Charlotte, was bought by Wells Fargo.)
 Over all, the museum's historical account could sound almost ... ordinary. But that is actually one of the virtues of this show, which was first mounted in 2002 by the museum's historian, Thomas W. Hanchett (based on his book ''Sorting Out the New South City''). Spend enough time at many Southern historical museums and you see that the ability to tell a straightforward history -- one filled with details about race without being possessed by it, engrossed in Southern possibilities without excessive celebration, and packed with Southern failures without being overcome by guilt -- is not easy. It is strange just how contested and vulnerable the ordinary is, for both the victims of racial hatred and for those who chronicle it. But the Levine's dispassionate survey is so effective that, at least until this year's budget cuts, a visit here was a required field trip for the county's eighth graders.
 Mr. Hanchett's account also suggests some surprising things about the development of Southern cities. The segregated Southern city of the mid-20th century, he argues, originated not in the Old South or the early decades of the New; during those periods, he points out, the distribution of races throughout the city was in a ''salt and pepper'' pattern. Urban segregation, Mr. Hanchett suggests, was a later creation, part of the rebellion against Reconstruction. Segregation was not a tradition; it was literally reactionary, a 20th-century reversal. 
 It is also illuminating to discover that the typical Southern city, whose image, until recently, has been a strange combination of antebellum charm, post-Reconstruction brutishness and post-civil rights racial tension, is also being supplanted. In 2009 the museum opened an exhibition, ''Changing Places,'' that is compelling for what it reflects about the continuing evolution of the New South.
 ''For most of its history, the South was America's poorest region,'' the wall text tells us. ''People left the South to seek opportunity. But since the 1970s, that's changed.'' 
 With the growth of businesses, the rise of air-conditioning and the success of the civil rights movement, the South has now become a destination for immigration. We are told that Mecklenburg County, which surrounds Charlotte, has a population of about 827,000; 24 percent were born in the United States, outside the South, and 13 percent were foreign-born. The largest immigrant group, from Latin America, constitutes 7 percent of the population. Indeed, the show notes, the Southeast now has the fastest-growing Latino population in the nation. 
 Moreover, this increase in diversity has resulted not in segregated neighborhoods defined by race or ethnicity, but in neighborhoods that are differentiated by income. The era of urban Chinatowns or Little Italys is gone: in the New South, immigration is to suburban areas with mixed populations. Living choices are not made based on the need for support or to avoid hostility, but to find the best affordable conditions.
 The theme of the exhibition, though, is that this is not always a comfortable situation; cross-cultural encounters lead to misunderstandings and divisions. The show is meant to be an educational corrective. The interest here, though, is not in its familiar multicultural approach, but in its locale, providing a sign of what the New South now means. 
 The novelty of the immigrant phenomenon here also leads to spots of real originality. In one demonstration visitors are asked to gauge their sensations when standing at varying distances opposite a life-size mannequin: distances for holding conversations comfortably, we learn, are 24 to 30 inches for Americans, 36 inches for the Japanese, and 8 to 12 inches for Middle Easterners. And one of the more vibrant aspects of the show are bulletin boards where visitors are asked to post their reactions to varied questions, like, ''When have you had problems communicating in Charlotte?''
 One visitor writes, ''I didn't know a toboggan was a hat and not just a sled.'' A Chicagoan notes, ''I get very lost when I take directions from a Southerner.''
 Some of the exhibition's elements, like its discussion of ethnic foods and family customs, would be routine or even obvious in the Old North, but in the New South, it has a different effect, a novel accent. 
 There is an appealing integrity in the way the museum takes on its subjects. (A few years ago I saw a fascinating show here about images of the South in newspaper comic strips.) In the future the museum should also take on more controversy-laden topics, examining, perhaps, the romance of the South, or the evolution of contentious racial politics in the region during the last 30 years. 
 But in the meantime, the Levine museum reflects the mixture of the traditional and the iconoclastic, the combination of a weighty past and an ever-shifting present, that characterize the idea of the New South and may even, one day, make that concept obsolete.
 The Levine Museum of the New South is at 200 East Seventh Street, Charlotte, N.C.; (704) 333-1887, museumofthenewsouth.org.

HEADLINE: Surprising Strength in January Retail Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sales at retailers were unexpectedly strong last month, suggesting consumers were feeling a little more comfortable about spending, which could improve prospects for first-quarter economic growth.
 Retail sales rose 0.5 percent as consumers stepped up spending not only on essential goods but on luxury items as well, the Commerce Department said on Friday. 
 Optimism over the increase was tempered by a separate report showing that consumer sentiment declined slightly early this month. But analysts dismissed the slip as insignificant and focused on the gain in sales as a hopeful economic sign.
 ''After considerable hand-wringing about the underlying strength of retail sales in the past few months, this is a solid report. It indicates the recovery is on track,'' said Brian A. Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
 Retail sales are being closely watched to determine whether consumers can sustain the economy's recovery once the government stimulus and the gains from restocking by businesses wane.
 The January sales increase came in above the 0.3 percent economists had forecast, and sales data for December and November were also revised upward. 
 While the report on consumer confidence indicated worries over unemployment, the slight slip left intact a longer-term trend toward improvement.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers' preliminary index of sentiment came in at 73.7 for February, down from 74.4 in late January but up from 56.3 a year ago. Analysts had expected a rise to 75.0.
 ''February's retracement does not seem to signal a fundamental shift in sentiment and is not likely to mean much for spending patterns in the months ahead,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn.
 Analysts, who are also tracking the impact of recent severe winter weather on the economy, said the year's strong start to sales augured well for first-quarter spending and growth.
 ''Even folding in potentially weak February consumption as a result of severe weather and automaker difficulties, it appears that real consumer spending is on a 2.5-3 percent quarterly trajectory,'' said Steven Wieting, an economist at Citigroup. A second report on Friday from the Commerce Department showed that business inventories slipped 0.2 percent in December after rising 0.5 percent in November.
 Analysts said the decline was smaller than the government had estimated when it released figures on fourth-quarter economic growth last month.

HEADLINE: Saving A Place To Bump Into People

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
On Wednesday afternoon, as the snowstorm rested between squalls, all seemed as it should at Bread Stuy, a coffeehouse on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn. 
 The small wooden tables were occupied by patrons in earphones tapping away at laptops, as a line formed for lattes, panini and fresh-baked pastries. Beneath the warm orange glow of the walls and a heat lamp, one of the owners, Hillary Porter, quietly directed workers from a banquette while her 16-month-old daughter, Maclemore, slept on her lap.
 Just one week earlier, the place was less welcoming, with its gates drawn and a bright red ''Seized'' sticker slapped on the front door, courtesy of federal marshals. In business since 2004, Ms. Porter and her husband, Lloyd, both 39, ran into tax trouble starting in 2008 as they lost customers to the recession, they said, and the government would not let them reopen until they had paid $10,000 in penalties. 
 But their neighbors rallied, giving money and throwing three fund-raisers that yielded enough for the shop to reopen.
 That urgent, emotional response, from customers and fellow business owners along the strip in Stuyvesant Heights, surprised even the Porters. There are several nearby spots offering specialty coffees and baked goods, and though the couple is active in the neighborhood, playing Mr. and Mrs. Claus at Christmas each year, other merchants lead community efforts, too. 
 Somehow, after less than six years in operation, Bread Stuy -- like other coffeehouses in other places -- has come to embody the aspirations of a gentrifying neighborhood now threatened by the downturn. Locals see it as a linchpin in their fragile economy.
 Jonathan Landau, who lives near the shop and held one of the fund-raisers, said he moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant two years ago from the Upper West Side because he was looking for the sense of community he found here, with the ''Sesame Street''-like brownstone stoop culture and ethos of neighbors helping neighbors.
 ''A coffee shop like Bread-Stuy offers a space where that can quote-unquote brew,'' Mr. Landau said with a chuckle. He added that he also liked the respite it offered from the ''bodegas and Chinese joints selling junk food.''
 Like the town tavern of old or the soda fountain of the 1950s, a coffeehouse helps build a sense of community, serving as a rare public space where people can bump into each other, share affinities or enjoy their ''solitude in company,'' as Mark Pendergrast, who wrote a history of coffee, ''Uncommon Grounds,'' put it in an interview. 
 ''Human beings are social creatures, and we've become less and less social,'' he said. ''We spend more and more time in front of our computers or our televisions, and we go to our work and we come home.''
 So the coffeehouse -- a so-called third place, beyond home and work, that the sociologist Ray Oldenburg has posited is crucial to developing a sense of place, civic engagement and democracy -- offers an ever-dwindling opportunity ''to share an experience in public,'' Mr. Pendergrast said. 
 Coffee shops have become driving forces in gentrifying areas, with merchant groups and development advocates looking to establish cafes to seed other types of mom-and-pop activity.
 In Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, a politically engaged coffeehouse called Vox Pop caused a minor sensation when it opened on Cortelyou Road in 2004, quickly becoming a symbol for what some saw as the neighborhood's new cachet. It, too, has struggled financially in recent years, and it has managed to survive in part by selling shares to customers. 
 Jan Rosenberg, a sociologist and real estate agent who has been active in spurring commercial development in the neighborhood, helped lure an outlet of the small chain Connecticut Muffin nearby. Now she is looking for a cafe for Newkirk Avenue a few blocks away. 
 ''It brings a flock of people to a street -- everyone likes a good cup of coffee -- and it gives them a chance to sit down and bump into each other,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It's simple, really, but if you don't have that and you're always getting the train to go to work and getting your coffee there, you don't have those bump-into-someone experiences, and that's important in a city neighborhood.''
 It is a role that Bread Stuy, which took over and expanded a coffee shop run by another owner, has clearly come to play on Lewis Avenue. 
 ''It's no longer just a place for people to go in and drink their coffee -- it's part of the fabric of the community,'' said Crystal Bobb-Semple, whose Brownstone Books, opened in 2000, sits a few doors away. ''It's all about creating a better neighborhood.''
 While they are not yet on secure footing, the Porters say they are grateful that they are able to continue playing a role in that process. Having run through their savings and being unable to leverage their home, they thought they would simply have to move back to Oakland, Calif., where they lived before coming to New York in 2000. 
 But the generosity of the neighborhood -- one woman gave Mr. Porter $25 on the street ''for milk and Pampers,'' he said, reducing him to tears -- has given the couple new resolve. ''Every day, I am making coffee with a purpose,'' he said. ''Like, 'I am going to make the best cup of coffee in America.' We're going to make this happen.''

HEADLINE: One Man Creates Ultimate Duel

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
Circle April 9 on the calendar; make your travel plans to Hot Springs, Ark., and keep good thoughts in your heart that Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta remain healthy. You don't want to miss their showdown that Friday in the Apple Blossom Handicap at one of the most charming, best-run racetracks in the nation.
 While you are anticipating what could be the greatest thing to happen to thoroughbred racing in America since Affirmed captured the Triple Crown in 1978, raise a glass to Charles Cella, the president of Oaklawn Park, who put the race together. 
 He is a racetrack owner in the oldest and most noble sense of the term. 
 For nearly 100 years, and over three generations, the Cella family has run a top-flight racetrack in the hills of Arkansas by sticking to a simple rule: ''We're all about the horse.'' 
 I heard him say those exact words last spring to the man in charge of his racetrack's marquee on the morning of the Rebel Stakes. 
 ''As soon as they cross the finish line, I want you to have the winner's name up in lights,'' Cella told him. ''We have a nice gaming room with a loyal following, but remember, we're all about the horse.''
 He has no shareholders to placate, so he has not tried to buy other racetracks like Churchill Downs Inc., or develop shopping centers and overpriced restaurants on his properties, as Frank Stronach has at Magna-owned tracks.
 Instead, Cella went about giving horseplayers and casual fans what they most wanted to see.
 He took one of his premier races, the Apple Blossom, raised the purse to $5 million to lure Rachel Alexandra, 2009's Horse of the Year, and Zenyatta, the undefeated mare and Breeders' Cup Classic winner.
 Then he worked the phones. Zenyatta's owners, Jerry and Anne Moss, won the Apple Blossom in 2008 and were pointing their mare here. 
 Jess Jackson, Rachel Alexandra's owner, asked Cella to push the race back a week so the filly could recover from a March 13 prep race at the Fairgrounds.
 Cella accommodated him.
 Even Oaklawn's gaming room, however, is horse-driven. Its Instant Racing game was conceived and developed at the track and offers parimutuel wagering on previously run races. Since installing the machines in 2000, the casino part of Oaklawn has handled more than $1 billion.
 But it has been Oaklawn's focus on quality horse racing that has earned it the reputation as the Saratoga of the South. It takes care of the horsemen by providing a well-kept surface that is similar to Churchill Downs. 
 Cella also knows the value of old-fashioned promotion. In 2004, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Oaklawn, he offered a $5 million bonus to a horse that could sweep the Rebel, the Arkansas Derby and the Kentucky Derby. Smarty Jones did; and he paid up.
 Smarty Jones then almost swept the Triple Crown, but was caught in the stretch of the Belmont Stakes by Birdstone. 
 Just as important is the attention paid to the fans -- whether it is opening day when corned beef sandwiches sell for 50 cents and Cokes cost a dime, or the affordable tickets and cheap, ice-cold beer available every day.
 Last year, in a crushing economy, Oaklawn raised its purses twice during the 54-day meet and put in a participation incentive, which added $500,000 to the nearly $16 million in purses. Its handle was up, surpassing $50 million, as was attendance, which exceeded 625,000.
 These things do not happen by accident, nor do classic matchups like Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta in the Apple Blossom. 
 When you are all about the horse, the fans and the money will follow.

HEADLINE: Spending Less in a Recession, And Talking About It, Too

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THREE years ago this month, I wrote a column about the secrecy, envy and anxiety that surrounded talk of money. While most of us were perfectly happy to speculate back then about how a friend, neighbor or colleague could afford that new addition to the house, the trip to Europe and luxury car, most of our private financial lives were shrouded in mystery.
 I don't need to tell you that times were different in 2007. Consumption was definitely conspicuous, and even if our family wasn't bringing in the multimillion-dollar bonuses that our banker friends were, we were feeling pretty comfortable.
 Now, even those of us who still live in the same house and cling to the same job have watched in pain as college savings plans and retirement funds withered. And virtually no one can say with confidence that financial disaster happens only to other people. 
 So have these changes shifted our attitudes toward sharing information about money? Is the old adage that Americans are happy to give you the latest detail about their addictions or sex lives -- but shut down when the talk turns to finances -- beginning to crumble?
 ''It's become more socially acceptable to talk about money,'' says Hilary Black, editor of the anthology ''The Secret Currency of Love'' (William Morrow, 2009). ''We're not getting down and dirty with actual numbers. But whatever your financial circumstances, there's a shared fear that has swept the country. Where it was once shameful to talk about some of these things, now it's not.''
 Ms. Black offered as one example making dinner plans with friends and someone suggesting an expensive restaurant. It now feels O.K. to say, ''It's not in my budget right now,'' when you might not have before, she said.
 And the stigma of being laid off has certainly diminished, if not disappeared altogether. ''One silver lining to this terribly scary time is that people can talk about their troubles without fearing that others are secretly judging them as failures,'' Ms. Black said.
 Dalton Conley, dean for the social sciences at New York University, agreed. ''There's a very strong norm against saying what's on your 1040, but people will say, 'I've had to give up cable,' '' Professor Conley said.
 I find that to be true. Friends are much more willing to let down their guard and admit that they are really worried about paying for their children's college educations or summer camps, that restaurant dinners have been replaced by the occasional pizza delivery.
 Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed the new openness to two causes. ''In a time of trauma -- and we've been through a national trauma -- people have a need to tell stories, to create a narrative.''
 In addition, he said, ''we have a compulsion to confess our miscalculations and misdeeds. Many of us have overspent and we now have sanction to talk about it to other people.''
 But I've also found that commiserating about being in a financial squeeze can have its downside. That is, your broke may not be my broke. I have been surprised and even felt a tad betrayed when friends have complained about money troubles, and then I discover they're planning an expensive remodeling or a lavish vacation. I don't know how they're financing it, but I do know we can't afford it.
 Shira Boss, author of ''Green With Envy: Why Keeping Up with the Joneses is Keeping Us in Debt'' (Warner Business Books, 2006), said there were ways of getting information -- or your point across -- without grilling your friends. For example, she said, how about wondering out loud how those neighbors paid for that weekend trip to Paris, saying something like, '' 'Wow, how long did you have to save up for that?' See what you find out, even if it's just the look on their faces that tells you they haven't saved.''
 Some of my feelings stem from old-fashioned envy -- who wouldn't want to jet off to Paris? Still, it's hard to have a sense of financial camaraderie. During the Depression, hard as it was, people seemed to feel as if they were pretty much all in the same boat. So why does it seem, in this recession, that some of us are in a rowboat and others in a yacht?
 First of all, the Depression hit far more people -- unemployment, which rose to 25 percent, was more than twice what it is now. And food stamps, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that people can turn to now were almost nonexistent, said Gianluca Violante, associate professor of economics at New York University. So large income losses were more pervasive.
 The Depression was viewed more as something akin to a natural disaster, with no clear-cut villains, Professor Violante said. ''Now there's a very strong sense that a few bad guys caused this mess -- bankers and financiers -- and got out of it without too much pain, and some good guys -- the general public -- are paying the price.''
 In addition, while income inequality was high before the Depression, during the 1930s and 1940s it compressed radically, Professor Conley said. The extremes of wealth and poverty didn't begin again until the 1970s and only reached pre-Depression heights in 2007.
 It may be hard to comprehend what that really means in our lives, but a friend of mine whose husband has been unemployed for a year sees the inequality every day. 
 ''In our community, people talk recession, but when I look around, I don't see it affecting them,'' she said. 
 So will talking more frankly about money matters actually make us feel better or worse? Do I need to know that the couple down the road makes 10 times more than what we do?
 Well, perhaps we don't need to publicize our bank balance. But being more open about financial realities may be a good thing. The problem is that the shame in talking about it, Ms. Boss said, leads people to hide their problems -- and think they're the only ones suffering money problems -- rather than seek help.
 Knowledge is also useful. We all might have a more enlightened discussion about public policy, Professor Conley said, if we realistically knew the cost of inequality and where we ranked on the economic ladder. He pointed to studies that show that 19 percent of Americans think they are in the wealthiest top 2 percent.
 And as more and more of us go out on our own, as freelancers or consultants, information about how and what to charge can be helpful. I belong to an organization of journalists and authors, for example. For many years, it has provided a section where members anonymously contribute information about how much they are paid for the work they do, providing a financial framework for the others.
 Will this new frankness, such as it is, lead to greater financial transparency? Most people I talked to think that's unlikely in the long term. But maybe we can seize this moment to learn some home truths. Trying to keep up with the Joneses, for instance, is a no-win game, and it turns out that many of those we envied for their supposed wealth built it on a shaky foundation of debt.
 Maybe wanting less, rather than making more, is the only way we'll ever feel as if we have enough.

HEADLINE: Japan Calls Hummer H3 Fuel-Efficient

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Hummer and ''fuel-efficient'' are rarely mentioned in the same breath.
 But anyone in Japan who buys the Hummer H3 model -- with its 5.3-liter, 300-horsepower engine -- can receive a 250,000 yen ($2,779) subsidy under the country's recently eased fuel-efficiency standards for imported cars.
 The change stems in part from criticism, particularly from Detroit automakers, that recent tax breaks and subsidies intended to spur sales of fuel-efficient cars in Japan unfairly excluded foreign brands. 
 No American cars were eligible under Japan's original cash-for-clunkers program, which began last year, while nine out of 10 Japanese-made vehicles received some form of tax break or subsidy. 
 Japanese officials had said that Japanese-made cars were simply cleaner. American automakers argued, however, that Japan's fuel-efficiency standards -- which focus more on pollution at low speeds and in stop-and-go traffic -- put foreign brands at a disadvantage.
 General Motors reached a preliminary agreement last year to sell the Hummer brand to the little-known Chinese machinery maker Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery. But the planned sale is still awaiting regulatory approval in China.
 Nevertheless, the Japanese standards have been a sore point for American brands. Japanese brands, after all, accounted for almost half of sales under the United States' own cash-for-clunkers program last year, in which models like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic topped the list. 
 The incentives, which ended in August, offered consumers discounts of as much as $4,500 to trade in older vehicles for new, more fuel-efficient models.
 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler had raised the discrepancy with the United States government, prompting the Obama administration to warn Japan in December that ''changes were necessary'' to give American cars ''greater opportunity to qualify under Japan's program.''
 Now, Japan says imported cars are welcome. To be eligible, buyers of foreign brands must also scrap a car more than 13 years old.
 The Hummer H3 makes the cut, Japan's trade ministry says, because the government has set easier fuel-efficiency standards for heavier cars. 
 The H3, which weighs about 4,700 pounds and averages 16 miles per gallon in city traffic, clears the required emissions standards relative to its weight, according to the transport ministry.
 The Japanese government has also agreed to accept United States mileage standards -- albeit for models with sales of fewer than 2,000 units a year here -- making it easier for imported cars to qualify.
 ''The thinking is that with just one fuel-efficiency level, we'd only subsidize the smallest cars,'' said Yasushi Akahoshi, director of the trade ministry's Americas division. 
 ''But consumer needs are more diverse than that,'' he added. ''Some people prefer smaller cars, but others need larger cars for work, for example, and they shouldn't be penalized.''
 Other foreign models also newly eligible for the 250,000 yen subsidy are Chrysler's Voyager minivan, the Cadillac CTS luxury sports sedan and Ford's Escape XLT Limited S.U.V.
 The Mercedes-Benz S-Class hybrid and Volkswagen Golf TSI Comfortline are also eligible for additional tax breaks.
 Hans Tempel, head of the Japan Automobile Importers Association and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Japan, applauded the change.
 ''I think we've made a step forward,'' he told reporters last month, when the government first announced it would loosen restrictions. ''We appreciate that the Japanese government, after listening to our arguments, amended regulations.'' 
 Japan imports far fewer cars than it exports. Foreign automakers sold about 177,000 vehicles in Japan last fiscal year, a small fraction of the 4.7 million cars sold in Japan and the 5.6 million cars the country exported. Moreover, Japan's domestic auto market is in decline, hurt by a stagnant economy and aging population.
 That has meant most American and European carmakers have been bypassing Japan for fast-growing auto markets like China and India. Not a single foreign automaker was present at the Tokyo Motor Show in October last year.
 Despite being too wide for many of Japan's narrow roads, Hummers have a small but loyal following. In the 12 months before March 2009, GM sold 723 Hummers in Japan, an increase of 7.7 percent over the previous year, despite an overall drop in car sales.

HEADLINE: A High-Speed Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WUHAN, China 

 BODY:
The world's largest human migration -- the annual crush of Chinese traveling home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, which is this Sunday -- is going a little faster this time thanks to a new high-speed rail line.
 The Chinese bullet train, which has the world's fastest average speed, connects Guangzhou, the southern coastal manufacturing center, to Wuhan, deep in the interior. In a little more than three hours, it travels 664 miles, comparable to the distance from Boston to southern Virginia. That is less time than Amtrak's fastest train, the Acela, takes to go from Boston just to New York. 
 Even more impressive, the Guangzhou-to-Wuhan train is just one of 42 high-speed lines recently opened or set to open by 2012 in China. By comparison, the United States hopes to build its first high-speed rail line by 2014, an 84-mile route linking Tampa and Orlando, Fla.
 Speaking at that site last month, President Obama warned that the United States was falling behind Asia and Europe in high-speed rail construction and other clean energy industries. ''Other countries aren't waiting,'' he said. ''They want those jobs. China wants those jobs. Germany wants those jobs. They are going after them hard, making the investments required.'' 
 Indeed, the web of superfast trains promises to make China even more economically competitive, connecting this vast country -- roughly the same size as the United States -- as never before, much as the building of the Interstate highway system increased productivity and reduced costs in America a half-century ago. 
 As China upgrades and expands its rail system, it creates the economies of large-scale production for another big export industry. ''The sheer volume of equipment that they will require, and the technology that will have to be developed, will simply catapult them into a leadership position,'' said Stephen Gardner, Amtrak's vice president for policy and development.
 But the high-speed trains, which average speeds of up to 215 miles an hour, have their critics here. Heavily subsidized regular trains, which require 11 hours for the trip from Guangzhou to Wuhan, cost $20.50 one-way. The bullet train costs $72, or one to three weeks' pay for an assembly line worker. 
 ''These prices are unreasonable, just like a lion opening its bloody mouth,'' said one recent Internet posting, using a Chinese proverb for voracious greed.
 Yet many workers traveling home for the lunar New Year were understanding of the high price. ''Based on the distance, the price is not too high,'' said a plastic injection molding worker who gave his surname, Li, and was catching the slow train to save money.
 China's lavish new rail system is a response to a failure of central planning six years ago.
 After China joined the World Trade Organization in November 2001, exports and manufacturing soared. Electricity generation failed to keep up because the railway ministry had not built enough rail lines or purchased enough locomotives to haul the coal needed to run new power plants. 
 By 2004, the government was turning off the power to some factories up to three days a week to prevent blackouts in residential areas.
 Officials drafted a plan to move much of the nation's passenger traffic onto high-speed routes by 2020, freeing existing tracks for more freight. Then the global financial crisis hit in late 2008. Faced with mass layoffs at export factories, China ordered that the new rail system be completed by 2012 instead of 2020, throwing more than $100 billion in stimulus at the projects. 
 Administrators mobilized armies of laborers -- 110,000 just for the 820-mile route from Beijing to Shanghai, which will cut travel time there to five hours, from 12, when it opens next year.
 Zhang Shuguang, the deputy chief engineer of China's railway ministry, said in a speech last September that the government planned 42 lines by 2012, with 5,000 miles of track for passenger trains at 215 miles an hour and 3,000 miles of track for passenger and fast freight trains traveling 155 miles an hour. Top speed on the Tampa-to-Orlando line is supposed to be 168 miles an hour.
 Though they have yet to retreat from their goals, Chinese officials have hinted in the last several weeks that stimulus spending may slow. Some transportation experts predict that a few of the 42 routes may not be finished until 2013 or 2014 as a result. One worry is whether China is overinvesting in high-speed trains that may require operating subsidies like those for maintaining highways: fares on a route from Beijing to Tianjin have been set lower than initially forecast to make sure they stay full.
 The new trains leave 29 times a day for Wuhan from a gargantuan train station on the outskirts of Guangzhou that opened on Jan. 30. With soaring steel girders, white walls and enormous skylights far overhead, the station, Asia's largest, resembles a major airport.
 As the Chinese train whizzes across the countryside, tile-roofed homes in ancient villages gape windowless, hints of peasant relocations that the government has not publicly quantified.
 To avoid bulldozing urban neighborhoods, huge rail stations have been erected in industrial districts on the edge of cities. Subways to the stations are still being built in Guangzhou and Wuhan; passengers now take 40-minute bus rides from city centers.
 The three-hour train to Wuhan makes a quicker trip than the nearly two-hour flight, once faster train check-in times are accounted for. Airlines are losing customers. 
 Bullet trains travel faster than a commercial jet at takeoff. They require extremely flat, straight routes. Amtrak's Acela only briefly reaches its top speed of 150 miles an hour because it runs on old, curvy tracks that it shares with 12,000-ton freight trains.
 On a recent Wednesday, the 2:50 p.m. bullet train glided smoothly out of Guangzhou's station and within four minutes was traveling more than 200 miles an hour. Practically every seat on the 14-car train was full of migrants heading home for Chinese New Year. 
 Sun Nanyu, a 9-year-old girl dressed in pink Minnie Mouse barrettes and a pink-and-gray ''Hello Kitty'' sweater, sat in economy class with her father.
 ''I was scared to go on this train because it goes so fast, but now I'm not scared at all because it's very stable and doesn't wobble back and forth,'' Nanyu said before falling asleep on her tray table.
 Many Americans may be too corpulent for the economy-class seats, which measure just 18 inches between the arm rests. One-way first-class seats are $114 and two inches wider. 
 The 2:50 train arrived in Wuhan at 5:52, six minutes early. A nearly full train back to Guangzhou the next day also arrived six minutes early.
 Soaring tax revenue, a national savings rate of 40 percent and laborers who earn less than $100 a month help make high-speed rail affordable to build in China.
 Even with cheap labor, the Wuhan-Guangzhou line cost $17 billion (116.6 billion renminbi); it has so many tunnels through mountains that at times it feels like a subway.
 A saying is making the rounds in Guangzhou: a resident can board a train in the morning, have lunch at historic Mount Yuelu in Changsha, dinner at the famous Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan and still come home and sleep in her own bed.
 For Americans, a comparable trip would involve a Boston resident who catches a train to Philadelphia, has lunch near the Liberty Bell, goes to dinner in colonial Williamsburg, Va., and returns home by bedtime.

HEADLINE: Lilly Pressured as Its First New Drug in 4 Years Falters

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Eli Lilly had billion-dollar hopes when the blood thinner Effient was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last summer.
 But Lilly's latest financial report shows the product -- its first new drug in four years -- is having trouble catching on. 
 After sales of $22 million in its first quarter on the market, sales in the subsequent quarter fell to $3.8 million, hardly portending a blockbuster, and analysts slashed their projections. 
 The faltering start of a new drug in a $6 billion market may also hold broader lessons for the nation's pharmaceutical industry. Some analysts say it shows that the big drug companies need to grow more from mergers and acquisitions than from research and development.
 The disappointment raises pressure on Lilly, one of the world's top 12 drug makers, to seek deals or an outright merger, as many of its rivals have done, to gain economies of scale and new products. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, has promoted homegrown innovation, but has found it a costly and risky strategy.
 ''Even if the company isn't ready to give up on Effient, we are,'' Jami Rubin, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a note to investors, cutting her 2015 estimates for the drug to $414 million, from $1.1 billion.
 Lilly says that it is too soon to tell whether Effient will be a hit. But doctors, analysts and pharmacy managers say there are many reasons the drug is not yet catching on. 
 Effient, which Lilly makes with Daiichi Sankyo of Japan, was approved for use by some heart attack patients to reduce risks of blood clots and subsequent heart attacks after they undergo angioplasty, a procedure using stents to widen blocked blood vessels. 
 But the F.D.A. from the start required a black-box warning about a heightened risk of bleeding with Effient, a risk that was highlighted by many physicians interviewed for this article. 
 In addition, Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefits manager for 60 million Americans, says Effient might not be any better than the market leader, Plavix, which is cheaper even now and will soon be available as a generic. In an unusual move, Medco has begun its own clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of Effient. 
 Effient was a decade in development, and Lilly stands by the drug, John C. Lechleiter, the chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts on Jan. 28. He said the sales dip was an aberration. 
 In the first quarter the drug was on the market, he said, hospitals and pharmacies stocked up, before waiting for insurers to start covering the drug and doctors to start prescribing it. By that reasoning, the slow sales in the subsequent quarter were part of this catch-up period.
 Indeed, prescriptions of Effient have grown from about 1,000 in August to 11,000 in December, according to the industry tracker IMS Health. But in the same period, Plavix prescriptions grew by 77,000, rising to 2.5 million.
 Javan Collins, vice president of Lilly's United States cardiovascular business, said the company was using office visits, promotional speakers, new sales materials and journal advertising to bolster Effient. ''It's a challenge to sell to doctors satisfied with Plavix,'' he added. 
 Dr. Lawrence Ong, director of interventional cardiology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said in an interview that ''doctors are kind of in a holding pattern'' with Effient. 
 Dr. Ong, who is not involved with any of the drug companies, said Plavix worked well and was time-tested, while Effient's higher risk of bleeding ''kind of dampens the enthusiasm for it.''
 What is more, Effient is being squeezed by market forces. On one side, Plavix, approved in 1997, will be sold generically starting late next year. On the other side, the Swiss drug maker AstraZeneca is seeking F.D.A. approval for another blood thinner, Brilinta, which some doctors say may have an advantage over Effient in being shorter-acting and quickly reversible. That can be an advantage for patients who require surgery, reducing the risk of uncontrollable bleeding. 
 Seamus Fernandez, an analyst for Leerink Swann in New York, says he believes that Effient may end up as a niche product, not a blockbuster, which he said would represent a strategic setback for Lilly.
 ''A research philosophy is fraught with risk and opportunity,'' Mr. Fernandez said in an interview. ''And over the last five years, Lilly has seen more of the risk of drug development than they have the reward.''
 In a note to investors, Mr. Fernandez wrote that Lilly must move aggressively on partnerships and acquisitions to increase its revenue because more than 70 percent of its forecasted sales from existing products would lose patent protection globally by 2017. That includes the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa, the antidepressant Cymbalta and the cancer drug Gemzar, all blockbusters with more than $1 billion in sales.
 An F.D.A. panel recommended approving Effient last year only after Lilly successfully persuaded the agency to remove a cardiologist critic from the advisory panel.
 In an interview this week, that critic, Dr. Sanjay Kaul of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said he was not surprised at the slow sales. ''I think its efficacy was overestimated and its safety risk was underestimated,'' he said. ''Bleeding becomes an even bigger issue in real clinical practice.''
 Cost is another issue for drugs that many heart patients take daily. Plavix, from Bristol-Myers Squibb and the French drug-maker Sanofi Aventis, costs a little less than Effient now, with each product around $5 a day. 
 But when it goes generic next year, Plavix may be expected to fall in price by as much as 90 percent, said Tim Heady, chief executive of UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions, a pharmacy benefits company. That is why Medco is conducting a head-to-head trial of Effient and Plavix to see if Plavix may be more beneficial than indicated in the Lilly-financed study on which the F.D.A. approved Effient.

HEADLINE: Haiti Lessons: A Search and Rescue Corps ...

BYLINE: By MATT KLAPPER and JAMES J. RILEY. 
Matt Klapper is a student at Yale Law School and a volunteer firefighter. James J. Riley is the leader of New Jersey's urban search and rescue team.

 BODY:
A S the one-month anniversary of Haiti's earthquake passes, one inspiring memory of the rescue effort stands out: after a Los Angeles search and rescue team pulled another survivor from the rubble, bystanders in Port-au-Prince chanted, ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' President Obama recounted the scene in his State of the Union address, and now policymakers should make sure that such successes can be repeated, more frequently, in future disasters by expanding our urban search and rescue capacity. 
 Consider what we were able to do in Haiti. The heroic work of just six American teams there -- a small fraction of the 43 international search and rescue teams deployed -- was responsible for a third of the lives saved. 
 At home, urban search and rescue teams -- consisting of firefighters, police officers, medical workers, engineers, technical specialists and K-9 units -- are ready to respond to disasters from earthquakes to acts of terrorism. Abroad, they could be used more aggressively to help during disasters and thus improve America's reputation. Polls conducted in Pakistan and Indonesia after American disaster assistance reveal huge upswings in the perception of the United States. 
 This would require that we establish more federal urban search and rescue teams. The Federal Emergency Management Agency oversees 28 teams that can deploy at home with six hours' notice, two of which regularly work with the United States Agency for International Development. But 28 is not enough. A team can spend the better part of a day rescuing a single survivor. Consider that, after 9/11, all but three FEMA teams were called to either the World Trade Center site or the Pentagon. And in Haiti, the 43 international teams on the ground were 15 more than in the entire FEMA arsenal. In a crisis, the number of teams, and the speed with which they deploy, can determine how many people survive. Large-scale responses require teams coordinated by the federal government. 
 Adding teams is cost-effective, because they consist of people who train for search and rescue part time. A team can operate for as little as $1.7 million a year, and many existing state and local teams could be brought into FEMA's fold. 
 As we reflect on the suffering endured in Port-au-Prince, it is easy to see the wisdom of paying a little more for greater safety here at home, and for the ability to extend one of America's most effective forms of benevolence around the world.

HEADLINE: Recession's Silver Lining: U.S. Trade Deficit Is Down the Most on Record

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AFTER years of being told by Asians and Europeans that it had to find a way to reduce its trade deficit, the United States did find a way in 2009. A global recession did the trick, producing the largest decline ever in the deficit. 
 The recession caused American imports to fall by 26 percent, by far the largest annual drop in imports of goods since the government began keeping trade statistics in 1948. There have been only a few years with any declines at all, with the largest before 2009 being a fall of nearly 7 percent in 1982, another recession year.
 Exports also fell, but not by as much, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. The result was a trade deficit in goods of $501 billion, or 3.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product. That was down from $816 billion, or 5.7 percent of gross domestic product.
 Any way you slice that, it was the largest improvement in the trade deficit on record. In terms of G.D.P., the biggest improvement before 2009 was in 1988, when the deficit declined by almost 1 percent. In terms of dollars, the improvement of $315 billion was almost 10 times as big as the largest previous improvement, of nearly $35 billion, in 1988. Then, the dollar was plunging, improving the country's trade competitiveness.
 Even so, the deficit, as a percentage of G.D.P., is larger than it ever was before 1999.
 Whether the trade deficit continues to decline, even if less sharply, may depend on the pace of economic recovery, both in the United States and in the rest of the world. Slower American growth would restrain imports. Faster growth in other countries would be likely to increase exports.
 One reason for the sharp improvement is that this recession caused concern among far more consumers than a usual one does. Normally, those who lose their jobs, or fear they might do so, cut back. In this recession, the slump in housing prices made many people feel poorer. Some of them, who had depended on refinancing mortgages to provide cash to spend, had no choice but to reduce spending.
 Historically, there has been a surge in imports when the American economy recovered from recession. But perhaps that could be different this time, if American consumers remain cautious.
 ''A moderate rebound for the U.S. consumer, after a deep recession, would be an unprecedented event,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm. ''A silver lining would be a decidedly tame rebound in imports, because so much discretionary spending goes to imported goods.''
 It was not, however, imports of consumer goods that plunged the most in 2009. They were down 11 percent, to $428 billion. Far more important was the decline in imports of industrial goods, which fell 41 percent, to $461 billion.
 Over all, imports fell by $546 billion, to $1.56 trillion, while exports declined by $231 billion, to $1.06 trillion. The United States had 68 cents of exports for every dollar of imports. At the peak of the trade deficit, in 2005, that figure was 54 cents.

HEADLINE: When Children Are Overweight, Changes for the Whole Family

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
AS Michelle Obamareminded us this week, the forces behind childhood obesity are insidious.
 Parents are busy. Fast food is cheap and easy (and children love it). Technology can help keep children sedentary. Children's TV networks advertise junk food. Two-thirds of adults are overweight. And on and on. 
 As a result, one of three children in this country is overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Overweight children are at risk of developing serious and costly health problems that used to be primarily the province of middle-age adults, like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. A recent C.D.C. study found that 22 percent of overweight (and 43 percent of obese) young people had, abnormal blood lipid levels, like high triglycerides, which are risk factors for heart disease. 
 And how is this a ''Patient Money'' topic? 
 For starters, obesity is expensive. People who are overweight tend to have more chronic illnesses than those who are not, and those illnesses can require intense medical attention. 
 And while Ms. Obama's campaign to address childhood obesity focuses on influences outside the household, parental intervention is important, too -- home economics, in other words. That can include making good choices about what goes on the grocery list and on the table, as well as finding and paying for the right professional help, when necessary. 
 The United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts, reported in January that some specific obesity programs were effective. The task force recommends that children aged 6 to 18 have their body mass index -- B.M.I. -- measured and, if they are found to be overweight, be referred to a weight-loss program. 
 Comprehensive weight-loss programs for children can be scarce and expensive, though, and many insurers provide scant coverage for obesity treatment. But parents can begin their own intervention programs, making changes that do not cost a lot of money and will pay off over the long term. 
 ''The family is the underutilized weapon in the fight against childhood obesity,'' says Dr. David Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital Boston. 
 FACE THE FACTS Parents are often lovingly blind when it comes to their children. What seems like harmless baby fat to you may be problem pounds for your child. 
 Anthony Brookins, a single father in Boston, saw that his son, Kris, was a little plump but figured ''he'd grow out of it.'' 
 But when Mr. Brookins noticed a dark ring around his son's neck, he took Kris -- then 11 -- to the doctor and learned that his son was 30 pounds overweight. That ring was a sign he had early-stage Type 2 diabetes. 
 ''I was shocked,'' Mr. Brookins said.
 Your pediatrician can tell you your child's body mass index -- a formula that considers height, weight, age and gender -- at the annual checkup. Many public schools also routinely screen children and send home explanatory notes to parents. You can also plug your child's stats into the B.M.I. calculator on the C.D.C.'s Web site.
 Your child is considered overweight if he or she falls in the 85th to 94th percentiles of the B.M.I. growth charts, and obese if he is in the 95th percentile or higher. If your child is over the 85th percentile, it is important to address the problem quickly. 
 And for children, weight loss is not quite so daunting. 
 ''It's easier for kids to lose weight than for adults,'' says Dr. Ludwig, who is also the author of ''Ending the Food Fight'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007). ''Because children are still growing, they may only have to keep their weight the same, or slow the rate of growth to reduce their B.M.I.''
 GET NUTRITION ADVICE ''Most families are under a high degree of stress,'' said Dr. Sandra G. Hassink, director of the Pediatric Weight Management Clinic at the A. I. Dupont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del. ''They rely on convenience and fast foods to help them cope with time and other constraints.'' 
 Unfortunately, children who eat fast food tend to consume more total calories, drink less milk and eat fewer fruits and vegetables and less fiber than those who do not, according to a study published in the January 2004 issue of the medical journal Pediatrics. 
 To begin changing your family's habits, consider seeing a registered dietitian who can evaluate the family's eating patterns and give you recipes for healthy low-cost meals. 
 Call your insurer to find out whether it will cover dietitian visits for children. Some do. 
 If you pay out of pocket, it will cost from $50 for a simple consultation to as much as $250 if the dietitian is working with multiple family members and developing a month's worth of menus, according to the American Dietetic Association.
 Ask your pediatrician if there are programs at local hospitals or schools. Comprehensive weight-loss programs can be scarce and expensive, and there is no central clearinghouse for them. (If you want to consider that path, call the large hospitals in your area and ask if they have such a program or can refer you to one.) But local hospitals sometimes offer effective ones on a smaller scale. 
 New York Hospital Queens, for instance, offers Fit Kids, which counsels families on nutrition and offers exercise classes for children three days a week -- all at no cost.
 When Kris Brookins was found to have insulin resistance, his pediatrician referred him to the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children's Hospital Boston. The program, which helps families find coverage through their insurers or by other means, says it doesn't turn anyone away. 
 In the Children's Hospital program, Kris and his dad learned about nutrition and portion sizes. Kris gave up pizza and fried-chicken meals and began eating more steamed vegetables and fish. The changes helped Kris reduce his B.M.I. by 20 percent over the course of a year, while also helping the family reduce its food budget. 
 ENCOURAGE ACTIVITYChildren are less active than they used to be. They now spend, on average, 7 hours and 38 minutes each day using computers, iPods and cellphones and watching television, according to a January report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
 To help reverse the trend, parents can set a limit on how much time children spend sitting in front of the television or using their computers for entertainment. The Kaiser report found that when parents set limits, ''children consumed nearly three hours less media per day than those with no rules.''
 As an alternative, make sure your children have something fun and active to do with their free time. Families can consider joining the local YMCA, which is typically more affordable than a gym and offers more programs for children. And it helps to be in the habit of taking your children outside to play more often. ''When I ask parents at my clinic, 'Does your child ever go outside?' I get 'no' a lot,'' Dr. Hassink said. 
 When outdoors is not an option, become inventive. Buy a fold-up Ping-Pong table. Or maybe dance or exercise to your children's favorite music for half an hour before dinner. 
 A FAMILY AFFAIRIt is nearly impossible for your child to change habits if the rest of the family does not. You cannot reasonably tell a child he is allowed only one soda a week if you keep two-liter bottles of Coke and Sprite in the refrigerator. 
 ''Without the help of parents, we are setting a child up for failure,'' says Dr. Anthony Porto, a pediatric gastroenterologist at New York Hospital Queens and the director of the Fit Kids program.
 Most children react well to change, Dr. Porto says, as long as they do not see it as a punishment. If you explain to your children that by eating better and exercising more, they will have more stamina to play sports and will take fewer trips to the doctor, your children may actually embrace your healthy lifestyle plan.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Slips but Ends Week With Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS; Matthew Saltmarsh, Jack Healy and Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly lower Friday as a move by China to curb bank lending and economic data in the United States and Europe raised fears that the global recovery might be in jeopardy. 
 Even so, Wall Street stocks ended off the day's lows as investors bet that the European Union would devise a clear plan to aid debt-laden Greece and restore confidence in countries using the euro.
 Stock laggards included large manufacturers and commodity-related companies, many dependent on Chinese demand. On the Nasdaq, bargain-hunting in technology helped the index to close slightly higher.
 The aluminum company Alcoa fell 2.2 percent, to $13.28, while United Technologies lost 1.5 percent, to $65.69, and General Electric dipped 1.4 percent, to $15.55.
 China raised banks' reserve requirements, the second such increase in two months. Investors worried that China, which has been spearheading the world's economic recovery, might be pulling back too soon.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 45.05 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,099.14. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.96 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,075.51. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.12 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,183.53.
 Data on consumer sentiment and business inventories and on the euro zone's gross domestic product were also weaker than investors had expected.
 The major stock indexes ended the week higher, halting a four-week string of declines, helped in part by investors scouring for shares in the beaten-down sectors, particularly technology. Both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 rose 0.9 percent, while the Nasdaq climbed 2 percent.
 Interest rates, meanwhile, fell on Friday. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 99 14/32, and the yield fell to 3.69 percent from 3.72 percent late Thursday.
 ''There may be a bit of buying and positioning going into the three-day weekend, assuming that the E.U. can iron out issues and finalize agreements to help Greece,'' said Dennis Cajigas, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a retail brokerage firm, in Chicago. Euro-zone finance ministers are scheduled to meet Monday, when financial markets in the United States will be closed for Presidents' Day.
 The Nasdaq's top gainers included the BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, which rose 3.1 percent, to $71.33, after Wedbush Morgan started coverage with an outperform rating, saying the stock was well positioned.

HEADLINE: China Hits Brake On Hot Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
As most countries agonize over how to keep their barely reviving economies growing, China is already looking to slam on the brakes.
 China's central bank moved late Friday to reduce lending to companies and individuals by requiring large commercial banks to increase the amount of cash they park with the central bank. The move, which came earlier than most economists had expected, was meant to slow China's breakneck economy and inflation. 
 It was the second time in a month that the central bank had directed the country's banks to increase reserves. In spite of the earlier edict, which took effect on Jan. 18, banks actually lent more money in January than in the previous three months combined, illustrating just how hard it is for Beijing to modulate its rapidly expanding economy. 
 Chinese economists now predict the economy will grow about 10 percent this year, while Western economists put the figure closer to 12 percent. The growth reflects a revival of exports, strong consumer spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure projects like high-speed rail lines. 
 But authorities in Beijing are walking a delicate and difficult line. They consider controlling inflation as key to domestic peace because in the past the erosion of the spending power of workers has led to unrest. 
 At the same time, if China brakes too hard, it risks slowing global growth overall and throwing other countries, including the United States, back into recession. For the first time in history, China's economy is acting as a major engine pulling the rest of the world out of recession. 
 Economic reports Friday showed that most of Europe's major economies either shrank or barely grew in the fourth quarter of last year. 
 The United States had strong growth in the fourth quarter, leaving many wondering when Washington will start increasing interest rates. The Federal Reserve has signaled it will be months. 
 Fears that China's move Friday would slow global growth sent share prices sliding across Europe and pushed New York markets lower when they opened, though they recovered some of the losses. China's commercial banks have become important lenders to the rest of the world as American banks have considerably reduced lending.
 ''The timing is a surprise,'' said Qing Wang, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Morgan Stanley, referring to the central bank's action. 
 Policy makers inject additional cash each year into the country's financial system before Lunar New Year to accommodate holiday spending. Raising the bank reserve ratio could prevent banks from turning that into loans for activities like real estate speculation.
 Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan, said, ''The message coming out of China has been quite clear -- policy makers are becoming more concerned about containing inflationary expectations and managing the risk of asset price bubbles as a result of last year's aggressive expansion of credit.''
 Stephen Green, the head of greater China research in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered Bank, said that he had been expecting one increase a month in the ratio for the foreseeable future as a way to slow the economy and the threat of inflation.
 The government began a stimulus plan of more than half-trillion dollars last year, and even before that Beijing had a huge public investment program to strengthen the country's infrastructure.
 At the same time, Chinese families are snapping up cars, apartments and other big-ticket items.
 China passed the United States last year to become the world's largest car market by number of vehicles sold. Car sales in January were more than double the level of a year earlier. 
 Families, real estate developers and industrial companies have all been borrowing heavily and have started paying more for everything from food to apartments. Last month apartment prices surged and the pace of wholesale inflation doubled.
 Chinese families have the cash to buy cars now partly because they still have extremely high savings rates by international standards and partly because the state-controlled banking sector went on a lending spree over the last year at the government's request. 
 China's banks largely avoided investing in the mortgage-backed securities, credit-default swaps and other esoteric financial instruments that have caused tremendous damage to the balance sheets of Western banks in the last two years, leaving them less able or less willing to lend.
 The National Bureau of Statistics of China said Thursday that annual inflation in producer prices had more than doubled in January from December, to 4.3 percent. Average housing prices in large and midsize cities were up 9.5 percent last month from a year earlier, the fastest rate of increase in 19 months.
 Rising producer prices and asset prices have not yet fed into high inflation in consumer prices, which were up only 1.5 percent last month from a year earlier despite an increase in food prices.
 The central bank action Friday was aimed at keeping a tight rein on consumer prices.
 The central bank pushed up the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 16.5 percent, for large banks, and 14.5 percent for small banks, effective Feb. 25. Small financial institutions that mainly lend to farmers, like rural credit cooperatives, are temporarily exempted from the increase to make sure they can provide loans for spring planting.
 As the government tries to keep inflation in check, the conventional remedy in most industrialized countries would be to push up the interest rates that borrowers must pay for loans, typically through actions in money markets. But that would draw even more investment into China, at a time when the Chinese authorities are already struggling to control foreign cash that has been flowing in.
 Banks have been keeping about 18 percent of their assets at the central bank recently. But raising the minimum makes it less likely big banks will start lending that money.

HEADLINE: A Blue-Ribbon Look at Criminal Justice

 BODY:
The nation's criminal justice system is in need of an overhaul. This is particularly true of its incarceration policies. Too many people are being put behind bars who do not need to be there, at great cost to the states, and not enough attention is being paid to helping released prisoners re-enter society. 
 The Senate Judiciary Committee recently voted to create a blue-ribbon commission to study the justice system and offer reforms. The bill's main sponsor was Jim Webb, a Democrat of Virginia who is one of the Senate's more thoughtful voices on crime and punishment. 
 Among the issues the commission would study is why the United States has the highest reported incarceration rate in the world. Prisons are filled with a large number of nonviolent offenders, including minor drug offenders. In many cases, it would be more humane, economical and effective to provide drug treatment and mental health alternatives.
 The high imprisonment rate has long been troubling as a matter of fairness, but with the recession it has become an enormous financial burden. States have begun, out of fiscal necessity, to parole prisoners faster and in larger numbers, and to look for alternatives to incarceration. This scattershot approach is far from ideal. It would be better to have experts address these issues at a national level in a more methodical way. 
 The commission also would look at sentencing policies for drug crimes, including their impact on minority communities, something that is long overdue, as well as the involvement of foreign-based gangs in crime in the United States. Some of the proposed topics have backing across the political spectrum, including re-entry programs to help released inmates begin law-abiding lives.
 The bill has strong support from both civil rights and law enforcement groups. The Senate leadership needs to push it to a vote, and the House needs to get to work on passing a companion bill. A broad consensus has emerged that the system is broken.

HEADLINE: Families See A Utopia Turn Nightmarish In a Legal Fight

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The Hello Living condo project in Brooklyn was marketed as an urban utopia, a collection of low-rise apartments designed for young families without large inheritances or bonuses. 
 More than three dozen of them closed on apartments, enticed by the modern designs set among the brick walk-ups of Prospect Heights and by amenities like a pool, a gym and a children's playroom that have all become the standard in higher-priced buildings. One resident called his building a ''luxury urban kibbutz'' where residents have a baby-sitting co-op and watch ''Lost'' episodes in the screening room.
 The first sign that something was not right came last fall, when fliers appeared outside one open house saying, ''Buyers Beware'' and ''Buying an Apartment in This Building Will Likely Get You Sued.'' Lawyers started calling people who had already made down payments to issue the same warning, and at least two people discovered that their banks had withdrawn their loan commitments.
 Then the lawsuits arrived, and even some families who had already closed and moved in found themselves on the defense. 
 ''For most of us, this is our first purchase, and it's most of our life savings,'' said Jennifer DiFiglia, who has a contract with her husband on a $525,000 two-bedroom. Her deposit remains tied up in litigation, and if she cannot close, she could lose thousands of dollars in legal fees and tax penalties for withdrawing retirement money. ''This isn't a building filled with people working at hedge funds,'' she added.
 They have become collateral victims in a vicious fight that is equal parts old Brooklyn and 21st-century real estate, a battle among a 34-year-old developer, his mentor from Borough Park and a two wealthy Austrian investors. 
 The developer, Eli Karp, is being sued by the others, who accuse him of stealing money from the project and selling apartments without permission. Mr. Karp has fired back, saying that they were simply unhappy with the prices and the pace of sales, and were angry because he would not agree to let the properties fall into foreclosure so that they could buy them for ''below-market prices,'' according to an affidavit. 
 The case has traveled from the Manhattan courts through a rabbinical court and now to the Brooklyn courts. The fight has grown so contentious that a judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, reprimanded both sides, saying, ''You're constantly jumping all over each other, and you have clients that will bury their heads in the sand and let these properties go up in smoke.''
 The roots of the dispute go back to Borough Park, where Mr. Karp said he took a keen interest in a neighbor, the ''big shot'' businessman Solomon Obstfeld, who works at a financial advisory firm on Central Park South. He tutored Mr. Obstfeld's son and marveled at his chauffeured cars, his collection of watches worth more than $100,000 apiece and his tales about his business battles. 
 He said that Mr. Obstfeld, who is now 54, was not just a role model. ''He was my best friend,'' Mr. Karp said while seated in an overstuffed office chair in one of his completed buildings on Pacific Street. ''I looked up to him.''
 In 2004, Mr. Karp pitched his plans to turn a beleaguered block into a condo community. Mr. Obstfeld agreed to invest $5 million, Mr. Karp said. And when Mr. Karp expanded his plans, he said, Mr. Obstfeld ultimately provided $30 million to construct a collection of 10 buildings, most of them spread over three blocks in Prospect Heights. Sprinkled among the buildings would be communal amenities including a business lounge, rooms for private parties, a gym and a 50-foot-long lap pool, with residents of every building having access to all of them. (A building several blocks away has separate amenities.) 
 In the summer of 2005, Mr. Karp said, he received an e-mail message from an Austrian businessman named Leon Lewkowicz, who identified himself as a major investor and said he wanted to visit the project. That December, Mr. Karp said, he received another e-mail message, from a man named James Schlaff, who said that he also was an investor and that he wanted to visit from Austria to review the financials. Mr. Karp said that he had not known of their involvement before the e-mail messages, but that Mr. Obstfeld confirmed they were involved. 
 Dr. Lewkowicz and Mr. Schlaff are strangers in Brooklyn, but are well known in Austria. Dr. Lewkowicz has been associated in news reports with one of that country's largest banks, though his lawyer in New York says that he has never been an employee there. Mr. Schlaff has been known as a wealthy casino owner who was investigated, along with his brother Martin Schlaff, several years ago over accusations that they had made illegal payments to the family of Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli prime minister. They have not been charged. Martin Schlaff also attracted attention in 2008 for paying one of the world's largest divorce settlements, reportedly 190 million euros. 
 As the buildings in Brooklyn were finished -- seven have been built -- Mr. Karp started selling apartments, despite the market slowdown. Of the approximately 110 apartments that Mr. Karp planned to develop and sell, he closed on 41 and has 5 in contract. Gil Talmi, a film composer who moved into a one-bedroom at 957 Pacific Street with his wife in November 2008, praised Mr. Karp's construction and the ''luxury urban kibbutz'' that he said was filled with ''cool, hip, groovy people.'' 
 But in an affidavit, Mr. Karp said that around June 2008, he started having ''material disagreements'' with his investors when ''the real estate market also began to fall into a deep recession, with prices declining precipitously, mortgage money drying up and sales becoming far more difficult to obtain and/or to close.'' He said the apartment sales prices matched their appraisals.
 But court records say that Mr. Karp's investors grew concerned about the project's future in late 2008 because Mr. Karp had not ''accurately projected his costs'' and ''grossly exceeded his budget.'' The investors accused Mr. Karp of ''stealing at least $170,000'' from the project and continuing to sell apartments without their consent, even though their original agreement said that he needed their approval. In July 2009, they said in court papers, they changed the operating agreements so that Mr. Karp no longer had authority to act on their behalf. Any contracts or agreements after that, they said, were done ''without the authority of the owner.''
 Mr. Karp replied in an affidavit that his investors wanted him to ''default on the loans and the buildings will go into foreclosure.'' That way, he said, they could buy them on the cheap. ''If this occurs,'' he said, ''not only would I be ruined as a developer as no bank, for the foreseeable future, would lend me a nickel.''
 Mr. Karp said in a court affidavit that in August, a beth din, or rabbinical court, ruled that he could continue to sell the apartments, with any money left over after loan payments deposited in escrow. 
 Mr. Obstfeld and the investors are pressing their case in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Because they claim that Mr. Karp did not have the authority to make the sales, they have named some would-be residents, and several who have moved in, as defendants in an attempt to cancel or overturn sales. 
 Lisa Daniels, who has been renting in an East Harlem walk-up with her husband and two sons while she waits to close on one of Mr. Karp's apartments, said that in late December her husband received aphone call from a lawyer at Oved & Oved, the firm representing Mr. Obstfeld and the investors, advising him of the litigation. She said the firm had also spoken to their mortgage broker. Although they still have a loan lined up, at least two other buyers say their banks have withdrawn their commitments because of the uncertainties caused by the litigation. 
 Mr. Obstfeld, Mr. Schlaff and Mr. Lewkowicz referred questions to the law firm. Terrence Oved, a partner at Oved & Oved, declined to comment on the case because of the pending lawsuit, but said that his firm ''exhibits the highest caliber of professionalism and integrity'' in its treatment of buyers in these projects.
 The dispute is providing few answers for buyers who simply need a place to live. Some had hoped that Mr. Karp's lawyer, Alan Lebensfeld, would help to resolve the case. But on Monday morning, Mr. Lebensfeld sent a message to the buyers saying that he was no longer Mr. Karp's counsel because he had not been able to pay his legal bills. 
 By late Monday afternoon, buyers said that they had started receiving calls from the investors' lawyers about whether they would stay in the deal.
 In the meantime, some buyers still want to move in. ''This is not an investment for us,'' said Ms. Daniels, who has a contract on a $618,000 duplex. ''This is our first home as a family.'' 
 ''I'm sorry they're losing money for what they thought they would get five years ago,'' she said. ''But it doesn't mean they have to kick families out on the street.''

HEADLINE: A Young Outsider, On the Doorstep

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
LaQuan Smith has no studio, no eager assistants -- not even a super-strength sewing machine. He stitches up his designs on a modest Kenmore in his bedroom, a tidy diminutive space in his grandparents' house in the St. Albans section of Queens. ''I do everything here but eat,'' Mr. Smith said as he sprawled on his grandmother's rose-patterned quilt, the room's single nod to tradition. 
 What he does possess are youth, good looks and an unswerving faith that his vision -- founded on flamboyant shapes, serpentine seaming and sequins -- will somehow see him through. 
 On Feb. 15, Mr. Smith, 21, will put on a show, his first, staged in the manner of an Old World defile, with models sauntering through a salonlike room bearing little numbered cards. His decision to wedge himself into a fashion calendar glutted, as always, with unfamiliar names requires gumption. But his outsider status, with resources skimpier than most, mark Mr. Smith as an emblem. He is that quintessential newcomer driven, against daunting odds, to snatch the Fashion Week spotlight. 
 He is betting, after all, that he can lure show-weary buyers and editors from the tents of Bryant Park to the Upper East Side headquarters of the Society of Illustrators, the stately town house where he will make his debut. 
 The gamble seems ill-timed if not reckless. A lingering recession has dashed cold water on fashion's perennial quest for novelty. And the days are long gone when a major department store might advance a promising designer a hefty percentage of projected earnings to finance production. Yet a handful of insiders are still willing to champion a neophyte with a brash eye and an air of authenticity. 
 ''Everything is about branding now,'' lamented Catherine Dietlein, an influential retail scout. ''When you come across someone who's not part of the corporate machinery, you feel inclined to give him a chance.'' Ms. Dietlein, who buys for Blake, a high-end boutique in Chicago, plans to attend Mr. Smith's presentation. 
 Erin Wylie, the New York editor for the Web site Daily Candy, posted a video last week showing Mr. Smith at work on his line. Ms. Wylie, who met the designer at the repeated urging of his publicist, observed that he has the compelling back story that is one of fashion's requisite calling cards. 
 ''He didn't go to a fancy design school,'' she said. ''He didn't come from a patrician lineage. Yet there is almost a couture sense to his design. That Mr. Smith creates his own patterns and lays out his fabrics on his bedroom floor lends him a kind of mythic quality.'' 
 The climb from obscurity was arduous. His grandfather, George A. Smith, a retired postal worker, recalled that by the time LaQuan was 4, the boy, true to cliche, was ''drawing twiggies'' -- slim elegant figures decked out in feathers and lace. The senior Mr. Smith was not amused. ''I gave him a football, but he did not want that football,'' he said. ''Then it was basketball, then a baseball glove.'' To no avail. ''He was totally uncoordinated,'' he added resignedly.
 High school was a trial for a lanky boy with close-cropped hair and a fondness for owlish shades. He was branded an outsider by all but a handful of peers. ''Nobody understood my style,'' he said.
 After graduation, he applied to fashion school, only to be turned away in quick succession by the Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons the New School for Design. 
 ''I was just so angry,'' he said. At F.I.T., the admissions committee ''just looked at my sketches and asked, 'Who was my girl?' '' Meaning, he said, ''who did I see as my customer -- was she black or was she white? They didn't understand that those sketches are not about who is black or white. They're about fashion. That's all.'' 
 On a meager income from sporadic retail jobs and occasional stints as a stylist, and with the help of friends, Mr. Smith acquired a sewing machine and a comely mannequin he christened Ivanka who stands at his window sheathed in a cobalt blue cocktail dress. He also bought a sheaf of Wal-Mart patterns but soon decided they were too ''corny.''
 ''I needed to be able to design the kinds of clothes that I wanted to design,'' he said. 
 Mr. Smith now drafts his own patterns and cuts his fabrics -- all the silk taffeta and point d'esprit his budget will allow -- using his floor as a cutting table. The results -- sophisticated jackets shaped like seashells and a double-layered tank top made of lace and neoprene, the scuba fabric that turned up last season on the Balenciaga runway -- belie their gritty origins. ''I don't know how I do what I do,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I just do it. But I do believe something big is going to come my way.''
 When it does, ''you are going to be ready,'' insisted Kelly Mills, a publicist who first glimpsed Mr. Smith about a year ago oozing attitude and towering above the crowd at a late-night party. He was dressed in skinny jeans and six-inch-high Louboutin pumps. 
 As canny as she is well connected, Ms. Mills introduced his designs to Rihanna, who wears one of his pink-sequined jumpsuits on her latest video. Lady Gaga has worn his gilded fishnet leggings, as have members of Semi Precious Weapons, a band that tours with her. Some of those music world dignitaries have been invited to see his show. Should Saks or Neiman Marcus turn up, however, there could be a problem. There is hardly a point in staging a show if it produces a flurry of orders the designer cannot hope to fill. ''I'm frightened by that,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Realistically, I can't make these garments 100 times to send to 17 stores.'' 
 Losing no time, Ms. Mills interposed: ''You can ask to ship to just seven. And we can always cut a deal.''

HEADLINE: Crucible of Change

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
President Obama wanted to change Washington. It changed ... for the worse. And it's now holding his agenda hostage. The question is: How much is he willing to change himself in order to save it? 
 On Feb. 9, 2009, at the first prime-time press conference of his presidency, Obama said: ''I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument.'' 
 Since then, the right has tried to block him at nearly every turn, and the far right has formed a movement fueled by irrational anger. 
 Over the same period, his job approval ratings have dropped to new lows for him, and according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released on Thursday, the gap between those who trust him and the Democrats to handle major issues versus those who trust Republicans to do so has narrowed to nearly nothing.
 And perhaps most worrisome, according to a January report from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, Obama's image among the all-important independents as a ''strong leader'' and a president ''able to get things done'' took the biggest slides of all his character traits measured.
 Yet, there he was again this week, a year to the day after the prime-time press conference, saying almost exactly the same thing: ''I am just an eternal optimist. ... And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what's right for the country and assume that over time, people, regardless of party, regardless of their particular political positions, are going to gravitate towards the truth.'' So stubbornly sweet. So simply naive.
 If Obama is still clinging to this quaint concept after the year he's had, it's easy to understand why he's in trouble.
 Still, it's not too late for him to change. In fact, this is his moment. He's already showing some signs of change, but his changes have to be even more dramatic.
 My advice: Worry less about making arguments and more about making connections. Simplify the message: ''Getting America back to work.'' Shake up the staffing of the West Wing to signal a fresh start. And keep showing those newly resurrected flashes of fight as a reminder that your patrician tenets are not at odds with bare-knuckled partisan politics. 
 At a dinner in New York City two weeks before his election, Obama joked that he was not the messiah but Superman. ''Contrary to the rumors you've heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton. ...''
 Well, our mild-mannered president is in desperate need of a telephone booth. He needs to summon his inner Superman who knows how to pair optimism with force when responding to a crisis, a Man of Steel who's more than a silver tongue with a tin ear.

HEADLINE: Lost in Transit

 BODY:
Here is chilling news for the eight million commuters who ride New York City's railroads, buses and subways each day and the businesses that depend on them. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system, is facing a budget shortfall of about $800 million. 
 Unless Gov. David Paterson and the Legislature find a fix, there will be drastic cuts in service: longer waits, overly crowded buses and trains, dirtier subway stations and more frequent breakdowns. Students will not have free passes to school and disabled riders would have less service. 
 The authority has been struggling with shortfalls for years, but its finances have gotten a lot worse. There are sound ideas for addressing these problems, but only if Albany's politicians are ready to finally show courage.
 Last year, after much prodding, the Legislature adopted a plan to finance the transportation authority that required nearly everyone in the New York City area -- commuters, businesses, taxi riders -- to pay a little more to keep the system running. But lawmakers balked at asking drivers to pay higher tolls on the city's remaining free bridges. The fix was supposed to last two years. Thanks to the cratering economy and new cuts courtesy of Albany, it only lasted six months. 
 The shortfalls are everywhere. Revenues for the transportation authority from dedicated taxes like those on real estate transfers are down. The payroll tax that was supposed to bring in $1.5 billion has fallen short by more than $200 million. Fewer people are riding to fewer jobs, so fare revenues were down $100 million in 2009. As part of a deficit reduction plan, Albany's lawmakers cut another $143 million from their contribution to the authority. And after a judge rejected the M.T.A.'s plan to scale back raises for employees, the shortfall increased by another $100 million. 
 Now Governor Paterson is threatening to make things worse. In a clear pander to suburban voters in this year's governor's race, he is calling for cutting the payroll tax in seven suburban counties around the city while increasing the payroll tax in the city's five boroughs. 
 A Legislature that is heavy on representatives from New York City is unlikely to go along -- at least on raising the city's taxes. The danger is that legislators, also facing voters this year, will decide to cut suburban payroll taxes without making up the loss to the transportation authority. 
 Some advocates are suggesting the agency shift some of its federal stimulus money -- supposed to be reserved for maintenance, subway construction and upgrades -- to use for operations. Transportation experts warn that if that happens, the system would deteriorate. Remember the ratty old subways of 30 years ago? 
 Albany must come up with a lasting solution for the M.T.A. That means leaving the payroll tax alone and finding new revenue sources -- starting with tolls on Manhattan's free bridges that could raise an estimated $600 million a year. It may mean raising fares, although that should be a last resort. It will mean supporting the new Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman, Jay Walder, including in his plans to lay off workers as he streamlines the system. 
 What it should not mean is doing away with free passes for needy students. Both the state and city will have to contribute more to help pay $214 million a year to help keep these students in school. 
 The transit system that feeds the New York City area is crucial to the welfare and commercial vitality of the entire state. Governor Paterson and the Legislature have a responsibility to make sure it has the money it needs to keep working.

HEADLINE: Diary of a Queens Pay Phone, Where a Link to Life Costs 25 Cents

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Benjamin Patir called his son because he was lonely and, perhaps more important, because he had a quarter. Robert J. Covelli called his son, too, to find out if, at some point during the more than 24 hours he spent in custody, he had become, for the first time, a grandfather. Frank Federico, fresh from a courthouse jail cell, called his mother, who spared him any lectures and asked him if he needed a ride home.
 The three men used the same curbside pay phone on a busy block of Queens Boulevard last week. So did Carlos Luciano, who lent his cellphone to his wife. And Alex Santana, who bought a banana to get change. And Marvin McCain, a subway conductor trying to call in sick, and two men uninterested in giving their names or explaining why, at midnight on a neon-lit stretch of Kew Gardens, Queens, they had to make a call.
 Everybody knows the public pay phone is dying, but nobody inclined to watch this one would believe it. It sits across the street from Queens Criminal Court, on a patch of sidewalk facing Fast & Fresh Supermarket Deli & Grocery. In the age of the iPhone and the BlackBerry, in a city where cellphones are cheaper and more plentiful than toasters, the pay phone outside Fast & Fresh is outdated, outnumbered, outperformed. 
 Yet this grimy phone -- in a silvery booth that Superman would have skipped over, for it is doorless and not fully enclosed -- survives and, in its own nickel-and-dime way, thrives. 
 In seven days last week, more than 100 people deposited a total of $52 in the phone, at 25 cents per call. Last month, hundreds of people put in a total of $210 worth of coins. Those who stepped into the booth last Thursday and Friday provided a snapshot of New York's pay phone user, an elusive, rather anonymous demographic sometimes viewed with suspicion. 
 They were mostly men, as young as 18 and as old as 62. They were Hispanic, black, white, Arab. Several said they were unemployed and could not afford a cellphone. Others owned a cellphone, but did not have it for one reason or another. For many, there was nothing suspicious about whom they dialed and why: They called their mothers. The machine served not so much as a lifeline, but as a simple landline, with life.
 THURSDAY, FEB. 4, 9:07 A.M.
 Mr. Patir, 59, pulled a quarter from a pocket. He happened to be walking by the phone booth when he decided to call his son. He has been out of work for five years, ever since his stroke, and he said he ran out of money to pay his cellphone bill two weeks ago. Asked why he called from that phone at that moment, he replied, ''Loneliness, loneliness, loneliness.'' 
 Mr. Patir's son did not answer. He left a message. ''I just asked him why nobody think about me,'' he said. ''Nobody calls me.'' 
 11:17 A.M.
 The booth provides something more than advertising space or shelter from the elements. It offers anonymity. And deniability. 
 ''Nah,'' one young man who made a call insisted, ''you didn't see me use that phone.''
 12:54 P.M.
 Frank Federico, 34, stepped into the booth. He had just been released from custody from the criminal courthouse. His cellphone was not as lucky. It was still back at the police precinct, where he was processed after being arrested the day before for heroin possession. ''I do drugs,'' Mr. Federico said frankly. ''I got caught with them.''
 While Mr. Federico talked with his mother, standing behind him was Jishan Alam, 18, waiting to call his brother after also being released from custody. Mr. Alam, a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, said he was stopped by the police for walking between subway cars and then arrested because he had failed to appear for a previous traffic ticket. 
 Mr. Federico asked Mr. Alam for a quarter. Mr. Alam had none, but he handed him a dollar and told him to keep it, and the two of them walked to Fast & Fresh to get change and use the phone. 
 Queens Criminal Court is the booth's biggest customer. It sits with its back to the courthouse at the edge of the curb -- ''Phone'' in blue letters across the top --between 82nd Road and 83rd Avenue. People rush out of their arraignments, head down the courthouse steps, cross Queens Boulevard, hop the fence on the traffic median and call their relatives or friends, repeating one basic message over and over again: Come pick me up, I'm out. 
 No one lingers very long, because no incoming calls are accepted. The recently released from jail were a population that was easy to spot in the frigid cold last week. Many appeared to have been arrested without their coats or had had their jackets confiscated, because they emerged from the courthouse dressed in thin shirts, and they shivered as they stood in the booth.
 The Queens Boulevard pay phone is one of 16,358 on the city's sidewalks, according to the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, the city agency that regulates them. The total has steadily decreased as cellphone usage has proliferated -- 33,335 in 2000, 28,971 in 2004, 16,358 today. There are thousands more inside bars, restaurants and private buildings that the city does not regulate.
 Verizon, which owns many, though not all, of the city's pay phones, operates about 7,000 on the sidewalks and another 18,000 in subway stations and buildings.
 Alex Steiner said the Queens Boulevard phone is one of the busiest of the 810 pay phones he co-owns with a partner, Dennis Danforth. Though they have had to pull out 500 phones that were not generating enough business in recent years, they remain optimistic. 
 ''Cellphones have not killed the business,'' said Mr. Steiner, 62, the former president of the Independent Payphone Association of New York. ''It certainly has reduced it.''
 Back at the Queens Boulevard pay phone, Mr. Federico and Mr. Alam finished their calls and wandered off. The booth was empty for only a minute or two before the courthouse sent it another client.
 9 P.M.
 From 9 p.m. Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday, only one person used the phone, Alex Santana, 37. He came from the courthouse, said he had been arrested on a charge of unlawfully soliciting a passenger for a cab ride at the airport and had called a friend to ask him to drive him home to Brooklyn. 
 This is not to say the booth was lonely. All day and night, people walk by the booth, holding cellphones to their ears. Tim Barr, 30, had ducked inside earlier and stood with his back to the receiver, talking to his best friend on an iPhone. Others used the booth as a wind barrier to light cigarettes. The body of the phone and the black metal tray below took on an unintended role as coasters, for coffee cups and a can of Budweiser in a paper bag. 
 FEB. 5, 8:51 P.M.
 Robert J. Covelli, 46, dialed a number and put the receiver to his ear. The earpiece had a small crack running through the black plastic, and so many hands have grasped its spine that the yellow-and-blue sticker running down it reading International now just spells national. 
 Mr. Covelli did not have time for hello. 
 ''I'm out, baby,'' he said into the phone. He had just left the courthouse, where he was taken after being arrested about 3 p.m. the day before. It was a long, complicated story, involving, he said later, an unpaid traffic ticket and the fact that he did not have his wallet or identification on him when the police stopped him as he was walking in Jamaica, Queens. 
 He needed at least a handful of quarters to dive into every detail -- the phone's mirrored faceplate listed local calls at three minutes for 25 cents -- so Mr. Covelli kept it short as he spoke to his son. ''I didn't have I.D. on me,'' he told him.
 He hung up, turned around and stepped toward Fast & Fresh but then stopped and returned to the phone. He called his mother. ''Ma! Ma!'' he said, but she did not pick up. He bought a cup of coffee and a pastry from the store, and then stood a moment outside by the phone to catch his breath. 
 His son's wife was about to have a baby. ''She's having five-minute contractions,'' said Mr. Covelli, who lives on Long Island and works as a survey inspector for a title insurance company. ''I'm on my way home. He just told me she's in pain. It's coming. It could be at any given minute.''

HEADLINE: New Pasture Rules Issued For Organic Dairy Producers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Department of Agriculture issued new rules on Friday meant to settle a dispute in the organic agriculture industry over how much time cows at organic dairies must spend grazing on pasture. 
 The ruling was cheered by many in the organic industry who said it would shore up consumer confidence in organic milk and could force some larger dairies in Western states to change how they operate. 
 ''This is the biggest deal in the organic community for many years,'' said Miles V. McEvoy, the deputy administrator of the National Organic Program, the arm of the agriculture department that regulates the organic farming industry. 
 ''Because of the controversy and the complaints against some of the larger Western dairies, it has really affected consumer confidence in the organic label. That's why it's so important for us to set the standard and say that organic livestock are pasture-based.''
 The new rules clarify an older requirement that said only that organically raised livestock had to have access to pasture. That left a loophole for some dairies that would put cows out to pasture only during periods when the animals were not giving milk or would feed their animals almost exclusively on grain or other feeds. 
 The new regulations, which go into effect in June, are much more specific. They say that animals must graze on pasture for the full length of the local grazing season. The season will be determined by local conditions and agriculture authorities, like organic certifiers or county conservation officials, not by the dairy alone. While the grazing season must last at least 120 days, in many areas it will be much longer. 
 The rules also say that animals must get at least 30 percent of their food from pasture during the grazing season. 
 Mr. McEvoy said the rules would be enforced by organic certifiers who will be required to make at least one inspection a year. In some cases, additional spot checks will be made. 
 ''There's this feeling that it will level the playing field between the larger farms in the West and the smaller farms throughout the nation,'' said Nancy Hirshberg, a vice president for Stonyfield Farm, who supported the rule change. Stonyfield markets milk from about 1,400 organic dairy farms across the country, which in most cases have about 50 to 75 cows each. She said that all the farmers who supplied Stonyfield already operated in accordance with the new rules. 
 Aurora Organic Dairy, based in Colorado, has been the focus of much criticism in recent years for how it pastures its animals. For many it has come to represent the contradictions embodied in large-scale organic farming. The dairy has about 15,000 cows on five farms in Colorado and Texas, with a total of about 4,400 acres of pasture, said Sally Keefe, Aurora's vice president for government affairs. 
 Agriculture department data shows that in 2008 there were 2,031 organic dairies in the country, with an average of 108 cows on each one, although many had far fewer. 
 While Ms. Keefe said she was still reviewing the final rule on Friday, she said she expected little would have to change in the dairy's operations. 
 ''We already graze for at least 120 days a year, most years it's well north of that,'' Ms. Keefe said. ''And we believe that we already comply with the dry matter intake requirements,'' she said, referring to the rule that cows get at least 30 percent of their food from pasture during the grazing season.
 Aurora, which supplies organic milk for the private label brands of several supermarket chains, agreed to make significant changes in 2007 after the agriculture department threatened to revoke its organic certification. Among the changes, the dairy agreed to give its animals greater access to pasture. 
 The new rules also apply to cattle raised for beef. In the case of beef cattle, however, the requirement that 30 percent of food must come from pasture is lifted during the so-called finishing period, which is when the animals are being fattened for slaughter and are often fed on grain. During that period they must still be allowed to graze, however.

HEADLINE: Europe's Recovery Comes to Near Halt

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Europe's economic recovery almost ground to a halt in the last quarter of 2009, according to data released Friday, capping a week of worries about the ability of some countries to deal with their outsize budget deficits. 
 Gross domestic product in the 16-nation euro area increased by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. The same tepid rate was recorded for the 27 members of the European Union as a whole. 
 France was essentially the only bright spot, increasing 0.6 percent in the quarter, driven in large part by consumer spending and inventory changes, its national statistics office, Insee, reported. 
 Analysts said the main reasons for the softening in European growth were the weak labor market, retrenchment by companies and patchy consumer spending. The anemic recovery is still being supported by government stimulus programs, now under siege in countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal because of growing nervousness in financial markets about government debt. 
 Last month, the International Monetary Fund forecast growth in the euro zone this year at 1 percent. ''If Europe posts 1 percent growth this year, that would be considered a great success,'' said Alfred Steinherr, research professor at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''But that's not enough to prevent unemployment rising or help private demand.'' 
 Most economists do not expect Europe to slide back into recession, but few expect it to keep pace with the rest of world. In the United States, gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, equivalent to about 1.4 percent above the previous quarter. 
 In China, the economy is expanding so rapidly that the central bank announced measures on Friday to require banks to set aside more reserves in a bid to limit credit. It was the second such move by the Bank of China in less than five weeks aimed at slowing the economy. 
 During the third quarter, the euro zone economy grew 0.4 percent. For the year, gross domestic product contracted 4 percent in the euro zone and 4.1 percent in the European Union. 
 Mr. Steinherr said Europe now faced a fundamental quandary after having failed to resolve deep-seated competitive issues that took root during the financial crisis. Market forces and the constraints of European fiscal agreements are imposing the ''wrong policy mix,'' he said, pushing several countries to try to cut their deficit spending at a time when it is needed most. 
 ''Temporary fiscal deficits have replaced private demand,'' Mr. Steinherr said, ''but it's hard to see private demand coming back in 2010 or 2011.'' 
 One benefit of the current disarray over budget deficits, however, is that it has led to a weaker euro. That should help stimulate demand for additional European exports, something that could lift production and perhaps ease the pain of fiscal retrenchment. 
 In Germany, which has the largest European economy, G.D.P. was flat in the fourth quarter after an expansion of 0.7 percent in the third. The Federal Statistics Agency in Germany said that the ''only positive contribution was made by foreign trade,'' while consumption and investment declined. No further breakdown of the German data will be available until Feb. 24. 
 Aline Schuiling, an economist at Fortis Bank, said the stabilization in Germany ''reflects some payback for the sharp expansion in the third quarter.'' During that period, growth was helped by strong gains in fixed investment, which appear to have fallen away. 
 ''We think the economy will embark on a moderate growth path from the start of this year,'' Ms. Schuiling added. 
 In France, with an economy that trails only Germany in the euro zone, inventories contributed 0.9 percent to economic growth, while the domestic demand added half a percentage point. For the whole year, growth in France declined 2.2 percent. 
 The Dutch economy also expanded, by 0.3 percent against the third quarter. 
 The Italian economy contracted 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, after an expansion of 0.6 percent in the previous quarter, the national statistical agency Istat said. G.D.P. contracted 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter from the period a year earlier. 
 The Greek economy remained in recession, shrinking by 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Eurostat, while Portugal's output was unchanged after two solid quarters. To the east, the economies of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania also shrank. 
 On Thursday, data showed that Spain, hit especially hard by a housing slump, remained in a recession. 
 For some, the trends suggest that the European economies might diverge further this year. ''It's becoming increasingly likely that we will see growing G.D.P. differentials between the northern and southern part of the area,'' said Marco Valli, the chief Italian economist at UniCredit Research in Milan.

HEADLINE: Three Poems by Tato Laviera

 BODY:
Three poems by Tato Laviera, whose work bridges New York and Puerto Rico, English and Spanish. The first, ''commonwealth,'' explores the political and emotional limbo created by Puerto Rico's nebulous status as neither state nor sovereign: 
 commonwealth 
 no, not yet, no, not yet
 i will not proclaim myself,
 a total child of any land,
 i'm still in the commonwealth 
 stage of my life, wondering
 what to decide, what to conclude,
 what to declare myself.
 i'm still in the commonwealth
 stage of my life, not knowing 
 which ideology to select.
 i'm still in the commonwealth
 stage of my life, all of us
 caught in a web of suspension,
 light-years away from the indians'
 peaceful enclaves.
 i'm still in the commonwealth
 stage of my life, observing the many integrated experiences
 we took everything
 and became everybody else.
 i'm still in the commonwealth 
 stage of my life, but there's
 not enough hatred in our hearts
 to kill each other or to draw
 blood for too long, ours 
 is a mental search
 carved through a mainstream of options
 but yet, somewhere
 in the commonwealth, we all yearn
 to feel our strengths,
 to show our ultimate,
 to find common wealth among us,
 to close our eyes,
 to find the total silence, silencio, silence,
 to find ... not one thing that unites us,
 even in silence we are still
 in the commonwealth stage of our lives,
 so let's touch hands, friends and foes,
 and stay together to hear each other's 
 sounds just for one moment, let's stay
 tucked together, and maybe then, less
 options, maybe then, hope.

 greek
 looking to find modern mythology
 in the descendants
 of ancient playwrights, to see if
 something rubbed off, was Aristotle
 brown in color, no, it couldn't be,
 well, anyway, the new poets of god,
 are making money, simply because the 
 poets were kept unemployed by some sleazy
 characters throughout history,
 where else could I find such
 mythological realities, I wonder
 if the greek scientists, who are
 new board chairmen, were lighter in
 skin than the playwrights, that
 might explain, no, it couldn't be ... 
 well, anyway, I love all greeks,
 and all the colors they may wish
 to add to this poem, but I always
 think they are puerto ricans,
 that's why I only mythologize
 in greek restaurants open
 twenty-four hours a day
 in new york.

HEADLINE: Diary of a Queens Pay Phone, Where a Link to Life Costs 25 Cents

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Benjamin Patir called his son because he was lonely and, perhaps more important, because he had a quarter. Robert J. Covelli called his son, too, to find out if, at some point during the more than 24 hours he spent in custody, he had become, for the first time, a grandfather. Frank Federico, fresh from a courthouse jail cell, called his mother, who spared him any lectures and asked him if he needed a ride home.
 The three men used the same curbside pay phone on a busy block of Queens Boulevard last week. So did Carlos Luciano, who lent his cellphone to his wife. And Alex Santana, who bought a banana to get change. And Marvin McCain, a subway conductor trying to call in sick, and two men uninterested in giving their names or explaining why, at midnight on a neon-lit stretch of Kew Gardens, Queens, they had to make a call.
 Everybody knows the public pay phone is dying, but nobody inclined to watch this one would believe it. It sits across the street from Queens Criminal Court, on a patch of sidewalk facing Fast & Fresh Supermarket Deli & Grocery. In the age of the iPhone and the BlackBerry, in a city where cellphones are cheaper and more plentiful than toasters, the pay phone outside Fast & Fresh is outdated, outnumbered, outperformed. 
 Yet this grimy phone -- in a silvery booth that Superman would have skipped over, for it is doorless and not fully enclosed -- survives and, in its own nickel-and-dime way, thrives. 
 In seven days last week, more than 100 people deposited a total of $52 in the phone, at 25 cents per call. Last month, hundreds of people put in a total of $210 worth of coins. Those who stepped into the booth last Thursday and Friday provided a snapshot of New York's pay phone user, an elusive, rather anonymous demographic sometimes viewed with suspicion. 
 They were mostly men, as young as 18 and as old as 62. They were Hispanic, black, white, Arab. Several said they were unemployed and could not afford a cellphone. Others owned a cellphone, but did not have it for one reason or another. For many, there was nothing suspicious about whom they dialed and why: They called their mothers. The machine served not so much as a lifeline, but as a simple landline, with life.
 THURSDAY, FEB. 4, 9:07 A.M.
 Mr. Patir, 59, pulled a quarter from a pocket. He happened to be walking by the phone booth when he decided to call his son. He has been out of work for five years, ever since his stroke, and he said he ran out of money to pay his cellphone bill two weeks ago. Asked why he called from that phone at that moment, he replied, ''Loneliness, loneliness, loneliness.'' 
 Mr. Patir's son did not answer. He left a message. ''I just asked him why nobody think about me,'' he said. ''Nobody calls me.'' 
 11:17 A.M.
 The booth provides something more than advertising space or shelter from the elements. It offers anonymity. And deniability. 
 ''Nah,'' one young man who made a call insisted, ''you didn't see me use that phone.''
 12:54 P.M.
 Frank Federico, 34, stepped into the booth. He had just been released from custody from the criminal courthouse. His cellphone was not as lucky. It was still back at the police precinct, where he was processed after being arrested the day before for heroin possession. ''I do drugs,'' Mr. Federico said frankly. ''I got caught with them.''
 While Mr. Federico talked with his mother, standing behind him was Jishan Alam, 18, waiting to call his brother after also being released from custody. Mr. Alam, a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, said he was stopped by the police for walking between subway cars and then arrested because he had failed to appear for a previous traffic ticket. 
 Mr. Federico asked Mr. Alam for a quarter. Mr. Alam had none, but he handed him a dollar and told him to keep it, and the two of them walked to Fast & Fresh to get change and use the phone. 
 Queens Criminal Court is the booth's biggest customer. It sits with its back to the courthouse at the edge of the curb -- ''Phone'' in blue letters across the top --between 82nd Road and 83rd Avenue. People rush out of their arraignments, head down the courthouse steps, cross Queens Boulevard, hop the fence on the traffic median and call their relatives or friends, repeating one basic message over and over again: Come pick me up, I'm out. 
 No one lingers very long, because no incoming calls are accepted. The recently released from jail were a population that was easy to spot in the frigid cold last week. Many appeared to have been arrested without their coats or had had their jackets confiscated, because they emerged from the courthouse dressed in thin shirts, and they shivered as they stood in the booth.
 The Queens Boulevard pay phone is one of 16,358 on the city's sidewalks, according to the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, the city agency that regulates them. The total has steadily decreased as cellphone usage has proliferated -- 33,335 in 2000, 28,971 in 2004, 16,358 today. There are thousands more inside bars, restaurants and private buildings that the city does not regulate.
 Verizon, which owns many, though not all, of the city's pay phones, operates about 7,000 on the sidewalks and another 18,000 in subway stations and buildings.
 Alex Steiner said the Queens Boulevard phone is one of the busiest of the 810 pay phones he co-owns with a partner, Dennis Danforth. Though they have had to pull out 500 phones that were not generating enough business in recent years, they remain optimistic. 
 ''Cellphones have not killed the business,'' said Mr. Steiner, 62, the former president of the Independent Payphone Association of New York. ''It certainly has reduced it.''
 Back at the Queens Boulevard pay phone, Mr. Federico and Mr. Alam finished their calls and wandered off. The booth was empty for only a minute or two before the courthouse sent it another client.
 9 P.M.
 From 9 p.m. Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday, only one person used the phone, Alex Santana, 37. He came from the courthouse, said he had been arrested on a charge of unlawfully soliciting a passenger for a cab ride at the airport and had called a friend to ask him to drive him home to Brooklyn. 
 This is not to say the booth was lonely. All day and night, people walk by the booth, holding cellphones to their ears. Tim Barr, 30, had ducked inside earlier and stood with his back to the receiver, talking to his best friend on an iPhone. Others used the booth as a wind barrier to light cigarettes. The body of the phone and the black metal tray below took on an unintended role as coasters, for coffee cups and a can of Budweiser in a paper bag. 
 FEB. 5, 8:51 P.M.
 Robert J. Covelli, 46, dialed a number and put the receiver to his ear. The earpiece had a small crack running through the black plastic, and so many hands have grasped its spine that the yellow-and-blue sticker running down it reading International now just spells national. 
 Mr. Covelli did not have time for hello. 
 ''I'm out, baby,'' he said into the phone. He had just left the courthouse, where he was taken after being arrested about 3 p.m. the day before. It was a long, complicated story, involving, he said later, an unpaid traffic ticket and the fact that he did not have his wallet or identification on him when the police stopped him as he was walking in Jamaica, Queens. 
 He needed at least a handful of quarters to dive into every detail -- the phone's mirrored faceplate listed local calls at three minutes for 25 cents -- so Mr. Covelli kept it short as he spoke to his son. ''I didn't have I.D. on me,'' he told him.
 He hung up, turned around and stepped toward Fast & Fresh but then stopped and returned to the phone. He called his mother. ''Ma! Ma!'' he said, but she did not pick up. He bought a cup of coffee and a pastry from the store, and then stood a moment outside by the phone to catch his breath. 
 His son's wife was about to have a baby. ''She's having five-minute contractions,'' said Mr. Covelli, who lives on Long Island and works as a survey inspector for a title insurance company. ''I'm on my way home. He just told me she's in pain. It's coming. It could be at any given minute.''

HEADLINE: Watching China Run

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It was primarily a symbolic gesture. Way back in 1979, in the midst of an energy crisis, Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House. They were used to heat water for some White House staffers.
 ''A generation from now,'' said Mr. Carter, ''this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people, harnessing the power of the sun to enrich our lives as we move away from our crippling dependence on foreign oil.'' 
 Ronald Reagan had the panels taken down.
 We missed the boat then, and lord knows we're missing it now. Two weeks ago, as I was getting ready to take off for Palo Alto, Calif., to cover a conference on the importance of energy and infrastructure for the next American economy, The Times's Keith Bradsher was writing from Tianjin, China, about how the Chinese were sprinting past everybody else in the world, including the United States, in the race to develop clean energy. 
 That we are allowing this to happen is beyond stupid. China is a poor country with nothing comparable to the tremendous research, industrial and economic resources that the U.S. has been blessed with. Yet they're blowing us away -- at least for the moment -- in the race to the future.
 Our esteemed leaders in Washington can't figure out how to do anything more difficult than line up for a group photo. Put Americans back to work? You must be kidding. Health care? We've been working on it for three-quarters of a century. Infrastructure? Don't ask.
 But, as Mr. Bradsher tells us, ''China vaulted past competitors in Denmark, Germany, Spain and the United States last year to become the world's largest maker of wind turbines and is poised to expand even further this year.''
 China also has become the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels and is pushing hard on other clean energy advances. As Mr. Bradsher wrote: ''These efforts to dominate renewable energy technologies raise the prospect that the West may someday trade its dependence on oil from the Mideast for a reliance on solar panels, wind turbines and other gear manufactured in China.''
 We're in the throes of an awful and seemingly endless employment crisis, and China is the country moving full speed ahead on the development of the world's most important new industries. I'd like one of the Washington suits to step away from the photo-op and explain the logic of that to me.
 The truth, of course, is that there is no reason at all for this to be happening. The United States, in many ways, is very well prepared to move ahead on clean energy. It could and should be the world's leader. Many, if not most, of the innovations in this area were developed right here. But much of that know-how, as we are seeing in China (and have been seeing in Germany and other places), is being implemented overseas.
 The conference that I attended in Palo Alto spotlighted the need to move to a low-carbon economy in the U.S. and exemplified some of the resources available to make it happen. It was sponsored by the Brookings Institution and Lazard, the investment banking advisory firm. The participants included the leaders of -- and major investors in -- companies that are making great strides in the alternative energy industry. But much of their business is done overseas because right now in America's wacky, dysfunctional public sector there is no clear vision of a viable clean-energy economy, and, thus, no clue about how to get there.
 The network of world-class universities and advanced research institutions in the U.S. is by far the most impressive in the world: think Harvard and Stanford and Berkeley and M.I.T. and on and on. If you add to that the venture capital community in the U.S. with its vast experience and the willingness of investors to take risks, and the sheer entrepreneurial talent of the American business community, you end up with an array of resources fully capable of moving the U.S. into a low-carbon, high-growth and extraordinarily productive economy that would be the envy of the world.
 But for that to happen -- as Bruce Katz, a Brookings executive who was one of the organizers of the conference, pointed out -- America's corporate, civic and political leaders will have to ''articulate what's really at stake here.'' 
 And what's at stake is the future of the American economy. The low-carbon era is coming. We can be dragged into that newer, greener world by leading countries like China; or we can take up the challenge and become the world's leader ourselves.

THE SCIENCE OF LIBERTY
 Democracy, Reason, and the Laws of Nature
 By Timothy Ferris
 368 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99
 To say that the scientific frame of mind has played an important part in the rise of the West is not exactly controversial. Science always gets its moment in the spotlight in ''Whig history,'' as historians (dismissively) call grand narratives of political and material progress. In ''The Science of Liberty,'' the veteran science writer Timothy Ferris makes a more extravagant claim, assigning not a mere supporting role but top billing to the celebrated experimenters and inventors of the past several centuries. As he sees it, the standard account of the history textbooks -- with the Renaissance giving rise to the Scientific Revolution and thus preparing the way for the Enlightenment -- fails to identify the primary causal relationship. Democratic governance and individual rights did not emerge from some amorphous ''brew of humanistic and scientific thinking,'' he argues, but were ''sparked'' by science itself -- the crucial ''innovative ingredient'' that ''continues to foster political freedom today.'' 
 Ferris, the author of ''The Whole Shebang'' and a number of other books about cosmology, usefully reminds us that science was an integral part of the intellectual equipment of the great pioneers of political and individual liberty. John Locke was not just the most eloquent philosophical advocate of the social contract and natural rights. He was an active member of the emerging scientific culture of 17th-century Oxford, and his intimates included Isaac Newton, who likewise was a radical Whig, supporting Parliament against the overreaching of the crown. Among the American founders, the scientific preoccupations of Franklin and Jefferson are well known, but Ferris emphasizes that they were hardly alone in their interests. He recounts a charming episode, for instance, in which George Washington and Thomas Paine floated together one night down a New Jersey creek, lighting cartridge paper at the water's surface to determine whose theory was correct about the source of swamp gas. Ferris also neatly summarizes the prehistory of modern science's ascent, with subtle takes on Galileo's clash with church authorities and Francis Bacon's inductive method.
 The most engaging chapters in ''The Science of Liberty'' concern the dynamic interplay of technology and commerce. As Ferris recognizes, the seemingly irresistible spread of modern principles of liberty derives in large measure from the capacity of modern industrial democracies to deliver the goods in terms of general prosperity, health and diversion. The practical side of the scientific outlook has generated endless rounds of invention and innovation (Watt and his steam engine, Morse and his telegraph, Edison and his electric lights, etc.), and the human benefits of these time- and labor-saving improvements have been extended dramatically, if haltingly, by the free market. The singular insight of Adam Smith, Ferris writes, was to recognize that wealth creation and the production of material comforts might be ''increased indefinitely if individuals are free to invest and to innovate.'' 
 By this point in his ambitious narrative, however, Ferris has given up on any real effort to argue for the decisive influence of science as such. He is content to speak of science metaphorically, as the model for openness and experimentalism in all the major realms of liberal-democratic endeavor. Thus, just as in his account of Smith's free-market economics, Ferris finds in the United States Constitution the underlying principle that citizens should ''be free to experiment, assess the results and conduct new experiments.'' The American Republic might be compared to ''a scientific laboratory,'' he writes, because it is designed ''not to guide society toward a specified goal, but to sustain the experimental process itself.'' 
 Ferris's refrain of ''experiment'' is a well-chosen trope. Few other words in the vocabulary of Western progress can match its prestige and practical appeal. To rely on experiment is to doubt authority, to cultivate self-awareness, to seek the reality behind natural appearances and received opinion. The experimental frame of mind encompasses the scientist in her lab, the inventor in his workshop and even (with some literary license) the reflective bohemian, the calculating entrepreneur and the shrewd democratic leader. But does it yield the ''laws of nature'' from which Locke and Jefferson drew the idea of universal human rights? Does it explain our reluctance today to compromise those rights in the name of expediency or results? Jeremy Bentham dismissed the idea of natural rights as ''nonsense upon stilts,'' because it stood in the way of a proper utilitarian calculus of human welfare. Arguably, one can find his heirs today atop the Chinese state, conducting technocratic experiments of their own and deploying the tools of modern science (Google beware!) to preserve a ''harmonious society.'' For the politics of liberty, mere empiricism is not enough. 
 Ferris is on firm ground in arguing that the political influence of the scientific enterprise has been liberalizing and progressive, on the whole. Whig history has its virtues. And he provides convincing indictments of various illiberal ideologies, from Nazism and Soviet Communism to postmodernist cultural theory, for their incompatibility with scientific inquiry. He would have done his readers a favor, however, by approaching the ideas of liberalism's most penetrating philosophical critics with more generosity; his tendency is to jeer and dismiss. Rousseau, Marx and Heidegger have indeed inspired a range of noxious intellectual and political movements, but they still have things to teach us about the failings and vulnerabilities of liberal-democratic societies. 
 Nor is it clear, as Ferris would have it, that science furnishes the ideal template for liberal democracy. Science, he notes, is antiauthoritarian, self-correcting, meritocratic and collaborative. As John Dewey, one of his heroes, put it, ''freedom of inquiry, toleration of diverse views, freedom of communication, the distribution of what is found out to every individual as the ultimate intellectual consumer'' are all as ''involved in the democratic as in the scientific method.'' In a like vein, Ferris also cites the theoretical physicist Lee Smolin: ''Good science comes from the collision of contradictory ideas, from conflict, from people trying to do better than their teachers did, and I think here we have a model for what a democratic society is about.'' 
 But crucial distinctions are lost in these comparisons. The scientific community may be open to everyone, in principle, but it has steep and familiar barriers to entry, as any layperson who has tried to read the research papers at the back of journals like Nature or Science can attest. When not distorted by its own personal and political rivalries, modern science is, in the most admirable sense, an aristocracy -- a selection and sorting of the best minds as they interact within institutions designed to achieve certain rarefied ends. Experiment, equality and freedom of expression are essential to this work, but it is the work of an elite community from which most people are necessarily excluded. Thankfully, participation in the everyday life of democracydoes not require a Ph.D., nor are theories and ideas its basic medium.
 Scientists today are understandably eager to shape policy debates on a number of urgent issues (like climate change, to which Ferris devotes much of his closing chapter). But they have to appreciate the many ways in which scientific discourse, even in its experimental mode, makes an awkward fit with democratic politics. Only then will they find it easier to talk to -- and persuade -- the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Offering Whatever Floats Your Boat

BYLINE: By ELAINE GLUSAC

 BODY:
DESPITE rough economic seas, the cruise industry is staying the course this year with new destinations far and near, activities for young and old and amenities that seem to appeal to every niche. 
 Want to jam with Kid Rock or scream with fellow ''Twilight'' fans? There's a cruise for that. Traveling alone on a budget? There's a cruise for that, too. Or how about acupuncture for weight loss while sailing to Phuket. There are at least a dozen cruises for that. 
 From a boom in European cruises to a rediscovery of America's rivers, cruises are trying to appeal to an increasingly fragmented clientele. After all, as cruise experts like to point out, just shy of 20 percent of Americans have been on a cruise -- which means the remaining 80 percent are potential first-time passengers. 
 Return to America's Rivers 
 Not since Lewis and Clark, perhaps, have America's rivers seen so much cruising action. Spurred partly by the recession, which put more-extravagant cruises out of reach for many, river cruises are staging a steady comeback. 
 American Cruise Lines, a river cruise company based in Connecticut, is adding two vessels and three itineraries. The 104-passenger Independence, with a glassed-in dining room and staterooms with private balconies, is scheduled to launch in June. It will spend the summer sailing along the Maine coast before heading to the Hudson River for the October foliage season, with six-night fares starting at $2,820 (all prices quoted are based on double occupancy).
 The Queen of the West, a paddle-wheeler, will make its American Cruise Lines debut, with seven-night cruises along the Snake and Columbia Rivers in the Northwest, with stops in Portland, Ore.; Clarkston, Wash., and elsewhere starting at $3,395. American will also introduce a route along the Potomac and Delaware Rivers, with stops along the way in Philadelphia, Washington, Mount Vernon and Annapolis aboard the 100-passenger American Spirit. The eight-day cruises start at $3,295.
 Elsewhere in the Americas, the Caribbean remains popular, but the newest routes belong to the Atlantic. In May, Carnival Cruise Lines is stationing the 2,056-passenger Carnival Fantasy in Charleston, S.C., with five-day departures to the Bahamas starting at $269.
 Bermuda is seeing more action, too. Revisiting a route it hasn't sailed for more than 15 years, Holland America returns to New York City, offering 24 trips to Bermuda beginning in April. The 1,350-passenger Veendam will depart from the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, with weeklong cruises from $699. 
 Also newly bound for Bermuda is the Celebrity Summit, a 2,034-passenger ship that departs from Bayonne, N.J., to spend three nights in King's Wharf. Fares start at $549, with optional excursions to swim with dolphins or snorkel to a shipwreck, plus cruise-by sightings of the Statue of Liberty. 
 Europe by Water
 European cruises are growing, allowing cruisers to hopscotch the Continent with ease, while also helping Americans avoid high exchange rates by locking in fares in dollars. 
 ''Europe is today where we were 15, 20 years ago,'' said Bob Sharak, vice president of Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 25 major cruise lines that serve North America. ''New ships used to debut here, but now we're seeing them debuted and deployed in Europe.'' 
 And it's not just Americans who are onboard. In 2000, less than 10 percent of passengers on the cruise association's member ships were not citizens of the United States. Today that figure is nearly 25 percent. 
 Though it has run Mediterranean cruises in the past, Disney Cruise Line, based in Florida, will expand its European offerings with four trips that sail from Dover, England. The 12-night Northern European Capitals Cruise takes place June and July onboard the 2,700-passenger Disney Magic, with fares from $3,649. 
 Similarly, Norwegian Cruise Lines, which is based in Miami and has run intermittent cruises in Europe, will post a ship in Venice for the first time this year. The 2,400-passenger Norwegian Gem will run seven-day cruises to Greece and Turkey with departures from April 24 to Oct. 23, priced from $719.
 The growth in European cruises isn't limited to big ships. Princess Cruises is introducing a series of seven-day Interlude itineraries in Europe aboard the 680-passenger Ocean Princess. The cruises, which start at $1,299, will sail from Rome to the Greek Isles, and from Dover to Scandinavia. 
 Variety Cruises, a five-year-old yacht line based in Athens, is offering its first Adriatic trips this summer, with seven-night cruises that include stops at the island of Hvar and the cities of Zadar and Venice aboard the 46-guest Pegasus. Fares start at $2,690. 
 The rivers of Europe are bustling, too. Avalon Waterways, a river cruise line based in Colorado, will launch two 138-passenger ships this year -- the Avalon Felicity and the Avalon Luminary -- that will sail the Rhine, including an eight-day cruise from Zurich to Amsterdam from $2,099. 
 AMAWaterways, a river cruise operator based in California, is offering five new European cruises including a 22-day excursion along the Douro River in Portugal and the Rhone in France, from $7,677. Viking River Cruises in California has a new eight-day sail down the Danube from Germany to Hungary from $1,456. And Seattle's Cruise West launches two river cruises aboard the 148-guest MS Amadeus Diamond that goes down the Danube and the Rhine, from $4,999 for 11 nights. 
 Even landlocked Europe is seeing a spillover effect. Among the excursions highlighted by Cruise West, Princess and Viking this summer is the once-a-decade Passion Play. It takes place in the German village of Oberammergau. 
 Getting Shipshape
 Gaining weight is one of the perils on the high seas, with the average cruiser said to put on several pounds on a weeklong cruise. To help passengers get shipshape and resist the buffet, cruise ships are offering everything from beefed-up gyms to macrobiotic menus. 
 Crystal Cruises' 922-passenger Crystal Symphony, one of two ships run by the Los Angeles-based luxury line, recently opened a feng-shui-inspired fitness center with a walking program, indoor cycling and acupuncture treatments. In June, the three sailing yachts of Windstar Cruises, which is based in Seattle, will introduce Technogym-brand treadmills, stationary bikes, stair climbers and weight machines onboard. 
 Wellness packages that bundle fitness classes and healthy menus are expanding. Holland America's well-being package includes fitness classes, a 50-minute spa treatment, access to the whirlpool and steam room and daily fruit deliveries for a premium of $299 a person on seven-day cruises. Specialized tour companies like A Taste of Health offer cruises with vegan chefs and macrobiotic menus. Its Holistic Caribbean Cruise, for example, sets sail from Fort Lauderdale for a seven-night cruise to St. Thomas, Puerto Rico and elsewhere, with passengers learning to make dishes like seitan paella. Rates from $1,199.
 Spas have had makeovers themselves. Regent Seven Seas Cruises recently added Canyon Ranch spas on its three high-end ships. And Paul Gauguin Cruises, which plies the South Pacific, just opened a thalasso spa onboard its namesake vessel. 
 A few spas are even beginning to resemble health clinics. In December, the 540-passenger Silver Spirit from Silversea Cruises introduced a spa that offers acupuncture for weight loss and stress management, as well as Botox injections and Restylane facial filler. Emerald Princess and Ruby Princess also offer Botox and tooth bleaching, so you'll look good even if you put on a few extra pounds.
 Floating Red Carpet
 Celebrity cruises are not new, but the Q rating of headlining guests seems to be rising. ''Theme cruises have always been a way to get new-to-cruise people aboard,'' said Carolyn Spencer Brown, the editor in chief of Cruisecritic.com, an online cruise magazine. ''Now they're becoming more sort of glitzy.''
 John Mayer sold out a four-night Carnival cruise from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas last year. And James Taylor was the star attraction on Cunard Line's Queen Mary 2 bound from New York to Southampton, treating guests to concerts, interviews and autograph signings. 
 This year will see more stars. Kid Rock already sold out the five-day Carnival Inspiration cruise from Tampa to Grand Cayman starting in late April. Before that, in mid-April, the same ship and route will feature the pop bands 3 Doors Down, Lifehouse and Shinedown as part of a VH1 cruise (from $799). The Zac Brown Band headlines over Labor Day weekend (from $699).
 The teenage heartthrobs Alex Meraz and Michael Welch, who star in the vampire movie ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon,'' will join the four-day Twilight Cruise from Seattle to Alaska onboard Holland America's Oosterdam. Prices start at $1,049, not including an optional off-shore excursion to Forks, Wash., where the vampire drama is set.
 And if your idea of celebrity runs to radio stars, you can join Garrison Keillor and the cast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' March 14 on Holland America's Ryndam for a seven-night Tampa-to-Belize immersion in all things Minnesotan (fares from $1,700).
 Far-Flung Ports of Call
 Cruises are venturing into uncharted waters and docking at more far-flung ports of call in Asia, the Middle East and even the North Pole.
 Asia, in particular, is seeing a wave of new ships. Yachts of Seabourn, a small-ships specialist based in Miami, is posting its first ship in Asia. The 208-passenger Seabourn Pride sails a variety of Asian itineraries out of Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Kobe, Japan, with fares starting at $4,050 for 12 days.
 The Ocean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, will spend this spring hopping between Singapore and Shanghai, Shanghai and Bangkok, and Shanghai and Tokyo, before heading for Europe. Fares start at $2,299 for a 14-day cruise. 
 River cruises in Asia are growing, too. Viking River Cruises will offer a two-day stop in Shanghai for Expo 2010 on many of its China cruises. In Vietnam and Cambodia, AMAWaterways is offering cruises along the Mekong between Ho Chi Minh City and Siem Reap, Cambodia, on the 92-passenger La Marguerite. Fares start at $1,499 a person for seven nights.
 The Middle East continues to welcome more ships. Costa Cruises is docking its newest ship, the Deliziosa, in Dubai. The 2,260-passenger ship includes a roller skating track, a 4-D cinema -- think 3-D with physical effects like wind -- and a golf simulator with 37 courses. Seven-night cruises to Abu Dhabi and Bahrain start at $899. 
 The 2,501-capacity Brilliance of the Seas from Royal Caribbean International will return to Dubai for a second season, with seven-night sailings from $699. And the 1,070-passenger Crystal Serenity will sail two Middle Eastern routes in March including the line's first stops in Kuwait City; Bandar Abbas, Iran; and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (13-day fares start at $8,855).
 Cruises are shifting from the South to the North Pole. With Antarctica possibly closing to big cruise ships because of new environmental regulations, cruises to Arctic waters are on the rise. New this year is a 24-day Northwest Passage cruise from Germany's Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The 184-guest Hanseatic sails from Greenland to Nome, Alaska, with polar bear sightseeing in between. Norway-based Hurtigruten will offer an 11-day Climate Pilgrimage along the Arctic Circle north of Norway onboard the 318-passenger Fram. The cruise, which starts at $4,100, passes by glaciers and features talks with climate scientists. 
 Tauck, a small-ship operator based in Connecticut, has sold out its eight-day Iceland cruises aboard the new 264-passenger Le Boreal. Literary cruisers can still join the author Margaret Atwood aboard a 16-day Northwest Passage cruise with Adventure Canada, one of five new itineraries aboard the 118-passenger Clipper Adventurer. The Aug. 28 departure, from $5,995, includes readings and lectures by Ms. Atwood as well as tundra golf and iceberg ogling.
 Virgin Voyages
 In the wake of last year's Oasis of the Seas, billed as the world's largest ship, the class of 2010 might look small, but it isn't. For starters, in December Royal Caribbean is planning to launch a sister ship, Allure of the Seas, that shares many of the same superlatives as the Oasis. Both share the title of world's largest -- 1,181 feet long with room for 5,400 passengers. 
 The next largest is the Norwegian Epic, a 4,200-passenger vessel that has a Vegas-style lineup of shows including Blue Man Group, Cirque Dreams, Second City and Legends in Concert. The ship also features a lavish water park, a rappelling wall (a first for the industry) and an ice bar. After its inaugural trans-Atlantic cruise scheduled in July, the ship will be based in Miami and offer seven-night cruises to the Caribbean with summer fares from $889.
 A smaller but perhaps more stately christening is set for October, when the new Queen Elizabeth from Cunard makes its maiden voyage from Southampton to the Mediterranean. The 2,092-passenger ship features lush Art Deco-style interiors that pay homage to the original 1938 ship. The new QE also features a glass-vaulted lounge inspired by Kew Gardens and filled with potted palms, and a game deck with paddle tennis, croquet and British bowls. The inaugural cruise sold out in 29 minutes last April, but fares for subsequent cruises to the Mediterranean and the Caribbean start at $1,195 for five days. 
 Kiddie Cruises
 Cruise lines have long appealed to parents. Now, they are catering more aggressively to children. In April, Norwegian Cruise Line will introduce a children's program in partnership with Nickelodeon that includes live versions of the ''SlimeTime'' game show and breakfasts with SpongeBob SquarePants and other characters. The Nickelodeon tie-in will be offered on the Norwegian Jewel, on its weeklong cruises from New York City to the Bahamas, starting at $499. It will also be offered on the new Epic. 
 With all those kids onboard, keeping track of them can be a full-time job. To help, Royal Caribbean gives children ages 3 to 11 an electronic wristband onboard the Oasis of the Seas, so that the crew can find them. Parents can also keep an electronic eye on their children's whereabouts by renting an optional locator for $17.50. 
 But maybe what parents need are full-blown GPS devices. Child-friendly cruises are crossing the Atlantic to Europe. Disney's new cruises to the Baltics include stops at historic sites like Catherine Palace in St. Petersburg, where characters like Snow White and Cinderella will greet passengers. The Crystal Symphony will make two seven-day trips in Europe -- from London to Ireland and back, and Copenhagen to Stockholm -- with those 17 and under staying free. And Tauck is offering family-only cruises along the Danube between Budapest and Regensburg, Germany.
 Not everyone, of course, wants to be surrounded by screaming kids, especially parents seeking a vacation. Child-free zones, which were introduced over a decade ago, are expanding. The Carnival Dream reserves an 11,250-square-foot ''serenity'' area for grown-ups with sun beds, a bar and whirlpools. On the Oasis of the Seas, a two-deck adult section near the bow includes two whirlpools cantilevered over the side of the ship. And the coming Norwegian Epic has an adults-only beach club that offers bottle service in poolside cabanas, just like South Beach.
 Boutique Hotels at Sea
 The captain's quarters don't cut it anymore. Cruise liners are continuing to carve out luxury staterooms that feel like mini-boutique hotels with special perks for those willing to pay. 
 Royal Caribbean is taking the lead with the Oasis of the Seas and its forthcoming sister ship, Allure of the Seas. Instead of windowless staterooms, the interior cabins have been reworked to offer views of soaring atriums inside the ship. The Central Park balcony staterooms, for example, overlook a common area, a 12,000-plant garden and the 150 Central Park restaurant. 
 When it sails in July, the Norwegian Epic will banish the boxy room. Its New Wave cabins have curved walls and domed ceilings. The ship also features 100-square-foot podlike studios designed for solo passengers. A communal lounge encourages socializing. Prices are from $799 (single occupancy) for seven-day sailings.
 Private villas and suites that function like gated V.I.P. communities continue to proliferate. Norwegian's four Jewel-class ships have courtyard and garden villas that offer quiet pools, sundecks, fitness rooms and concierges that are available only to villa guests. Victoria Cruises, which specializes in Yangtze River cruises in China, has new suites that offer a private lounge and restaurant. And in May Windstar Cruises will introduce spa suites on the 312-passenger Wind Surf.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 14 about what's new in cruising in 2010 misstated the itinerary of the new Queen Elizabeth's maiden voyage this fall. The ship's maiden voyage, departing Oct. 12, sails from Southampton, England, to the Canary Islands in the Atlantic -- not to the Mediterranean. Its second voyage, departing Oct. 25, sails from Southampton through the Mediterranean to Naples, Italy. And a picture caption misidentified the river on which a Viking River Cruises vessel is shown sailing as it passes the Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, Germany. It is the Main, not the Danube.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Democrats To Campaign For House

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
Two prominent Rhode Island Democrats announced on Saturday that they would run for the Congressional seat held by Patrick J. Kennedy. 
 Mayor David N. Cicilline of Providence and Bill Lynch, the chairman of the State Democratic Party, declared their candidacies a day after Mr. Kennedy said he would not seek re-election. 
 Both candidates said that if elected they would focus on job creation, a crucial issue in a state with the nation's third-highest unemployment rate, 12.9 percent. 
 ''I have three priorities on the day I get to Washington: jobs, jobs, jobs. That's the issue in Rhode Island,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We were one of the first states to get into the recession, and most people seem to think we're going to be one of the last out of it. The No. 1 priority has to be the creation of jobs and turning the economy around.'' 
 Despite the federal bank bailouts, Mr. Cicilline said, small businesses in the state are having trouble obtaining loans and cities and towns are slashing their budgets. 
 ''We need someone fighting for small businesses,'' Mr. Cicilline said. ''The middle class is still suffering, and none of that relief came to cities and towns.'' 
 Mr. Lynch said more money needed to flow from Washington to Rhode Island. 
 ''People are constantly upset and angry at this point with Washington, and the inability to access any kind of meaningful funds from the government to Rhode Island,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''I don't think we've done a good job at that.'' 
 Mr. Cicilline, 48, a lawyer, was elected mayor of Providence in 2002 and promised to clean up corruption in City Hall months after former Mayor Vincent A. Cianci, Jr. was convicted of a racketeering conspiracy charge. 
 Mr. Cicilline, the city's first openly gay mayor, was re-elected in 2006, and said he had planned to seek another term this year. 
 Mr. Lynch, 52, also a lawyer, has been chairman of the State Democratic Party since 1998. A Pawtucket native, Mr. Lynch comes from a political family. His father served as mayor of Pawtucket from 1973 to 1981, and his brother, Patrick, is the state attorney general and a candidate for governor.
 A State Representative, John J. Loughlin II, a Republican, announced his candidacy for his party's nomination earlier this month.

HEADLINE: A War Over An Agency That Built A Honey Pot

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The foot of Manhattan Island has grown by 92 acres over the past four decades, the shoreline expanded with dirt from the excavation for the World Trade Center and tons of sand dredged from the harbor.
 Those sand piles have become one of the world's great honey pots: Battery Park City, home to nearly 12,000 people and the World Financial Center. It has churned out $1.8 billion for the city in the past 22 years, money that has been used to build affordable housing in the five boroughs.
 Now, war has broken out at, and around, the agency that built it all, the Battery Park City Authority. 
 The chairman abruptly stepped down on Tuesday. The vice chairman, who was one of the founders of the authority in 1968, says that it no longer needs to exist, and certainly not with a budget of nearly $30 million. But his term is up, and he will probably soon be replaced.
 The authority has $400 million in funds that normally would be available to the city. The governor wants half for the state budget. The mayor is negotiating. So is the city comptroller.
 Hovering above these cosmic matters is a yearlong investigation by the state inspector general into what, apparently, were many false accusations about executives at the authority, including a classic showstopper: that they rented a two-bedroom ''love nest'' at a cost of $50,000 a year. In fact, the apartment was a working model for green technologies, with all entries logged in a book and recorded by surveillance cameras in the hallways.
 Nevertheless, such investigations belong to a genre: There were questions about cronyism, a romantic relationship, the use of the authority's cars, business lunches and staff picnics where a hired clown was deployed using authority money.
 What did it all add up to?
 Well, the amount that the authority has spent on the law firms that it hired to represent the employees under investigation -- $500,000 -- is more than all the questionable expenses combined, according to Alexandra Altman, the agency's general counsel.
 A draft of a report by the office of Inspector General Joseph Fisch says the authority had a culture of entitlement that was not typical of government agencies, paying, for example, for too many lunches. The authority said it had been successful precisely because it operated like a private business, with New York City as its single shareholder.
 But officials conceded that certain expenses looked questionable in an economic downturn. James E. Cavanaugh, the president of the authority, said that he had cut the budget for meals, travel and community events to about $27,000 for this year, down from $61,000 in 2005.
 Some of the agency's responses to the draft question whether a final report is even worth publishing, given the ''flyspecking'' nature of the findings -- including details on money spent at the annual picnic for a cotton candy machine and a softball umpire.
 Mr. Fisch's office declined to comment on the report because it was not final.
 There are far bigger questions at stake.
 The 92 acres of landfill are almost completely built now, with commercial office space, apartment buildings and a few town houses. There are also 32 acres of parks, public schools and an esplanade.
 ''The job of building it out is finished, but we're still spending $30 million a year at the authority,'' said Charles J. Urstadt, the vice chairman and the board's original chief executive. ''You don't need the authority anymore.''
 Mr. Cavanaugh said the authority would be finished with its major construction projects within two years. ''Then we are built out, and that leaves people assessing what our future should be,'' he said. ''It's a legitimate question.'' He is studying how much would be saved if the city took over the operations, but said that residents were likely to be concerned that the facilities would not be maintained as well.
 Should the authority exist in perpetuity? ''Why not?'' asked Larry Schwartz, top aide to Gov. David A. Paterson. ''It has an excellent reputation.'' When the Legislature returns, Mr. Schwartz said, the governor will nominate four new board members; two have already been selected: William C. Thompson Jr., the former city comptroller and an unsuccessful Democratic mayoral candidate, and Fernando Mateo, a businessman.
 Mr. Urstadt, who first worked on Battery Park City during Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's administration and was appointed to the board by Gov. George E. Pataki, may end up being bounced by one of the new appointees.
 The city has the option to buy Battery Park City for $1, although this would require some complicated arrangements over existing bonds. Even so, Mr. Urstadt argues, the transaction could ultimately be worth as much as a billion dollars to the city.
 No, Mr. Cavanaugh said, probably not that much, but surely hundreds of millions. A spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the city would not be drawn into a discussion about the proposal's merits.
 ''I don't know why you would leave that much money on the table,'' Mr. Urstadt said.

HEADLINE: This Year, the Tax Code Is My Friend

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
TAX time has come around again, with its glorious blend of trepidation, tedium and loss. But there's no need to get all gloomy about it. Let's celebrate!
 There's just so much good news in the United States Tax Code, gosh darn it -- even if it might look like bad news at first.
 Consider this personal example: Like many Americans, I took a pay cut last year to help my employer through a tight spot. Good news: My taxes will come out a little lower this year. I'm glowing over it, frankly. 
 But that's not the only way taxes turn bad news into good. Let's say you've had a rotten year or so in the stock market, but you needed some quick cash -- say, one of your children needed surgery that wasn't covered by your health insurance. When that happened in my own family, I sold several hundred shares of my company's stock, which I'd bought at a little over $40 a share, for just $5 a share.
 That might sound pretty grim. But the tax code is helping to turn that frown upside down. It allows me to use $3,000 of capital losses to offset ordinary income, and the rest can help defray capital gains from profitable stock sales in the next few years. So those losses are a gift that keeps on giving. If I had any assets to sell at a profit, it would truly be great news.
 The most amazing example of bad news turning into good comes in the form of taxes' old partner: death. Normally, death is about the worst thing you can think of. But even the Reaper has an upside this year, thanks to the glories of the tax code. Under the provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, the estate tax disappears this year. Gone. Poof. Unless Congress extends the law, however, the estate tax will return on Jan. 1, 2011.
 That means the estate of anyone who dies after Dec. 31 this year will be subject to the old estate taxes. Now there's a law that puts the ''dead'' in deadline. 
 It turns out that there were death panels after all -- but instead of health care bureaucrats, they're made up of I.R.S. agents and tax advisers.
 Yet this is good news, too. If the worst happens this year, there's a golden lining for your heirs. And no matter what happens, it's going to be a year when people have a special reason to be very, very nice to their children. Family harmony is a good thing. 
 And while we're on the cheery topic of death, I'm just waiting for Osama bin Laden to start his own withering critique of the tax code. You might think it would be out of character, but in fact, Mr. bin Laden has lately emerged as a kind of self-styled economic guru. We all need to branch out, right?
 In a recently released speech, he spoke out against the United States' bank bailout and what he called excessive corporate influence in American politics. The banks, he said, did much to cause the global financial crisis, and ''when those perpetrators fall victims to the evil they have created, the heads of state rush to rescue them using public money.''
 In the speech, which was not immediately verified, Mr. bin Laden also expounded on the influence of the dollar as a global currency and even his concerns about global warming.
 Do you get the impression that he's running out of things to talk about? You can almost hear him muttering to himself about the drop-off in attention.
 ''What else have I got here?'' he might ask himself as aides look on nervously. ''Something to raise my positives. Kittens! The infidels hate kittens! Cute, fluffy kittens are despised by the infidel!''
 You'd be forgiven for thinking that Mr. bin Laden was trying to build a constituency in the United States. If so, wouldn't it seem that decrying the excesses of tax law would be a logical next step? 
 WELL, maybe. While we might think that everybody hates the tax code -- judging from all the noise at rallies and on cable news shows -- surveys show that most people aren't all that upset about what they're paying to Uncle Sam. 
 Last April, a Gallup Poll found that 61 percent of Americans called the amount that they pay in taxes ''fair.'' In a set of more specific questions, slightly more than half told the pollsters that their taxes were either ''about right'' or -- holy cow! -- ''too low.'' (O.K., let's be realistic: only 3 percent said their taxes were too low, while the ''about right'' group was 48 percent.) Of course, a sizable chunk -- 46 percent -- thought that their taxes were too high; Republicans were likelier than Democrats to be in that category. 
 Given all of this, perhaps Mr. bin Laden won't say anything momentous about taxes. Ultimately, such a path wouldn't be promising. The whole darned code is just jam-packed with niceness, and he, no matter how he portrays himself, is not.

HEADLINE: Oregon Historical Society Looks to Past for Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Ore. 

 BODY:
They say economic collapse is what froze this place in time, a gold rush relic all but abandoned when the railroad passed it by. Decades later, that chance preservation positioned Jacksonville to benefit from new interest in the past. Boutiques moved to quaint California Street. Californians soon moved to town.
 History sells, but now Jacksonville may learn that, the hard way. 
 The Southern Oregon Historical Society, which controls five of the most prominent historic properties in a town that is itself a historic district, has proposed selling some of the sites as a way to prevent the organization's own economic collapse. After changes in state and county tax policies left it without a clear revenue stream in the 1990s and several short-term measures since then have run their course, the society says it is essentially out of money. 
 Last September, the society shut down the Jacksonville Museum, housed in a former courthouse from the 1880s. It has also closed the rectory of a local Roman Catholic church, built in the 1860s, and Beekman Bank, which still houses scales used to weigh gold. The rectory and the bank, as well as the U.S. Hotel, built in the 1880s, are among the properties the society said it hoped to sell.
 Then came the backlash.
 ''That's like selling your grandmother,'' said Terri Gieg, a board member of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. ''And what I resent is we were not asked, as a town, 'What do you think?' ''
 Against the growing resistance, Allison Weiss, the executive director of the historical society, said the society has had to rethink some of its plans. But she expressed little patience for complaints about them. 
 ''What are people's priorities?'' Ms. Weiss said. ''They're carrying on that this would be a catastrophe, yet nobody's coming forward to fund these projects.''
 The historical society wants to use money from a sale to pay off debt and help manage its other assets, including an extensive collection of artifacts, photographs and documents from the broader region, from logging saws to Native American art, that are currently not on public display. 
 As painful as that idea sounds to some people here, many historic homes and structures elsewhere have been moving into private hands in recent years amid declining attendance and revenues for the nonprofit groups that often own them. Yet here in Jacksonville, the recession has added a wrinkle, and tension.
 The buildings are owned by surrounding Jackson County, not the historical society. The society once owned some of them, however, and has operated most of them for many years. It wants the county to sell the buildings or allow it to sublease them and share the proceeds, an idea the county is willing to consider, though how the proceeds would be split is unclear. 
 The historical society needs the county's cooperation, but it also resents that the county has not restored its funding. The county, which has made painful budget cuts in recent years, is not opposed to the revenue a sale would bring.
 ''I'm fairly certain we can come to some agreement,'' said Danny Jordan, the Jackson County administrator. 
 Ms. Weiss took a different tone.
 ''They've pushed us up against the wall, and they will benefit as a result of it,'' she said.
 Even without community opposition, there are questions about how saleable the properties are. The rectory and the bank are saddled with deed restrictions that limit how they can be used and altered. The U.S. Hotel, now partly occupied by a bank branch and believed to be worth around $2 million, may be the most likely to go; a Canadian involved with the region's wineries has expressed interest in a long-term lease to open a wine-tasting shop.
 Ms. Weiss, who joined the historical society last summer, said she did not view selling the properties as a betrayal of the society's mission. She said the society's priority should be its collection, not preserving buildings or staging historic re-enactments in them, as has sometimes been done. Besides, she said, there is no money to do so.
 ''I'm so not of that old school,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''What is the value of it if it's just sitting there and no one can go into it?''
 She noted that much of Jacksonville is protected as a national historic district, designated in 1966. The town, she said, will preserve its appeal.
 ''People visit it because it's thriving, because there's retail here,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''If the hotel gets sold and there's one more successful business operating on the street, I think that's a good thing.''
 Others also want to preserve commerce.
 ''It's been kind of static for a while,'' said David Jesser, who moved to the area about five years ago and opened a specialty food and wine shop across from the hotel. ''The fear of it changing is something I don't share.'' 
 Mr. Jesser has helped start a new business development group, separate from the Chamber of Commerce. There is also a newly formed Jacksonville Historical Society, which has expressed interest in subleasing some of the properties Ms. Weiss's group had intended to sell. 
 Historic buildings are not all that are shuttered here. Even though the recession has not hit Jacksonville as hard as it has other places, the town has plenty of empty storefronts and houses, especially in newer areas meticulously designed to resemble historic villages. 
 Walking a dog for a homeowner near the new Nunan Square neighborhood on a recent afternoon, Janet Engle nodded to shops that stood vacant. 
 ''Let's fill those up with businesses,'' Ms. Engle said, ''not the old historic buildings.''

HEADLINE: Explaining the Irrational: Here Goes ...

BYLINE: By DANIEL JONES. 
Daniel Jones is the editor of Modern Love.

 BODY:
LOVE it or dread it, here we are again: Valentine's Day. Why does such a holiday exist? One story is that back in the third century, a saint named Valentine, who faced execution for officiating illegal marriages, fell in love with his jailer's daughter. Somehow he wrote and delivered a card to her that he signed, ''From your Valentine.'' Then he was killed.
 Today, some 1,700 years later, love remains just as fraught, except perhaps for the threat of execution. And instead of scratching out our affections (in blood?) during our final hours in a dungeon, we splice our face onto the head of a break-dancing Cupid to create a video Rap-gram we can send via e-mail. 
 Will love always be this strange? You'd think by now we would have an iHeart app that takes our quivering insecurities and converts them into kilowatts that can be sold back to the power company. We don't. I've been sitting in this editor's chair for five years. Tens of thousands of strangers have told me their love stories in letters, essays, phone calls and dinner conversations. It's not a pretty picture. 
 Navigating this ocean of anxiety every day, I've at least become better at reading the currents -- what people are burned by, celebrating and stewing over. It boils down to a series of head-scratching questions about love that Americans are asking in 2010. As my Valentine's offering, I attempt some answers.
 Is it acceptable to dump someone via e-mail message, text message or tweet?
 Like it or not, e-mail and text-message breakups have become increasingly common and are therefore losing their stigma, if not their sting. I've actually yet to hear of anyone being dumped via Twitter (who would deserve such a public e-stoning?), though it's no doubt happening. In any case, if you decide to use these methods to lose your lover, let me suggest a few basic rules to minimize resentment, hurt feelings and continued entanglement. 
 1. Keep your electronic adios focused, grammatically correct and free of emoticons . 
 2. Avoid texting shorthand (''i h8 to 1/2 to tell u''). 
 3. If you use an iPhone for the digital ditching, be sure to disable the ''Sent from my iPhone'' tagline first to keep your ex from imagining that you wrote your kiss-off while hurriedly in transit, not even bothering to break stride as you raced off into your new life.
 What happens when you're in a no-strings-attached sexual relationship, and you start to fall in love?
 Maybe the better question is: How do you incorporate feelings into a relationship that is founded on a premise of no feelings? I have heard this lament too many times to count, from men and women. And few stories follow a more predictable script than the hookup in which one person suddenly wants more. As soon as he or she expresses a desire for anything beyond the routine, no matter how meekly phrased (''So, hungry for breakfast?'') or exhibits a slight change in body language, or a misinterpreted glance or smile, the equilibrium shifts irreparably, and the thing collapses. 
 Luckily, you needn't rage or cry as if you were at the end of a real relationship; you simply squash the love, along with the disappointment. The rationalization goes like this: I knew the rules going in, and it's not fair to change them midstream. It's not fair, in other words, to fall in love. So I won't. I'm not even sure I did.
 How can monogamy still be considered a viable long-term arrangement?
 Some people think we live too long to commit to one person for life. Monogamy may have made sense a few centuries ago, they argue, when we tended to die in our 40s (after raising a dozen children). But being with the same person well into our 70s and 80s? That simply can't be natural.
 This is a question, by the way, asked almost exclusively by people in their 40s (or younger). People in their 70s and 80s do not ask this question. They are, by and large, very happy to have shared a lifetime with the same person.
 O.K., but that's three decades before the appreciation kicks in. What if you want to feel appreciated now? And what if the person who makes you feel appreciated isn't your spouse?
 Here's a heartening trend -- husbands and wives choosing to talk honestly with each other about their needs, desires and temptations, even (or especially) when they threaten the marriage. In the stories crossing my desk, sneaking is increasingly being replaced by confiding. And the sky isn't falling and clothes aren't being thrown from windows. The conversations are hard, rage may have to be expressed, but many couples find a way through. 
 There's a difference, of course, between using the truth as a means of reconciliation and using it as a weapon. Honesty isn't always the high road, just as lying isn't always the low. Though there is one excuse in which you can have it both ways, taking the low road by claiming you literally have been taking the high: ''Dear, I was hiking the Appalachian Trail.''
 How has the Great Recession affected relationships?
 Divorce is costly even during the best of times, and now, for many, it's unaffordable. As a result, more warring couples are conserving their money, biding their time and doing whatever it takes to get along. Tolerance is the new intolerance.
 Except in the workplace, where divorce has been rampant. Divorce, that is, from your office spouse, that cubicle-and-conference-room pal with whom you've shared 95 percent of your daylight hours for the last few years, tag-teaming on research, gulping down takeout teriyaki, and giggling at YouTube clips of screeching felines being flung from ceiling fans. That closer-than-blood colleague who knows everything about your children and passions, who upon waking texts you bullet points for the board meeting and to whom you send status reports via BlackBerry before your head hits the pillow at night, the person you're more in touch and in sync with than the real husband or wife snoring next to you. 
 So when your office spouse suddenly vanishes, the break can be traumatic, with no couples' counseling to ease the transition. And unlike in a real divorce, there are no protracted negotiations -- over property, children or pets -- that allow your emotions to catch up to reality. Your relationship goes from all to nothing in one pink slip. Sure, you can meet for lunch or stay friends on Facebook, but there's no going back to what you had. It's just over. (Well, except for his or her unfinished work that gets dumped on your desk.)
 In gay marriages, are both men called ''husbands'' and both women ''wives''?
 Few use those terms, despite a lack of viable options. The default choice, ''partner,'' can be misleading (business partner?) and has no marital connotation. Spouse, like louse, sounds too drab. Mate -- likely to spur thoughts of the Navy, or Australia -- isn't even in the running. And exotic choices like ''lusband'' (lesbian husband) don't seem to be gaining much traction.
 Several months ago, Sara Sarasohn explained in this space how she and her, um, wife decided to use ''wife'' purely for political reasons. But years later, while chatting with a stranger, she was surprised to hear herself say ''my partner'' to deflect potential unease. And a married gay friend told me that when a medical receptionist asked him to clarify his relationship to the man listed as his emergency contact, he also said ''partner'' because he didn't want to invite possible disapproval with the bolder, if more accurate, ''husband.'' 
 All this talk of partners reminds me of a recent visit I made to a Tucson duderanch, which is where I reckon I came up with this idea: Why not tear a page from the wranglers' handbook and require all married folk to call each other partner? Think of the benefits. Not only would life start to sound like a permanent square dance, we'd also lose the language that distinguishes gay marriage from straight. And perhaps like Dr. Seuss's famous Star-Belly Sneetches, who finally learn that no one kind of Sneetch is the best on the beach, we'll see that marriage is marriage, meant for devotion that thrives, and not just for unions of straight husbands and wives.
 What is love, anyway?
 Ah, best for last. If I were Spock from ''Star Trek,'' I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability and bravery. Desire makes one feel vulnerable, which then requires one to be brave. 
 Since I'm not Spock, I will tell a story.
 Say you decide to adopt a baby girl in China. You receive her photo, put it on your refrigerator and gaze at it as the months pass, until finally you're halfway around the world, holding her in your arms, tears of joy streaming down your face. 
 But later in your hotel room, after undressing her, you discover worrisome physical signs, in particular a scar on her spine. You call the doctor, then head to the hospital for examinations and CT scans, where you are told the following: she suffered botched spinal surgery that caused nerve damage. Soon she will lose all bladder and bowel control. Oh, and she will be paralyzed for life. We're so sorry.
 But the adoption agency offers you a choice: keep this damaged baby, or trade her in for a healthier one. 
 You don't even know about the trials yet to come, about the alarming diagnoses she'll receive back home, the terrifying seizures you'll witness. Nor do you know about the happy ending that is years off, when she comes through it all and is perfectly fine. You have to decide now. This is your test. What do you do?
 If you're Elizabeth Fitzsimons, who told this story here one Mother's Day, you say: ''We don't want another baby. We want our baby, the one sleeping right over there. She's our daughter.''
 That's love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery. Or a lot.
 Happy Valentine's Day.

HEADLINE: Crib Notes on Canada, From a Canadian

BYLINE: By BRUCE HEADLAM

 BODY:
Welcome to Canada. Bienvenue a Canada! We want you to enjoy your stay here at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver but we also hope you'll take this opportunity to travel beyond the Olympic village. Canada, you know, is the second-largest country by area in the world -- almost a third larger than your United States. Fortunately, most of it is empty so you're not missing much. But what there is to see may surprise you.
 If you're like most Americans, Canada conjures up words like ''efficient,'' ''pleasant,'' ''boring,'' ''socialized medicine,'' ''Is Gordie Howe still playing?'' and, ''I've been to Minnesota. Isn't it the same only bigger?''
 But if you look closely, you'll discover what we call the other side of the cereal box (''l'autre cote de la boite de cereales''). Previous Olympic hosts try to cover up their gritty side, as the Chinese government did when it bulldozed slums in Beijing and cracked down on the local habit of spitting. 
 That's not how we roll here. You see, there are really two Canadas, just as there are two kinds of bears you might meet hiking in our great wilderness. If you come across a grizzly bear, you should lie down and pretend to be dead. But if you stumble across a black bear, you must run for your life. Or perhaps it's the other way around. The point is that there are two kinds of bears and either way you're in a lot of trouble.
 Outside the happy Olympic village, you'll find that other Canada -- a dark and edgy place. Just wander down to Vancouver's seedy Downtown Eastside neighborhood where you'll find homeless people, prostitutes and addicts ''jonesing'' for illegal drugs just as you would in any midsize American city. To help you find your way, there is even a government information center there with free pamphlets to answer all of your questions. So if you want to ''see where the action is'' or ''take a walk on the wild side,'' please go downtown and visit ''our government information center.''
 And that's really just the start. Since this is the first visit for many of you, we've prepared the following guide to fascinating Canadian facts (''faits fascinants sur le Canada''). We think you'll discover that Canada is not only a lot bigger than Minnesota, it's just as interesting.
 National Symbols
 Canada has two national symbols, the Maple Leaf, a symbol of nature and growth, and the Beaver, which represents industry and loyalty.
 According to Roman legend, the beaver, when cornered, will chew off its testicles and offer them up to the attacker. Modern biologists have dismissed this as myth. Beaver will only chew off their testicles if you ask nicely. But that's our point: you have to ask.
 National Anthem
 ''O Canada,'' although it is permissible to substitute ''God Save the Queen'' or ''Working for the Weekend'' by Loverboy.
 National Sport
 We know what you're thinking: hockey. Wrong! Our national sport is actually lacrosse, a rugged game taken from the Iroquois word meaning ''to kill time until the pond freezes over.'' As much as Canadians love hockey, the fastest game on ice, they enjoy curling, the slowest game on ice, even more. In fact, we've dominated Olympic curling except for in 2002, when the entire Canadian team tested positive for barley.
 Biggest Export (By Volume)
 Celine Dion, followed closely by oil.
 Motto
 ''From Sea to Sea.'' Also acceptable: ''You had your turn. Give the other guy a go.''
 Know Your Canadian History!
 Here are some dates to remember.
 1000: Leif Ericson becomes the first European to land in what is now Canada, then immediately gets in a dispute over the pronunciation of ''Newfoundland.'' 
 1600: Early settlers in what is then called New France are decimated by hunger and the harsh winter. The next year, more settlers arrive to replace them and they die of exposure and scurvy. The next wave arrives, prompting the local Iroquois to ask, ''just how bad is Old France?''
 1867: Almost a century after America declares its independence from Great Britain through the bloody crucible of revolution, Canada declares its sovereignty after filling out the necessary paperwork.
 1937: Famed Montreal Canadiens center Howie Morenz dies after a devastating on-ice collision but still finishes the game.
 1951: Famed Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bill Barilko disappears in northern Ontario on a fishing trip, leaving generations of Toronto players to say, ''Gee, I wish I'd thought of that.''
 1954: Hurricane Hazel sweeps northward through southern Ontario. More than 80 people die, mostly from excitement that something from New York came to Toronto.
 1976: Quebec elects its first separatist government, leading to several late-night drunken calls from English Canada saying it promises to change and French Canada eventually asking for its Leonard Cohen records back.
 1980: Margaret Trudeau, the wife of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is photographed cavorting in a Toronto hotel with a member of the Rolling Stones. A swell of national pride ensues until it is discovered that she was only with Ron Wood.
 1982: After scoring an astounding 92 goals in a single season, hockey star Wayne Gretzky is declared a wimp who never helps out in his own end.
 1988: Ben Johnson is stripped of his gold medal in the 100-meter sprint after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Humiliated, Johnson is reduced to running in a charity race against a horse and a stock car. He loses but the horse is later seen at a Gold's Gym with Mark McGwire.
 2009: After a devastating worldwide financial crisis, economists point to Canadian banks as a model of restraint and probity, completing neglecting to account for the hookers in east Vancouver.
 Just memorize these dates and soon your new Canadian friends will treat you like a native, greeting you with a hardy ''Way to go, guy,'' or, ''I'm sorry. You're standing on my foot,'' or ''Le docteur ne peut pas vous voir pour encore six mois'' (the doctor cannot see you for another six months). When you return to the United States, please tell all your friends about the great country of Canada. And don't forget the part about the hookers.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure, Insurer Delays Double-Digit Rate Increase for California Customers

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Under intense pressure from Washington and Sacramento, California's largest for-profit health insurer delayed a double-digit rate increase by two months on Saturday, but expressed confidence that its new premiums would pass state scrutiny. 
 The state insurance commissioner, Steve Poizner, requested the delay on Monday after an estimated 700,000 individual policy holders began receiving notices from the insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, of increases, some as high as 39 percent. The increases, originally scheduled to take effect March 1, were suspended until May 1. 
 Mr. Poizner said his department needed time to determine whether the increase would violate state regulations that require insurers to spend at least 70 percent of premiums on health claims, rather than on overhead and profit. Absent that, he said he had no authority to reduce Anthem's rates. 
 The Obama administration criticized the company relentlessly, arguing that the increases demonstrated the need for the health care overhaul now stalled in Congress. 
 ''While a two-month delay offers some temporary relief,'' said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, ''what California families need is long-term health insurance security. This rate increase underscores the urgency of passing real health insurance reform.''
 Mr. Poizner, a Republican candidate for governor, said in a conference call Saturday that he had hired outside actuaries to review Anthem's rate filing. If the company is found in violation of the 70 percent rule, he said he would withdraw its license to sell individual policies in California unless it reduced its rates.
 ''There are reasons to be suspicious that this rate increase might not be in compliance,'' Mr. Poizner said, noting that many of the increases would be double or triple the rate of medical inflation. ''I have a healthy skepticism about how you get to 39 percent.''
 Anthem's parent company, WellPoint Inc. of Indianapolis, asserted in a statement that its new rates would comply with the law. ''We welcome the regulatory review and are confident that our rates reflect anticipated medical costs,'' said Brian A. Sassi, president of WellPoint's consumer business unit. 
 The company has said the rates are justified because of escalating medical and pharmaceutical costs and because the recession is prompting healthy consumers to drop their coverage, leaving insurers with a smaller, sicker risk pool. Mr. Sassi said this week that Anthem lost money on the individual market in California last year. Mr. Poizner said he could not confirm that.
 Mr. Sassi said the average rate increase would be 25 percent, and that fewer than one in four customers would see increases of 35 percent to 39 percent.
 Mr. Poizner said he also was seeing ''pretty significant'' price increases on individual policies sold by other carriers, but he could not compare them to Anthem's.

HEADLINE: A Balance Between the Factory and the Local Farm

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
INDUSTRIAL food production is not very fashionable right now.
 Three books by Michael Pollan criticizing the system of giant corporate farms and food factories have topped the best-seller lists. A graphic documentary, ''Food, Inc.,'' based in part on his books, has been nominated for an Academy Award.
 In Washington, Michelle Obama grew vegetables on the White House lawn as an example of self-sufficiency. And across America, more farmers' markets and restaurants have popped up that sell vegetables and meat produced on small farms. 
 Diners now scan the menus at their local restaurants for provenances like ''Cattail Creek Ranch lamb'' or ''Hudson Valley rabbit.'' And home cooks now await boxes of fresh produce delivered weekly from local growers.
 Some of these so-called locavores may think they are part of a national movement that will replace corporate food factories with small family farms. But as much of the East Coast lies blanketed beneath a foot or more of snow, it's as good a time as any to raise a few questions about the trend's viability.
 First, how practical is local food sourcing in a nation that enjoys a diversity of food? From a practical standpoint, there isn't much that can be grown in winter in most parts of the country.
 ''You can dig parsnips out of the ground,'' said the chef Payton Curry, referring to his native state of Minnesota. ''It's 10 below there.'' Mr. Curry features locally sourced food at his Caffe Boa restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, Ariz.
 The problem isn't confined to the snow belt. Recently, I asked a neighbor who was bringing in her weekly box of locally grown produce what she got this time. ''Kale,'' she said. ''A lot of kale.'' And this is in Northern California.
 Then there are the inconsistencies in locavore behavior. People who eagerly order microgreens -- tenderly cut with scissors by a farmer that morning -- would be scandalized if a Chilean grape was served next to them.
 But their wine and water? Those tend to be shipped in from far-flung places. Rarely, for example, do you hear a New York restaurant bragging of its Long Island wine. Even at Chez Panisse, the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant where Alice Waters got the whole local-ingredients trend started, two out of three wines on a recent evening -- the wine list changes daily -- did not come from the acclaimed wine regions that begin only 25 miles away.
 A friend of Mr. Curry's, Pavle Milic, has gone to the extreme of serving only Arizona-made wines at FnB, his small restaurant in Scottsdale, Ariz. The concept may surprise some customers, but he says that some of the same people who sneer at a Pillsbury Casa Blanca Pinot Gris from Cochise County will declare in blind taste tests that they thought it came from a famous wine-growing region.
 ''I develop a thick skin here with what I do,'' he said. And he acknowledges that ''I risk losing a guest who doesn't want to drink an Arizona wine.''
 Granted, wine doesn't have to be fresh to be good. And freshness is the compelling reason driving the locavore movement. Unlike organic food, which can taste no different from food grown with chemicals, fresh food does taste better. 
 But what started as an effort to source fresher ingredients from nearby family farms is now as much about reducing the carbon footprint and the ''food miles'' of food. Ordering water from the South Pacific island of Fiji or wine from New Zealand when the local stuff is quaffable seems to run counter to those ideals.
 PEOPLE who grow vegetables in empty lots and schoolyards have a nice, wholesome hobby -- but one that can make little sense economically. A few years ago, William Alexander wrote a delightful book chronicling his gardening travails, ''The $64 Tomato.'' He revealed a truth about do-it-yourself gardening: It is more efficient to buy a fresh tomato in the farmer's market for $1.50 a pound.
 (In San Francisco, where I live, that means going to a market patronized largely by immigrants, not the foodie-dominated ones with inflated prices that put fresh food out of the reach of the poor. )
 As a sustainable trend, localism bears at least some resemblance to Mao Tse-tung's Great Leap Forward. In the late 1950s, Mao decreed that steel production be localized in backyard steel furnaces. Villagers began melting down pots and pans and creating their own steel, which amounted to low-quality and largely useless pig iron.
 It was a bad idea that dragged down the nation's productivity and played a role in widespread famine.
 Localism is difficult to scale up enough to feed a whole country in any season. But on the other extreme are the mammoth food factories in the United States. Here, frequent E. coli and salmonella bacteria outbreaks are the food industry's version of Toyota's sudden-acceleration and braking problems. It may be a case of a manufacturing system that has grown too fast or too large to be managed well.
 Somewhere, there is a happy medium.

HEADLINE: 1977 Vs. 1979

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Visiting Yemen and watching the small band of young reformers there struggle against the forces of separatism, Islamism, autocracy and terrorism, reminded me that the key forces shaping this region today were really set in motion between 1977 and 1979 -- and nothing much has changed since. Indeed, one could say Middle East politics today is a struggle between 1977 and 1979 -- and 1979 is still winning.
 How so? Following the defeat of Egypt and other Arab armies by Israel in the 1967 war, Nasserism, a k a Arab nationalism, the abiding ideology of the day, was demolished. In its wake came two broad alternatives: The first, manifested by President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in his 1977 trip to Israel, was a bid to cast the Arab world's future with the West, economic liberalization, modernization and acceptance of Israel. The weakness of ''Sadatism,'' though, was that it was an elite ideology with no cultural roots. The Egyptian state made peace with Israel, but Arab societies never followed. 
 The second Arab-Muslim response emerged in 1979. To start, there was the takeover that year of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists who challenged the religious credentials of the Saudi ruling family. The Saudi rulers responded by forging a new bargain with their Islamists: Let us stay in power and we will give you a free hand in setting social norms, relations between the sexes and religious education inside Saudi Arabia -- and abundant resources to spread Sunni Wahabi fundamentalism abroad. 
 The Saudi lurch backward coincided with Iran's revolution in 1979, which brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power. That revolution set up a competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia for who was the real leader of the Muslim world, and it triggered a surge in oil prices that gave both fundamentalist regimes the resources to export their brands of puritanical Islam, through mosques and schools, farther than ever.
 ''Islam lost its brakes in 1979,'' said Mamoun Fandy, a Middle East expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. And there was no moderate countertrend. 
 Finally, also in 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Arab and Muslim mujahedeen fighters flocked to the cause -- financed by Saudi Arabia at America's behest -- and in the process shifted Pakistan and Afghanistan in much more Islamist directions. Once these hard-core Muslim fighters, led by the likes of Osama bin Laden, defeated the Soviets, they turned their guns on America and its Arab allies.
 In a smart essay in The Wall Street Journal, titled ''The Radical Legacy of 1979,'' the retired U.S. diplomat Edward Djerejian, who led the political section of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in 1979, noted: ''Last year we celebrated the great historic achievements marked by the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent unification of Germany. But we should also remember that events in the broader Middle East of 30 years ago have left, in sharp contrast, a bitter and dangerous legacy.'' 
 In short, the Middle East we are dealing with today is the product of long-term trends dating back to 1979. And have no illusions, we propelled those trends. America looked the other way when Saudi Arabia Wahabi-fied itself. Ronald Reagan glorified the Afghan mujahedeen and the Europeans hailed the Khomeini revolution in Iran as a ''liberation'' event.
 I believe the only way the forces of 1979 can be rolled back would be with another equally big bang -- a new popular movement that is truly reformist, democratizing, open to the world, yet anchored in Muslim culture, not disconnected. Our best hopes are the fragile democratizing trends in Iraq, the tentative green revolution in Iran, plus the young reformers now coming of age in every Arab country. But it will not be easy.
 The young reformers today ''do not have a compelling story to tell,'' remarked Lahcen Haddad, a political scientist at Rabat University in Morocco. ''And they face a meta-narrative'' -- first developed by Nasser and later adopted by the Islamists -- ''that mobilizes millions and millions. That narrative says: 'The Arabs and Muslims are victims of an imperialist-Zionist conspiracy aided by reactionary regimes in the Arab world. It has as its goal keeping the Arabs and Muslims backward in order to exploit their oil riches and prevent them from becoming as strong as they used to be in the Middle Ages -- because that is dangerous for Israel and Western interests.' ''
 Today that meta-narrative is embraced across the Arab-Muslim political spectrum, from the secular left to the Islamic right. Deconstructing that story, and rebuilding a post-1979 alternative story based on responsibility, modernization, Islamic reformation and cross-cultural dialogue, is this generation's challenge. I think it can happen, but it will require the success of the democratizing self-government movements in Iran and Iraq. That would spawn a whole new story. 
 I know it's a long shot, but I'll continue to hope for it. I've been chewing a lot of qat lately, and it makes me dreamy.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Helped To Mask Debts Shaking Europe

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY, LANDON THOMAS Jr. and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Wall Street tactics akin to the ones that fostered subprime mortgages in America have worsened the financial crisis shaking Greece and undermining the euro by enabling European governments to hide their mounting debts. 
 As worries over Greece rattle world markets, records and interviews show that with Wall Street's help, the nation engaged in a decade-long effort to skirt European debt limits. One deal created by Goldman Sachs helped obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels. 
 Even as the crisis was nearing the flashpoint, banks were searching for ways to help Greece forestall the day of reckoning. In early November -- three months before Athens became the epicenter of global financial anxiety -- a team from Goldman Sachs arrived in the ancient city with a very modern proposition for a government struggling to pay its bills, according to two people who were briefed on the meeting.
 The bankers, led by Goldman's president, Gary D. Cohn, held out a financing instrument that would have pushed debt from Greece's health care system far into the future, much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards. 
 It had worked before. In 2001, just after Greece was admitted to Europe's monetary union, Goldman helped the government quietly borrow billions, people familiar with the transaction said. That deal, hidden from public view because it was treated as a currency trade rather than a loan, helped Athens to meet Europe's deficit rules while continuing to spend beyond its means.
 Athens did not pursue the latest Goldman proposal, but with Greece groaning under the weight of its debts and with its richer neighbors vowing to come to its aid, the deals over the last decade are raising questions about Wall Street's role in the world's latest financial drama.
 As in the American subprime crisis and the implosion of the American International Group, financial derivatives played a role in the run-up of Greek debt. Instruments developed by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and a wide range of other banks enabled politicians to mask additional borrowing in Greece, Italy and possibly elsewhere.
 In dozens of deals across the Continent, banks provided cash upfront in return for government payments in the future, with those liabilities then left off the books. Greece, for example, traded away the rights to airport fees and lottery proceeds in years to come. 
 Critics say that such deals, because they are not recorded as loans, mislead investors and regulators about the depth of a country's liabilities.
 Some of the Greek deals were named after figures in Greek mythology. One of them, for instance, was called Aeolos, after the god of the winds. 
 The crisis in Greece poses the most significant challenge yet to Europe's common currency, the euro, and the Continent's goal of economic unity. The country is, in the argot of banking, too big to be allowed to fail. Greece owes the world $300 billion, and major banks are on the hook for much of that debt. A default would reverberate around the globe. 
 A spokeswoman for the Greek finance ministry said the government had met with many banks in recent months and had not committed to any bank's offers. All debt financings ''are conducted in an effort of transparency,'' she said. Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.
 While Wall Street's handiwork in Europe has received little attention on this side of the Atlantic, it has been sharply criticized in Greece and in magazines like Der Spiegel in Germany. 
 ''Politicians want to pass the ball forward, and if a banker can show them a way to pass a problem to the future, they will fall for it,'' said Gikas A. Hardouvelis, an economist and former government official who helped write a recent report on Greece's accounting policies.
 Wall Street did not create Europe's debt problem. But bankers enabled Greece and others to borrow beyond their means, in deals that were perfectly legal. Few rules govern how nations can borrow the money they need for expenses like the military and health care. The market for sovereign debt -- the Wall Street term for loans to governments -- is as unfettered as it is vast. 
 ''If a government wants to cheat, it can cheat,'' said Garry Schinasi, a veteran of the International Monetary Fund's capital markets surveillance unit, which monitors vulnerability in global capital markets.
 Banks eagerly exploited what was, for them, a highly lucrative symbiosis with free-spending governments. While Greece did not take advantage of Goldman's proposal in November 2009, it had paid the bank about $300 million in fees for arranging the 2001 transaction, according to several bankers familiar with the deal. 
 Such derivatives, which are not openly documented or disclosed, add to the uncertainty over how deep the troubles go in Greece and which other governments might have used similar off-balance sheet accounting. 
 The tide of fear is now washing over other economically troubled countries on the periphery of Europe, making it more expensive for Italy, Spain and Portugal to borrow. 
 For all the benefits of uniting Europe with one currency, the birth of the euro came with an original sin: countries like Italy and Greece entered the monetary union with bigger deficits than the ones permitted under the treaty that created the currency. Rather than raise taxes or reduce spending, however, these governments artificially reduced their deficits with derivatives.
 Derivatives do not have to be sinister. The 2001 transaction involved a type of derivative known as a swap. One such instrument, called an interest-rate swap, can help companies and countries cope with swings in their borrowing costs by exchanging fixed-rate payments for floating-rate ones, or vice versa. Another kind, a currency swap, can minimize the impact of volatile foreign exchange rates. 
 But with the help of JPMorgan, Italy was able to do more than that. Despite persistently high deficits, a 1996 derivative helped bring Italy's budget into line by swapping currency with JPMorgan at a favorable exchange rate, effectively putting more money in the government's hands. In return, Italy committed to future payments that were not booked as liabilities.
 ''Derivatives are a very useful instrument,'' said Gustavo Piga, an economics professor who wrote a report for the Council on Foreign Relations on the Italian transaction. ''They just become bad if they're used to window-dress accounts.''
 In Greece, the financial wizardry went even further. In what amounted to a garage sale on a national scale, Greek officials essentially mortgaged the country's airports and highways to raise much-needed money. 
 Aeolos, a legal entity created in 2001, helped Greece reduce the debt on its balance sheet that year. As part of the deal, Greece got cash upfront in return for pledging future landing fees at the country's airports. A similar deal in 2000 called Ariadne devoured the revenue that the government collected from its national lottery. Greece, however, classified those transactions as sales, not loans, despite doubts by many critics.
 These kinds of deals have been controversial within government circles for years. As far back as 2000, European finance ministers fiercely debated whether derivative deals used for creative accounting should be disclosed. 
 The answer was no. But in 2002, accounting disclosure was required for many entities like Aeolos and Ariadne that did not appear on nations' balance sheets, prompting governments to restate such deals as loans rather than sales.
 Still, as recently as 2008, Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, reported that ''in anumber of instances, the observed securitization operations seem to have been purportedly designed to achieve a given accounting result, irrespective of the economic merit of the operation.''
 While such accounting gimmicks may be beneficial in the short run, over time they can prove disastrous. 
 George Alogoskoufis, who became Greece's finance minister in a political party shift after the Goldman deal, criticized the transaction in the Parliament in 2005. The deal, Mr. Alogoskoufis argued, would saddle the government with big payments to Goldman until 2019.
 Mr. Alogoskoufis, who stepped down a year ago, said in an e-mail message last week that Goldman later agreed to reconfigure the deal ''to restore its good will with the republic.'' He said the new design was better for Greece than the old one.
 In 2005, Goldman sold the interest rate swap to the National Bank of Greece, the country's largest bank, according to two people briefed on the transaction.
 In 2008, Goldman helped the bank put the swap into a legal entity called Titlos. But the bank retained the bonds that Titlos issued, according to Dealogic, a financial research firm, for use as collateral to borrow even more from the European Central Bank.
 Edward Manchester, a senior vice president at the Moody's credit rating agency, said the deal would ultimately be a money-loser for Greece because of its long-term payment obligations. 
 Referring to the Titlos swap with the government of Greece, he said: ''This swap is always going to be unprofitable for the Greek government.''

HEADLINE: Seizing Those Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
SEEKING to stimulate the nation's moribund economy, Congress offered Americans a variety of tax-based incentives to spend money and to help cope with daily living last year. Among them are new or expanded credits for home purchases, energy-efficient home improvements and college costs; the making-work-pay credit; and the right to enhance the standard deduction with additional deductions for real estate taxes and sales taxes on purchases of new vehicles. The breaks will please many taxpayers, and using tax software can ease the complications they may bring to preparing a return.
 To help taxpayers understand the changes and claim all the breaks to which they are entitled, Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times prepared a sample return for a hypothetical New York suburban couple. She used the TurboTax program, published by Intuit, in consultation with Bob Meighan, vice president of TurboTax.
 Software provided by TurboTax and other services requires little knowledge of either computers or tax law. Users may simply answer interview questions. The program then selects the best options for a particular return, fills out the forms and does the calculations. It can even download many W-2 and 1099 forms that report income. 
 Like many Americans, the couple in this return had a tough year, so the new tax breaks were especially welcome. An expanded version of the sample return and commentary are at nytimes.com/business.
 Filling Out the 1040
 Form 1040 is a summary of income, adjustments to income, deductions and credits. Most of the numbers are bottom-line figures transferred from worksheets or supplemental forms and schedules. Taxable income and the tax on it, along with any refund or payment due, are calculated on Page 2.
 The Internal Revenue Service encourages taxpayers to file electronically. But whether they do so or mail in paper forms, the preparation is the same. E-filing, which is included with TurboTax, saves collating papers and speeds refunds.
 The most time-consuming part of the process may be gathering all the papers related to your income and deductions. Don't guess at a number for a missing W-2 or 1099. Employers, banks, brokerage firms and others who made payments to you must send the I.R.S copies of the W-2 and 1099 forms they also send you, so I.R.S. computers can compare what the payers report with your return. Like most other married couples, the hypothetical couple in this example -- Samuel P. and Felicity Q. Taxpayer -- are filing jointly (Line 2).
 They claim four exemptions (Line 6) -- two for themselves and one each for their children, Cyril, 18, and Heidi, 14. The husband lost his job in late 2008 and opened his own business, hoping for lucrative consulting projects. By mid-2009, however, with income far below his previous six-figure salary, he joined the ranks of the underemployed, taking an evening maintenance job while continuing to seek engineering projects during the day.
 Their biggest source of income is Felicity's salary, $72,000, as reported on Box 1 of her W-2. That, along with Samuel's salary for part-year employment, comes to $96,000 (Line 7). Felicity had $3,000 withheld for a tax-deferred 401(k) retirement plan, which shows up on her W-2 form, but not on their tax return. As their finances worsened, she ceased the 401(k) contributions in midyear.
 Taxable interest income of $200 is reported on Line 8a and tax-exempt interest of $420 on Line 8b. Ordinary dividends of $50 on Line 9a include qualified dividends of $35 (Line 9b). Qualified dividends, which include most dividends from domestic stocks and stock-based mutual funds, are taxed like long-term capital gains at 15 percent for most taxpayers (although people in the 10 percent and 15 percent income-tax brackets do not have to pay taxes on qualified dividends or capital gains). These numbers come from the year-end tax statements on Form 1099-DIV issued by financial institutions.
 This couple did not have to file Schedule B, although people who have more than $1,500 of either interest or dividends must do so.
 Business income of $28,130 (Line 12) is what Samuel earned as a consulting engineer after office rent and other expenses. Capital losses of $2,961 (Line 13) come from Schedule D. That is a net figure of a short-term capital gain of $1,205 and a loss of $4,166 carried forward from 2008. (Their losses exceeded their gains by $7,166 in 2008, but only $3,000 can be taken against ordinary income in one year.) Samuel withdrew $10,000 from his I.R.A. (Line 15b), bringing total income to $131,419 (Line 22).
 Next come two adjustments, often called above-the-line deductions. On Line 27 is one-half of the self-employment tax that Samuel must pay for Social Security and Medicare. Employers must pay one-half of those taxes for their employees and can deduct their share, so self-employed people, who pay the entire tax, can deduct half. On Line 31a is $9,000 in alimony that Samuel paid to his first wife, whose Social Security number must be shown. Recipients must report alimony as income on Line 11. The couple's adjusted gross income is $120,431 (Line 37).
 After itemized deductions of $23,692 (Line 40a, from Schedule A) and four personal exemptions worth $14,600 (Line 42), the couple's taxable income is $82,139 (Line 43). The regular tax on that is $12,906 (Line 44).
 An enormous complication in the tax code is that taxpayers are required to calculate their regular tax, then calculate the alternative minimum tax, which denies personal exemptions and certain other tax breaks, notably the deduction for state and local taxes, and pay whichever is higher.
 Line 45 is blank on this return because TurboTax performed the dual calculations and found that the Taxpayers were not liable for the A.M.T.
 Next come several credits, which reduce taxes dollar for dollar. In contrast, deductions reduce taxes only at a taxpayer's marginal rate, which is 25 percent for this couple. The Taxpayers claim credits of $1,500 (Line 49) and $1,000 (Line 66), both from Schedule 8863 for Cyril's college costs; a child credit for Heidi of $450 (Line 51) and a residential energy credit of $1,500 (Line 52) from Schedule 5695. That is for a new energy-efficient boiler that they bought when their old one broke late last winter. To pay for it, Samuel withdrew $10,000 from his I.R.A., which resulted in a $1,000 penalty (Line 58) because he is under age 59.
 They also claim a making-work-pay credit of $800 (Line 63) from Schedule M, which is new for 2009 and is intended to help stimulate the economy by giving workers a tax break and therefore more money to spend.
 Self-employment tax of $3,975 (Line 56) comes from Schedule SE. After all the credits, the 10 percent I.R.A. penalty, and withholding from their salaries of $12,050 (Line 61) for federal taxes, they owe $581 (Line 75).
 Although many people look forward to a refund, it means that they have provided the government an interest-free loan through overwithholding. Owing a small amount, but not enough to incur an underpayment penalty, is what many tax professionals consider ideal.
 Schedule A: Itemized Deductions
 Medical expenses (Line 1) can be deducted only to the extent that unreimbursed outlays exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. The Taxpayers, who have health insurance from Felicity's job, do not qualify.
 The couple report state and local income taxes of $4,112 (Line 5) and real estate taxes of $12,100 (Line 6). They deduct mortgage interest of $5,800 (Line 10).
 They also deduct gifts to charity of $1,680 (Line 19). Those include $1,500 in cash (Line 16) and $180 (Line 17) for the thriftshop value of good used clothing donated to a church rummage sale. If audited, filers must be able to show written evidence, like bank records, for cash donations and proper receipts for gifts of $250 or more.
 Their itemized deductions total $23,692 (Line 29) and exceed the standard deduction of $11,400 for married couples filing jointly. Many people who take the standard deduction, however, will be able to file the new Schedule L and take additional deductions for property taxes and sales taxes on up to $49,500 of the purchase price of a new vehicle.
 Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business
 As an engineering consultant, Samuel must file Schedule C for a sole proprietorship.
 He reported gross income of $47,060 (Line 7) and expenses of $18,930 (Line 28). He has a deduction of $1,400 (Line 9) for driving his car 2,546 miles (Line 44 on page 2) for business purposes. A deduction of 55 cents a mile is allowed.
 The largest expense, detailed in Part II, was $7,200 for office rent (Line 20b). Because he bought and deducted computer equipment and office furniture in 2008 when he opened his office, he did not make any such purchases last year, and thus had no depreciation deduction (Line 13). People who do buy such equipment may deduct up to $250,000 under Section 179, rather than depreciating it over several years, provided that they have offsetting earnings.
 Returns containing Schedule C have above-average audit rates, and those who are audited need detailed records to substantiate deductions. Samuel reported net profit of $28,130 (Line 31).

HEADLINE: Don't Overlook the Rewards for Thinking Green

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
IT'S one thing to favor clean energy and to want to reduce your carbon footprint. It may be quite another to put together enough cash to buy energy-efficient products like hybrid cars or electricity-efficient refrigerators -- or to pay for an all-out home energy upgrade. 
 But help is at hand. Thanks to new and expanded tax credits included in the federal stimulus package, certain energy-saving purchases may be more affordable for some taxpayers. 
 In his State of the Union address last month, President Obama said that these incentives were meant to spur demand for energy-saving products, to help expand green industries, to create jobs and to keep the United States competitive. While perhaps appreciating these loftier goals, many taxpayers are also likely to find the potential reduction of their tax bill very appealing.
 Not only do these tax breaks offer bigger savings when compared with those of previous years, but some people can use them to offset the alternative minimum tax for 2009. Still, the 2010 rules for the A.M.T. are not yet clear, and it may still be hard to calculate when, or if, an energy-efficient purchase is paying for itself.
 Here is an overview of energy-saving tax credits for individuals:
 ALTERNATIVE MOTOR VEHICLE CREDIT This is sometimes called the hybrid tax credit. In some ways, it is the most straightforward -- and, for recent car buyers, it can be quite lucrative.
 If you bought a hybrid, fuel cell, alternative fuel or advanced lean-burn technology vehicle, you may qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. The credit applies to vehicles bought new, on or before Dec. 31, 2010; used vehicles don't qualify; some phase-outs apply. 
 To see if your car, S.U.V. or truck qualifies, ask the manufacturer or search for ''alternative motor vehicle credit'' on the I.R.S. Web site, irs.gov. You can peruse vehicles listed by year, make and model to see whether yours is included, and what the likely credit will be. 
 Starting this year, you also may be able to get a tax credit up to $7,500 for some electric plug-in vehicles -- those with a rechargeable, plug-in battery.
 Hybrids typically cost more than comparable cars with standard gasoline engines -- as much as 20 percent higher or more. There are online hybrid calculators to help you decide whether the money you save on fuel, plus the tax credit, makes the purchase worthwhile. 
 And don't forget the vehicle sales tax deduction. If you bought any new vehicle from Feb. 17 to Dec. 31, 2009, you also qualify for a deduction equal to any state or local sales tax you paid -- on any purchase of a new vehicle up to $49,500. 
 RESIDENTIAL UPGRADES Although the residential energy property credit expired at the end of 2007 it has been revived and extended through 2010. Under the original law, this credit was limited to 10 percent of home improvement costs, up to $500, generally speaking. 
 Now you can claim 30 percent of what you spend on qualified improvements, up to $1,500, for 2009 and 2010 combined. 
 This credit covers the cost of certain energy-saving heating and cooling systems, water heaters, or stoves that burn plant-based fuels (wood or pellet stoves, for example) -- and the installation of these items.
 The cost of energy-efficient windows, doors, insulation and certain roofs is also covered, but installation is not. 
 Which products qualify? As with hybrid cars, you need to look for the manufacturer's certification that the addition to your home qualifies as energy-efficient under the terms of the new law. In some cases, an Energy Star designation is all you need. 
 You would have to spend $5,000 over the two-year period to claim the full $1,500; you can't claim $1,500 a year, no matter how many energy-efficient home improvements you make.
 HOME ENERGY SYSTEMS Under a related tax credit called the ''residential energy efficient property credit,'' if you install an alternative energy source for your home -- like solar panels, wind turbines or geothermal pumps -- you can claim 30 percent of whatever you spend, with no limit on the cost or credit (including installation). This credit is good through 2016, in case you need to work up the nerve to tackle a full geothermal, solar conversion.
 And there's more good news: It's possible to claim one or both residential tax credits, whether or not you itemize your deductions using Schedule A. Eligible homeowners should file I.R.S. Form 5695 for either of these residential credits.
 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS At the moment, individual taxpayers who are subject to the alternative minimum tax for 2009 can apply the credits relating to energy-efficient vehicles and home improvements against the A.M.T. Although these tax credits will continue through 2010 or longer, it's unclear how they will apply under the A.M.T. rules for 2010, said Robert Marvin, a spokesman for the I.R.S.
 If you bought or are planning to buy energy-efficient appliances that don't qualify for the residential tax credits, you still may be able to get a state-level rebate, as part of the Energy Star appliance rebate program. All 50 states and five territories are participating in this Department of Energy program. Information is available at (888) 363-7289.

HEADLINE: Paying the Price For Survival Tactics

BYLINE: By CHARLES DELAFUENTE

 BODY:
FOR some people, the recession was only the first part of a one-two economic punch. Tax time delivers the second blow.
 That's because the I.R.S. treats many kinds of written-off debts, some distressed sales of homes and many emergency withdrawals from retirement accounts as taxable income. 
 The amount a lender forgives is sometimes called phantom income, because the taxpayer never sees it but still owes tax on it, said Michael R. Ford, a lawyer at Fellers, Snider, Blankenship, Bailey & Tippens, in Oklahoma City. Mr. Ford is also chairman of the professional services committee of the American Bar Association's section on taxation. 
 The taxable amount, he said, is the difference between what the lender would have received and what it will receive under a new agreement. Taxes are imposed even if only the interest rate, not the amount of principal, is reduced.
 That happens, for example,to consumers who renegotiate credit card debt, according to Lisa M. Zarlenga, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington. ''The card companies have been fairly flexible, so they have been willing to forgive'' some debt or cut interest rates in some cases, she said.
 A lender is supposed to issue a 1099-C form reporting forgiven debt, but that doesn't always happen if the principal is not reduced, Mr. Ford said. 
 Ms. Zarlenga, a vice chairwoman of the same bar association committee, said there were exceptions to the forgiven-debt rule. Some of them are big enough to drive an S.U.V. through -- if it hasn't been repossessed.
 Forgiven debt is not taxable income, she said, if it is discharged by bankruptcy, or if the debtor is insolvent when the debt is forgiven.Insolvent doesn't necessarily mean bankrupt: it just means broke. The I.R.S. defines it asa financial condition in which the ''liabilities exceed the fair market value of the assets.''
 Bailout measures aimed at helping homeowners generally won't prompt forgiven-debt tax on a principal home, because Congress exempted up to $2 million of such relief. But foreclosures, short sales and other loss-of-home scenarios could bring on capital gains tax, Ms. Zarlenga said.
 If a house worth significantly more than a mortgage is repossessed and sold by the lender, the owner gets the difference but has a taxable profit, which will cause a capital gain. But Mr. Ford noted that the first $500,000 on gains on a main home for couples ($250,000 for single taxpayers) may be covered by a tax exclusion. And nonrecourse mortgages, in which the lender can't touch any assets other than the property, generally don't cause such a gain. 
 Aside from homeowners, people who had to withdraw money prematurely from their retirement accounts because of a job loss or reduced work hours also face extra taxes. 
 Holders oftraditional I.R.A.'s and I.R.A. rollover accounts must pay 10 percent of any amount withdrawn before they reach 59 1/2 as a penalty, according to Michael H. Iacolucci, a financial planner in Ballston Spa, N.Y. That is on top of the regular tax on money taken out, which must be paid regardless of one's age.
 Holders of Roth I.R.A.'s face different rules. The holder's contributions -- but not the account earnings -- can be withdrawn without penalty after five years, according to Mr. Iacolucci. 
 Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k)s and403(b)s, face yet another set of rules. For them, withdrawals are penalty-free if the account holder left the employer that set up the plan after he or she turned 55. But money rolled over to an I.R.A. from a former employer's plan is subject to the 59 1/2-age rule, according to Mr. Iacolucci, an expert on the tax treatment of tax-deferred accounts. 
 ''There could be some relief for some people'' from penalties on early withdrawals, he explained, referring to an arcane plan known as substantially equal periodic payments. It is still available for withdrawals made last year.
 Under that plan, someone who is not yet 59 1/2 can avoid the 10 percent penalty by taking payments from an I.R.A .or a 401(k) account based on life expectancy. But Mr. Iacolucci cautioned that someone using such a plan must continue to take the minimum distributions for at least five years or until reaching 59 1/2 -- whichever comes sooner. That might make using the equal-payment plan unattractive for someone who made a one-time withdrawal to meet an emergency. 
 Such a plan need not be declared to the I.R.S. in advance, Mr. Iacolucci said, so someone who withdrew funds last year could do the calculation this year ''and possibly find a safe harbor.'' 
 DETERMINING the minimum withdrawals under such a plan used to be the province of accountants and other tax experts, and often still is, Mr. Iacolucci said, although tax software might be able to walk some taxpayers through the calculations. 
 Most 401(k) and 403(b) plans generally do not allow current employees to make withdrawals. But they often have loan provisions -- and another tax nightmare can occur if an employee with an outstanding loan loses his or her job. In that case, the loan must be repaid quickly. Otherwise, the balance is treated as a withdrawal. Then it is subject to tax and to the 10 percent penalty if the employee is under 55, unless an equal-payment plan is used.

HEADLINE: Green Cards for Green Cars

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
SOME entrepreneurs are counting on a lot of support from China for making hybrids in the United States. Why? Because supporting green technology can mean a green card for an entire family. 
 Under a federal program, people who invest at least $500,000 in a business that helps create jobs in a rural or high-unemployment area can move, along with their immediate family, to the United States. If the business works out, they can get green cards and permanent residency.
 Known as EB-5 visas, the program is part of the Immigration Act of 1990, an effort by Congress to encourage investment in the United States and provide more jobs.
 Court documents show that a car company, the Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Corporation, planned to build vehicles in Mississippi. But Charles Wang and Benjamin Yeung, two company executives, got in a squabble late in 2008 over control of the company, leading to a suit filed in Mississippi early in 2009.
 The suit was resolved out of court and resulted in two companies. Mr. Yeung has Hybrid Kinetic Motors in Alabama. Mr. Wang's company in Mississippi is called GreenTech Automotive.
 Charles Huang, vice chairman of Hybrid Kinetic Motors, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the automaker would start building vehicles in Alabama in 2013 and produce 300,000 a year, employing 5,000 people. 
 Mr. Huang said the project initially would cost about $1.5 billion and ''the principle source of funding'' would be the EB-5 visas. That would be the equivalent to about 3,000 visas over four years, he said. Investors are already lined up, waiting for the process to begin, which will happen as soon as the proper documents are available, he said.
 A key part of the EB-5 visa program is what's called a regional center. Regional centers were established by Congress as part of an effort to encourage the use of the EB-5 program. It allows government-approved regional centers, which are similar to clearing houses, to pool investments for large projects.
 The center handling EB-5 applications for Hybrid Kinetic Motors is the Alabama Center for Foreign Investment in Montgomery. Court records show that in 2009, 80 percent control of the center was bought by the Far East Golden Resources Group Limited. The chairman at the time was Mr. Yeung, who is also the chairman of Hybrid Kinetic Motors.
 Some are skeptical about the plan. In a column in the trade publication Automotive News, Charles Child, the news editor, called the Alabama proposal a ''pie in the sky'' project and described it as ''a visa factory.''
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Child said he stood by the column, but added: ''I hope I'm wrong. I hope H.K. designs good cars that support a thriving plant in Alabama.''

HEADLINE: Stiffening Political Backbones

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
SPINELESS and shortsighted.
 That's the complaint you hear around this time of year, every year, about politicians and their failure to confront the mushrooming federal deficit. Elected officials only care about what will get them through the next election, pundits say, not what is good for the country.
 But really, can you blame the politicians? 
 Like bankers, politicians respond to incentives. Our political system encourages fiscal myopia, and will continue to do so even after the recovery solidifies. So long as politicians see fiscal profligacy as a prerequisite for re-election, the argument goes, they will postpone the hard decisions about tax hikes and spending cuts, and continue to overfish the revenue pool. 
 So, rather than obsessing over Washington's rubbery backbones, perhaps we should find ways to align the interests of the country with those of the politicians who are guiding it. Put another way, how can we get politicians elected on a short-term basis to think about the long-term good of the country?
 The typical solution has been to form some sort of blue-ribbon fiscal-responsibility commission, as President Obama said he would do. Unfortunately, as about a dozen such commissions have demonstrated over the last few decades, this strategy almost never works.
 Sure, these panels sometimes propose smart policy solutions. But they are not good at building the political will to make members of Congress (and constituents) eat their vegetables. 
 Other nations have tried different ways to get their politicians to think longer term, with varied success.
 Some legislatures have tried tying themselves to the mast, Ulysses-style, by placing limits on their budgets. In recent years, Germany and Switzerland have adopted a ''debt brake,'' constitutionally enshrining how much these countries can spend and how much they must save, depending on economic conditions. The Maastricht Treaty also limited how much debt nations could have before joining the European Union. 
 But it's hard to develop an approach that is flexible enough to allow discretion, yet rigid enough to be effective. 
 In the United States, Congress has tried to impose similar rules upon itself -- Pay-Go, Gramm-Rudman and the Byrd Rule, to name a few -- that have been cleverly unraveled. And state governments that are constitutionally prohibited from running deficits have been just as creative with their accounting.
 On the other hand, some countries, like Sweden and Denmark, have ''fiscal policy councils,'' generally made up of prestigious economists. They provide independent forecasts and analysis, and occasionally try to shame politicians into doing unpopular things. Such councils have a mixed record, depending in part on the country's attitudes toward experts.
 An alternative might be to delegate fiscal policy -- that is, taxing and spending -- to a separate technocratic body, which can rely on legal authority rather than popularity.
 Just consider why the United States has handed over decisions on monetary policy to the economists at the Federal Reserve. Giving these technical decisions to an independent central bank should, in theory, depoliticize them. 
 The analogy only goes so far, though. There is relatively more agreement about monetary policy -- for example, acceptable levels of inflation -- than there is about fiscal policy. Plus, there are infinite combinations of spending cuts and tax increases that can add up to the exact same bottom line. Is it really democratic to hand over such questions, with all of their social and moral consequences, to people who haven't been elected?
 So perhaps the best fixes involve more directly changing the incentives for elected officials, rather than taking away their power.
 For example, United States representatives serve exceptionally short terms: a mere two years (though senators serve for six). They are constantly running for re-election, and never have enough time to prove that austerity can sometimes be good for the economy. Perhaps if they had longer terms, they might be more sensitive to the longer-term consequences of their actions. 
 In other countries with lengthier terms for all lawmakers, like Sweden, where they serve four years at a time, politicians have made gutsy, painful budget cuts that later helped turn the economy around. Those cuts then became credibility-boosters that helped incumbents win re-election. 
 Brazil has a more creative strategy for changing the incentive structure for politicians. There, under the Fiscal Crimes Law, politicians who overspend can be barred from running for re-election, and even thrown in jail. But this strategy has primarily been effective for mayors and governors, said Michigan State University's Carlos Pereira, because the national government generally acts as enforcer. Someone still needs to play bad cop at the federal level. 
 The most foolproof way to impose fiscal discipline may be to instill a sense of crisis. 
 Indeed, just about every developed country that has overhauled its political system to promote long-term fiscal thinking seems to have done so either because a crisis was imminent or one was fresh in their minds.
 Historically, fiscal crises have followed financial crises (yup, like the one we just had), so now is probably the time to start planning. But it has been difficult to spook Americans too much because it has been so blissfully long since we had a budget crisis; the last time the government technically defaulted on its debt was during the Great Depression. 
 Alas, we don't have a color-coded alert system to warn us about our fiscal condition. 
 We do, however, have credit rating agencies. Moody's recently warned that it might downgrade America's top-notch sovereign credit rating, which could alarm the markets and eventually make it harder for the government to borrow. Once upon a time it seemed we needed the government to save the financial markets; perhaps now it is the financial markets that will keep the government in line.

UNION ATLANTIC
 By Adam Haslett
 304 pp. Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $26
 When the first wave of novelists began to tackle the post-9/11 world, many critics marveled (and some jeered) that they'd done it so soon. In 2005, Jonathan Safran Foer's ''Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close'' and Ian McEwan's ''Saturday'' were in the vanguard. Since then, new works touching on our jittery times have appeared with increasing frequency. And yet, almost a decade after the cataclysm, it can still strike a reader as portentous or premature when the somber shadow of that day falls across the pages of contemporary fiction. So it's with surprise, even incredulity, that you grasp, as you read Adam Haslett's first novel, that this book, set chiefly in 2002, not only tucks 9/11 into its narrative in an uncowed, offhand way but, to an extent, leaves it behind. 
Instead, Haslett tracks a different calamity: the global economic crisis that accelerated after 2001, propelled by bad mortgages, bad financial instruments, bad regulations and bad faith. As Doug Fanning, the protagonist (in no way a hero) of ''Union Atlantic,'' curtly observes, recapping the trajectory that made him rich, the attacks on 9/11 ''only sped the trend.'' So much for the halcyon pre-9/11 mind-set. This novel's narrative history doubles as news analysis. 
 Fanning, a narcissistic bachelor, has taught himself to ride out adversity by refusing to be accountable for others. When, as a teenager in Massachusetts, he tired of his troubled mother's heavy drinking, he joined the Navy and dropped her cold. In 1988, on a warship in the Persian Gulf, he was among those responsible for a terrible military error, shooting down a plane with 290 civilians on board. Not only did he get away with it, he was awarded a combat ribbon. 
 Back in America, Fanning has prospered by helping to turn a sound regional commercial bank -- the Union Atlantic of the title -- into a rotten global financial-services conglomerate. He has floated hundreds of millions abroad, imperiling the investments of unwitting citizens but increasing his company's earnings, to the great satisfaction of his boss, Jeffrey Holland. ''The old compact'' has changed, Fanning tells Holland, and the public's ''old assurances'' that government, business and the news media will respect their interests have expired. What matters nowadays, he insists, is to ''focus on the bigger picture. . . . Influence. Power over information. Control.'' His advice to Holland is blunt: ''You take the advantage you can get.'' But if Henry Graves, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were to find out about Union Atlantic's shenanigans, would he expose them or hide them? And if he exposed them, would the bankers pay a personal price for their abuse of power and the public trust? 
 Recent headlines in the financial press could have come from the pages of Haslett's novel. In 2008, it has now been revealed, the New York Fed, then headed by Timothy Geithner, the current United States Treasury secretary, instructed the insurance giant A.I.G. to hide information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Like the Fed chairman in Haslett's novel, Geithner (whose defenders have said he knew nothing of such instructions, that they were relayed by underlings) has plausible deniability. Unlike Henry Graves, Geithner isn't fictional -- and neither is his situation. 
 The eerie overlap of Haslett's narrative with current events in the American economy gives ''Union Atlantic'' unusual impact. This timely novel demonstrates not only how the financial crisis happened but why -- by documenting the intersection of big, blunt historical forces with tiny, intricate, cumulatively powerful personal impulses. Businesses become too big to fail, Haslett suggests, because individuals fail one another, in a snowball effect.
 Haslett's first book, the 2002 story collection ''You Are Not a Stranger Here,'' was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Each story in that moody, introspective book explored a different way that tightly wound lives can come unspooled. Haslett wrote in a variety of detached, understated voices, each aching in its precise registry of the minute gradations of emotional pain. It's remarkable how successfully ''Union Atlantic'' -- so unlike the stories in structure and style, and so much broader in scope -- continues the nuance of Haslett's earlier characterizations. The actors in this extroverted drama are closeted (or not-so-closeted) introverts. The screen of their surface behavior hides their obsessions and hopes, as well as their shame -- just as the balance sheet of a shady debt bundle can appear spruce and clear while concealing a thicket of machinations. 
 As the novel begins, Fanning has had a hillside near his childhood home in Massachusetts cleared in order to erect a sterile McMansion. His eccentric next-door neighbor, a history teacher named Charlotte Graves who was forced out of the local high school for excessive moralizing, despises Fanning and his giant house, but he assumes he can ignore her. Yet he soon learns that Charlotte isn't so easy to sidestep. Idealist to the core, an articulate defender of the Constitution and civil rights, she's also a kook who believes that her two massive hounds share her disillusionment with modern ways. 
 One of the dogs channels the Puritan preacher Cotton Mather, the other is a canine reincarnation of Malcolm X. Charlotte has lengthy arguments with both animals about the decay of the social compact that Fanning considers defunct. Crazy? Maybe. She recalls a character from Haslett's ''You Are Not a Stranger Here,'' an institutionalized woman who converses with an opinionated ghost. But Charlotte is sharp enough to suspect that the town didn't have the legal right to sell the land where Fanning built his ''steroidal offense'' -- land that once belonged to her forefathers. She may be right, and she may be able to pursue her case. If she does, will she have the wits -- and the tenacity -- to defeat the forces of greed and selfishness arrayed against her?
 Charlotte still tutors the occasional high school student. One of these is a quiet senior, Nate Fuller, whose father killed himself the previous fall, after being unemployed for two years. Like the protagonist in Haslett's story ''The Beginnings of Grief,'' Nate has begun to feel sexual desire for men in the wake of his father's death. Curious about the new place near Charlotte's house, which he believes to be unoccupied, Nate breaks in. When Fanning, returning, finds him there, Nate feels a strong instant attraction. ''Terrified at the thought of what kind of person he was for wanting this,'' Nate can't resist the call of ''enacting the fantasy of self-forgetting'' with this macho egotist. Charlotte has attempted to awaken Nate's civic conscience, but after meeting Fanning the boy prefers to let it sleep, rationalizing that ''losing his father permitted him this moral lapse. As if, in some grand ledger, his loss had earned him a pass or two.''
 Many of the characters in ''Union Atlantic'' are more closely linked than is strictly probable. The high school kids Nate hangs out with include the son of Fanning's boss, while nutty Charlotte happens to be the sister of the New York Fed chief. And yet these overly convenient connections reflect a larger truth that obtains between Main Street and Wall Street: compact or no compact, the fates of both streets are entwined. In ''Union Atlantic,'' swiftly and confidently, Haslett unwinds the ball of yarn that is the global financial crisis to reveal its core: a knot of ineluctable yearnings and individual needs.

HEADLINE: So Fine, So Fickle, So Euro

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
In 1870, the French novelist Victor Hugo had a vision. Planting an oak tree in his yard, he predicted that by the time it matured, a ''United States of Europe'' would have sprung up, strengthened by a common currency that would one day make the Continent a force to be reckoned with.
 One hundred and forty years later, the dream, like Hugo's tree, is alive -- if a little twisted. 
 Around Europe, 27 nations now fly the flag of the European Union next to their own. Sixteen have ditched the drachmas, marks and other bills that symbolized their sovereignty to embrace a single currency, the euro, lending new power to their economic and trade bloc.
 All that is now being called into question, however, as European leaders struggle to prevent ruinous spending by Greece from spiraling into a wider crisis or even breaking up the euro union. How they handle this problem could either propel Europe to greater economic and political clout in the decades ahead, or downgrade it to a sideshow in a global economic theater directed by China and the United States.
 For the moment, things don't look comforting for the euro. As the troubles in Greece drove the currency ever lower against the dollar last week, Europe's politicians did what everyone has by now come to expect: they talked about a bailout for Greece, then talked some more about the need to take ''coordinated action.''
 Yet details of a rescue plan were put off to a future date. No mention was made of how they would prevent Portugal, Spain or other deficit-saddled economies from falling like dominoes. And questions about who would pay for any future blowups were answered with silence.
 ''Now is the time when Europe needs to speak as one voice,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''The crisis should lead to political unity, but it could just as easily lead to a divided Europe.''
 What explains this inertia? Even as the euro was being conceived, Germany, Europe's sturdiest economy, was fretting about Europe's tendency to freeze during a crisis. The German chancellor at the time, Helmut Kohl, and Otmar Issing, a German who was then the chief economist for the European Central Bank, feared that unless they set strict rules on euro membership, the new currency union could stumble.
 Germany and other wealthy northern European nations might one day even find themselves transferring taxpayer money to support their poorer kin in the south, among them Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Britain, one of Europe's wealthiest nations, saw the writing on the wall and never surrendered its pound.
 The seeds of the current debacle were planted early. In 2003, four years after the euro's birth, France touched off a firestorm by spending lavishly to tame a recession, declaring with a shrug that it had agreed only to ''the principle of Europe.'' Nations like Portugal, which made painful budget cuts to qualify for euro membership, asked why they should sacrifice if a heavyweight like France didn't. Greece and Italy echoed similar views.
 With more governments using the euro like a credit card, it was only a matter of time before investors questioned their ability repay debt. In January, when Greece tried to raise funds to pay down some of its 53 billion euro deficit, investors forced the government to pay an annual interest rate of more than 6 percent on bonds that will mature in five years.
 Now governments in Spain, Portugal and Italy are also facing demands for higher rates, and fears that they might have to quit the euro club are mounting. On Friday, the French bank Societe Generale became the latest to question whether a bailout of Greece simply postponed ''the inevitable breakup of the euro zone.''
 What this means for dreams of a more united Europe remains far from clear.
 When the dust settles, Europe will probably still be a union with separate national parliaments and fiscal policies, says Thomas Mayer, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank. But he says he foresees economic policies that will be more tightly coordinated between countries, with a mechanism to resolve crises like the one brought on by Greece today. If that happens, the number of stable countries adopting the euro would probably grow, cementing Europe's economic might as the decades pass.
 But if the politicians fail, Hugo's vision of a United States of Europe would become more clouded, and Europe's economic weight in the world would decline.
 Already, some of the small Baltic nations that had been clamoring to get into the euro club are having second thoughts. And if Britons were wary of adopting the euro before, they must surely be nursing a silent schadenfreude as they watch Germany and France scramble to clean up after Greece. Don't expect them to change their minds any time soon.

A FEW weeks ago, Tom Lelievre, 46, who owns a home renovation business in Westford, Mass., noticed that he'd ''chipped'' a back tooth and so he visited his dentist, Dr. Thomas Connelly.
 Dr. Connelly examined him and saw a sight all too common in the mouths of his middle-aged male patients during this Great Recession. ''His molar was smashed, and his front teeth flattened,'' Dr. Connelly recalled.
 ''Tom, you under a lot of stress?'' he asked.
 A lot of stress? Mr. Lelievre used to do the finish work on a dozen homes a year; in the last year he's done two. He used to employ three men; now he hires subs as needed. He used to have a waiting list of eight months of work. ''Now they call me a week before I'm scheduled to start, 'Sorry, I lost my job, I can't go forward.' And I'm thinking, What do I do for the next month?'' 
 ''I'm not sleeping well,'' Mr. Lelievre continued. ''I wake at 1:30 and think, How will we pay the bills and keep the kids warm?''
 In the market downturn, he and his wife lost much of the money that they'd saved for their three children's college educations. ''That thought keeps coming up,'' he said.
 And now his dentist was explaining that the stress was leading him to grind his teeth -- and that was just half of it. ''I'm grinding at night,'' Mr. Lelievre said, ''and clenching during the day.''
 Stress?
 Alan Beck, 63, who owns a New Jersey-based cosmetics company named Beauty Bridge, knows it well. ''Yes, lots of stress,'' he told Dr. Irwin Smigel of Manhattan.
 Until the recession, Mr. Beck's company had a staff of 33 and 100 independent contractors nationwide. Before that, he was the president of the United States subsidiary of Jean Patou, the perfume company. Now he works as a solo consultant.
 ''Last year was a disaster, just a disaster,'' he said. ''People wouldn't commit. Lots of talk, lots of proposals, and no one wants to sign on the dotted line.''
 Nine months ago, he started having toothaches but did not go to the dentist. ''I used to provide dental insurance for 33 people -- now I don't have it myself,'' he said.
 When it felt as if he needed a root canal, he visited Dr. Smigel. ''He said, 'Are you sleeping?' '' Mr. Beck recalled. 'I said, 'Not very well,' '' 'Headaches?' Yes. 'Does your mouth hurt?' Yes. 'Do you bite your tongue?' As a matter of fact, I do. He said, 'You don't need a root canal, you need a night guard -- you're grinding.' I had no clue. When I was under pressure before, my legs would tense up in the middle of the night. Never this.''
 For Dr. Smigel, the president of the American Society for Dental Aesthetics, it's the signature diagnosis of the Great Recession: middle-aged men grinding. He said that Mr. Beck's grinding is nothing compared with Alik Singer's. Mr. Singer, 63, has fashion and textile businesses in New York and Russia, and constantly flies back and forth, working to keep them afloat. ''Stress, yes,'' Mr. Singer said. ''It gets under the skin. You're losing what you have, you're losing your grip on things. You can't hold it together.''
 Dr. Smigel said that in 45 years of dentistry, he's never seen teeth as ground down as Mr. Singer's. ''I use it as a case study when I lecture at N.Y.U.,'' Dr. Smigel said. ''They're fascinated.''
 This is the longest recession in modern history, and when people say that they're worn down, their dentists say it's literally true. According to the American Dental Association, normally 10 to 15 percent of people grind, a condition known as bruxism. And while there are no studies about grinding and its relation to the recession, representatives of the major dental groups -- Dr. Matthew Messina, a Cleveland dentist who speaks on grinding for the dental association; Dr. Howard Glazer of Fort Lee, N.J., a past president of the Academy of General Dentistry; and Dr. Smigel, of the dental aesthetics society -- all have experienced a pronounced increase in stress-related grinding during this recession. And they hear similar reports from colleagues.
 In the annual survey of Dental Products Report, a trade journal, 57 percent of dentists in 2009 said that they were handing out educational materials on grinding, compared with 40 percent in 2008. Thais Carter, the editor in chief, said that ads for dental labs in her magazine have switched from crowns and bridges to night guards for grinders.
 ''In fact,'' Ms. Carter said, ''the last appointment with my dentist, I complained of headaches first thing in the morning.''
 She now wears a night guard. Asked if her grinding was recession related, she said: ''The publishing industry is extremely stressful. We've had layoffs.''
 Traditionally, grinding damage manifests in middle age, as teeth weaken over time, and those who seek treatment are predominantly women. Researchers don't know if this is due to differences in estrogen levels (studies are inconclusive) or if, as Dr. Smigel believes, women are simply more concerned about the appearance of their teeth.
 But most striking has been the recent increase of grinding among men. Dr. Messina, the dental association representative, has seen a 25 percent jump in the number of male patients he's treated for grinding in the last year. Dr. Smigel said that, while female grinders still predominate in his practice, their male counterparts have doubled to 40 percent of his caseload.
 Dr. Connelly, who has an upscale clientele in Manhattan and a middle-class one in Manchester, N.H., can trace the growth in male cases by the number of night guards he makes. In 2007, he made 53 guards for patients in his two offices, 41 of them for women. In 2008, he made 51 guards, 43 for women. And in 2009, he made 84 guards, 49 of them for women and 35 for men.
 The front-line dentists' best guess for explaining the increase among men: we're in the midst of a recession that's hitting men harder. In January, 9.5 percent of men over age 45 were unemployed, compared with 6.5 percent of women the same age.
 The pressure people put on themselves even while asleep is painful. Normal chewing places 68 pounds of pressure per square inch on the back teeth; intentionally clenching your teeth places 150 pounds of pressure; grinding unconsciously at night places up to 900 pounds of pressure. ''In one night, you put more pressure on your teeth than an entire month of normal wear,'' Dr. Connelly said.
 Remediation costs vary widely. Mr. Beck, the New Jersey cosmetics consultant, spent $1,200 for a night guard and minor work on his teeth. A patient who needs a rebuilt mouth of 28 crowns could face a $100,000 bill, Dr. Connelly said. Little of that, if any, would be covered by insurance. 
 Brian Benko, 46, the chief executive of Back Bay Ventures, a Web-domain business, connects his teeth problems (''grinding with an uneven bite -- a bad combo'') directly to the business cycle: ''Worst after the Lehman Brothers collapse and better after the economy began to stabilize'' in the third quarter of 2009.
 His business shrank from 26 employees to 8. ''Very few things compare to the stress of laying people off,'' he said. He kept wondering if the dream were over. ''The dream of hitting a home run, taking the company public, selling to a large company and cashing out, those dreams that make life rich. Would that come back -- it's the fear of the unknown.''
 Dr. Connelly made Mr. Benko a night guard and fitted him for braces to even his bite. By last summer, Mr. Benko's spirits had begun to lift. ''I had this feeling of getting over it, that things would get better,'' he said. ''I was ready to climb back on the horse.''
 He stopped wearing his night guard. ''Less stress,'' he said. ''I stopped grinding.''
 Mr. Lelievre, the Massachusetts home renovator, asked his wife if she'd noticed the grinding at night. ''She said: 'Yeah, pretty bad. And clenching.' '' Dr. Connelly fitted him with a night guard, but Mr. Lelievre has put off more corrective work until the economy improves. ''My wife bought me gum -- so I don't clench, I chew all day,'' he said. ''I can't afford to clench my teeth.''

HEADLINE: My Home, a Mortal Peril? What the Childproofers See

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
First she balances; then comes a huge grin. After that it's one foot, a wobble, another foot, some momentum, and then she's off to the races. With all the pleasures of seeing my 13-month-old daughter learn to walk came one disappointing realization: it might be time to think about childproofing.
 The obsession with childproofing had always seemed a bit ridiculous, another modern parenting anxiety that cropped up once people stopped having to worry about diphtheria or the draft. Keep your knives out of reach, keep an eye on the kid. How much specialized knowledge does it really take? But things start to look different when you see her lurching away from you, arms stretched toward a hot stove. 
 Bookstores and Web sites offer a plethora of low-cost or free advice. But in New York, of course, there are always consultants willing to charge you a lot of money for something you could probably do yourself. So I decided to see what the experts had to offer.
 Jennifer Ward is an interior designer who specializes in child-friendly spaces. Her blog, called Minor Details, feels like a window onto a world where everything is bright and colorful and inviting. After a few minutes surfing around, I was desperate to move in.
 Her initial consultation was $300. That's a lot for a 45-to-60-minute visit, and supplies and installation are extra. But I was secretly hoping that while she was in my apartment she'd tell me how to rearrange my furniture or what to do about the rug I keep upside down, too ugly to show its face. Maybe by the time she left I'd be living in a space-age fun zone like the ones on her Web site, sipping a kooky cocktail while my daughter bounced around an ultramodern play set.
 I think of my apartment as a basically safe place -- no open fire pits or mid-century modern hypodermic needles. But looking through Ms. Ward's eyes, I immediately saw an obstacle course of mortal peril. An uninsulated steam pipe, a dangling wire, a humongous cactus leaning ominously off a windowsill.
 And that was before we got into the baby's room, a small jungle of hand-me-down bundles and outgrown car seats. Next to the crib teeters a wobbly stack of boxes. I asked Ms. Ward how bad it looked. She said it was about average, which had the distinct ring of grade inflation.
 She suggested some of the obvious fixes (cabinet latches, electrical outlet plugs) and a few extra-credit options, like built-in railings for my flower pots. But I had to decide: Did I want to rule out every conceivable risk? Or just cover the obvious hazards? The memo she e-mailed the next day, with annotated photographs, proposed $150 to $200 in supplies and about $90 of labor. As for the upside-down rug, she said she liked it.
 My next visitor, Sebastien Amy, worked at Lehman Brothers until it collapsed. So when it came time to babyproof his home, well, he had some room in his schedule. From trial and disappointing error, he found his way to the International Association for Child Safety, and started his own company, A+ Childproofing.
 A boyish presence with a French accent, Mr. Amy -- whose initial consultation was free, and whose eventual estimate came to $761.86 -- went from room to room suggesting simple, practical solutions. He didn't even blink when he saw the listing cactus. But he opened the drawers of the dresser that doubles as a changing table and tipped it over with barely a nudge. ''I don't try to scare people,'' he said, ''but this is one piece of furniture I tell people is a baby killer.''
 Then there was the balcony. My apartment, which is in downtown Manhattan, has one of those little balconies that is not much wider than a chair, which, Ms. Ward warned me, a child could use to climb up and over the railing. She said a higher railing was a must.
 Mr. Amy also thought the balcony needed attention -- but his fear was that a child might slide right through the railing. Both of these professionals saw a disaster waiting to happen, but not the same disaster. A third person might find a different hazard still (and dismiss the first two as equally irrelevant). So where does it end? No one can guard against every danger. In miniature, that's the agony of parenting: They are their own little people, not objects you can lock up in a drawer. But that's also the fun of it, of course.
 Thom Golden, the founder of the child safety association, made an interesting case for his profession. ''If the parent is watching so intently that the child can't do anything on their own free will,'' he said, ''then the child doesn't learn how to do anything on their own, how to develop confidence in their own decisions.'' Rather than a way to control your child, these safety devices are a way to let him or her be, he said.
 A nice thought. But when you hire a professional childproofer, it's not the outlet protectors you're shelling out for. You are, in effect, paying that person to do your worrying for you. A childproofed home isn't 100 percent safe, and an unproofed home isn't a deathtrap. But with an expert's imprimatur, nervous parents buy themselves the right to relax a bit.
 I decided to take about half the suggestions my two experts offered. Safer electrical outlets? Absolutely. And I'll dismantle that tower of doom in my daughter's room. But I haven't figured out how to pick up that huge cactus.

HEADLINE: Making Yourself Indispensable

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. Your company went through layoffs and you survived, but you want to do more than just hold on. How can you make yourself more valuable to your company and improve your chances of a future promotion?
 A. You can enhance your odds of promotion by suggesting ways to solve problems, taking the initiative on projects, sharpening your skills and showing a willingness to help others. 
 Find ways that the company can earn more money and spend less, said Larry Myler, chief executive of the consulting firm More or Less Inc. in Provo, Utah. When you see ways to cut costs or streamline processes, develop a plan and write a proposal, Mr. Myler said. 
 Presenting that to your manager ''shows you're taking initiative, which makes you more valuable,'' he said. ''You will be seen as a person who is mindful of the company's bottom line and who has the ability to do something about it. That's huge.'' 
 Even if you're not directly involved with revenue generation or budgeting, you might interact with customers or other departments and have cost-saving ideas in those areas.
 ''Let's say you have been watching the shipping process and you see there are more steps than needed,'' Mr. Myler said. ''You propose cutting a few steps to save a specific amount of money and get the product to customers faster.''
 Q.You want to carve out a niche for yourself in the company, one that sets you apart as an expert in a specific area. How do you manage to do that while handling your usual job responsibilities? 
 A. To create that niche, focus on what you already know, rather than picking a new area and then trying to learn all about it, said Vaughan Evans, a career strategist in London. 
 ''Let's say you are very proficient with numbers, quantitative work and with using the Excel program,'' Mr. Evans said. ''Why not become a master at Excel so that within the organization, you are the go-to person for that program?'' 
 Building on your strengths -- and letting your weaknesses go -- will enable you to carve out a niche. Keep in mind that your area of expertise needs to be important to the organization, Mr. Evans said. 
 Q. Should you ask your manager whether the company would be willing to pay for additional training? 
 A. Some career experts say that during a recession, employees should be cautious about asking their companies to cover costs for training, conferences or additional education.
 Mr. Myler suggested that if you do ask, be frugal about it. ''Asking your company to cover the cost of attendance at a pricey conference probably won't go over well,'' he said. ''Instead, ask if they will pay for the conference notes -- usually a nominal cost -- and do self-study instead.'' 
 Ingrid Stabb, co-author of ''The Career Within You,'' suggested checking with human resources to see whether tuition reimbursement is among your benefits. That money can be used to pay for a variety of courses that further your expertise in a particular area, she said.
 For instance, advanced training in finance, social media marketing or obtaining certification for a specific software program may all qualify for tuition reimbursement. If the company won't pay, you might want to consider footing the bill yourself for evening or weekend classes or for online courses.
 Q.Although you don't want to be obnoxious about it, you do want management to be aware of all you are doing to enhance your skills and expertise. What's the best way to handle that?
 A. Show your strengths in a way that benefits your boss and everyone in your department. Ms. Stabb said: ''If your strength is organizing data, for example, and you know there is all this data your boss has but hasn't organized, create a spreadsheet or table that makes it easier for the department to access the information, and then offer to lead a brown-bag lunch presentation to explain how to read it. People will remember that back in Q1, Jane Smith started this initiative in the department.'' 
 Being helpful toward and protective of others is another way to showcase your knowledge -- and integrity -- in a nonthreatening way. This applies to both colleagues and managers.
 When you have information that could be useful to others, share it, said Sandra Naiman, owner of the executive coaching firm SMN Partners in Denver and author of ''High Achiever's Secret Codebook: The Unwritten Rules for Success at Work.'' This could include articles in trade journals, information on the company's intranet and relevant online sources.
 When others go out of their way to help you in a similar manner, always give them credit by sending an e-mail message to their boss to describe the help, she said. 
 ''The bottom line is you want to be known and relied upon by as many people in the organization as possible,'' Ms. Naiman said. ''The more people who depend upon you for their success, the more valuable you become.''

HEADLINE: Some Clues for Finding New Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
OPPORTUNITIES to save money on 2009 taxes abound, thanks to incentives enacted by Congress last year. What's more, taxpayers can still act to claim one of the biggest prizes: a credit of up to $8,000 for buying a home.
 That credit is available to what the law calls ''first-time home buyers'' and defines as those who have not owned a primary residence in the three years before the purchase. 
 In addition, for the period of Nov. 7, 2009, through April 30 of this year, the law provides what is called a longtime resident credit of up to $6,500. It is for people who buy a primary residence that costs no more than $800,000, provided that they have owned a home and used it as their primary residence for at least five consecutive years of the eight previous years. 
 Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and a certified public accountant, said the tax credits, coming at a time of reduced home values and low mortgage rates, offered ''a wonderful opportunity'' to those considering buying a new home. The longtime resident credit would even benefit people who are trading down to a smaller home, as an older couple might be. 
 Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., pointed out that the new home need not be a traditional house or apartment; a motor home or a houseboat can also qualify if it is a primary residence. 
 If the purchase is made this year, taxpayers may claim the credit on either their 2009 or 2010 tax returns. Those who have entered into a binding contract by April 30 have until June 30 to settle on the purchase. 
 Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a tax information service for professionals, said the purchase had to be settled in order for the credit to be claimed. That means people who were in the process of buying but wanted to claim a 2009 credit to improve their cash flow could file for an automatic extension to file until Oct. 15 on Form 4868. The credit itself is claimed on Form 5405. 
 The law also raises the income limits for those eligible to claim the credit. Single filers with modified adjusted gross income of $125,000, phasing out at $145,000, are now eligible, as are joint filers within a range of $225,000 to $245,000. The income limits are lower for homes bought before Nov. 7, 2009. 
 The new law also requires that substantiating documents be submitted with a taxpayer's return, meaning that it must be filed by paper, not electronically. 
 Mr. Block, who formerly worked in the I.R.S. criminal investigation division, said that home purchases were far from the only reason for filing a paper return. If a taxpayer has an unusually large charitable contribution or medical deduction, for example, or another matter that needs explaining, then attaching a statement and perhaps a copy of relevant documents to the return might avert questions or an audit, he said.
 Not in the market for a new home? You may still be able to claim other tax breaks, as diverse as those for college costs, energy-efficient home improvements, the new making-work-pay credit and child credits. 
 Parents of college students who have been ineligible for education credits in past years will find that the new American Opportunity Credit is far more generous this year, Mr. Luscombe said, both because of higher income limits and the fact it is available for four years of undergraduate study. 
 Preparation and Patience
 In the quest for breaks, tax advisers urge patience in navigating the process. 
 Bill Fleming, a managing director in the Hartford office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said, ''Don't be fidgeting when the accountant is asking you lots of questions,'' or, if you use software, do not skip the program's interview. 
 Your answers are needed to learn which of the new incentives you can take, he added. Taxpayers cannot just look at last year's return and collect the same papers or simply fill out the same forms. 
 Because of the documentation required for the credits Mr. Fleming advised taxpayers to start early on the paper chase. In many cases people have mislaid or tossed out receipts, he noted, and will need to get duplicates. 
 Standard, and Then Some
 More than 60 percent of taxpayers claim the standard deduction, rather than itemizing deductions, but they should ''recognize that there is nothing standard about the standard deduction,'' said Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., who is a member of the J. K. Lasser Institute Team of Editors and Writers.
 The deduction is $11,400 for married couples filing jointly and qualifying widows and widowers, $5,700 for single filers and married individuals filing separately and $8,350 for heads of household. But for 2009 there are several possible add-ons: state and local real estate taxes of up to $500, or $1,000 if filing a joint return; a net loss reported on Form 4684 resulting from a federally declared disaster; and state or local sales or excise taxes on the purchase price, up to $49,500, of qualifying motor vehicles.
 Those claiming add-ons to the standard deduction must file Schedule L. 
 For Non-Millionaires, Too
 State income taxes are another matter. In some states, especially on the East and West Coasts, what used to be called ''the millionaires' tax'' -- that is, the top bracket -- is now affecting people with incomes of a quarter or half of that, said Jamie C. Yesnowitz, a senior manager and state tax specialist in the Washington office of Grant Thornton. 
 ''California and New York are getting aggressive'' in their collection efforts, he said, as officials seek to balance state budgets. The top rate is now 10.55 percent in California, 11 percent in Oregon and Hawaii, 10.75 percent in New Jersey, 9.9 percent in Rhode Island and 9.4 percent in Vermont. New York's top rate is 8.97 percent on incomes over $500,000, but Mr. Yesnowitz pointed out that New York City residents must also pay city income taxes with a top rate of 3.2 percent. 
 What can taxpayers do about these high rates? ''Not much but change your residence,'' he said, which may not be practical.
 Still Time for an I.R.A.
 One thing that taxpayers can still do to lower 2009 taxes, said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, is to contribute to a deductible I.R.A., if eligible, by April 15 or to a Simplified Employee Pension, known as a SEP-IRA. 
 Contributions to I.R.A.'s are capped at $5,000, or $6,000 if age 50 or older. But those eligible for a SEP, which is a retirement plan for self-employed people and small-business owners, may put in up to 25 percent of their earnings, with a $49,000 cap for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.
 Detailed rules for both, including eligibility, are explained in I.R.S. Publications 560 and 590. 
 Tax Preparation Fees
 Mr. Block pointed out that many people who pay to have their returns prepared cannot deduct the fee because it is a miscellaneous itemized deduction, and such deductions can be taken only to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. 
 If a return, however, includes Schedule C for a sole proprietorship, E for rental or royalty income or F for farm income, a preparer might spend as much as 60 percent of his or her time on that one schedule, and the relevant portion of the fee can be deducted directly on it.
 Other Considerations
 Here are more points that could affect 2009 returns:
 People who donated cash to a charity for Haitian earthquake relief after Jan. 11 of this year and before March 1, including contributions made by text message, check, credit card or debit card, may claim an itemized deduction on either their 2009 or 2010 returns. Donations made after that will be deductible only for 2010. 
 People who lost their jobs and collected unemployment compensation last year may exclude up to $2,400 of unemployment payments from taxable income.
 People who took advantage of the government's cash-for-clunkers program, getting a $3,500 or $4,500 voucher toward the purchase of a new car when they traded in a gas guzzler, are not liable for taxes on the voucher. Rather, it is taxable income to the dealer that sold the car.
 The I.R.S. says one taxpayer in six qualifies for the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program for low- and moderate-income wage earners, and the benefits have been expanded for 2009. The new income thresholds are $48,279 for families with three or more qualifying children, $45,295 for those with two or more children, $40,463 for people with one child and $18,440 for those with no children. The credit is refundable, meaning that people can claim it even if they owe no tax and none was withheld from their paychecks. But they must file a return to claim it. 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Should Tax Bills Be Public Information?

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK. 
Anna Bernasek is the author of ''The Economics of Integrity,'' HarperStudio (2010, $19.99).

 BODY:
MANY people are phobic about letting others see their tax information. Perhaps they shouldn't be.
 If Americans all knew one another's tax bill, they might be motivated to fill out their taxes correctly. ''Disclosure could be an automatic enforcement device,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University. 
 And if the big inequalities in the tax system were brought to light -- if you knew, for example, that a very wealthy neighbor paid no taxes at all -- political support for tax simplification might climb. 
 Public disclosure of personal income tax filings is actually the norm in countries like Finland and Norway -- and it was once practiced in the United States as well. 
 The history of disclosure in this country is surprising, given current privacy standards. Since 1976, after attempts in the Nixon administration to use individual tax information to harass its enemies, strict civic and criminal penalties have been in place to ensure that tax returns remain private and confidential.
 It wasn't always this way. According to a 2003 article in the National Tax Journal, privacy for tax filings wasn't required when Congress enacted the federal income tax in 1861. The article was written by David L. Lenter, a law professor at the University of Virginia; Joel Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan; and Douglas A. Shackelford, a business professor at the University of North Carolina.
 It found that from 1861 to 1864, newspapers often published lists of taxpayers and their tax liabilities. In 1870, Congress prohibited the lists' publication but allowed public inspection of individual returns. There was a backlash by 1894, when Congress prohibited government officials from disclosing any part of an individual or corporate tax return. 
 In the first half of the 20th century, Congress twice required tax disclosure. In 1923 and 1924, individual and corporate taxpayers had to make public their tax payments but not entire returns. Proponents of disclosure said the measure would encourage tax compliance and reduce improper business conduct. 
 ''Secrecy is of the greatest aid to corruption,'' Robert Howell, a Republican senator from Nebraska, said at the time.
 Newspapers had a field day, publishing the names of famous people and big corporations, together with their tax liabilities. On Oct. 24, 1924, for example, The New York Times revealed that John D. Rockefeller Jr. topped the list of taxpayers in Manhattan, with more than $7 million in taxes in 1923. It said that J. P. Morgan Jr. was much farther down the list, with a tax payment of $98,643.67, and that Charles M. Schwab, a steel magnate, paid $29,494.38.
 Subsequently, President Calvin Coolidge and Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, argued that continuing disclosure of tax information could put wealthy citizens at risk of schemers. Congress dropped the requirement.
 By 1934, though, the disclosure debate flared up again -- in the form of ''pink slips'' that individuals and corporations were to be required to attach to their returns. The slip, which would become part of the public record, would disclose a person's or corporation's name, address, gross income, amount of deductions, net income and tax liability. But the law was dropped before tax time.
 Which brings us to the present. In the wake of accounting scandals and corporate earnings frauds of recent years, not to mention aggressive tax avoidance schemes, some experts say we should bring back corporate tax disclosure.
 ''You can't look at a financial statement and tell how much tax is remitted,'' Professor Slemrod said. ''Corporations can report high income to the public while they report low income to the I.R.S. and pay little tax.'' 
 He said that public disclosure of corporate tax returns could enhance financial market efficiency, provide regulators and researchers with important data and increase tax compliance and pressure for tax reform. Opponents say such measures would compromise business secrets and might be confusing to investors, who would have to figure out how to reconcile tax figures with annual reports and earnings figures. 
 In 2002, Paul H. O'Neill, then the Treasury secretary, told lawmakers who supported corporate tax disclosure that it would create confusion in the public and subject corporations to ''misinformed, inexpert analysis.''
 The pay of top executives at public companies is routinely disclosed in public filings, and has become a controversial issue in an era of financial shock and government bailouts. And since the 1970s, presidential candidates have generally released their tax returns. 
 Of course, with so much data stored electronically these days, privacy is a significant worry. In a 2008 paper, Paul M. Schwartz, a professor at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that tax returns would ''increasingly be subject to the same kind of forces, legal and otherwise, as other personal information.'' Economists like Professor Kotlikoff say they believe that tax disclosure could simply involve releasing an individual's income and tax liability -- figures that cannot be readily used to steal someone's identity. All personal information like Social Security numbers, home addresses and children's names and ages would remain private.
 Online tax filing is now common, and the Internal Revenue Service says it has taken measures to ensure its databases are secure. Still, a 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office found that there were ''vulnerabilities in the security system used by the I.R.S. to protect taxpayer data.'' It said the I.R.S. ''is especially vulnerable to attackers with inside information, which could expose taxpayer and financial data.'' 
 Because government budget deficits are expected to extend far into the future, the tax system is likely to be front and center of the policy debate. Greater tax disclosure might focus attention on how the system actually works and provide an incentive to create a fair and sensible approach that most Americans can support. 
 ''If people could see how terrible the system is,'' Professor Kotlikoff said, ''perhaps then the appeal of a simple, straightforward and fair tax system might rise.''

HEADLINE: Waiting on Washington

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 FACING enormous budget deficits, high unemployment and a weak economy -- not to mention midterm elections and the imminent expiration of major tax cuts -- the Obama administration and Congress have difficult choices ahead.
 For taxpayers, unfortunately, financial planners say that there are myriad issues to ponder but relatively few strategies that can be undertaken with confidence, at least until the legislative process takes shape.
 A big immediate hang-up is the unresolved status of the estate tax, which Congress allowed to lapse at the end of 2009 but which is considered likely to be restored, on as-yet-undetermined terms.
 ''I don't think there's anything more significant than the estate tax,'' said Catharine V. Fairley, a tax planner and partner at Draper & McGinley in Frederick, Md., citing its wide implications for wills, gifts and trusts. ''No one saw this coming -- that they let the estate tax sunset.'' 
 Another unknown is what will happen to the large tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, enacted under President George W. Bush. The cuts produced current income-tax rates of 10 to 35 percent that are due to expire at the end of this year. While it seems a good bet that they will not be extended permanently, the Obama administration proposes to keep them in place, at least temporarily, for all but higher-income taxpayers.
 Individuals earning more than $200,000 -- $250,000 for married couples -- would revert to top-bracket rates of 36 and 39.6 percent, from today's 33 and 35 percent. They would pay 20 percent on capital gains and dividends, instead of 15 percent.
 But the legislative outcome is highly uncertain. How much will Congress want to raise taxes, even on the rich, when economic recovery is so fragile and unemployment still near double digits?
 At the same time, the parlous state of the nation's finances makes it likely that a variety of taxes must rise before very long. To recommend ways to cut budget deficits, the president has pledged to appoint a bipartisan panel to make recommendations, presumably after the midterm elections. 
 ''You've got to believe that future tax rates are going to be significantly higher than current maximum marginal rates -- and that you're going to be subject to them,'' said Bruce J. Berno, president of Berno Financial Management, a financial planner in Cincinnati.
 And David A. Stockman, a former head of the Office of Management and Budget for President Ronald Reagan, predicted recently that ''we're going to be in the tax-raising business for the next decade.''
 The administration has already proposed a $90 billion ''financial responsibility fee'' -- which some would call a tax -- on banks, and reducing the value of itemized deductions and personal exemptions for the wealthy. Other possibilities that might be considered, but are rarely discussed openly, include full or means-tested taxation of Social Security benefits and applying the Medicare payroll tax to investment income. 
 WITH the demise of the estate tax on Dec. 31, 2009, planning has become ''a nightmare,'' Ms. Fairley said. ''It's just limbo,'' she added, until the government decides what to do about restoring the tax, which Democrats have said they support and which directly affects the existing gift tax and the way the capital gains tax is levied. 
 ''You have to wait and see'' what happens, said Robert J. DiQuollo, president of Brinton Eaton Wealth Advisors in Madison, N.J. He noted the possibility of a drawn-out constitutional challenge if the estate tax were to be brought back retroactively to, say, Jan. 1.
 While those who sought abolition of the estate tax say it is unlikely that its repeal will be permanent, supporters of the tax don't imagine that the exemption amount and rate will revert to the levels of 2001 -- $1 million and 55 percent -- when a convoluted phase-out was enacted.
 ''Politically, that's not feasible,'' said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He supports the targets advocated by the Obama administration -- a return to the 2009 regime, which would mean a $3.5 million exemption ($7 million for couples) and a 45 percent rate for larger estates. 
 ''I wouldn't make any drastic moves'' in anticipation of what might happen,'' Mr. DiQuollo warned. He did suggest, though, that in coming months investors might want to ''harvest'' capital gains before the rate on them rises, perhaps even selling those qualifying for long-term treatment and buying them right back. The so-called wash sale rule applies only to losses.
 Analysts also offered the usual ''accelerate income, defer deductions'' advice in situations of likely rate increases.
 Then there are gift taxes. The weak job market and diminished assets might make some people less inclined to make gifts to certain relatives and noncharities this year. But the 2010 gift tax rate, after a $1 million lifetime cap, is 35 percent, compared with 45 percent last year and a probable 55 percent in 2011.
 ''This is the year to do it,'' Mr. DiQuollo said. 
 Ms. Fairley concurred in this sit-tight strategy, citing the uncertainty. ''How do you know, when you update your will, whether to put in a bypass trust?'' she asked. This means not only risking a wrong decision but ''you've just unwound someone's estate plan that they've paid a thousand dollars for.'' 
 And remember that some states have their own estate taxes with exemption amounts that are more limited than those of the expired federal version. 
 Closely tied to the estate tax is a higher levy on capital gains, which was devised in 2001 to replace revenue that would be lost from estate taxes. 
 Traditionally, the value of securities and other assets is stepped up at death, in effect wiping out any tax liability on profits. The heir then starts with a clean slate. Beginning this year, though, under what is called carryover basis, or modified step-up, the heir is subject to a 15 percent tax, using the deceased's original cost or the asset's price at the date of death, whichever is lower, when he or she sells it. 
 Assuming that the provision stands, the effect is mitigated by exemptions of $3 million for spouses and $1.3 million for children and other inheritors. But it will surely mean more record-keeping -- and it has already prompted some consternation among executors. 
 Much more certain, however, is that the suspension of required minimum distributions from I.R.A.'s for 2009 will not be repeated.
 CONGRESS is likely to apply yet another one-year patch to the alternative minimum tax, to prevent legions of additional middle-class households from becoming ensnared by it. The Obama budget proposes indexing that tax to inflation, a move that could make the annual patches far less urgent.
 Late last year, the House passed a bill extending for one year a grab bag of some 50 tax provisions that were to expire at the end of 2010. The Senate, however, didn't take action. The House bill included research-and-development credits for corporations, as well as provisions that would crack down on the use of certain foreign bank accounts to evade taxes and would levy ''carried interest'' as ordinary income rather than capital gains. Carried interest is profit earned by managers of private equity funds acting as general partners in the buying and selling of companies. 
 Amid the uncertainty, Ms. Fairley and others contend that some tax prospects, like raising the 15 percent rate for stock dividends, justify at least modest portfolio adjustments for investors.
 ''I'd be very surprised if they didn't do that,'' she said. As a result, she added, investors ''are looking again to the growth side,'' favoring stocks of companies that reinvest in the business instead of paying profits out as dividends. 
 But such shifting should probably be kept to a minimum, Mr. Berno says, because one's mix of stocks, bonds and other assets is the most crucial investment decision. He says that for a tax-rate difference of perhaps 10 percentage points, investors ''really shouldn't be changing their allocation.''

HEADLINE: He Breaks For Band Recitals

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON 
 IT is no secret that President Obama desperately wants Congress to pass legislation to overhaul health care. But last month, when Mr. Obama convened Congressional Democratic leaders at the White House for a marathon negotiating session, another priority intervened.
 His 11-year-old daughter, Malia, had a band recital.
 Thus did the president of the United States ditch his own health care talks -- temporarily, at least -- to slip off to Sidwell Friends School for a few hours to listen to Malia play the flute. When the recital was over, he returned to the White House, and everybody went back to work. The talks wrapped up at 1:30 a.m., and if the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid; or anybody else had anything to say about the delay, they held their tongues.
 ''There are certain things that are sacrosanct on his schedule -- kids' recitals, soccer games, basketball games, school meetings,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said in an interview the day after the session. ''These are circled in red on his calendar, and regardless of what's going on he's going to make those. I think that's part of how he sustains himself through all this.'' 
 When Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived in Washington little more than a year ago, Mrs. Obama promptly declared herself the mom in chief, and mothers across the nation watched as she juggled her duties as first lady with her responsibilities as a mother. But her husband, the president, conducts an unabashed juggling act of his own. 
 He knocks off work at 6 p.m. each evening to have dinner with his family, and has given his schedulers strict instructions that, if he must have night-time activities, they are to take place after 8 p.m. That includes matters of war; in November, as the commander in chief wrestled with sending more troops to Afghanistan, he called an 8 p.m. meeting of his national security team, in deference to his role as father in chief.
 He squeezes in parent-teacher conferences, soccer and basketball games, and broke away from an economics briefing to call his younger daughter, Sasha, on her eighth birthday. (She was in London with her mother.) And when the White House announced that Mr. Obama would be traveling next month to Indonesia and Australia, the president's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was not shy about confirming that the trip was timed to coincide with the girls' spring break.
 ''We spend a lot of time coordinating the girls' holidays and vacation time,'' said Valerie Jarrett, another senior adviser. ''It doesn't just drive Michelle's schedule, but it drives the president's as well.''
 So far at least, Washington does not seem to have raised any eyebrows. When Mr. Obama told lawmakers why he was leaving the health talks, ''We all said, 'Absolutely, get out of here, go,' '' said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, who was there. 
 Yet even in today's father-friendly world, Mr. Obama's balancing act is not risk-free -- especially in an economy where so many ordinary Americans are struggling. Critics could accuse him of slacking off when the country is in need. And this city is filled with politicians who have sacrificed their families for their jobs, so Mr. Obama must be careful not to generate resentment among those whose schedules must swing around his own.
 ''People elect you not to be a good family man, they elect you to fix their problems, and that's the cold-hearted reality of it,'' said John Feehery, a Republican political strategist. ''And all those folks on the Hill, they've left all their families at home; they don't have the luxury of skipping back home in the middle of the meeting to catch their daughter's recital.''
 In a sense, the 48-year-old president is reflecting attitudinal changes about fatherhood that are typical of men in his generation, said Ellen Galinsky, the president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research organization. Ms. Galinsky says men, now more than women, feel caught between work and parenthood; her surveys show that 59 percent of men report experiencing some or a lot of work/life conflict, up from 35 percent in 1977.
 Yet while Mr. Obama's advisers like to think he is setting an example for fathers everywhere, he does, in fact, have more flexibility than most -- he is, after all, the boss. Because he gets to ''live over the store,'' as he often says, he doesn't have the stress of making that mad dash for the subway to get home in time to relieve the baby sitter. At home, he never has to fix the leaky faucet or take out the trash. And if he needs to go back to the office to finish up work late at night, all he has to do is walk downstairs.
 As Ms. Jarrett said, ''He doesn't have to rush here, because everything is the way he likes it to be.''
 Still, Ms. Galinsky argues, that does not diminish the significance of the president's choices. ''You could argue on one hand that he has a lot more autonomy than most men, and that is absolutely 100 percent true,'' she said. ''But on the other hand, he's got a lot more responsibility on his shoulders than most men.''
 And Mr. Obama has had to give up a few things as well. When he lived in Chicago, he enjoyed driving Malia and Sasha to school; his huge entourage now makes that impractical. ''Quite frankly, they don't want him to,'' Michelle Obama said of the girls in an interview last week with Larry King on CNN. ''They think his motorcade is a complete embarrassment.''
 After two years of being away from his daughters on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama made clear from the start that he intended to make up for lost time. Barely a week into his presidency, he set his first bill signing for 11 a.m. so he could attend a morning presentation at Sasha's school. And in case there were doubts that the dinner hour was sacrosanct, Mr. Obama put an end to them last spring, as his economics team was in the thick of a heated debate over how to bail out faltering auto makers.
 ''It was getting close to 6, and they were not coming to some sort of resolution,'' said one senior official, speaking anonymously to discuss the president's private conversations. ''The president said, 'Look, I'm going to have dinner with my family, why don't you guys spend a couple of hours thinking about this, and after they go to bed, I'll come back and see if we can hash this out.' ''
 Mr. Obama is hardly the first president to feel the tug of fatherhood, but he does seem to be the first to so openly acknowledge working his schedule around his family. In the recent book ''The Clinton Tapes,'' the historian Taylor Branch reveals how President Clinton quietly put off an important trip to Japan in early 1996 so that he could stay home to help his daughter, Chelsea, then a high school junior, study for her mid-term exams. The decision infuriated former Vice President Al Gore, who viewed the trip as critical to smoothing tensions with Japan. Mr. Clinton ultimately went -- three months after Mr. Gore thought he should have gone.
 ''Gore couldn't believe that Clinton was baby-sitting, in his view,'' Mr. Branch said in an interview. ''What Clinton was saying was, 'It's junior year mid-terms, those are the last grades that go on your college applications.' Whether he was a devoted father or an inattentive president -- that's the debate. But he didn't express any misgivings about it.''
 Nobody seems to be accusing Mr. Obama of being an inattentive president, though he did irk one powerful constituency -- the Washington media elite -- when the White House announced he would not be attending lastyear's Gridiron Dinner, the annual white-tie affair in which the city's high-society journalists poke fun at politicians in song and skits.
 The decision earned Mr. Obama the distinction of becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland to miss the first Gridiron of his presidency, and the capital's media mavens were especially bent out of shape when they discovered that spring break was taking place not in Chicago, as the White House had originally said, but rather at Camp David, the presidential retreat, a short 20-minute helicopter ride away. 
 When he first took office, Mr. Obama said he intended to run a family-friendly White House -- provoking a now-infamous retort from his sharp-tongued chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who bluntly told the president, ''family-friendly to your family.'' Mr. Emanuel's prediction has proved pretty much correct; most senior advisers to Mr. Obama see their own children far less than he sees his. 
 Even so, Anita Dunn, the former Obama communications director, says that by being so open about his own family obligations, Mr. Obama has given his advisers -- both men and women -- the license to be open about theirs. 
 ''Many of us who have children of our own love this piece of him,'' said Ms. Dunn, who has a teenage son. ''Not only does he have no problem saying, 'I have to do this, this is my priority,' but it gives people who work for him the space to say, 'I'm sorry, I can't be at that meeting, because my child has an honor roll assembly.' ''

HEADLINE: The Myth of the One-Term Wonder

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. MERRY. 
Robert W. Merry, the publisher of Stratfor, is the author, most recently, of ''A Country of Vast Designs: James K. Polk, the Mexican War and the Conquest of the American Continent.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 No doubt President Obama was sincere when he recently told ABC's Diane Sawyer that he'd ''rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president.'' The president seemed to be saying that he would make decisions with history in mind rather than voter sentiment, even if voter sentiment would get him tossed out at the next election. 
 This is perhaps a noble sensibility -- and one worth reflecting on as President's Day approaches. But it's also misguided. The judgment of history -- in the form of presidential rankings yielded up by those periodic polls of heavyweight historians -- coincides to a remarkable degree with the contemporaneous judgment of the electorate. With few exceptions, history has not smiled upon one-term presidents. Only one such chief executive has managed with any consistency to get into the historians' ''near great'' category. 
 That president is James K. Polk, who announced upon getting his party's nomination in 1844 that, if elected, he would serve only one term. He did this in part because, as a small-government man, he possessed a philosophical aversion to entrenched power. But his vow was pragmatic, not just idealistic: he felt the powerful figures of his party would be more likely to unite behind him in the general election if they thought they would have their own shot at the presidency in four years. 
 Polk was in many ways a smaller-than-life figure -- sanctimonious, suspicious by nature, uncomfortable in social settings. But he harbored larger-than-life ambitions. Upon getting elected, he embraced four big goals: reduce tariffs; create an independent treasury; establish American control of California and most of the Oregon Territory. None of this was easy. Tariff rates generated intense political emotions in those days, rather like tax cuts today. And the independent treasury raised the ire of Americans still angry about Andrew Jackson's destruction of the Second Bank of the United States a decade earlier.
 But his foreign policy goals generated the most friction. Polk nearly stumbled into war with Britain over the Oregon Territory before a diplomatic breakthrough fostered a peaceful carving-up of that vast expanse. And he did force his country into a war with Mexico to fulfill his ambition of taking over not just California but what is now the American Southwest. The war, popular initially with the American people, dragged on for two years, generating intense civic discontent and sapping the president's political standing. 
 In the end, he succeeded in all four goals and annexed Texas along the way, thus expanding the United States by a third and creating a transcontinental nation positioned to dominate two oceans. In doing all that, he accomplished what the American people wanted him to do and won the respect of future historians.
 But if Polk is the exception, and one-term presidents tend to get history's brush-off, who gets its accolades? As the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. noted in 1996 -- in conjunction with his own poll of presidential scholars -- surveys since 1948 have been consistent in identifying nine greats and near-greats: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt (usually in that order), followed in various rank order by Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Harry S. Truman. 
 Leaving aside Polk, all these men either were two-term presidents or got themselves elected after succeeding to the White House upon the death of their predecessors. In other words, all made the case to the voters that they deserved to retain their jobs. And the only one-term exception opted out of the game even before facing the electorate the first time (a formula for one-term success that is obviously no longer available to Mr. Obama). 
 What about those men judged by history to be presidential failures? The polls of historians generally focus on James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce, Andrew Johnson (who inherited Lincoln's second term and never was elected in his own right), Millard Fillmore and Warren G. Harding (who died in office). Not a two-term president in the bunch. 
 One two-term outlier among the ''failed'' presidents is Ulysses S. Grant, who presided over nasty financial scandals involving White House and Cabinet officials. Grant was re-elected mostly thanks to the economic boom that came with railroad construction in his first term and the fact that the worst of those scandals erupted only in his second term. 
 The typical one-term president generally falls into the ''average'' category, occasionally showing up as ''above average.'' This generally means no unavoidable crises, no scandals of consequence and no serious new directions for America. A 2000 Wall Street Journal poll of historians ranked John Adams as above average and then populated the average category mostly with one-termers: William Howard Taft, John Quincy Adams, George H. W. Bush, Rutherford B. Hayes, Martin Van Buren and Chester A. Arthur. 
 Also on the ''average'' list were the two-termers Calvin Coolidge, whose economic policies are viewed by many historians as having contributed to the Depression, and Bill Clinton, whose historical reputation couldn't be judged fairly before his presidency was over. (Similarly, it's too soon for historians to assess George W. Bush, however tempting that may be.) Most of these ''average'' presidents were decent men and serious politicians, but they left little mark of historical dimension upon the nation. 
 All this suggests a false dichotomy underlying Mr. Obama's expressed resolve to render his presidential decisions without regard to his re-election chances -- as if the choice were between political popularity and governmental success. A better approach for any chief executive is to assume that, in presidential politics, as in retailing, the customer is always right, and that the electorate's verdict will be consonant with history's consensus. Thus, the aim of every historically minded president, Mr. Obama included, should be to pursue a second term by bundling up voter sentiment into a collection of policies and programs that succeed in the crucial areas most on the minds of the American people.
 Mr. Obama can certainly anticipate a one-term fate if he gets crosswise with his citizens. And if that happens, it isn't likely that on future President's Days he will ever be remembered as a great chief executive.

DATELINE: Athens 

 BODY:
 Greece has entered the third millennium having survived many foreign occupations. The most trying was that of the Ottoman Empire, starting in 1453 when Constantinople was renamed Istanbul, from the Greek phrase meaning ''going to the city.'' Since our liberation from the Turks in 1821, we have suffered many dictatorships, the most recent following the coup d'etat of 1967 and lasting seven years. But since then, Greece has entered its longest period of peace and democracy since it was constituted as an independent state. 
 Excuse me for this prologue, but it is indispensable in order to explain the present ''crisis'' over Greece's exploding debt. This mess is actually a small problem by historic standards. Over the last two centuries my compatriots have survived much worse. 
 Historically, Greece has had three patrons: Britain, France and Russia. In the early days of the reborn Hellenic state, Germany was usually an unfriendly country; it became an ally of Kemal Ataturk's Turkey and a foe in both world wars. Now we are facing the delicate situation of accepting the protection of a Germany that, along with France, dominates the euro zone. (Britain's role as a patron was handed off to the United States with the Truman doctrine of 1947.)
 Yet the vast majority of Greeks do not consider the European Monetary Union a threat to national sovereignty. On the contrary, we feel that the common currency offers valuable protection from the headwinds of the international economic crisis, and is thus an extra guarantee to national sovereignty. 
 A neighbor of mine, Yiannis, recalls the days of nonstop devaluations of the drachma, our national currency before the euro. If you wished to go to, say, Delphi by car, you would take a suitcase of drachmas to pay for fuel. 
 The first signs of our current fiscal derailment appeared in 2007 with the crashing of our own real estate bubble. Last October, Prime Minister George Papandreou was elected with a strong mandate to fight corruption and navigate the country through the fiscal storm. 
 The political and economic morass that our journalists call the ''Greek tragedy'' became an opportunity to push forward an unprecedented agenda of regulatory reform and policy initiatives to support a new model of sustainable, environmentally friendly development. And the Greek people gradually have come to understand that they themselves must help in creating a new model of economic development. 
 Therefore, we are for the most part reacting with stoicism to the government's proposed austerity measures. The demonstrations by civil servants over the last few days got a lot of press coverage, but they were relatively modest, without the infamous ''pulse'' of earlier eras. They were much tamer than the December 2008 riots that followed the police shooting of a 15-year-old student.
 I sense that the majority of Greek people seem to understand the urgency of the economic situation and are willing to accept sacrifices. They demand deep and radical change right now. Our politicians also appear united, a demonstration of cohesiveness in Greek society that may be without precedent, at least in the 35-year history of the Republic. 
 My cousin Stella, for example, was telling me she would be willing to sacrifice a part of her monthly income if that would help the country. But she thinks that burden-sharing needs to be fair and just for the measures to get broad social support. This is a major challenge for our top economic officials: to use the existing labyrinth of obsolete and inefficient bureaucracies and procedures to come up with a proposal for financial restoration that the public will accept. 
 The man in the street also feels more positively about the United States than ever before. Most Greeks think that on issues from foreign policy to restoring the social safety net, the Obama administration's goals are in sync with their own. The Greek people also share President Obama's anger and frustration over the behavior of bankers. 
 While the European Union last week promised ''determined and coordinated action'' on Greece's debt problem, none of us is quite sure what that will amount to. The one thing I am certain of, however, is that my country will overcome the financial crisis with national pride and international dignity intact.

HEADLINE: Palin's Cunning Sleight of Hand

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
Liberals had a blast mocking Sarah Palin last weekend when she was caught addressing the Tea Party Convention with a cheat sheet scrawled on her hand. Even the president's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, couldn't resist getting into the act and treated a White House briefing to a Palin hand gag of his own. 
 Yet the laughter rang hollow. You had to wonder if Palin, who is nothing if not cunning, had sprung a trap. She knows all too well that the more the so-called elites lampoon her, the more she cements her cred with the third of the country that is her base. Her hand hieroglyphics may not have been speaking aids but bait. 
 If so, mission accomplished. Her sleight of hand gave the anti-Palin chorus another prod to deride her as an empty-headed, subliterate clown, and her fans another cue to rally. The only problem is that the serious import of Palin's overriding political message got lost in this distracting sideshow. That message has the power to upend the Obama presidency -- even if Palin, with her record-low approval ratings, never gets anywhere near the White House. 
 The Palin shtick has now become the Republican catechism, parroted by every party leader in Washington. Their constant refrain, delivered with cynicism but not irony, is this: Republicans are the anti-big-government, anti-stimulus, anti-Wall Street, pro-Tea Party tribunes of the common folk. ''This is about the people,'' as Palin repeatedly put it last weekend while pocketing $100,000 of the Tea Partiers' money.
 Incredibly enough, this message is gaining traction. Though Obama remains more personally popular than the G.O.P., Republicans pulled ahead of the Democrats in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, among others, in a matchup for the 2010 midterms.
 This G.O.P. populism is all bunk, of course. Republicans in office now, as well as Palin during her furtive public service in Alaska, have feasted on federal pork, catered to special interests, and pursued policies indifferent to recession-battered Americans. And yet they're getting away with their populist masquerade -- not just with a considerable swath of voters but even with certain elements in the ''liberal media.'' The Dean of the Beltway press corps, the columnist David Broder, cited Palin's ''pitch-perfect populism'' in hailing her as ''a public figure at the top of her game'' in Thursday's Washington Post. 
 That Republican leaders can pass off deceptive faux-populism as ''pitch-perfect populism'' is in part a testament to the blinding intensity of the economic anger and anxiety roiling the country. It also shows the power of an incessant bumper-sticker fiction to take root when ineffectually challenged -- and, most crucially, the inability of Democrats to make a persuasive case that they offer anything better. 
 The Obama White House remains its own worst enemy. No sooner did Palin's Tea Party speech end than we learned of the president's tone-deaf interview expressing admiration for ''very savvy businessmen'' like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs. With that single remark, Obama ingeniously identified himself with the most despised aspects of both Washington and Wall Street -- the bailout and the bonuses. He still doesn't understand that to most Americans, Blankfein is a savvy businessman only in the outrageous sense that he managed to grab his bonus some 17 months after the taxpayers had the good grace to save him from going out of business altogether.
 Instead of praising bailed-out bankers, the president might have more profitably instructed his press secretary to drop the lame Palin jokes and dismantle the disinformation campaign her speech delivered to a national audience. Palin, unlike Obama, put herself on the side of the angels, railing against Wall Street's bonuses and bailout, even though she and John McCain had supported TARP during the campaign. Palin also bragged that she had ''joined with other conservative governors'' in ''rejecting some'' stimulus dollars when in reality she rejected only a symbolic 3 percent of those dollars -- soon to be overruled by the Alaskan Legislature, which took every last buck. 
 This disingenuousness is old hat for Palin, who hired lobbyists to pursue $27 million in earmarks while serving as mayor of the town of Wasilla (pop. 6,700) and loudly defended her state's ''bridge to nowhere'' until her politically opportunistic flip-flop. What's new is the extent to which her test-marketed dishonesty has now become the template for her peers in the G.O.P. ''populist'' putsch. Adopting her example -- while unencumbered by her political baggage -- the party is exploiting the Tea Party movement to rebrand itself as un-Washington while quietly conducting business as usual in the capital. 
 There's ''no difference'' between G.O.P. and Tea Party beliefs, claims the House Republican leader, John Boehner. Not exactly. The three senators named ''porkers of the month'' for December by the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste were all Republicans: Richard Shelby of Alabama, Susan Collins of Maine and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Shelby is so unashamedly addicted to earmarks that he used a senatorial ''hold'' to halt confirmation votes on 70 Obama administration appointees until his costly shopping list of Alabama pork projects was granted. Or so he did until his over-the-top theatrics earned him unwelcome attention and threatened to derail his party's pious antispending posturing.
 While more brazen than his peers, Shelby is otherwise typical of them. Jonathan Karl of ABC News last week unearthed photographs of various G.O.P. congressmen posing in their districts with stimulus checks that they had publicly opposed. The Washington Times uncovered more than a dozen other Republican lawmakers who privately solicited stimulus money from the Department of Agriculture while denouncing the stimulus to their constituents and the news media, often angrily. 
 Even the G.O.P./Tea Party heartthrob of the hour, Scott Brown, is not the barn-coat-wearing populist he purports to be. In her speech, Palin saluted him as ''just a guy with a truck'' who was doing ''his part to put our government back on the side of the people.'' In reality Brown's Massachusetts Senate campaign benefited from a last-minute flood of contributions from financial industry donors -- with 80 percent of the haul coming from outside the state. It says all you need to know about our politics that his Democratic opponent, Martha Coakley, matched him by holding a fund-raiser largely sponsored by lobbyists for the health care and pharmaceutical industries. 
 Now that he's in the Senate, Brown is likely to junk the truck and side full time with Wall Street against Main Street. To do otherwise would be to buck his party's entire establishment. Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has already signaled that he'll fight the Obama administration's push for a ''Volcker rule'' to rein in too-big-to-fail financial behemoths. The conservative message guru Frank Luntz has drafted a memo instructing G.O.P. legislators on how to defeat a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency while camouflaging themselves as populist foes of the very banks and credit card companies that that agency would regulate. That's a neat trick -- Luntz's nonpolitical clients include Merrill Lynch and American Express -- and it helps explain why Wall Street is now tilting its contributions to Congressional Republicans for 2010.
 Yet it's the Democrats who are now most linked to corporate interests, thanks to all the backroom deals over health care. More Americans have heard of the Medicaid money shoveled to the Democratic senators Ben Nelson (the January ''porker of the month'') and Mary Landrieu in exchange for their health care votes than of Thad Cochran's $8.75 million earmark for the ''Exchange With Historic Whaling and Trading Partners Program'' (a proposed cut in the Obama budget). The Republicans are so disciplined at claiming the fiscal-hawk high road that even Jenny Sanford, the wronged first lady of South Carolina, is still defending her husband, Mark, as an uncompromising defender of ''hard-earned tax dollars'' in her new tell-all memoir, ''Staying True.'' Though she gives us the skinny on her husband's philandering, she never mentions the subsequent revelations that expenses for his trysts and other personal travel were billed to taxpayers. 
 Before he was done in by his Argentine firecracker -- and before the emergence of Palin -- Sanford was floated by The Wall Street Journal editorial page and others on the right as an ideal ticket mate for John McCain in 2008. As a congressman he had slept on a futon in his office and voted against a breast cancer postage stamp as wasteful ''feel-good legislation.'' As governor, he refused to take stimulus money despite the fact that South Carolina had the nation's fastest-growing unemployment rate. When an unemployed man from Charleston caring for a seriously ill mother and sister called in to C-Span last February begging Sanford for help, he didn't budge. But he did volunteer to pray for the caller and his family.
 So it went with Palin last weekend. Her only concrete program for dealing with America's pressing problems came in the question-and-answer session. ''It would be wise of us to start seeking some divine intervention again in this country,'' she said, ''so that we can be safe and secure and prosperous again.'' That pretty much sums up her party's economic program, at least: divine intervention will achieve what government intervention cannot. That the G.O.P. may actually be winning this argument is less an indictment of Palin than of Washington Democrats too busy reading the writing on her hand to see or respond to the ominous political writing on the wall.

HEADLINE: The Rattled State of Democrats

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was a telling glimpse into the state of mind of rattled Senate Democrats.
 Worried that they were going to be skewered for pushing a jobs bill that was stuffed with business tax breaks and pork, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, pulled the plug Thursday on a rare bipartisan proposal, gambling both with the party's best chance of posting a needed legislative win as well as with President Obama's new push for cross-party cooperation. 
 The surprise move by Mr. Reid, partly in response to fears from lawmakers that they were going to take a pummeling on cable news, has put the future of the jobs legislation in question and showed how the criticism heaped on their health care plan and the loss of the Massachusetts Senate seat have put Democrats in a protective crouch. 
 At the same time, Mr. Reid's gambit puts pressure on Republicans to back elements they had already endorsed as part of the broader package, rolled out by top Democrats and Republicans on the Finance Committee, a note the White House sounded Friday.
 ''I think the legislation that Senator Reid will move when the Senate comes back into town will garner bipartisan support,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. 
 Yet if Mr. Reid cannot assemble 60 votes to advance a slimmed-down measure he is proposing when the Senate returns from a 10-day recess on Feb. 22, he could be accused of turning a potential bipartisan victory into a Democratic defeat. He seemed ready to try to turn the tables on Republicans, warning them that they would be guilty of opposing popular provisions they were already backing as part of the broader, more costly bill. 
 ''Each piece of this bill enjoys bipartisan support,'' Mr. Reid said of his $15 billion package, which would give payroll tax exemptions for employers who put unemployed people to work and seeks to spur investment in public works projects. ''I look forward to swift action on this measure that will create and save dependable jobs.''
 But Mr. Reid's rollout was messy, sent conflicting signals and was highly instructive about the state of relations between the two parties as well as among Democrats.
 The events began with Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, Mr. Baucus's occasional Republican partner in bipartisanship, when they released an $85 billion plan that included the payroll tax holiday and a slew of other provisions. 
 Among them were the extension of billions of dollars in corporate tax breaks, but some were even more off the point of job creation, like agriculture assistance for Arkansas, where Senator Blanche Lincoln, the Democratic chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, is in a difficult fight to hold her seat.
 Still, the measure drew accolades from the left and the right, a virtually unheard of occurrence in the Senate these days and one viewed as a potential sign of a thaw in the partisan freeze. Even the White House weighed in, with Mr. Gibbs distributing a supportive statement on Thursday.
 So it was a bit shocking when -- just hours after the White House statement -- Mr. Reid left a Democratic luncheon and told reporters he was jettisoning the bipartisan proposal for a smaller package that would be the first installment in a comprehensive Democratic jobs agenda. 
 At the White House on Friday, Mr. Gibbs suggested that even the administration had been caught off guard by Mr. Reid's shift, saying, ''I don't know the degree to which he talked to us about that.''
 As lawmakers, top aides and news organizations tried to sort out what had happened to change the approach, a few things became clear. 
 First, liberal Democrats in particular were unhappy with the Finance Committee plan, believing that Mr. Baucus had conceded too much to the Republicans and was putting Democrats in danger of attacks for turning a jobs bill into a legislative ''Christmas tree'' loaded with ornaments for constituents back home. Indeed, House Republicans were already preparing to ridicule it despite the inclusion of elements favored by their party.
 ''You know,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, ''it looks more like a tax bill than a jobs bill to me, and I want a jobs bill.''
 Second, a year of poisonous partisanship has taken its toll on trust in the Senate. Democrats said they remained skeptical that Republicans would follow through on their signals of support for the bipartisan measure. And even if they did, Democrats feared that Republicans would drag out the process, forcing them to use up valuable floor time for a measure that should be approved quickly.
 Democrats pointed to a private meeting Tuesday between Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Mr. Reid at which, Democrats said, Mr. McConnell would not commit to putting Republican muscle behind the measure.
 Republicans pointed out that lack of backing from Mr. McConnell had hardly prevented Democrats from forging ahead with other bills, and they were fuming about Mr. Reid's maneuver. 
 An aide to Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican co-author of the payroll tax plan, said Saturday that he would oppose the measure on the initial procedural vote in protest, depriving Democrats of one of their most likely allies. Another party official said Republican senators might ultimately vote for the bill, but only after making their unhappiness known.
 And the Republicans might be only the beginning of Mr. Reid's problems as he tries to chalk up a victory on the economic issues that are a top election-year concern of many voters. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who helped shepherd a much more expansive jobs and economic package through the House late last year, has her own ideas about what the legislation should look like.
 Ms. Pelosi said Friday that she intends to ensure that critical elements of the House measure are in any final package.
 Evidently, achieving bicameral harmony can be as hard as finding the right bipartisan balance.

HEADLINE: Missed Warning Signs of the Financial Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Testy Conflict With Goldman Helped Push A.I.G. to Precipice'' (front page, Feb. 7):
 The ''tip of the iceberg'' quote attributed to me was in reference to my belief that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York missed an early warning signal of the impending global credit crisis. Something was clearly amiss when the gap in valuation was so wide between two prominent players of the caliber of A.I.G. Financial Products and Goldman Sachs. 
 Beyond figuring out who was right and wrong in the valuations, the Fed would have learned much more by digging into the motivations of each side. The Fed would have learned something that should have been blindingly obvious: management at A.I.G.F.P. was reluctant to accede to Goldman's valuation for fear of having to crystallize career-threatening losses in reports to the company's ultimate parent on Pine Street. By contrast, Goldman was worried about protecting its profits.
 History has long shown us that hiding disasters is the stronger of the two motivations, and it is a motivation that often leads to dire results. By understanding this, the Fed would have realized that these large disparities were indeed highlighting the vast extent of the problem.
 This conclusion would have been further reinforced if the Fed had understood the difference in the risk management culture of the two institutions. A.I.G.F.P. was warehousing default risk, essentially adopting a trade and hold strategy. Goldman, by contrast, tends to be more systematically focused on managing its risk, and because it is more active in modeling, trading and hedging its portfolios, its valuation measures would be more strongly grounded in market pricing.
 At the time, the crisis was simply being called a ''subprime crisis.'' If the Fed had done its job better, if would have realized earlier that the entire financial system was in deep distress.

HEADLINE: Unlicensed Drivers Are Caught in Net for Drunken Ones, and Lose Their Cars

BYLINE: By RYAN GABRIELSON. 
Ryan Gabrielson is a fellow with the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley

 BODY:
Bernardino's wife began to sob as soon as she saw the signs warning ''sobriety checkpoint ahead.'' 
 ''They cannot do anything to us,'' said Bernardino, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, as he pulled their 1997 Ford Explorer into a police checkpoint in San Pablo.
His wife knew better. They were sober, but Bernardino, who would not allow his last name to be used because of his illegal status, had no driver's license, an offense that would cost them their car.
 Sobriety checkpoints, like the one in San Pablo, have increasingly become profitable operations that are far more likely to seize cars from unlicensed -- and often illegal immigrant -- motorists, than to catch drunken drivers. 
 An examination by the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that in 2009, impoundments at checkpoints generated an estimated $40 million in towing fees and police fines statewide. Cities like Oakland, San Jose, San Rafael, Hayward and Redwood City divide the revenue with towing companies.
 While there is an economic benefit for strapped cities, it comes at a cost to taxpayers. In the last fiscal year, $30 million was authorized to pay overtime for officers working on the drunken-driving crackdowns. That money came from federal taxpayers through the California Office of Traffic Safety, which contracts with the University of California, Berkeley, to help distribute the money. 
 While the checkpoints do catch some drunken drivers, the police manning them are also leaving sober but unlicensed drivers, like Bernardino, on the side of the road, with no hope of regaining their vehicle for at least a month. Once vehicles are impounded, California law requires towing companies to hold them for 30 days. That can mean storage fees and fines that run from $1,000 to $4,000, municipal finance records show. Unlicensed motorists rarely challenge the impoundments. 
 Often the owners lack the money to recover their cars. Tow companies do not require vehicle owners to have a driver's license, but they must bring a legal driver with them to the tow lot.
 Perry Shusta, vice president of the California Tow Truck Association and owner of Arrowhead Towing in Antioch, said two-thirds or more of the impounded vehicles were never reclaimed and were sold at lien sales.
 The proceeds go primarily to the towing companies.
 The Investigative Reporting Program reviewed hundreds of pages of city financial records and police reports, and analyzed data from sobriety checkpoints during the past two years. The data revealed that police departments across the state are seizing a growing number of vehicles from unlicensed drivers. In the last fiscal year, the police seized approximately 24,000 such cars at sobriety checkpoints, up from 17,900 in 2008 and 15,700 in 2007.
 Law enforcement officials say demographics play no role in determining where the police establish checkpoints. But records show that cities where Hispanics make up a majority of the population are seizing cars at three times the rate of cities with small minority populations. 
 Sobriety checkpoints typically take place on major thoroughfares near highways. On average, officers seize seven cars for each drunken-driving arrest, state data show. The disparity is far greater in some cities. San Rafael averaged almost 15 impoundments for each drunken-driving arrest in the last fiscal year, and the police in Oakland seized 11 cars for every drunken driver who was caught. And in Montebello, state records show, checkpoints netted up to 60 impoundments for every drunken driver apprehended. 
 Police officials said they asked for driver's licenses at sobriety checkpoints because doing so helped remove another kind of unsafe motorist from the road -- unlicensed drivers -- and because the California Office of Traffic Safety, which provides the grants for the checkpoints, advises departments to do so. Research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that motorists driving with a suspended or revoked license cause collisions at a higher rate than licensed drivers.
 ''I think that a significant number of the hit-and-run drivers, when we do apprehend them, often have no driver's license,'' said Chief Ron Ace of the Hayward Police Department. ''Which adds to one of the reasons why they don't stick around.''
 The seizures appear to defy a 2005 federal appellate court ruling that the police cannot impound a car solely because the driver is unlicensed. 
 Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for the office of Attorney General Jerry Brown, wrote in an e-mail message that the ''law is unclear regarding the circumstances under which a vehicle operated by a driver who is determined at a checkpoint to be unlicensed may be constitutionally impounded at the scene.''
 A challenge to the constitutionality of California's 30-day impound law will be argued later this year before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Ms. Gasparac said the ruling might clear the matter.
 The San Francisco Police Department is not waiting for a ruling; it recently altered its impoundment policy to allow unlicensed motorists 20 minutes to find a legal driver to move their car from the scene. The policy of the California Highway Patrol is to refrain from impounding vehicles at its checkpoints simply because the driver has no license. 
 Data from state records show that Bernardino was one of 91 unlicensed drivers to lose his car in San Pablo in 2009. The ratio of impoundments to driving under the influence arrests was high around the Bay Area in 2009: In Daly City, there were 39.5 impoundments for every D.U.I. arrest; in San Rafael, 18.6; and in San Pablo, 9.
 Drunken-driving checkpoints have saved countless lives on the nation's roadways. But in California, motorists arrested for drunken driving can usually retrieve their vehicles the next day.
 Impoundments, on the other hand, can create a significant economic hardship for those who depend on a vehicle to get to work. And the consequences can be more than economic.
 Bernardino, for example, worked seven days a week to raise $1,900 to pay the city fines and tow fees so he could recover his sports utility vehicle. After 30 days, he gave the money to his brother-in-law -- a licensed driver and the vehicle's registered owner.
 But an acquaintance robbed Bernardino's in-law of the money and shot him to death the day he was to retrieve the Explorer. 
 For three months, as his family mourned and struggled to send money to relatives back home, Bernardino said he worked long hours so he could buy another car, allowing him to travel to higher-paying jobs in other Bay Area cities.
 ''If I lose the car, I cannot do anything, so I need to have it,'' Bernardino said in Spanish. ''I have to drive because I have no alternative.'' 
 While state law prevents an illegal immigrant like Bernardino from getting a driver's license, it does not prevent him from buying a vehicle.
 Location, Location
 A checkpoint typically lasts six hours. As the cars roll through and licenses are checked, officers rarely inquire about the drivers' residency status. Nor do they contact United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they suspect unlicensed motorists are in the country illegally.
 In mid-December, the Hayward police stopped Hugo Hernandez, a 26-year-old illegal immigrant and unlicensed driver, at a checkpoint and impounded his 2002 Nissan Altima. 
 Mr. Hernandez went to the police headquarters the next day to pay his fine and retrieve the car. But a Hayward Police Department clerk told him the car would be kept for 30 days, he said. 
 Local governments require car owners to pay impoundment release fees, on average $155, cities' records show. And cities increasingly charge tow companies franchise fees, which gives the governments a cut of the dollars raised through impoundments.
 The checkpoint where Mr. Hernandez was stopped was outside El Potro, a Latin music nightclub run by Francisco Ruiz. Mr. Ruiz said that for a dozen years, he had not seen any sobriety checkpoints. Then, the police department confirmed, it conducted four operations there in 2009.
 The state does not consistently collect data on where departments set up sobriety checkpoints. A majority of more than a dozen California law enforcement agencies refused to release records showing which intersections they single out or what had happened at checkpoints.
 But the disparity between vehicle impoundments and arrests for drunken driving exists in nearly every region of California. South Gate and several other cities around Los Angeles average 20 cars impounded for every D.U.I. arrest.
 Hispanics make up only a quarter of the residents of San Rafael, according to data from the federal Census Bureau. In the past two years, however, 10 of the city's 12 sobriety checkpoints took place on streets surrounding the city's Hispanic neighborhoods, the Canal District. Those operations resulted in four arrests for drunken driving and 121 cars impounded for driver's license violations.
 Lt. Glenn McElderry, head of the San Rafael Police Department traffic unit, said, ''We do not put checkpoints right there in the Canal District.'' 
 While the police have not staged operations inside that district, department records show that checkpoints halted traffic on two primary feeder streets.
 Impoundments at checkpoints are incidental, not intentional, law enforcement officials say. And the operations, they say, do not single out Hispanic areas. Nonetheless, it is often Hispanic drivers -- sometimes whole families -- who are left by the side of the road at a checkpoint without their car and all that was in it.
 Some tow-company workers have seen Hispanic mothers arrive at impoundment lots to remove car seats and toys.
 ''You're standing there like some armed guard inventorying her belongings as she takes them out,'' said Mattea Ezgar, an office manager at Terra Linda Towing in San Rafael. ''I have to stand here for days and watch them take their whole life out of their vehicles.''
 Checkpoints' Origins
 Fifteen years ago, California lawmakers who broadened the impoundment authority of local police had no expectation of the kind of checkpoints now common in the state, said David Roberti, former president pro-tem of the State Senate.
 ''It's turned out to be a far more vigorous enforcement than any of us would have dreamed of at the time,'' Mr. Roberti said.
 In 1994, Quentin L. Kopp, then a state senator representing San Francisco, sponsored the 30-day impoundment legislation to toughen penalties for a variety of traffic violations. Driving without a license was just one of them. The measure became law in 1995.
 In an interview last month, Mr. Kopp, now a judge in South San Francisco, said he had not intended to single out unlicensed drivers, and certainly not illegal immigrants.
 ''The impounding bill I don't remember as being that controversial,'' he said.
 What he did not anticipate was the way his law would work in concert with a voter initiative, Proposition 187, which voters approved in 1995 and which took away illegal immigrants' driver's licenses and their chance to obtain one legally. The impoundment law then helped strip them of their cars.
 But even with the new legal authority to set up frequent checkpoints, it was not until 2006 that their extensive use became evident.
 Search and Seizure
 ''It is assumed under the law that the taking of personal property without a warrant is unconstitutional,'' said Martin J. Mayer, a founding partner in the Fullerton law firm Jones & Mayer, who represents numerous law-enforcement associations. 
 Mr. Mayer was referring to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which restricts law enforcement's authority to seize private property without a court order. That, he said, protects everyone, whether they are in the country legally or not. He communicated his opinion in a memorandum to his clients, California's police chief and sheriffs, in 2005 after a ruling by the Ninth Circuit in an Oregon case.
 In that decision the court held that law enforcement could not impound a vehicle if the only offense was unlicensed driving. The only exception permitted the police to impound a car was if it posed a threat to public safety, was parked illegally or would soon be vandalized if left in place.
 The ruling sharply altered the legal status of vehicle impoundments. In response, in 2007 the legislative counsel of California called on the state's police departments to cease what had become a standard practice.
 ''If a peace officer lawfully stops a motor vehicle on the highway and the driver of the motor vehicle is an unlicensed driver, that alone is not sufficient justification for the peace officer to cause the impoundment of the motor vehicle,'' the counsel, who advises lawmakers, said in a report. But the counsel has no authority over police departments.
 In 2008, in a separate case in Federal District Court case, a judge arrived at a different conclusion, agreeing with the State of California and several cities, who were defendants and argued that the impoundments were penalties for a criminal offense, and that therefore car owners were not subject to Fourth Amendment protections. The plaintiffs' appeal is pending. 
 Most California law enforcement agencies continue to seize vehicles based on driver's license violations alone.
 State officials have declared that 2010 is the ''year of the checkpoint,'' and plan 2,500 of the operations statewide.

HEADLINE: Polanski's Visions of Victimhood

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
''THE GHOST WRITER,'' the 18th feature by Roman Polanski, opens this week, and, not for the first time in Mr. Polanski's career, the movie itself is likely to be overshadowed by the man who made it. 
 Critics and viewers have long been tempted to link Mr. Polanski's work to his life -- to view one through the prism of the other -- not least because the life has been so public and so uncommonly eventful. ''There's nothing about human nature that would surprise him,'' the novelist Robert Harris, a co-writer of ''The Ghost Writer,'' said recently. ''He's a sort of walking microcosm of history.''
 As Mr. Harris suggests, Mr. Polanski's biography could double as a summary of the 20th century. Born in 1933, he spent part of his boyhood scrambling to stay alive in the Krakow ghetto. He was reunited with his father after the war, but his mother died at Auschwitz. A precocious actor and street performer, he started plotting his escape from Communist Poland at a young age. His award-winning early films were his ticket out, and he arrived in London on the eve of the Swinging '60s. 
 He made it to the United States in time for the summer of love, only to become a tragic symbol of the end of the '60s, when his pregnant wife, the actress Sharon Tate, and four other people were slaughtered by followers of Charles Manson. The counterculture hangover continued; one might even say it never went away. In 1977 Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty to ''unlawful sexual intercourse'' with a 13-year-old girl. Last September, more than 31 years after he fled Los Angeles to escape sentencing, he was arrested in Zurich by Swiss authorities pending possible extradition to the United States. 
 While Mr. Polanski's films are generally not self-revealing in any literal sense, he invites psychobiographical criticism because he has been, for almost his entire career, that relatively rare entity: a celebrity director. His persona is so much a part of the public imagination that it looms even over a movie as devoid of autobiographical echoes as ''The Ghost Writer,'' which had its premiere Friday at the Berlin International Film Festival and opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday. 
 His filmography amounts to its own microcosm, cutting a swath through a half-century's worth of cinematic trends. He came to prominence as part of the European art cinema of the '60s: ''Knife in the Water'' (1962), his poised first feature about the triangle among a married couple and a young hitchhiker, earned an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. In America he directed ''Chinatown,'' one of the crowning achievements of Hollywood's most recent golden age. 
 He has a taste for potboiling Grand Guignol (''The Ninth Gate'') but won an Oscar for his most restrained film, the Holocaust drama ''The Pianist'' (2002). A terminal outsider -- ''a fugitive all my life,'' as he once put it -- he has navigated the tricky logistics of international co-productions, especially since his banishment from Hollywood, making films that are often defined by displacement and rootlessness (''Frantic,'' ''Bitter Moon''). 
 Journalists and biographers reflexively scour Mr. Polanski's life for clues to his art and vice versa. His ''violent life and times,'' Barbara Leaming argued in ''Polanski: The Filmmaker as Voyeur'' (1981), ''form the subtext of his cinema.'' Mr. Polanski is, to say the least, dismissive of this interpretive tack. In 2003 one question too many from Premiere magazine led him to cut short the interview: ''Whatever happens to you changes the result of your work. Even sometimes trivial things. Now I must stop. I've had it.''
 With a new film -- and new circumstances in his life -- the game of connect the dots continues. Based on ''The Ghost,'' a best-selling 2007 novel by Mr. Harris, ''The Ghost Writer'' unfolds from the point of view of a ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) hired to whip into shape the memoir of a former British prime minister (Pierce Brosnan), a Tony Blair-like American ally under investigation for war crimes. Watching this twisty thriller -- which for long stretches finds Mr. McGregor's character sequestered in a Martha's Vineyard beach house in the dead of winter, another one of Mr. Polanski's secluded heroes in another one of his restricted locations -- it is hard not to note that the film was completed by its director while confined to his own chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland. (He has been under house arrest since December.) 
 It's also tempting to observe that Mr. Polanski used a ghostwriter (the journalist Edward Behr) for his 1984 autobiography, ''Roman by Polanski.'' ''The Ghost Writer'' is Mr. Polanski's first post-exile film to be largely -- and pointedly -- set in the United States. Since he has not set foot on American soil in more than three decades, those dune-edged beaches are not, as we're supposed to believe, in Massachusetts. Exteriors were shot on the German coast; the palatial vacation home was built on a Berlin soundstage. 
 But there is another way to see Mr. Polanski in his films, and that is through his authorial presence. More than half of his features are adapted from existing texts, but much of his work retains a striking unity of theme and mood. ''His personality infiltrated it inevitably,'' Mr. Harris said of the script for ''The Ghost Writer,'' which he wrote with Mr. Polanski. 
 The film gives us a quintessentially Polanskian me-against-the-world setup, in which an isolated protagonist succumbs to increasing paranoia. In Mr. Polanski's movies paranoia can be a symptom of madness (''Repulsion'') or the only proof of sanity in a crazy world (''Rosemary's Baby''). Sometimes it appears to be both, as in ''The Tenant'' (1976). In that film, both a black comedy about French xenophobia and a split-identity psychodrama, Mr. Polanski plays the title character, a Pole who rents an apartment in Paris and comes to suspect that his neighbors are conspiring to turn him into its previous resident, a woman who threw herself out of her window. Mr. McGregor's unnamed character in ''The Ghost Writer'' is also haunted by his dead predecessor: the writer he's replacing drowned under mysterious circumstances. 
 Mr. Polanski's obsessions seem to have emerged fully formed. The series of short films he made in the late '50s and early '60s map out his universe in embryo. His first student film, ''Murder,'' stages in just over a minute a fatal stabbing by penknife: a killing without motive or context, rendered with startling detail and economy. Films like ''Teeth Smile,'' ''Break Up the Dance'' and ''The Fat and the Lean'' hint at the mind games and power plays to come. 
 From the start Mr. Polanski was a distinctive filmmaker with a penchant for extreme situations. The aura of violence and perversity that surrounded the films suited an enfant terrible who enjoyed notoriety. But the murder of his wife, besides shattering Mr. Polanski's life, turned this convenient master narrative into a sick joke. Describing the carnage at his rented Benedict Canyon home, the Satan worship of ''Rosemary's Baby'' fresh in their minds, journalists could not refrain from comparing it to a movie -- specifically a Roman Polanski movie. ''It was a scene as grisly as anything depicted in Polanski's film explorations of the dark and melancholy corners of the human character,'' Time magazine declared. 
 Roger Gunson, the prosecutor assigned to the statutory rape case, prepared for thetrial that never happened by taking in a retrospective of his films. ''Every Roman Polanski movie has a theme: corruption meeting innocence over water,'' he says in Marina Zenovich's 2008 documentary ''Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,'' noting that Mr. Polanski had seduced his under-age quarry in a Jacuzzi. 
 As glib as such connections can seem, they are not always unfounded. Especially in times of distress Mr. Polanski has been drawn to material that might seem personally difficult. His first film after Ms. Tate's death was an adaptation of ''Macbeth'' (1971), a blood-soaked tragedy that had many viewers fixating on the scene in which Macduff learns of the massacre of his family. Pauline Kael spoke for many critics when she wrote, ''One sees the Manson murders in this 'Macbeth' because the director put them there.'' 
 After leaving the United States, Mr. Polanski again turned his attention to a classic that suggested parallels with real-life circumstances. The young heroine of ''Tess,'' his adaptation of Hardy's ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles,'' is raped and cast out of society; the film starred the teenage Nastassja Kinski, who had reportedly been involved with Mr. Polanski since she was 15. Despite the provocative casting, some critics saw the film as an apology -- Tess does avenge herself -- and the sexual violence is shot with conspicuous, fog-shrouded discretion, in contrast to the lurid rape at the center of ''Rosemary's Baby.'' 
 The central ambiguity of ''Tess'' -- is the director identifying with Tess or her rapist or both? -- gets at the complex notion of victimhood that runs through Mr. Polanski's cinema, and through aspects of his biography, from Holocaust survivor to grief-stricken widower to accused rapist. There are plenty of victims and victimizers in his movies, but also plenty of victims turned victimizers: Tess, Catherine Deneuve's character in ''Repulsion'' and Sigourney Weaver's in ''Death and the Maiden.''
 Mr. Polanski's psychobiographers might do well to keep in mind a recurring tenet of his movies: Things are not always as they seem. Many have described the confined spaces in his films -- the apartments, boats, castles and islands that offer no escape -- as the visions of a man who spent his childhood in the walled-in ghetto of Krakow. Mr. Polanski has a more benign explanation. In a 2001 interview with the BBC he talked about his early love for Laurence Olivier's claustrophobic 1948 film ''Hamlet,'' connecting it to the intimacy of a Vermeer: ''I liked films which made you feel you are actually inside an interior, feeling virtually the fourth wall behind you, like in Dutch paintings.'' 
 It is in keeping with the unpredictable turns of Mr. Polanski's life that his current unhappy chapter should come after ''The Pianist,'' a stately late-career triumph that many considered a culminating work. More than a quarter century ago he wrote in ''Roman by Polanski,'' ''I am widely regarded, I know, as an evil, profligate dwarf.'' That caricature had faded away over the years, along with the stories of his brutal on-set perfectionism, replaced by a picture of a marginalized but respected industry elder whom journalists and collaborators have described as reticent and not especially prone to introspection. (He has been married for more than 20 years to the French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, with whom he has two children.) 
 Ronald Harwood, who won an Oscar for his screenplay of ''The Pianist,'' has been in regular contact with Mr. Polanski by telephone these past few months. 
 ''I ask him how he is, and he says he's fine,'' Mr. Harwood said. ''But I don't know how he is. No one really does.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths CARROLL, THOMAS SYLVESTER

 BODY:
CARROLL--Thomas Sylvester, 90, retired CEO of Lever Brothers, president and CEO emeritus of the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) and resident of New Canaan, CT for over sixty years, passed away February 1st, 2010. He was born October 1st, 1919 in Washington Heights, NY. A graduate of Catawba College in Salisbury, NC, Tom pursued graduate studies at MIT and received his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1947. He served during WWII with the U.S. Army Air Corps, advancing to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1947 Tom and Sidney G. Burke wed and together raised five sons. Tom derived both personal and professional fulfillment overseeing the expansion of the IESC, which was founded in 1964 by David Rockefeller and Sol Linowitz as a "business person's Peace Corps," whose mission is to promote private enterprise in developing countries. 
During his tenure from 1981-1993 as president and CEO, the group experienced its greatest growth, to date, and tripled the number of projects undertaken by its volunteers worldwide. Prior to leading the IESC, Tom served as president and CEO of Lever Brothers, from April 1967 until February 1980 when he announced his retirement. He continued as a director of the company and chairman of the finance committee of the board and as a director of Unilever, U.S. until 1983. Tom was trustee emeritus of the Museum of Modern Art, advising the museum in its economic development. He was also a trustee of Catawba College, a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, director of Associates of Harvard Business School, former president of the Harvard Business School Association, chairman of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, member of the board of directors of American Airlines, Interpace Corporation and Associated Dry Goods Corporation. From 1964-1966 Tom served as Police Commissioner in New Canaan, and was an Honorary Deputy Fire Commissioner, NYFD. A lifelong athlete, Tom boxed in his youth and attended Catawba College on a football scholarship. Tom was a tennis champion at both the New Canaan Field and the Country Club of New Canaan. As a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club, Tom was ranked third nationally in 1995-1996 in men's singles squash (75+) by the United States Squash Racquets Association. While raising his family he became an avid skier, returning to Alta, Utah annually from 1965-1999. He skied his last run in the shadow of Mount Baldy at seventy-nine. In 1981, Tom Carroll and Caroline E. Wheelwright married; she predeceased him in 2005. One son, Thomas Jeremiah also predeceased him, in 1973. Tom will be deeply missed by his four sons: Jeffrey, James, Matthew and Charles; favorite daughters-in-law: Lynda, Nancy, and Penny; nine grandchildren: Elizabeth, Julia, Nicholas, Clara, Finn, Amanda, Thomas "TJ" Jeremiah, Liam and Dylan; and two stepchildren: George and Sophia Wheelwright. The son of Irish immigrants and the youngest of six fun loving siblings, Tom made the most of his opportunities and, in return, gave generously to many people, rich and poor, around the globe. Tom was and remains a preeminent example of his favorite saying, "it is better to be born lucky than rich". A celebration of Tom's life will be held at 2pm on March 21st at the New Canaan Country Club. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that those so inclined send donations to either The Thomas S. Carroll Executive Symposium Endowment at Catawba College, Development Office, 2300 West Innes St., Salisbury, NC 28144, or International Executive Service Corp., 1900 M Street NW, Washington, DC 20036.

THE NEWS Before the city could finish digging out from the two feet of snow that fell last weekend, Washington was hit with another blizzard, making the winter of 2009-10 the snowiest on record in the capital. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The one-two punch made for a lost week of snow days in Washington and its suburbs, with schools closed and the federal government largely shut down. Throughout the mid-Atlantic region, seasonal snowfall records fell as municipalities struggled to clear roads and utilities battled to restore power to thousands of shivering customers. 
 THE NEWSRajendra K. Pachauri and the United Nations group he heads, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced accusations of scientific sloppiness and potential conflicts of interest from climate skeptics, right-leaning politicians and even some scientists.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The group shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. Opponents have sought to tarnish the panel's landmark study, which said that the Earth's climate was warming and human activity was largely to blame. But the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists is that the report's findings are on target.
 THE NEWS Greece's financial problems roiled economic markets for days because of worries that the country might default on $28 billion in debt. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Prime Minister George A. Papandreou said the country was at the ''edge of the cliff.'' Other European Union nations feared Greece's huge budget deficit could threaten the stability of the euro currency. So, with gritted teeth, especially in Germany, other European nations agreed to bail Greece out with loans if necessary. while it gets its finances in order. Analysts said Portugal, Spain or Ireland might be next to falter.
 THE NEWS Fewer children would be given drugs for bipolar disorder, but more would get behavioral therapy for problems like excessive aggression or binge eating, under proposed revisions to the standard manual for diagnosing mental disorders, known as the D.S.M.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Changes to the manual are always controversial because of the wide implications for doctors, drug makers, the courts and society at large: ''The more disorders you put in, the more people get labels, and the higher the risk that some get inappropriate treatment,'' said Dr. Michael Frist of Columbia University. 
 THE NEWS In a pugnacious speech on the anniversary of the revolution that brought down the shah, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Iran had succeeded in enriching uranium to 20 percent, and could go all the way to bomb-grade enrichment if it wanted to.
 BEHIND THE NEWS A sweeping crackdown kept a lid on protesters who say Mr. Ahmadinejad's re-election last year was rigged, so he spoke to a friendly crowd. But the speech won no plaudits abroad, where diplomats said Iran had breached its promises to the International Atomic Energy Agency; they called for tighter sanctions.

HEADLINE: In Detroit, Is There Life After The Big 3?

BYLINE: By PETE ENGARDIO

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 CRUISE the blighted streets that shoot off in either direction from 8 Mile Road, and the scars of the automotive crisis abound. ''For sale'' signs adorn the front of long-shuttered metal, paint and tool-and-die shops. And at factories still in business, the small number of cars in the parking lots testify that the shops are working below capacity. 
 But pull into the bustling headquarters of W Industries, a compound of imposing black structures at 8 Mile and Hoover Street, and you'll encounter a more hopeful vision of Detroit's future. Once an exclusive supplier to the auto industry, this machine tool and parts company is rolling in new business.
 In one section of the cavernous shop floor, machinists use powerful lasers to slice thick steel plates. They're making parts for Humvees and Stryker combat vehicles destined for Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 Elsewhere, they are assembling a 60,000-pound apparatus for testing the Orion space module by simulating the violent vibrations of liftoff. Other workers are finishing a steel mold that will be used to make 70-foot-long roof sections of Airbus A350 passenger jets.
 Dozens of Michigan manufacturers like W Industries are discovering there is indeed life beyond the auto industry. Over the last two years, multinationals and start-ups alike have been coming to the state to build, buy or design a hodgepodge of products, whether aircraft parts, solar cells, or batteries for electric cars. 
 In September, for instance, NTR, a solar energy company from Ireland, awarded contracts to two Detroit-area auto suppliers, including the race-car engine developer McLaren Performance Technologies, to make components for thousands of SunCatcher solar dishes.
 ''It should be no surprise we went to Detroit,'' says Jim Barry, NTR's chief executive. ''The standard of manufacturing in the automotive industry is extraordinarily high, and that is the only place you can find such a concentration of skills.'' 
 Of course, nobody expects Michigan to regain anytime soon all of the estimated 216,000 auto-related jobs lost in the past decade. Most of the new projects create 50 to 100 jobs at a time, while auto plant closures have shed tens of thousands.
 ''You could bring a whole new industry in here, and it may replace one auto plant,'' says David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor. 
 THE economic impact of the new industries is also hard to gauge: Michigan has few statistics on revenue from industries like clean technology and aerospace. Much of the new work, moreover, is limited to machining and developing prototypes. Mass production will most likely head elsewhere to save costs or to be closer to end customers. In short, the full payoff of the investments outside the auto industry is unlikely to be felt for several more years. 
 ''What we really are talking about is R&D, pilot projects and early-stage production,'' says Peter Adriaens, a University of Michigan entrepreneurship professor tracking the trend. ''There is virtually nothing we can do to keep large-scale production here.''
 Still, Mr. Cole and Mr. Adriaens say, the opportunities for auto suppliers are huge and could leave the state with a healthier, more diverse industrial base.
 For example, virtually all of the $50 million in engineering projects at the Detroit campus of Ricardo Inc., a British engineering services firm, are for products like remotely piloted military aircraft, construction equipment and lithium-ion batteries. And Global Wind Systems, a developer of wind farms that is based in the Detroit suburb of Novi, says it is working with 18 local suppliers to design next-generation turbines to be assembled nearby in 2012.
 General Electric, meanwhile, is investing $100 million in a 1,000-worker research and manufacturing facility for wind turbines outside Detroit, and Aernnova, a Spanish company that is a supplier to Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier, is planning an engineering center in Ann Arbor that will eventually employ 600. New plants to make lithium-ion batteries are in the pipeline from A123, Johnson Controls and LG Chemical. 
 ''There is a lot of business out there that is really suited to Detroit's automotive skills,'' says Edward Walker, the chief executive of W Industries, a privately held company.
 Among all the projects, the biggest is in Wixom, Mich., just northwest of Detroit. There, a mothballed Ford plant that had turned out millions of Thunderbirds, Town Cars and GTs is getting a $1.5 billion facelift. Two investors -- Extreme Power of Austin, Tex., and Clairvoyant Energy of Santa Barbara, Calif. -- plan to hire 4,000 workers by late 2011 to make solar panels and battery systems for utilities. 
 ''As the alternative-energy space builds out, we expect these plants will create a lot of opportunities for Michigan suppliers,'' says Greg Main, the chief executive of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the state's investment promotion agency. Mr. Main estimates that at least 100 auto suppliers already have secured contracts in other industries and that at least 250 have bid for work.
 Federal and state tax credits, loan guarantees and grants certainly help stimulate investment. But the main allure of the Detroit area is its ability to quickly turn designs into workable products that can be economically mass-produced. The region remains the country's premier precision manufacturing base, with 2,500 auto suppliers and tens of thousands of highly skilled, underemployed mechanical engineers, machinists and factory managers. 
 ''We have the best manufacturing resources on the planet here in Michigan,'' says Chris Long, the founder and chief executive of Global Wind Systems. ''We just need to get aligned.'' 
 IN 1981, W Industries was founded by Robert Walker, Edward's father, to make wooden crates used to ship car windshields and windows. It eventually expanded into a wide range of machine tools and metal parts for car frames and bodies. 
 The younger Mr. Walker, a 42-year-old with a fondness for wearing black, started working on the shop floor as a teenager and took the helm in 1993. To give the company a distinctive look, he adopted a bold red ''W'' logo and had all the buildings redone in red and black.
 The only way W Industries could grow, Mr. Walker soon concluded, was to diversify. He started with military contracts. By law, most of the work must be done on American soil. And by manufacturing within Detroit's city limits, W Industries benefits from federal policies requiring that a certain portion of military contracts be given to companies in depressed areas. 
 Another lure is abundant and cheap industrial space. Mr. Walker says he spent around $20 a square foot to buy and upgrade factories from bankrupt auto suppliers, about one-fifth of the cost of new buildings. 
 Since landing its first military contract in 2004, the company has secured jobs to make hundreds of heavy steel parts for the frames, bodies and gun mounts of vehicles like the Stryker and the mine-resistant Cougar, both made by General Dynamics. Demand for such vehicles surged as the military sought to replace Humvees, which proved vulnerable to roadside bombs.
 Such work ''requires a different mind-set and an entirely different way of operating your business,'' Mr. Walker says. 
 Rather than cranking out high volumes of parts for years, jobs come in small batches and are highly customized. Each month, for example, W Industries builds a dozen 25,000-pound frames for rough-terrain military vehicles that the Kalmar Corporation, based in San Antonio, builds for the Army. 
 To win such business, W Industries has spent $50 million on modern machinery since 2006. The mold for the Airbus sections, which it is building for Spirit AeroSystems of Kansas, is being made with one of the world's largest computer-controlled machine tools. It moves along a 200-foot-long rail shaving steel to create a super-polished surface. Spirit selected W Industries largely because it offered ''an attractive combination of fabrication and expertise,'' says Ken Evans, a Spirit spokesman. 
 W Industries also got the Orion simulator project in part because it was one of the few companies in the United States with the right equipment. The Orion space program aims to send human explorers to the moon by 2020 and then to Mars and beyond. But NASA hasn't built a space capsule since the Apollo program ended in 1975. 
 Five years ago, W Industries had $15 million in annual sales. This year, it expects at least $150 million, two-thirds of it from military and aerospace contractors. It has bought three old factories in the area and is looking for more, and it plans to double its work force to 500 by 2011.
 Dowding Industries, a family-owned company in Eaton Rapids, is also wagering its future on diversification. It was founded in 1965 as a tool-and-die shop for Oldsmobile and later expanded into metal auto parts. The company branched out into tractor and rail car parts in the 1990s, as the Big Three pinched costs to compete with overseas rivals and ''started getting real brutal'' on suppliers, says Jeff Metts, Dowding's president.
 He said that after Dowding had invested in new machine tools and perfected a part, the work was often shifted to China six months later. ''There seemed to be a real effort to remove our profit,'' Mr. Metts recalls. 
 In 2006, he attended a wind-power trade show in Los Angeles. ''We were really shocked at how big this industry was becoming,'' he says. That year, Dowding won a $5 million contract from Clipper Turbine Works of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Other wind customers followed. 
 After the recent recession, in which it laid off 130 of its 280 workers, Dowding made a bigger bet on wind, forming a venture with MAG Industrial Automation Systems in Sterling Heights to develop tools for turbine components. 
 MAG also makes machines used to fabricate carbon-composite airframes for planes like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In October, the venture will introduce a system that Mr. Metts says can make better-performing wind turbine hubs in one-fifth the time of current methods.
 The next goal is a machine for carbon-composite blades that, he says, will be 30 percent lighter than fiberglass blades and last 20 years or longer. Mr. Metts says Dowding has commitments from several turbine makers, and he sees opportunities to use similar machines and technologies for bridges, expressways and ships -- for which production methods and materials haven't changed much in decades.
 ''This will be as big as the shift from metal to plastics,'' Mr. Metts says.
 The need to turn prototypes into real products is what lured NTR to the Detroit area. The company, based in Dublin, is installing the first 60 of its SunCatcher dishes, which cost $50,000 to $60,000 each, in Phoenix. If all of its solar-plant deals with California and Texas utilities are completed, it expects to sell 65,000 of them over the next two years.
 In 2008, NTR's manufacturing arm, Stirling Energy Systems, hired Tower Automotive in Novi to develop modules with mirrors that will reflect the sun's energy. It also enlisted McLaren in Livonia to help design and build the motorized units that will convert concentrated sunlight into electricity. Founded in 1969 by Bruce McLaren, the New Zealand-born auto racer, and bought in 2003 by Linamar of Canada, the firm is best known for developing turbocharged engines for race cars. 
 Five years ago, all of McLaren's business was with carmakers. Now, nearly a third is in developing motorized devices for the solar and wind industries. McLaren's engineering team redesigned the SunCatcher engine and each of its 100 parts to make them more efficient, less expensive and easier to mass-produce. 
 ''We put everything on a wall,'' recalls Phil Guys, McLaren's president. ''We got 500 suggestions from engineers.'' 
 McLaren has shipped its first batch of power-conversion units to Stirling and is developing new prototypes. 
 A BIG question is whether the new work will sustain Detroit's manufacturing ecosystem if auto assembly keeps migrating elsewhere. As suppliers close, more managers and engineers could move away. 
 To illustrate how difficult that talent would be to replace, Bud Kimmel, vice president for business development at W Industries, points out Jason Sobieck. A 30-year-old machining whiz sporting a green tattoo, gray T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Sobieck manages the Spirit and Orion projects. 
 ''Jason is like an artist,'' Mr. Kimmel says. ''We built our whole program around him.''
 Mr. Sobieck began work at 17 at a small Detroit welding shop. He then worked for tooling companies, where he learned to program automated systems and manage projects. ''These skills really aren't taught in school,'' Mr. Sobieck says, dragging on a cigarette. ''This is a trade you learn on the shop floor.'' 
 That's one reason that W Industries wants to snap up as many good machinists and engineers as it can afford.
 ''If we don't re-engage the automotive workers soon in major programs,'' Mr. Kimmel says, ''this set of skills will be lost.''

HEADLINE: A Sin We Sip Instead of Smoke?

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN. 
Mark Bittman writes the Minimalist column for the The Times and is the author, most recently, of ''Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating.''

 BODY:
Is soda the new tobacco?
 In their critics' eyes, producers of sugar-sweetened drinks are acting a lot like the tobacco industry of old: marketing heavily to children, claiming their products are healthy or at worst benign, and lobbying to prevent change. The industry says there are critical differences: in moderate quantities soda isn't harmful, nor is it addictive.
 The problem is that at roughly 50 gallons per person per year, our consumption of soda, not to mention other sugar-sweetened beverages, is far from moderate, and appears to be an important factor in the rise in childhood obesity. This increase is at least partly responsible for a rise in what can no longer be called ''adult onset'' diabetes -- because more and more children are now developing it.
 Attention is being paid: Last week, the Obama administration announced a plan to ban candy and sweetened beverages from schools. A campaign against childhood obesity will be led by the first lady, Michelle Obama. And a growing number of public health advocates are pushing for even more aggressive actions, urging that soda be treated like tobacco: with taxes, warning labels and a massive public health marketing campaign, all to discourage consumption. 
 A tax on soda was one option considered to help pay for health care reform (the Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that a 3-cent tax on each 12-ounce sugared soda would raise $51.6 billion over a decade), and President Obama told Men's Health magazine last fall that such a tax is ''an idea that we should be exploring. There's no doubt that our kids drink way too much soda.''
 But with all the junk food and U.F.O.'s (unidentifiable food-like objects) out there, why soda? Why a tax? And, most important, would it work?
 To the beverage industry, the idea is not worth considering. Susan Neely, the president of the American Beverage Association, acknowledges that obesity is a problem but says: ''If you're trying to manage people being overweight you need a variety of behavior changes to achieve energy balance -- it can't be done by eliminating one food from the diet.''
 Even if soda consumption were to drop, say critics of the tax, a drop in childhood obesity isn't guaranteed. ''Simply pricing one product higher,'' says Derek Yach, a senior vice president of global health policy at PepsiCo, the big food company that has spoken the most seriously about building a healthier portfolio, ''would lead to unknown effects on total dietary consumption. It may even lead to worse situations: people may stop spending on one food and eat more of another, so taxing high levels of sugar may lead to eating higher levels of fat.''
 Still, the idea of a special tax on soda, similar to those on tobacco, gasoline and alcoholic beverages, is attracting more interest. Advocates of a tax note that sugared beverages are the No. 1 source of calories in the American diet, representing 7 percent of the average person's caloric intake, according to government surveys, and up to 10 percent for children and teenagers. These calories, they point out, are worse than useless -- they're empty, and contribute to a daily total that is already too high.
 ''What you want,'' says Kelly Brownell, director of Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, ''is to reverse the fact that healthy food is too expensive and unhealthy food is too cheap, and the soda tax is a start. Unless food marketing changes, it's hard to believe that anything else can work.''
 Advocates argue that a soda tax would reduce consumption and pay for anti-obesity campaigns. In an opinion piece in The New England Journal of Medicine last year, Dr. Brownell and Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C. and former New York City health commissioner, estimated that in New York State alone a penny-per-ounce soda tax would raise $1.2 billion annually.
 Small excise taxes on soda are already in place in Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia, and Chicago imposes a 3 percent retail tax on soft drinks. Soda taxes were proposed in at least 12 other states in 2009, though none were approved. Mississippi is considering legislation that would tax the syrup used to sweeten soda; the mayor of Philadelphia is weighing a tax on soda and other sugar-sweetened drinks, and Gov. David Paterson of New York has indicated that he will recommend a penny-per-ounce tax on sugared beverages in his 2011 budget.
 The penny-per-ounce tax, favored by Dr. Brownell and others, would produce a significant increase in retail costs: the 12-pack of Coke on sale for $2.99 would go for $4.43 and a 75-cent can would rise to 87 cents. These increases, Dr. Brownell estimates, would reduce the annual per capita consumption of soda by more than 11 gallons, to 38.5 gallons. ''And the revenue,'' he says, ''could be used to subsidize fruits and vegetables, fund obesity prevention programs for children and home economic classes in schools, and more.''
 The model, clearly, is tobacco. Dr. Frieden, who promoted a soda tax when he was a health commissioner, sees further parallels between soda and tobacco: ''There are aspects of the food industry that are reminiscent of tobacco -- the sowing of doubt where there's no reasonable doubt, funding of front groups, use of so-called experts, claims that new products which are safer for consumers are available, and the claim that they are not marketing to children.''
 The public war against tobacco has worked, if imperfectly: Americans smoke at half the rate they once did, half of all smokers have quit, and the tobacco companies finance strong antismoking campaigns.
 In the case of tobacco, the health risks of smoking were clear. But the beverage industry contends that science does not back up the assertion that childhood obesity is even partly caused by soda consumption, and has sought to make the discussion about personal choice and freedom. ''Soda has calories, and food with calories causes people to put on weight when consumed in excess,'' says J. Justin Wilson a self-described ''libertarian consumer advocate'' and senior research analyst for the Center for Consumer Freedom, an industry-sponsored advocacy group. ''But there is no unique link between soda and obesity.''
 Besides, says Ms. Neely, the industry is taking measures: ''The beverage industry supports real solutions to obesity and continues to step up to do its part. We've removed full-calorie soft drinks from schools across the country and, in support of Mrs. Obama's initiative, will place the full calories for our products on the front of our containers.''
 Perhaps the process of reducing the drinking of sweetened beverages need not be so contentious. ''There are parts of the industry that want to be constructive'' says Dr. Frieden. ''Big Food doesn't have to become the next tobacco.''
 With this Dr. Yach agrees, and though he clearly thinks a soda tax won't work, he'd like to see a greater government role. ''The overall governmental voice and investment in solutions required has been stunningly weak. They need to forcibly say, 'The fundamental issue is one of calorie balance, and here's what you need to do.' ''
 The problem, says Dr. Frieden, is that, ''Obesity is a major health problem that's getting worse, and it's clear that exhorting individuals to eat less and exercise more is not going to turn things around.''
 It may be time to try something a little more forceful.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
If electric cars have any future in the United States, this may be the city where they arrive first.
 The San Francisco building code will soon be revised to require that new structures be wired for car chargers. Across the street from City Hall, some drivers are already plugging converted hybrids into a row of charging stations. 
 In nearby Silicon Valley, companies are ordering workplace charging stations in the belief that their employees will be first in line when electric cars begin arriving in showrooms. And at the headquarters of Pacific Gas and Electric, utility executives are preparing ''heat maps'' of neighborhoods that they fear may overload the power grid in their exuberance for electric cars. 
 ''There is a huge momentum here,'' said Andrew Tang, an executive at P.G.& E. 
 As automakers prepare to introduce the first mass-market electric cars late this year, it is increasingly evident that the cars will get their most serious tryout in just a handful of places. In cities like San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and San Diego, a combination of green consciousness and enthusiasm for new technology seems to be stirring public interest in the cars.
 The first wave of electric car buying is expected to begin around December, when Nissan introduces the Leaf, a five-passenger electric car that will have a range of 100 miles on a fully charged battery and be priced for middle-class families.
 Several thousand Leafs made in Japan will be delivered to metropolitan areas in California, Arizona, Washington state, Oregon and Tennessee. Around the same time, General Motors will introduce the Chevrolet Volt, a vehicle able to go 40 miles on electricity before its small gasoline engine kicks in.
 ''This is the game-changer for our industry,'' said Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's president and chief executive. He predicted that 10 percent of the cars sold would be electric vehicles by 2020.
 Utilities are gearing up to cooperate with the automakers, a first for the two industries, and governments on the West Coast are focusing intently on the coming issues. Price and tax incentives need to be worked out. Locations must be found for charging stations. And local electrical grids may need reinforcement.
 The California Public Utilities Commission, whose headquarters are in San Francisco, has brought together utilities, automakers and charging station companies in an urgent effort to write the new rules of the road.
 Much of the attention on electric cars has been on the vehicles' design, cost and performance. But success or failure could turn on more mundane matters, like the time it takes car buyers to navigate a municipal bureaucracy to have charging stations installed in their homes.
 When the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Michael R. Peevey, leased an electric Mini Cooper, he said, it took six weeks of visits by installers and inspectors before he could plug in his new car at home.
 ''It was really drawn out and frustrating and certainly is not workable on a mass basis,'' Mr. Peevey said.
 Such issues are being hashed out here first. The San Francisco area is home not only to a population of early technology adopters but to companies like Coulomb Technologies and Better Place that are developing the networks and software to allow utilities to manage how cars are charged. 
 Tesla Motors, a Silicon Valley company that makes electric cars, says it has already sold 150 of its $109,000 Roadsters in the Bay Area. One customer bought the sleek sports car on the spot after a test drive.
 ''We asked him how he heard of Tesla and why he bought the car,'' said Rachel Konrad, a Tesla spokeswoman. ''He said, 'Well, three other guys on my block have them.' '' 
 In Berkeley, a town known for its environmental sensibility, one out of five cars sold today is a hybrid Prius. If electric cars are adopted that broadly in the next few years, problems could ensue.
 ''If you just allow willy-nilly random charging, are we going to have neighborhood blackouts?'' asked Mr. Tang, the utility executive. He said a single car could consume three times as much electricity as a typical San Francisco home. 
 Mr. Tang is working to make sure that does not happen by monitoring where electric cars are sold in Northern California. And later this year P.G.&E. will lead a ''smart charging'' pilot project, connecting 200 cars to special charging stations that let utilities control the electrical demand at a given moment.
 Robert Hayden, the clean transportation adviser for San Francisco, said the city hopes to have 60 charging stations installed in public garages by year's end, with a thousand more available across the Bay Area in 2011. And in Oregon, an advisory group is working on charging stations and related issues.
 To avoid problems in areas with high car concentrations, utility executives said they would encourage people to charge their vehicles at night or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand.
 ''We are trying to be proactive about how to make sure that the transformers that serve these homes and neighborhoods are robust enough,'' said Doug Kim, an executive at Southern California Edison, which serves Los Angeles.
 Mr. Kim said the popularity of electric vehicles ''will be a function of a lot of different things: the state of the economy, how many people can actually afford to buy the cars and the price of gasoline -- how high does it have to be?''
 Some transportation experts are skeptical that electric vehicles will catch on anywhere in the country, in large part because the batteries and the installation of home recharging units are expensive. 
 Dan Sperling, the director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, estimated that a typical electric car battery would cost the automaker $12,000, and a 240-volt charging unit would cost a household at least $1,500.
 Without huge subsidies, ''the reality is, these electric vehicles are not going to sweep the industry and become a major share of the market for a very long time,'' Mr. Sperling said. 
 Despite such skepticism, Washington is putting considerable money into the effort, including billions of dollars in loans to Ford, Nissan and Tesla Motors. 
 Under last year's stimulus package, nearly $200 million will support Nissan's introduction of the Leaf by permitting the installation of 13,000 charging stations around cities in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona and Tennessee in the next year or so. (Nissan plans to build the Leaf in Tennessee eventually.)
 If electric cars do take off, consumers and society could benefit. Battery-powered motors are more efficient than gasoline engines. They cost drivers on average only 2.5 cents a mile for fuel, less than a third of the cost for a highly efficient gasoline car, according to proponents.
 The Energy Department says electric cars produce less of the emissions linked to climate change than traditional vehicles, though how much less depends on the source of power on the local electricity grid.
 Before the first Nissan Leafs and Chevrolet Volts reach the show room, an electric car infrastructure is getting a test drive in the Bay Area, in a limited way. 
 Google, which is talking to automakers about using its PowerMeter energy management software, has already become something of an electric transportation hub. At Google's Mountain View headquarters, a handful of employees drive to work in Tesla Roadsters, and more drive a fleet of modified Priuses that Google owns. The employees pull into carports that are covered with solar panels and plug their cars into the 100 available charging stations.
 Nearby, in downtown San Jose, the city has reserved street parking for electric vehicles and installed charging stations. Nearby, at Adobe Systems' headquarters, an executive showed off a dozen charging stations in the parking garage. Eighteen more will be installed this year.
 ''No one wants to be left behind,'' said Richard Lowenthal, chief executive of Coulomb Technologies. ''We're preparing for an onslaught of demand.''

PERSON: Phillip Martin 

HEADLINE: Phillip Martin, 83; Led His Tribe to Wealth

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Phillip Martin, a former chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, who guided his tribe from grinding poverty in the red clay hills of east central Mississippi to become proprietor of one of the state's leading business empires, died Feb. 4 in Jackson, Miss. He was 83 and lived in Philadelphia, Miss.
 The cause was a stroke, his niece Natasha Phillips said. 
 When Chief Martin was first elected in 1979, the Choctaws in Mississippi were still relegated to the hardscrabble existence that had repressed them for generations. In 1831, a year after passage of the federal Indian Removal Act, most of the Choctaws were forced to walk what became known as the Trail of Tears to resettlement in the Oklahoma Territories. Over the decades, those Choctaws who remained in Mississippi eked out livings through sharecropping and unskilled labor. Into the early 1970s unemployment on the reservation stood at nearly 75 percent. 
 Chief Martin changed all that, and the turnaround was all the more remarkable because it was well under way before the rise of tribal casinos after passage of the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
 ''He was truly one of the first and most important leaders in the drive for tribal self-determination,'' Joseph Kalt, co-director of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, said in an interview. ''Chief Martin led this movement in which first the Mississippi Choctaw and then many other Indian nations have said: 'We're just going to run everything ourselves. We're building our own schools, our own police department, our own health program, our own economy.' '' 
 Chief Martin, who was tribal leader until 2007, first lobbied successfully for government grants to develop an 80-acre industrial park on the reservation. In 1981 he persuaded officials in Philadelphia, Miss., to issue bonds to attract the American Greetings card company to the industrial park. He brought a satellite-imaging laboratory to the park. Under his leadership the tribe started Chahta Enterprise, a company that produces wiring for automakers and other electronic systems, and a construction company.
 The tribe opened the Silver Star Hotel and Casino in 1994 and a second casino, the Golden Moon, in 2002. Today they form the heart of Pearl River Resort, which includes a theme park and a golf club and is the largest and most profitable Choctaw enterprise. In recent years, according to the Harvard project, the businesses have been generating about $180 million a year in wages alone. More than 7,000 people are employed, and the unemployment rate on the reservation has plunged to about 4 percent. (The national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in January.)
 ''Every Choctaw who could and wanted to work has had a job,'' Professor Kalt said, ''and thousands of non-Indians are working for the tribal government and the tribal businesses.'' Between 1985 and 2000, the professor added, ''life expectancy in the tribe rose 20 years.'' 
 The transformation could also be seen in neighborhoods near the casinos, where government-issue cinderblock houses have given way to suburban homes. The chief also established a scholarship fund that pays full tuition for all students from the tribe who are accepted to college.
 Born on March 13, 1926, Phillip Martin was the third of six children of Willie and Mary Martin. His father was a janitor for the local office of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.
 With his father's government paycheck, surviving the Depression was not as difficult for the family as it was for most other Choctaws -- until a hit-and-run driver killed Willie Martin. Struggling on a welfare check, Phillip's mother sent Phillip to a Cherokee boarding school in North Carolina when he was 13. He enlisted in the Army at 19, joined the Air Force after the war and was a staff sergeant and a radar technician when discharged in 1955. 
 After training as an electrician under the G.I. Bill, Mr. Martin returned to the reservation, where he met and married Bonnie Bell, a Choctaw. She survives him, as do two daughters, Deborah Lewis and Patricia Gibson; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. 
 ''We decided if we were going to live here we should try to do something for ourselves,'' Chief Martin said at a conference sponsored by the federal Administration for Native Americans in 1986. ''Our success has changed the attitudes not only of the Choctaw but of our neighbors.''
