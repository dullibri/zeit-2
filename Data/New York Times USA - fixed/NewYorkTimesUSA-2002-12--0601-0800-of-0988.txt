HEADLINE: Blair for President 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
With Al Gore now out of the presidential race, everyone is giving the Democrats advice on who their candidate should be. All I know is that whoever the Democrats choose needs to keep in mind a few basic rules that Democrats have forgotten in recent years. 
 Rule #1: People listen through their stomachs. The key to the success of any presidential candidate is to convey to voters -- in a way they can feel in their gut -- that you as a leader know what world they're living in. George Bush Sr. lost to Bill Clinton because he failed to convey to voters in their gut that he knew what world they were living in -- a world of rising economic insecurity. 
 Mr. Clinton's campaign conveyed through one phrase, "It's the economy, stupid," that he knew exactly what world people were living in; and because of that, they were ready to overlook his foibles. Connect with people's gut concerns and they'll go anywhere with you -- without asking for the details. Don't connect, and you'll never be able to show people enough details to get them to follow.
George W. Bush has conveyed to Americans in their gut that he understands exactly what world they're living in now -- a world threatened by terrorism in which, as the former N.S.C. adviser Sandy Berger put it, "national security is now personal security." In this new world, Mr. Bush has been a warrior without mercy. No Democratic leader has -- yet -- forged such a gut connection with the American people on this issue. 
Rule #2: Never put yourself in a position where you succeed only if your country fails. The Democrats can't just wait for Mr. Bush to fail in Iraq, or hope the economy collapses, and assume they will benefit. People want to hear a positive alternative agenda. There can be a hard-nosed Democratic alternative. It is one that would say, "Yes, let's win the war on terrorism, but that requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses all our vulnerabilities and levels with the American people."
Right now the Bush bumper sticker reads: "You Can Have It All: Guns, Butter, War With Iraq, Tax Cuts & Humvees." This is nonsense. America has never won a war without the public's being enlisted and summoned to sacrifice. Is there a Democrat ready to push for a crash oil conservation program and development of renewable energy alternatives -- that would also respond to European anger over Kyoto? Is there a Democrat ready to take on our absurd farm subsidies and textile tariffs that help keep countries like Pakistan poor by keeping them hooked on aid, not trade? Is there a Democrat ready to take on the far-right Bush forces, which are now trying to undermine all U.S. support for global population controls? (Just what we need: more failed states with exploding populations.)
Is there a Democrat ready to say we don't need more long-term tax cuts, which will only produce chronic large deficits that will reduce resources for both homeland security and Head Start? And our economy doesn't need more short-term tax stimulus either -- it needs a successful war on terrorism. The economy is recovering slowly on its own. What's holding it back now are fears about terrorism and war with Iraq, which keep oil prices high and investment low. The minute those are resolved, you will see consumers ready to spend and companies ready to invest. 
Rule #3: Get a candidate people like. I don't know George Bush, and I do not like his domestic policies. But I find him hard to dislike. The "likability factor" is hugely underestimated in politics.
Rule #4: Get a candidate who can give a fireside chat. In these confusing times, people crave a leader who can explain why we're doing what we're doing and how it will lead to a better world. That is what the Democrats need. Mr. Bush conveys a lot of sincerity, but he lacks the emotional or intellectual depth to really reassure people. I'm convinced that one reason for his high poll ratings is projection: We desperately want to believe that he knows what he is doing, and that he is always acting in the best interests of the nation -- and not on naked political considerations -- because if he isn't, we're all sunk.
Right now there is only one Democrat who could live up to all these rules: the British prime minister, Tony Blair. Maybe the Democrats should give him a green card. He's tough on national security, he has an alternative global vision, people like him and he is a beautiful, reassuring speaker. He's Bill Clinton without baggage. I'd say he's a natural.

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE CONSTITUENTS; 
Black and White Doubt Their Senator's Sincerity

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss., Dec. 17 

 BODY:
At Sylvia's Annex Restaurant, the closest thing to a town square in Senator Trent Lott's hometown, reactions to his latest apology, like so many other things, divide along racial lines.
 Sitting in a booth deciding on what to eat -- salmon fritters or pork chops, or maybe the catfish? -- Frank L. Borden, who is white, said he was tired of Mr. Lott's repeated mea culpas. 
 "It upsets me to hear it over and over," said Mr. Borden, a programmer at the Ingalls shipyard. "Five times now? And now he says he's for affirmative action. He's definitely doing a lot of backpedaling. I hate that he's conforming to whatever he wants people to think that he is." 
Mr. Borden's wife, Susan, said: "He's been a segregationist for 20 years. He should just stand up and admit that's what he believes."
Out behind the kitchen, meanwhile, Peggy Carter, a black cook taking a smoke break, thought differently of Mr. Lott's interview on Monday night on Black Entertainment Television. "What's the difference between this month and last month?" Ms. Carter, of Moss Point, said of his apologies. "I can forgive someone if they're sincere. But I doubt very seriously that he is."
Loraine Houser, another black woman working in the kitchen, said: "There's a lot of things in my life that I've changed, and I know I've changed. But he said he 'believed' he'd changed. Even now he's not sure?"
The differing views in Sylvia's show just how complicated Mr. Lott's position has become as he fights to keep his job as Senate Republican leader. A day after his fifth apology for remarks viewed as racially insensitive, some whites in Pascagoula were beginning to bridle at Mr. Lott's repeated efforts to win forgiveness. But at the same time the senator did not seem to be winning over many blacks in his hometown, a largely blue-collar port city that is about 29 percent black and 65 percent white.
To be sure, the racial lines are not uniform. Today, in Jackson, white and black Republicans including Amy Tuck, the lieutenant governor, who is white, and Yvonne Brown, the mayor of the Delta town Tchula, who is black, held a rally for Mr. Lott, saying they accepted his apology and pleading for him to remain as Republican leader.
They said their communities had benefited from his influence in Washington and they cited his efforts to help bring a new Nissan plant to Canton, a largely black town. 
But Mr. Lott has long been a divisive figure here, and that does not appear to be changing.
Many whites have viewed him as a political superman, able to bring to the Gulf Coast giant defense contracts and road and bridge projects the way other lawmakers boast of putting up stoplights.
"If he gets out, we're going to lose a lot of our little perks down this-a-way," said Clyde Bosarge, a white retired commercial fisherman who lives blocks from Mr. Lott and put up a sign on his lawn: "We still love you Trent."
Mr. Borden, the shipyard programmer, said, "He's done incredible things for that shipyard." The shipyard was recently bought by Northrop Grumman, and it still employs close to 11,000, he said. By contrast, International Paper closed an old plant not long ago, as did Rohm & Haas, the chemical company.
"You'd see for-sale signs on everybody's houses if the shipyard closed," Ms. Borden said.
Many black Mississippians, by contrast, say that Mr. Lott's pork-barrel prowess has given him a free pass for too long and that they find his record on race difficult to defend.
D. E. Magee, a Jackson ophthalmologist who was appointed to the State College Board by Gov. Kirk Fordyce, a Republican, said recently that Mr. Lott had never really bothered to court the black vote.
"It really is an embarrassment," Dr. Magee said. "It does make it difficult when you're trying to convince others that the Republicans are a serious party that tries to reach out to everybody."
Dr. Magee was on the platform behind Mr. Lott at the commencement address at Alcorn State University, which Mr. Lott has cited as evidence that he is attentive to black students in his state.
But an Alcorn French professor, Belinda Griffith, chose not to attend. She called the speech lip service. "It was a one-woman boycott, but I think most of the faculty resented it," Professor Griffith said. "Hiring a few interns and speaking at a graduation have no impact. It allows him to point to something he has done for black people. I don't think he's capable of doing anything meaningful for the black community."
Some black residents contend that Mr. Lott's economic development projects do not benefit blacks and whites equally. James Crowell, president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter in Biloxi, about 25 miles west of Pascagoula, said that just as blacks held only the lowest-level shipyard jobs in Mr. Lott's father's day, they still made up only a small fraction of the supervisors there. And Mr. Crowell said the location of the Nissan plant in Canton created much dissension because it required the relocation of a number of black homeowners to make room for the factory site.
It does not help Mr. Lott that an easy comparison is available to Senator Thad Cochran, a fellow Republican who has won healthy percentages of the black vote in Mississippi.
In the nearly 15 years that the Rev. Larry Hawkins Sr. has been preaching at Union Baptist Church, a congregation of a few hundred families here in the center of Trent Lott's hometown, the senator has never visited.
"Governor Musgrove came twice," Mr. Hawkins says. "He's sat through our whole service. Senator Cochran's worshiped with us. But when Trent Lott is here he worships at First Baptist on Live Oak. First Baptist's white."
Mr. Lott could work wonders by reaching out to blacks, Mr. Hawkins said. "I'm not talking about hanging out with us," he said. "But at least acknowledge us. I mean, you could stop by one of the black churches."
He laughed a little, then added, "We're not going to mug him, or nothing like that."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the reaction in Pascagoula, Miss., Senator Trent Lott's hometown, to the outcry over remarks he made that have been denounced as racially insensitive misspelled the surname of a former Mississippi governor and, because of an editing error, misattributed a comment to him in some copies. The former governor is Kirk Fordice, not Fordyce. It was D. E. Magee, a Fordice appointee, who said of Mr. Lott's record on race relations: "It really is an embarrassment. It does make it difficult when you're trying to convince others that the Republicans are a serious party that tries to reach out to everybody."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: POSTWAR PLANS; 
Report Urges Iraqi Control Of Rebuilding After Hussein

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
A panel of experts has recommended that the United States ensure that Iraqis select their own government and control their vital oil industry in the event that Saddam Hussein is removed by military action.
 The group's proposal for reconstruction and reconciliation in a postwar Iraq strikes a cautionary tone about counting on Iraq's oil reserves, the second largest in the world, to stabilize and rebuild the country's troubled economy. 
 "The allure of Iraq's oil is tantalizing," said Amy Myers Jaffe, the senior energy adviser at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, "but it is also potentially destabilizing if it is not handled right." 
The study, sponsored by the Baker Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations, warned that "a heavy American hand" would only convince the Iraqis, as well as "the rest of the world, that the operation against Iraq was undertaken for imperialist, rather than disarmament, reasons."
The panel, headed by two former American diplomats, Edward P. Djerejian and Frank G. Wisner, called for a "level playing field for all international players to participate in future repair, development, and exploration efforts."
For now, American oil companies have adopted a hands-off approach to Iraq, largely because economic sanctions prohibit any deals. Some Russian and European companies, by contrast, have struck tentative deals but last week Iraq canceled the largest of those pacts, a multibillion dollar agreement with a leading Russian oil company.
The group's study highlighted the political and economic quandaries inherent in Iraq's reconstruction. 
Oil revenues could resuscitate Iraqi's economy, but huge investments are needed to rebuild an industry in dire straits -- an estimated $5 billion to repair Iraq's oil export facilities and another $20 billion to rebuild its power grid, for example.
Iraq's oil industry has a long history -- it was a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- but, the report noted, it will also need to attract $30 billion to $40 billion in new foreign investment to rehabilitate active wells and to develop new fields.
"Iraq is no different than any of the other countries in the Persian Gulf," said Ms. Jaffe, a panel member, "in terms of the debate over whether to share the wealth with outside companies in return for access to their technology."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BAGHDAD; 
Stocks Bullish In Iraq Market; Don't Ask Why

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
In his jacket of finely tailored herring-bone tweed, his highly polished brogues and the 1930's opera glasses he carries around his neck in inlaid Chinese cloisonne, Abu Zaki is, by his own jaunty reckoning, the breeziest boulevardier of the Baghdad bourse. 
 Fellow denizens of Iraq's only Stock Exchange say Abu Zaki, a 72-year-old investor, elevates the dingy former customs clearing-house by his elegant presence, along with the sage "picks" he makes among the stocks, and his ebullient talk of times gone by. In the unforgiving land of Saddam Hussein, he is a walking reminder of a gentler Baghdad, and of a time when finesse still counted, before all Iraqis learned to live in fear of Mr. Hussein's secret police. 
 To Abu Zaki -- he prefers the nickname to his real name, Akram Hussam -- the epitome of good times was the 1950's. That was when he was a rising young man in Iraq's last royal government, before King Faisal II was assassinated by army rebels in 1958, his body dragged through the streets. In America, visited so often by Abu Zaki that he considers it his home away from home, it was the time of the man he still calls Ike. 
"The secret? Taking it easy," Abu Zaki, a retired merchant, said in impeccable English as he chatted with his broker before heading off for lunch at the once-grand men's club on Sadoun Street where he invites cronies for afternoons of dominoes and backgammon.
On that particular day, Saturday, he was yet more chipper than usual. The last month has been a bullish one. The Baghdad Stock Index, or B.S.I., as it is known even among investors who speak no English, rose sharply, its gain on the year surging to more than 50 percent. Just about the best day was Nov. 9, when the share volume traded, 66 million, was up 65 percent on the previous close. The trading value, at 3.5 billion Iraqi dinars, or $1.7 million, was up 94 percent.
But hold on a minute, an outsider might think. Wasn't Nov. 9 the day after the United Nations Security Council passed, at American insistence, a tough new weapons inspection mandate requiring Iraq to accept an intrusive foreign presence? Wasn't the resolution denounced by the government, before it accepted it, as an American bid to "humiliate" Iraq and saturate it with "spies"?
It was. 
So what is behind such a spectacular market rise? On this, men like Abu Zaki are cautious, citing many factors. Oil prices, crucial to Iraq's economy, have been strong. The central bank cut interest rates early in the month. Mr. Hussein signed a law opening up all of the economy, except the nationalized oil sector, to investors from across the Arab world.
But what nobody here will acknowledge, at least not in so many words, is that the American action in pushing through the new weapons inspection resolution may have been the most important spur. For any Iraqi to say so clearly would be to suggest that he saw, in President Bush's threats of war, a development from which to take heart -- and that could be a life-threatening thought. 
So Abu Zaki and his friends aim off a little, as Iraqis do whenever the subject turns to Mr. Hussein, their iron-fisted ruler for 23 years. They search for ways of suggesting what is in their hearts without exposing themselves, because the mukhabarat, Mr. Hussein's secret police enforcers, are so pervasive that even old friends, when talking politics, must speak in codes.
What had driven November's bull market, Abu Zaki said, was that Iraqis had discovered "underlying asset value" in everything from the dismal, concrete-block hotels in Baghdad that have been empty for years, to fisheries on the Tigris and Euphrates that sell their catch at rock-bottom prices -- just the sort of businesses that might boom if Iraq found itself under a government that ended its estrangement.
Others found other formulations. "People think that six months from now, the situation in Iraq could be much better," said Nerses Artin Ardzivian, the 62-year-old dean of the brokers. Then, as if to be sure he would not be thought to imply disloyalty to Mr. Hussein, he offered a just-in-time correction. "Six months from now, we'll know so much more than we know right now."
It is, of course, possible that investors now crowding the exchange see the United Nations' renewed search for banned weapons as a way for Iraq, and Mr. Hussein, to escape the economic cul-de-sac in which it has been trapped for two decades of sanctions and war. If inspectors and outside intelligence turn up nothing, the country and its ruler could be free of the inspections, and of sanctions, as early as next fall.
But there is another, startling possibility: That the men and women now plunging their savings into shares in hotels and restaurants, farms and fisheries, banks and insurance companies, have glimpsed a different Iraq, one without Mr. Hussein, under the sway of the United States after another defeat at America's hand.
For November, the Baghdad exchange's "blue book," published in staple-bound soft copy at the end of each month, reads like a guide to counterculture economics: agriculture, up 13.5 percent; industrials, up 17 percent; banks, up 21 percent; services, including hotels and tourism, up 28 percent. Overall, a 25.4 percent rise in the index, the best one-month surge in years.
For the exchange, founded in 1992 as Mr. Hussein's government began to privatize much that was nationalized after the assassination of King Faisal, it has been the perfect start to its second decade.
Subhi al-Azawi, the Finance Ministry official whom the government made the exchange's director general, has just returned from Amman, capital of neighboring Jordan, with plans to computerize trading and give Baghdad an exchange commensurate with Mr. Hussein's ambitions to be unchallenged leader of the Arab world. As matters stand, computers seem an age away; all the wall clocks seem to have stopped years ago, and TV sets on the trading floor play old speeches by Mr. Hussein.
"We intend to construct an economy that surpasses the West's," Mr. Azawi said. 
The exchange director, with pinstripe suit and a paint-splashed tie straight from the closet of a Wall Street high-flier, had his own explanation for the market's surge. "The people of Iraq have a tremendous confidence in their government, and the market's rise only reflects this," he said. 
Downstairs on the trading floor, reality is seen through a different prism. If truth has been an elusive commodity in Mr. Hussein's Iraq, it has found a home of sorts on either side of the black wrought-iron fence that runs across the old customs warehouse. Here, with investors on one side and brokers on the other, the way the prices flow reflects as keen a sense of reality as Iraqis can muster in the Stalinist system of censorship imposed by Mr. Hussein.
"To prosper here," Mr. Ardzivian counseled, "you have to come every day, have good information, ask a lot of questions, and keep your eyes and ears open. You cannot afford to substitute hope for fact, or ambition for reality."
The results are registered in the bids to sell or buy that are posted manually, in marker pen, on white plastic boards dedicated to each of the 115 listed Iraqi companies. Investors range from cosmopolitan dandies like Abu Zaki to wizened old men from the bazaars. One accomplishment Mr. Hussein can fairly claim is that he has encouraged the emancipation of women, and the exchange has a strong minority of female traders and investors.
On Saturday, when the market fell back under heavy profit-taking, some companies were riding high, and Abu Zaki consolidated some of his earlier gains. As he paused to tally his profits, he was asked if he intended, at his club, to raise a glass -- something else permitted in Iraq that is forbidden in many Arab lands. "No, certainly not," he said. "If I celebrated every time I make money, I'd be celebrating all the time."

HEADLINE: Pepsi Switches To a New Voice Of a Generation 

BYLINE:  By NAT IVES 

 BODY:
Britney Spears, the pop star who has been a PepsiCo celebrity endorser for nearly two years, has been supplanted as the most prominent voice of the Pepsi generation by Beyonce Knowles of the vocal group Destiny's Child.
 But PepsiCo's move, which comes as Ms. Spears's contract has run its course, leaves open the possibility of her return to Pepsi ads. 
Ms. Knowles, who at 21 is the same age as Ms. Spears, has agreed to appear in two television commercials as well as in radio and Internet ads and in-store promotional materials, the company said yesterday. Pepsi also has the option of sponsoring a solo concert tour by Ms. Knowles if she decides to undertake one in 2003.
"We were really looking to take the work in a different direction," said Bart Casabona, a spokesman at Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y.
Ms. Knowles, a black singer who earlier this year appeared in the movie "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and will release a solo album next year on the Columbia Records label of Sony Music Entertainment, will help Pepsi reach consumers with a wider range of racial, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, Mr. Casabona said. He declined to discuss financial terms of their deal. The company spent $103 million advertising its Pepsi brand in the United States last year, and spent $63 million from January through August this year, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
The deal is not part of Pepsi's recent pact with Sony Music Entertainment, which was intended to help the companies promote each other.
The end of the contract between Pepsi and Ms. Spears, however, does not mean the end of their work together, said Lisa Kasteler, Ms. Spears's publicist. "They are in conversation and if they come up with something that is creatively as amazing as the other three have been, I'm sure Britney would love to work with them more," she said.
Ms. Spears appeared in three commercials for Pepsi, which were later edited into six, since their agreement was announced in February 2001, including a 90-second Super Bowl commercial in February in which she sang Pepsi jingles from the 1950's forward. Pepsi executives have booked advertising time for the Super Bowl next month, but do not know whether they will use a commercial with Ms. Knowles then, Mr. Casabona said.
New Pepsi commercials starring Ms. Spears are possible but not imminent, Mr. Casabona said. "We've had a fantastic relationship with Britney and will always consider her part of the Pepsi family," he said.
Pepsi's alliance with Ms. Spears was effective, but perhaps had run its course, said Gary Hemphill, senior vice president at Beverage Marketing, a consulting firm in New York. "They constantly need to bring news and excitement to the brand," he said. "A new celebrity spokesperson is certainly a very high-profile way to do that."
Pepsi has had a good run over its long history of using celebrities like Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Robert Palmer in its advertising, Mr. Hemphill said.

HEADLINE: From Dockyard To Your Yard 

BYLINE:  By ALASTAIR GORDON

 BODY:
IF every object has its day, then the steel shipping container may be the log cabin of the 21st century.
 One winter morning in 1996, Ada Tolla and Giuseppe Ligano, partners in the New York-based architecture firm LOT-EK, left the city for an outing. Instead of driving to a ski mountain or spa, they chose an unlikely destination, a port in Elizabeth, N.J. There they walked among great ziggurats of shipping containers that were stacked along the wharves. 
 What Ms. Tolla and Mr. Ligano saw in the industrial sprawl, they said, was no less than a new kind of city. "You had narrow streets and piazzas and incredible facades," Ms. Tolla said. "It was the best architecture I had ever seen." 
At the time, Mr. Ligano was less than convinced. Was it really architecture?
"Yes," Ms. Tolla said. "For me it was like being in Pompeii."
Since that day, Ms. Tolla, 38, and Mr. Ligano, 39, have adopted the container as a design signature, using it along with oil tanks, airplane fuselages and other industrial castoffs. Their most recent project is an ingenious system of movable containers for the Bohen Foundation, an exhibition space that opened last month at 415 West 13th Street (Ninth Avenue).
"We tend to use the most banal objects," Mr. Ligano said. "It's all about the stuff around us that you see every day."
LOT-EK (pronounced LOW-tech) is the most prominent of an emerging school of architects using inexpensive recycled containers as temporary or permanent homes, offices or galleries.
Ms. Tolla and Mr. Ligano, childhood friends, grew up on the same street in Naples. On their first visit to America, in 1989, they drove across the country, photographing highways, gas tanks and malls along the way.
"In Italy, the burden of history is always with you," Ms. Tolla said. "When we came here, it was like these doors sprang open. Ah, there is also this modern world! We had the realization that this was our true culture -- these colors, these shapes."
Ms. Tolla and Mr. Ligano returned to America the following year and attended a postgraduate program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. They have lived in New York ever since. Ms. Tolla, whose companion is a photographer, had a baby in August. 
For Art Basel Miami Beach, an art fair held this month, 20 shipping containers were refurbished and converted into galleries by a Basel architectural firm, Steinmann & Schmid.
The containers were lined with white wooden walls and positioned along the beach at Collins Park (not far from the main exhibition at the Miami Beach Convention Center). After the show closed, the containers were reused for their initial purpose, transporting exhibition materials back to Switzerland.
LOT-EK designed an exhibition for Art Basel, a video lounge, which was installed at the Miami Public Library, where viewers watched videos while lying down on a sloping floor. "We call it a technological beach for image bathing," Mr. Ligano said. 
For designers with a weakness for industrial chic, containers are hard to resist. They're a ubiquitous byproduct of the global economy -- available from Montana to Mozambique -- and endlessly recyclable. They stack as easily as children's blocks and shift like Legos from truck to ship to train. They come in an assortment of sizes and are extremely durable. And they're inexpensive: a 40-foot-long, 8-foot-high container costs about $2,300.
"There's a kind of self-effacement in the attitude that not everything needs to be designed from scratch," said Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. "There's a thrifty and environmental turn to the use of containers. It goes back to the found object and the ad hoc-ism of the 1960's."
A New Jersey architect, Adam Kalkin, who has used containers as instant rooms in several housing projects, said he was attracted to containers for their enigmatic as well as practical qualities.
"They have all of this veiled mystery," he said. "These things have been sitting on ships all over the world, carrying God knows what."
Mr. Kalkin used three stacked shipping containers in his Collector's House, a $140,000 prototype for mass-produced housing, built last year on the grounds of the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vt. Hope Alswang, president of the museum, said that about 200,000 people had visited the prototype. "Some were initially skeptical about the idea of living in containers," she acknowledged. "But as they spent some time inside it, they were transformed." 
For a 4,000-square-foot vacation house in Brooklin, Me., Mr. Kalkin used 12 containers: two stacks of six each, topped by a prefabricated roof. "People looked at us and thought we were crazy," said Anne Adriance, an advertising executive who owns the house with her husband, Matthew, a business consultant. "But it's very intimate inside the container rooms. It's cozy without being cloying."
The central living area of the house, which cost $500,000, is an open, loftlike space. Five containers serve as bedrooms, three as bathrooms. To relieve their monastic, cell-like quality, Mr. Kalkin filled in opened ends of each container with glass. "They have this total plastic quality," he said, talking about the containers. "You just take a welding torch and cut out a skylight or a window or a door." 
After initial complaints, the community has grown to accept the unconventional structure, Ms. Adriance said. "It's so far outside of people's context for 'house' that they don't have the emotional language to envision it. Their first reaction is curiosity and confusion."
LOT-EK has pushed the container aesthetic to a new level of sophistication at the Bohen Foundation, which asked the architects to anticipate the needs of experimental artists.
"We were looking for a firm that could reconceive the very idea of the exhibition space and how it functions," said Frederick B. Henry, president of the foundation.
Within the vast, 15,000-square-foot space, LOT-EK placed eight bright red steel shipping containers, four of them used as offices. One is a video lounge, another is a conference room. Here and there, the corrugated metal has been folded down like a flap to create desks or counters. All the containers are mounted on steel rollers that slide along tracks recessed a few inches into the concrete floor. "As you move the containers you transform the space," Ms. Tolla explained. "It's all about flexibility."
A set of overhead tracks, like those used in nearby meatpacking plants, support generic white exhibit walls that can be moved to create gallery enclosures. The result is a kind of crazy railroad-switching yard. "There's a sense of joy about working in such a nontraditional space," said Joan Weakley, Bohen's program director, who had been working inside one of containers for the past two weeks. "The possibilities are limitless." 
Perhaps LOT-EK's most ambitious project to date is its Mobile Dwelling Unit, a housing system inspired by a visit that the partners made in 1999 to a container port in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where they watched as a giant, insectlike mechanism moved hundreds of containers from a ship to waiting trucks.
Their dwelling unit is a self-contained space for living and work, lined with built-in fixtures and furnishings made of fiberglass, that is shipped as efficiently as any other industrial container.
A prototype version of LOT-EK's Mobile Dwelling Unit is now being fabricated and is to be part of a traveling exhibition that starts at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in June. "We are building it as a real architectural product, not just a conceptual project," Ms. Tolla said.
While container architecture might be another passing design trend, it seems to be making at least some headway into domestic reality. "You have to take a leap of faith," said Ms. Adriance, who will be moving into her container house in Maine in a few weeks. "I am in the mood for it."

HEADLINE: Baryshnikov Hatches Grand Plan for a New Arts Center 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Putting New York at the center of his artistic universe once more, Mikhail Baryshnikov, the international ballet star and former artistic director of American Ballet Theater, says he will open an arts center in Manhattan in 2004. He has disbanded his touring modern dance troupe, the White Oak Dance Project. 
 Mr. Baryshnikov said that the Baryshnikov Center for Dance, which is to have its headquarters on West 37th Street, plans to offer space to performing arts groups at subsidized rates. But he emphasized that its major program will be a laboratory in which artists will work with mentors from the worlds of dance, theater, film and lighting and costume design. Participants will be chosen by members of the center's 18-person artistic advisory panel, which includes the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, the modern dance pioneer Merce Cunningham, the choreographer William Forsythe, the Georgian puppeteer Rezo Gabriadze, the violinist Gidon Kremer, the director Peter Sellars, the writer Susan Sontag and the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton. 
 Mr. Baryshnikov, who is 55, said in a recent interview that he had fallen behind in his work on the new building and could not devote enough time to White Oak. 
"The fund-raising pressures were enormous," he said. "I couldn't do both, so I cut it short." He will continue to dance, appearing in the spring and summer in a national tour of a solo program that will be performed only once in each tour city, to raise money for his new project.
The center, which will occupy three floors in a new performing arts complex under construction at 450 West 37th Street, will house four rehearsal studios and offices. It will also have access to a 300-seat theater, one of three theaters of different sizes in the new building. 
The center will occupy the top floors, which Mr. Baryshnikov has bought, of a seven-floor building that is owned and developed by the West 37th Group, a limited-liability corporation composed of Broadway and Off Broadway producers including Alan Schuster, who manages three downtown theaters. The building, which is expected to open early in 2004, will house two commercial Off Broadway theaters as well as the mixed commercial and nonprofit theater that will be used by the Baryshynikov Center. 
Speaking of members of his advisory board, Mr. Baryshnikov said: "Pedro really loves New York and wants to meet young playwrights and filmmakers. Peter Sellars wants to teach. Anybody who has any kind of association with art will be welcome." He said the center would also be the "the New York creative address" for Mr. Forsythe, who will step down as director of the Frankfurt Ballet in 2004. Mr. Baryshnikov talked excitedly of other possibilities for the arts complex. "We have a year and a half to build the programs," he said. 
Mr. Baryshnikov envisions the center as "a hangout," he said, that "can be a little beginning for people of different art forms to meet and discuss their future and our future." Much of his inspiration for the institute came from talks he has had over the years with members of the Judson Dance Theater movement in New York City in the 1960's, whose collaborative spirit and iconoclasm Mr. Baryshnikov celebrated in a White Oak program called Past Forward. 
Mr. Baryshnikov said that Mr. Cunningham, whom he describes as the "chief chairperson" of the panel, has also been a major inspiration. For Mr. Cunningham, the idea of the center represents a creative melding of the sort he encountered when he was a young choreographer. 
"The experience of being with, and talking with, contemporary artists with contemporary ideas was important to me and my work," Mr. Cunningham said in a statement, mentioning Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Morton Feldman and others. "I suspect that is what Misha wants to give young artists a chance to meet and talk together much in the same way." 
Mr. Baryshnikov has raised $3 million, which includes his own contribution of $2 million and a $1 million grant from the Howard Gilman Foundation, toward the estimated $8 million needed for the center. All money raised, he said, would come from nongovernmental sources. The center may also affiliate with a local university. 
Planning began after Christina Sterner, managing director of Baryshnikov Productions, attended a meeting in 2000 about a possible new building for the arts. "We weren't really seriously looking," Ms. Sterner said. "But we've always been nomadic in terms of our rehearsal space. Alan had a wonderful idea to build some Off Broadway theaters under one roof and rent additional space to nonprofit arts organizations. That meeting was the genesis of the idea. This hit me as the right people in the right place at the right time." 
Mr. Barsyhnikov has had a long and varied career in dance. His life as a performer has continued, despite injuries, well past the age when many dancers stop. He had a nine-year stint as director of American Ballet Theater, which he left in 1989. As director of White Oak, founded with Mark Morris, Mr. Baryshnikov gained a reputation as a producer of new work by young dance experimentalists. Why this new project? 
Mr. Baryshnikov talked of Rauschenberg's habit of questioning himself every morning. What should he have done already? the artist asked himself. More important, what shouldn't he do? "I wake up with this phrase all the time," Mr. Baryshnikov said. "It puts you into the right frame of mind, because life pushes you to fall into a routine, which is not necessarily healthy. Life is not a series of convenient events, from my point of view.
"An art center in New York right now is stupid. Insane. Ridiculous. Yeah? Maybe. But I think that's what this city and this country need. In New York City, people used to collaborate and meet and discuss and have fun together and learn from each other. There's no connection anymore, especially with the economic pressures on the arts. And people try to please the media, or a board of directors, in order to succeed. It's all a game. Press agents, fund-raisers, this and that." New York, he added, has become an even more difficult place for young professionals to show their work. 
Mr. Baryshnikov said that the creation of the center is also his "coming back to New York." 
"When I left American Ballet Theater, I left New York psychologically," he said. "It was a very difficult time in my life. I felt a very deep kind of hurt because I kind of dropped the ball in the middle of the game. I failed myself in what I originally envisioned, a new kind of dynamic classical theater. I felt I could not just continue.
"That's why I went to Europe to work with Mark and made a couple of stupid movies. I found myself again as a performer with Mark's help. I figured out how I could do what I couldn't do in Ballet Theater." The result was White Oak." 
"I'm doing this for purely selfish reasons," Mr. Baryshnikov said of the center. "I like to watch. I love to see young people create and be supportive in their failures and helpful in their successes. In the last 12 years and in some of my highlights with A.B.T., the highlight of my life was when certain collaborations worked and certain moments clicked. What I like more than anything else, more than any of my personal success on stage, is to be part of something which moves the history of the theater or of dance forward. You remember those moments to the end of your life."

HEADLINE: Big Banks Step Up Efforts Against I.M.F. Debt-Relief Plan 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Big international banks are counting on the ouster of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to help them block the creation of a bankruptcy system of sorts for nations drowning in debt.
 In September, Mr. O'Neill backed efforts by the International Monetary Fund to propose an international process under which a country like Argentina might renegotiate its debt with a committee of creditors. 
 Big international banks, which hold billions of dollars in loans to governments around the world, have bitterly fought the idea because they fear that the new rules would protect insolvent governments even more than ordinary bankruptcy laws shield insolvent companies. 
On Tuesday, an alliance of banks, bondholders and institutional traders said the plan was based on "false assumptions" and was essentially unworkable in any form.
The alliance, whose members include banks like Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase of the United States and European banks like UBS and Deutsche Bank, said that "no changes in any specific aspects" of the plan would "alter their serious concerns about the proposal." The alliance is headed by the Institute of International Finance, a lobbying group in Washington.
The financial collapse of Argentina over the last year has made the issue of debt restructuring more urgent to governments around the world.
Fund officials argue that the world needs a system that will make it easier to anticipate a financial crisis and then react to it. The essence of its plan would be to create a set of rules under which a government would be able to negotiate a debt restructuring if it could reach agreement with creditors holding 75 percent of its debt.
One advantage of such rules, officials argue, is that the restructuring process could not be dragged out by one or two creditors who refuse to sign onto an agreement.
Mr. O'Neill infuriated many financial institutions by resolutely supporting the idea of a "two-track approach" to sovereign debt. The first approach, which private banks tend to support, calls for writing new clauses into loan contracts that would set up procedures for dealing with countries in danger of defaulting on its loans.
The second track would create a set of international rules and procedures, possibly under the auspices of the fund, about when a country is effectively bankrupt and what to do.
Mr. O'Neill did not endorse a specific approach for the fund, but he joined other international leaders in September by calling on the I.M.F. to offer a specific proposal by next April. At the time, he compared the two approaches to the need for having more than one tool in a tool kit.
Thomas Dawson, a spokesman for the fund, dismissed the complaints of bankers as "old wine in new bottles," adding that "the two-track approach has broad international support" from governments around the world.
But even before Mr. O'Neill was abruptly dismissed two weeks ago, top officials at the Treasury Department had begun backing away.
John B. Taylor, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, in a speech to securities traders on Dec. 9, conspicuously omitted any direct description of the fund's approach and spent the whole speech promoting the idea of voluntary collective-action clauses in bond contracts. John W. Snow, President Bush's choice to succeed Mr. O'Neill, has not stated his views on the issue, and Treasury officials emphasized they do not want to speak for him.
But Gerald P. O'Driscoll, an international economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington, said Mr. O'Neill was the only important person in the Bush administration who actively encouraged the idea of an international debt-relief process.
"That was O'Neill," Mr. O'Driscoll said. "I think what he was saying was that we should try to come up with an idea. His going will enable them to back off and say it wasn't what they had in mind."
Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the Treasury, said the administration still supports the idea of developing two separate proposals but emphasized that it has not yet committed itself to the fund's approach.
"If they can convince us this is the best way to go, then we will go ahead with it," Mr. Fratto said. "But they are going to have to convince us first."
Big financial institutions are not the only groups opposing the plan. Big developing countries like Brazil, Mexico, Poland and Turkey are also against it, because they fear the new procedures will scare off lenders and raise the costs of their borrowing in the future.

HEADLINE: HOW IT WORKS; 
Shifting Gears, With the Help of Software

BYLINE:  By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
THE ease of driving a car equipped with an automatic transmission makes automatics the overwhelming favorite of American motorists. But while the Hydra-Matic 4T40-E transmissions moving down the final assembly line at a General Motors factory in Windsor, Ontario, may be simple to use, they are far from simple to design and build. Flipped upward like cast-aluminum cornucopias, the partly assembled transmission bodies are fed a harvest of gears, chains, springs, electronics and wires. Exactly how the pieces come together to shift gears is something of a mystery even to the people who make the transmissions, which are soon to be installed in Chevrolet Cavaliers, Oldsmobile Aleros and other cars. When asked about the specifics of the torque converter, the link between the transmission and the engine, the plant's engineering manager, Don Wright, laughed. "As for how it works, you'll have to ask someone else," he said. "I'm the guy who knows how to make them." 
 But what sets the 4T40-E apart from older models is not the intricacy of its mechanical and hydraulic systems. Rather it is a box tethered to the transmission by a wire. Inside, a sophisticated microprocessor uses special software to replace the electromechanical systems that once controlled automatic transmissions. 
By moving to electronic controls, transmission makers have not only been able to introduce new features -- like additional gear ratios and transmissions that adapt to different driving styles -- but have also narrowed the efficiency and performance gap between automatics and manual transmissions. 
 Mark Gilmore, the director of transmission development at G.M.'s Powertrain division, acknowledged that the all-mechanical automatics that were being produced by the company when he joined it in 1977 probably deserved their popular pejorative name, "slush buckets." But today, he said, there is legitimate debate on how they compare with manual transmissions. "I think we're now certainly very close with automatics," he said.
 Whether manual or automatic, transmissions perform two basic jobs. At low speeds, they allow the drive shaft that powers the wheels to rotate at a lower rate than the engine's drive shaft. Doing that creates the force, known as torque, needed to accelerate the car. At higher speeds, the situation reverses. To prevent the engine from running inefficiently, the transmission creates a final drive shaft rotational speed that is higher than the engine drive shaft's rate. The first automatic and semiautomatic transmissions appeared in the years before World War II, but they were largely experimental and not particularly successful. "They provided acceleration that could best be described as stately," said Bob Casey, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich. 
 Then in 1939, the first G.M. Hydra-Matic appeared, and it became available on Oldsmobiles during the next year. It used a hydraulic system to make gear changes based on a complex set of factors, including the vacuum pressure of the engine's exhaust manifold, the car's speed and the engine throttle setting, all measured mechanically. Various springs opened and closed hydraulic pistons to shift gears. "It was just insanely complicated, yet the transmissions became extremely reliable," Mr. Casey said. 
 One of Mr. Gilmore's first jobs as a junior engineer at G.M. was to adapt transmissions to different engines by changing their springs and pistons. "I used to carry a little suitcase around filled with hardware," he said. Eliminating that fiddly process was one reason that G.M. and other transmission makers started looking at electronics. It also quickly became apparent that electronics offered ways to boost performance. 
 Automatic transmissions, like manual ones, need to uncouple themselves from the engine when shifting. Rather than use a mechanical clutch -- basically two abrasive discs that press against each other -- the torque converter makes its coupling between the engine and the transmission with hydraulic fluid. 
 When a car is accelerating, fluid couplings can boost engine torque. But at higher speeds they put the "slush" into slush box.
 The obvious solution, introducing a mechanical connection that kicks in at highway speeds, was difficult without electronic controls. 
 The first G.M. transmission to have all of its gear changes controlled by electronics did not appear until 1989. 
 Transmission software has become so sophisticated that it can now determine if a car is climbing a hill -- a situation that often baffled transmissions in the past -- and study drivers' patterns to see if they prefer sporty acceleration or sedate but economical driving. "Our goal is to have the customer not even realize the transmission is doing a whole lot of things," Mr. Gilmore said. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Power Conversion"Automatic transmissions are designed to seamlessly take the power from a cars engine and apply it efficiently to the wheels. But while that task is relatively simple, transmissions are extraordinarily complex, with hundreds of mechanical, hydraulic and electronic components. ELECTRONIC SENSORSElectronic sensors are critical to the performance of the transmission and the torque converter, the fluid coupling between the engine and the transmission. The sensors send data about engine speed, exhaust pressure and other performance characteristics to a processor, which activates electrical switches, or solenoids, to shift gears and control a clutch plate in the torque converter. POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULEThe processor at the heart of the system that processes the data and activates the appropriate switches. OUTPUT SPEED SENSORMeasures transmission rotation speed after gearing. CLUTCH CONTROL BRAKE SWITCHReleases the torque converter clutch when the brake is applied. PUMPVanes on the pump, which is connected to the engine, force hydraulic fluid at the turbine. STATORThe stator contains vanes that alter the fluid flow at low speeds, increasing torque, or turning power. TURBINEThe moving hydraulic fluid turns the turbine, which is connected to the transmission. TORQUE CONVERTER SOLENOIDApplies the clutch plate to the torque converter for more efficient operationat high speed. MANUAL SWITCH (INSIDE CASE)Shifts gears when the gearshift lever is moved by the driver. INPUT SPEED SENSORMeasures transmission rotation speed before gearing. SHIFT SOLENOIDSElectrically operated valves control the path of hydraulic fluid through the network of channels cast into parts of the transmission housing, below.

HEADLINE: Attention Focuses East In Early Film Awards 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Maybe it wasn't such a nutty idea to move the Academy Awards to New York.
 Although it's still early in the movie awards season, dominated thus far only by the kind of critics groups likely to shun big studio fare, the pattern is that almost all of the early honors have gone to movies from the mini-studios and small, independent distributors based in Manhattan. In their rush to create mass entertainments intended to please both audiences and corporate boards, the traditional Hollywood studios have all but taken themselves out of the year-end awards competition. 
Whether this is an aberration -- something that will shortly be corrected by more Hollywood-friendly competitions like the Golden Globes -- or a permanent shift is a subject of brisk debate in Hollywood. 
Frank Pierson, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the industry group that gives out the Oscars, said that he thought the situation resulted from more than the mere mix of films coming up for awards this year. It is, he suggested, a conscious decision that the Hollywood moguls have made. 
"The studios don't even call them movies anymore," he said sourly. "They call them products."
When Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, which is based in TriBeCa, proposed a few months ago that the coming Oscar ceremonies be transplanted either in whole or in part to New York City, the Hollywood movie community reacted with a loud chortle of amusement. The ceremonies are not moving to Manhattan, Mr. Pierson said again early this week, although talks continue to have perhaps a portion of the event broadcast from New York. 
Still, taking into account how many of these early honors have gone to films from New York, is moving the awards such a wild notion?
"There's no way I'm going to touch that one," said Jean Picker Firstenberg, director of the American Film Institute.
Of the top 10 movies of the year as chosen by the National Board of Review, a New York-based group of film scholars and enthusiasts, only one -- Columbia's "Adaptation" -- was the sole work of a Hollywood studio. One other, "The Hours," which the group chose as best picture, was a co-production of Hollywood-based Paramount Pictures and Miramax. (Paramount, as the American distributor, would actually take home the gold statuette.)
Of the other eight films on the list, five came from Miramax; two from Focus Features, the New York-based indie arm of Universal Pictures; and one from Sony Pictures Classics, also based in New York.
The American Film Institute's top 10, released earlier this week, was similarly tilted toward the East Coast -- three films from Hollywood studios, six from studios with headquarters in New York and one ("The Hours," again) split between the two.
And the critics groups were unanimous. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association chose New Line Cinema's "About Schmidt" as the year's best film and Focus's "Far From Heaven" as runner-up. Critics groups in Boston and Los Angeles went with Roman Polanski's "Pianist," also from Focus, while Toronto critics today picked "Adaptation." And the New York Film Critics Circle this week chose "Far From Heaven" as best film, with the closest runners-up being "Y Tu Mama Tambien" (from New York-based IFC Films), "Talk to Her" (from Sony Pictures Classics) and "About Schmidt" (from New Line, which like Focus has offices in both New York and Los Angeles, but considers Manhattan its main headquarters).
These smaller, independent film companies and mini-studios -- particularly Miramax -- have been important players in the Oscar race for almost a decade, and they count on striking some sparks in these early critics awards. But it is difficult to remember a time when so many of the major Hollywood studios have simply abandoned the field.
Warner Brothers, the biggest Hollywood studio, has yet to have a film prove remotely competitive in this year's race, although, led by "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," it has been one of the biggest money earners this year. The same goes for MGM. Disney is mounting an effort for M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs," but it has failed to get any traction in the early going.
Universal Pictures, which won the Oscar last year for "A Beautiful Mind," has been pushing "8 Mile," the film debut of the rapper Eminem, and "The Emperor's Club," a prep-school drama, though neither has landed any early awards. Lately, Universal has focused more attention on "About a Boy," a spring release that actually ended up on the American Film Institute's top 10 list.
Some, like Focus Features' president, James Schamus, feel it is a little unfair to hammer the studios, many of which made at least one attempt to make the kind of movie that can attract Oscars.
Twentieth Century Fox, for instance, pinned much of its hopes on what seemed a likely award contender -- Steven Soderbergh's "Solaris," a space drama full of big ideas. But that film opened last month to mixed reviews and poor box office, leaving Fox to focus on last summer's Steven Spielberg thriller, "Minority Report." But that film, too, has thus far failed to land year-end honors.
Still to be heard from is the Hollywood-based DreamWorks, a mini-studio whose smaller release slate, mixing serious dramas with more splashy entertainments, makes it more similar to smaller, hybrid studios like Miramax and New Line Cinema than to the Hollywood titans.
DreamWorks has the best record in Hollywood in recent years in winning top awards, taking the best picture Oscar in 1999 with "American Beauty" and in 2000 with "Gladiator," and then co-producing "A Beautiful Mind" with Universal last year. But its major 2002 films, Sam Mendes's "Road to Perdition" and Mr. Spielberg's "Catch Me if You Can," have not won any of the early awards or turned up on top 10 lists.
That, many in Hollywood suspect, will shortly change, perhaps as early as Thursday morning, when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association releases its Golden Globe nominations in Beverly Hills.
"In the old days, a studio chief like Darryl Zanuck would toss in a movie that he knew wouldn't make money, just for the prestige factor," said Damien Bona, author of "Inside Oscar" and a veteran Academy Award scholar. "But you just don't see that happening at all anymore."
Instead, the major studios have largely confined themselves to audience-pleasing blockbusters that are as risk-free as possible, meaning a steady diet of sequels, prequels, comic book heroes and franchise series. 
At the same time, the smaller independent companies have been changing, too. Many of them have become divisions of the global conglomerates that also own the major studios. AOL Time Warner owns both Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema, for instance, while Disney owns both Walt Disney Studios and Miramax. And as the larger studios have shifted away from expensive Oscar fare, many of these smaller siblings have moved toward making bigger, more expensive productions.
This year's two biggest Oscar-pitched epics, the kind of movies that the major studios used to make every year, are "Gangs of New York" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," which came, respectively, from Miramax and New Line.
These smaller production and distribution companies have for decades tended to base themselves in New York to be closer to sources of financing and to Manhattan's reservoir of relatively lower-cost talent. But this trend has accelerated in the last decade as Miramax and other entities have developed lucrative relationship with the growing number of young, independent-minded filmmakers drawn to the city's film schools and cultural scene.
So it is perhaps inevitable that the Oscar race will increasingly be fought among competitors working in the shadow of a skyscraper rather than the shade of a palm tree.
"This is not just a short-term trend, it's a reality," said Amir Malin, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment, a New York-based independent distributor. "And it's a reality born out of the economic necessities of our business. In the past, the studios also might have offered up some pedigree films that would make their way into these top 10 lists. But at the moment, there is a dearth of that kind of product from the major studios."
With production and marketing costs going up and corporate boards demanding surer returns on investment, the major studios simply cannot afford to take a flier on a risky, expensive project, Mr. Malin said, unless a major star like Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise is attached to it.
Mr. Malin and others feel this year is not an aberration but a glimpse of the future. "I don't think there's going to be a reversion," he said.
But others, like Mr. Bona, think that it is more of a cyclical event and point to the 1996 Oscar race, in which only one studio film, "Jerry Maguire," was among the five best-picture nominees. 
"It seems to happen every five or six years," Mr. Bona said. "The reaction from the studios tends to be either, 'We need to do better,' or, 'Oh, who cares about the awards, anyway, we're making a lot of money.' "
Mr. Pierson said that he hoped the major studios would get back into the business of making more of the kinds of movies that end up competing for Oscars but that he was not sure how quickly that turnaround might come.
Cynthia Swartz, a senior executive at Miramax, said, "I think you can extrapolate from what we've seen thus far this year that the major Oscar contenders, for the most part, will not come from the traditional, major studios."
At the same time, she said, it's still a little early to declare, simply on the basis of these early critics awards, that the major studios will be shut out of the Oscar race.
"I don't think the critics awards are a sure-fire indicator of where the Oscar season will eventually go," she said. "And I don't think it's that unusual that the critics groups would be dominated by smaller films that might need this kind of recognition to find an audience."
Whatever the case, this year's race for the Oscars -- nominations will be announced Feb. 11 and the awards handed out on March 23 -- is proving to be as tense and competitive as always. "It is a bloodbath out there," Mr. Schamus of Focus Features said. "The academy season is just brutal."

HEADLINE: Port Lockouts Narrowed Trade Deficit InOctober 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
The trade deficit narrowed to $35.1 billion in October, the Commerce Department reported today, though much of the gain was attributed to the effect of the West Coast labor dispute, which cut back imports. 
 The imbalance between what the United States sells abroad and what it imports decreased 5.5 percent from a deficit in September of $37.1 billion. 
 September's deficit and an August imbalance of $38.1 billion had been the two highest monthly trade deficits on record as shippers rushed to get goods into the country ahead of the deadline for resolving the labor dispute with dockworkers. 
Port operators locked out the workers, disrupting shipments in late September and early October before President Bush invoked federal law to reopen the ports. The stoppage cut into both imports and exports but was more disruptive on imports, particularly from China and Japan. 
The October deficit was the smallest since March, when the deficit was $32.6 billion. Even with the narrowing, the deficit for the year is running at an annual pace of $420 billion, a record and 17 percent higher than last year's deficit of $358.3 billion. 
For October, exports of goods and services fell 1 percent, to $82 billion, with the decline led by decreases in the shipments of computer chips and industrial machinery. Farm products fell 4 percent, to $3.86 billion, the lowest level since April 2000. 
Imports of all goods and services fell 2.4 percent, to $117 billion. Shipments of foreign cars declined $906 million, to $16.8 billion. Household goods fell $398 million, and clothing imports were down $297 million. 
Energy imports rose 13.5 percent in October, to $10.38 billion, the highest level since January 2001. 
The United States recorded its largest deficit with China, $9.5 billion, though that was down 7.2 percent from September's level.
The deficit with Canada, the largest trading partner, declined 5.1 percent, to $4.3 billion. The imbalance with Mexico, the other partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, rose 17 percent, to $3.5 billion, the second-highest level on record.
In trying to control the deficit, the Bush administration has taken the same stance as the Clinton administration, arguing that instead of raising barriers to imports, the United States will try to increase exports by seeking the removal of foreign trade barriers. Last week, the administration said it had concluded a free-trade agreement with Chile and last month officials said they had resolved almost all remaining issues for a deal with Singapore. 
Critics contend that despite all the negotiations, American workers face unfair competition from low-wage countries where factories operate under lax labor and environmental regulations.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Climbs Steeply In California 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
California plunged deeper into fiscal red ink today as Gov. Gray Davis announced that the state's budget deficit for the next 18 months would be a stunning $34.8 billion.
 The shortfall is bigger than the annual budgets of every other state except New York. California's own general budget for the current fiscal year is $78 billion. 
Just two weeks ago, Mr. Davis proposed $10.2 billion in spending cuts to address a shortfall that was then estimated at $21 billion over the next 18 months. If approved by the Legislature, those reductions will cut deeply into state spending on education, health care, welfare, parks and other services.
Mr. Davis said today that it would be impossible to balance the budget solely with spending reductions, but did not specify what tax increases he would propose when he submits to the Legislature on Jan. 10 a budget plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Earlier this year, the governor proposed an increase in cigarette taxes and vehicle license fees to raise several billion dollars and so help close a much smaller budget gap, but lawmakers rebuffed him. The nonpartisan legislative budget office has suggested that an income tax increase for high-income households and a half-cent increase in the state sales tax, now 5 cents on the dollar, could raise $5 billion a year. But adopting all those taxes would go only partway toward closing the gap now projected.
The governor attributed the latest grim news to a steep decline in anticipated tax revenue, resulting in part from poor performance by the stock market; unplanned increases in spending on mandatory programs; and cuts in federal funds for Medicaid and domestic security.
Mr. Davis said earlier estimates of state revenue had obviously been based on overly optimistic assumptions. But he said no expert, "from Alan Greenspan on down," had foreseen the sluggish performance of the economy or the continued doldrums in financial markets this year. California's budget is heavily dependent on income- and capital-gains taxes paid by the wealthy.
"The problem is so big that there's not a lot of time for hand-wringing," Mr. Davis said at a news conference in Sacramento this afternoon. "We have to tackle this head on."
Republicans in the Democratic-controlled Legislature have vowed to resist any new taxes, saying Governor Davis and other Democrats previously ignored their warnings about the depth of the fiscal crisis. Dave Cox, the Assembly Republican leader, said raising taxes would depress business activity in California and make the problem worse.
At his news conference today, Mr. Davis announced that his budget director for the last four years, Tim Gage, would be quitting government early next year. His replacement will be Steve Peace, a 20-year veteran of the Legislature who was instrumental in drafting the state's failed experiment with energy deregulation.
Before running for office, Mr. Peace, who is from El Cajon in San Diego County, produced and starred in the cult classic "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."

HEADLINE: South Korean Voters Weigh Rival Visions for Peninsula 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
The race for president here turned into a referendum on relations with North Korea in a tense, final day of campaigning today, as the two top candidates relentlessly pitched their very different visions of how to deal with a dangerous and impoverished neighbor.
 "Inter-Korean peace and cooperation is not a matter of choice," said Roh Moo Hyun, a liberal labor lawyer and former legislator from the governing Millennium Democratic Party who seems to be the leading candidate. "The survival of 70 million people is at stake." 
 Mr. Roh's chief rival, Lee Hoi Chang, countered with a denunciation of engagement with North Korea, the so-called sunshine policy championed unsuccessfully by the departing president, Kim Dae Jung. The credibility of that policy suffered a major blow recently, with North Korea's admission that it has been secretly building a nuclear weapons program. 
"The clearest distinction between myself and candidate Roh is that I believe the 'sunshine policy' is a failure," said Mr. Lee, a dour 67-year-old former Supreme Court justice from the conservative Grand National Party.
Other major issues have floated to the surface, including ties with the United States, in an race that is expected to be extremely close. But most other issues have receded as Thursday's election has approached, with South Koreans and the candidates themselves emphasizing that the relationship with the estranged northern half of the peninsula is the linchpin upon which their future rides.
If ties with the United States have faded a bit as a focus, however, the election's significance for American diplomacy in this region remains unusually high. Western diplomats here routinely pre-empt any questions about the race with a vigorous pledge that Washington "will work closely with either candidate."
Most political analysts, whether Korean or American, say a victory by Mr. Lee would mean that bilateral ties would continue relatively unchanged. A victory by Mr. Roh, who is often described as Mr. Kim's political heir, could presage a lengthy adjustment period for South Korea and the United States.
Washington's diplomacy toward North Korea is traditionally conducted through consultation with South Korea and Japan, close economic and military allies who long ago realized they can maximize leverage on North Korea by maintaining common positions, at least in public.
Japan made a flourish of solidarity this week with visits of its foreign and defense ministers to Washington, even though there remain substantial differences in the approaches of the two countries.
With South Korea, however, differences with Washington have been out in the open for months, and are indeed growing. They have been fueled in part by a huge popular campaign of protests against the presence of 37,000 United States troops, after the acquittal in a court martial of two American soldiers who had accidentally crushed two teenage girls with their armored vehicle while on patrol near Seoul. 
After several weeks of disquieting news, beginning with Washington's disclosure of North Korea's secret nuclear program, a rush of conciliatory signals out of North Korea this week seem to have been made at least in part with the idea of reassuring South Korean voters and bolstering Mr. Roh's political standing. 
First, North Korea restated its longstanding call for the United States to negotiate a "nonaggression pact," calling that the only way to avoid war on the peninsula. Then it agreed on a new round of reunions for families separated after the Korean War and announced that it had finished clearing mines on its side of the demilitarized zone, a major and much-delayed step toward the promised restoration of rail service between the countries.
North Korea entered the final stage of the campaign in another significant way, as well, when a former candidate, Chung Mong Joon, withdrew his support for Mr. Roh at the last minute, supposedly over differences relating to North Korea. A senior aide to Mr. Chung said Mr. Chung objected to Mr. Roh's reported warning in a speech today that South Korea would be "embroiled" if a war broke out between the United States and North Korea. Mr. Chung, the aide said, believed there was little chance of an American attack on North Korea.
Mr. Kim had staked his presidency on normalizing relations with North Korea and came up short. But he has never abandoned the goal, even as the Bush administration has pushed for sanctions to punish North Korea for its nuclear program and international weapons sales.
Mr. Lee, the conservative challenger, promises an approach to North Korea closely in tune with Washington's policies. But Mr. Roh seems more keen to assert South Korea's right to pursue a different approach. Without South Korea's cooperation, there are limits to the pressure Washington can apply on North Korea, even if Japan is on board.
In recent weeks, Mr. Roh, 56, has repudiated a view he held in the 1980's that the United States should withdraw its troops from South Korea. Against the backdrop of the mushrooming anti-American protests, however, he has said that if elected he would not "kowtow" to Washington and that he would not support the imposition of a deadline for North Korea's compliance with international demands to end its nuclear program. At a news conference two weeks ago, he said he would "guarantee North Korea's security."
Scott Snyder, the Korea representative of the Asia Foundation, said: "Washington is probably going to approach a Roh presidency at least initially with considerable distrust. The challenge to Lee will be in winning over the support of his own people on these issues." 
The different positions of the two candidates have resonated strongly with very distinct demographic groups. Mr. Roh's support is reportedly far stronger among people in their 20's and 30's who have grown up in a cosmopolitan and upwardly mobile South Korea so much richer than its northern neighbor that they cannot easily conceive of the threat. 
Mr. Lee is said to enjoy overwhelming support among people 45 and older, who have memories of the Korean War or of the nation's economic hardships. The older generation typically needs no reminding that North Korea has 13,000 artillery pieces deployed within striking distance of Seoul. This pattern has made people in their 40's a critical swing group, and it has provided special challenges to each candidate for getting his core voters to turn out.
"Koreans are all one people, and it is a bit of a shock to hear the U.S. president calling them an axis of evil," said Kim Hye Young, a 27-year-old advertising agency employee who was out for lunch with two co-workers in Myongdong, a popular shopping area in Seoul that caters to young people. "Bush is very unpopular here because of that."
A few blocks away, though, Jang An Na, a hale 74, was out for the afternoon with women friends of her generation. "Lee's policies toward North Korea are a lot better because he says, 'Let's wait and see if they are going to cooperate before giving them any more money,' " she said. "That seems a lot more prudent to me."

HEADLINE: Nafta to Open Foodgates, Engulfing Rural Mexico 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: IRAPUATO, Mexico, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
A decade of hemispheric economic upheaval finally turned Eugenio Guerrero's life upside down last Saturday. That morning, he tried to auction off the pig farm that has supported his family and some 50 others for two generations.
 "It's true," read a flier that announced the sale. "We are closing and auctioning everything." 
 From now on Mr. Guerrero, 41, will dedicate himself to selling paint.
The changes he has been forced to confront are being felt all over Mexico as the country struggles to keep its balance, one foot in poverty, the other seeking a toehold in prosperity through the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Guerrero said he had barely been able to keep afloat since the treaty began abolishing trade barriers between Mexico, the United States and Canada nearly 10 years ago. Credit ran dry after a national economic crisis devastated banks in 1995. The Mexican government ended most agricultural subsidies, sending his costs through the roof. Pork prices plunged as cheaper imports from the United States flooded Mexican markets. 
Now, Mr. Guerrero's last defense is being dismantled. Under Nafta, on Jan. 1 tariffs on almost all agricultural imports from the United States will end. 
The looming deadline has consumed the attention of a nation where a quarter of the population lives in rural areas, and produced warnings about the possibility of unrest and increased migration across the Mexican countryside and into the United States, as millions of peasants are forced to abandon their tiny fields. 
In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers and their supporters have blocked highways and border crossings. They have temporarily shut down gas and electricity installations, and even burst into Congress on horseback.
President Vicente Fox's government is short of cash and has offered little more than moral support. "In the world today, all sectors have to adapt to the new competitive conditions," the president said. "Agriculture cannot be the exception."
Meanwhile, some, like Mr. Guerrero, grope for ways to hold on to a middle-class way of life, if not their farms. For him, Saturday was the start of another life. 
That morning, Mr. Guerrero, the father of two adolescent sons, held an auction to begin selling off half of his 2,000 pigs. There was no way, he said, that the family business could compete against large-scale pork producers in the United States, who now hold 40 percent of the Mexican market. 
In the United States, a pig can be raised and sold in Iowa for a fifth of what it would cost to raise and sell one in Irapuato. Since Nafta took effect, a third of Mexico's 18,000 swine producers have gone out of business, according to the Mexican Hog Farmers Association. 
Mr. Guerrero said he had laid off all but five of his workers. Most told him they would emigrate to the United States illegally in search of a new start. 
Mr. Guerrero, however, decided to start over at home. He closed Saturday's auction with the sale of a hulking black and white male that went for 40 percent less than he was asking. A few hours later, more resigned than rejoicing, he presided over the grand opening of his new paint store. 
"Mexico will not be a country of producers, it is going to become a country of salesmen," he lamented. "The problem with that is we are putting our independence at risk. We are becoming a country that depends on foreigners for food." 
Mr. Guerrero said he accepted the survival-of-the-fittest laws of free trade. "But Mexico entered the free trade game with serious disadvantages," he added. "Naturally, we are the losers."
It was widely predicted before Nafta took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, that free trade would create a new world of economic winners and losers. Mexico has become the world's ninth largest economy and a powerhouse in the export of manufactured goods. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were created, most of them in assembly plants called maquiladoras.
Food imports from the United States have doubled, from $3.6 billion a year to $7.4 billion. But the food trade has also boomed in the opposite direction. 
Exports to the United States, mostly products made by large Mexican and transnational food processing corporations, have increased from $2.7 billion to nearly $5.3 billion. Among the most notable winners are companies like Grupo Bimbo, Mexico's largest food company, which has taken advantage of cheap grain imports. 
Other winners are Maseca, which has become the world's largest producer of cornmeal and tortillas, and Sigma, which imports cheap pork parts and poultry pastes from the United States to make sandwich meats.
Fruit and vegetable farmers, who benefit from longer seasons of sunshine and cheaper labor than their American competitors, have also increased their exports to the United States under Nafta. 
But many observers say the losses outweigh the gains. Mexico's most difficult challenge has been the fate of some 25 million people who live in the countryside. 
Although agriculture represents less than 5 percent of the gross domestic product, about one in five working Mexicans are directly involved in it. The overwhelming majority are poor subsistence farmers, who work plots as small as two acres. However, midsized farmers are also being devastated.
Poultry farmers, too, are expected to be hit hard when remaining tariffs are lifted on Jan. 1. Currently Mexico places a 48 percent tariff on poultry.
As much as Nafta ignited an economic evolution, said analysts, it has also set off a kind of social landslide as the government struggles, in the span of a decade, to move millions of people from farming into other ways of life. The impact is likely to be felt on both sides of the border.
Some 700,000 people are expected to lose jobs in farming and other food industries next year, warned Armando Paredes Arroyo, president of the National Agriculture Commission. Many may join the estimated 300,000 Mexicans a year who make the illegal journey to the United States. Most are peasant farmers.
Farm leaders pointed to President Bush's farm bill, which promised $180 billion in spending over the next 10 years, as an example of unfair trade practices by the United States. A typical farmer in Mexico receives $722 a year in government subsidies, officials say, while the average American farmer will receive more than $20,000 under the bill signed by President Bush.
President Fox, however, rejected calls to renegotiate or suspend Nafta. The government says the farming crisis is linked in large part to the legacy of government corruption and mismanagement by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which controlled Mexico for seven decades.
In the budget approved last week, the Mexican government pledged $10.2 billion in spending on agriculture next year, an increase of about 4 percent over last year. However, farmers complain, only $4.5 billion will go directly to subsidies.

PERSON: Ezra Solomon 

HEADLINE: Ezra Solomon, 82, Economist Who Shaped Finance Theory 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Ezra Solomon, an economist at Stanford University whose work helped shape modern theories of corporate finance, died on Dec. 9. He was 82.
 The cause was a heart attack, said the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which announced his death on Tuesday. 
 Dr. Solomon's best-known book, "The Theory of Financial Management," appeared in 1963, shortly after he became a professor at Stanford. It is regarded as having helped change the study of finance from a descriptive process into a more rigorous, theory-based discipline.
He served on the president's Council of Economic Advisers from 1971 to 1973, when the Nixon administration suspended the dollar's convertibility into gold and imposed an import surcharge and wage and price controls to try to recast the international financial system.
A result was the end of the so-called Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates for major currencies. That system, established at the end of World War II, was eventually replaced by the present system of floating exchange rates.
Dr. Solomon was recruited to the council by its chairman, Paul W. McCracken. At his Senate confirmation hearings in June 1971, Dr. Solomon hinted at the startling economic moves to come that August when he indicated support for a floating dollar instead of one tied to gold.
"I am not against letting the dollar float; it is one way of finding parity," he said. "It may become necessary that in the future we take the initiative and let the dollar float."
Ezra Solomon was born on March 20, 1920, in Rangoon, Burma, when it was a part of British India. He graduated from the University of Rangoon in 1940 and then fled the Japanese army by going to India, where he joined the Royal Navy.
In 1950, he received his doctorate from the University of Chicago. In 1956, he joined the graduate business school there as a professor of finance. He moved to Stanford in 1961. He was the author of 13 books.
His wife, Janet, died last month. 
He is survived by three daughters, Catherine Shan Solomon of Newark, Calif.; Ming Solomon Lovejoy of Eureka, Mont.; and Laura Solomon-Oyarce of Stanford, Calif.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
ESPN's new message: Sports is not a metaphor for life, sports is life. So name your child ESPN.

BYLINE:  By Sean Mehegan 

 BODY:
IN its efforts to be a ubiquitous part of the sports world, ESPN has few media rivals. The flagship channel is available in 87 million homes and has 97 percent awareness among American adults, according to ESPN executives, who say that certain truly fanatical parents have even given their children the network's brand name.
 Now, ESPN plans to celebrate the face-painter in us all with a campaign that makes the none-too-subtle point to both viewers and advertisers that the cable network is synonymous with sports. 
 The effort from ESPN, a division of the Walt Disney Company, is called "Without Sports," and will begin Monday. It is ESPN's first comprehensive brand campaign, as opposed to ads for specific programming like its sports news show, "SportsCenter." Neither ESPN nor its agency, Wieden & Kennedy in New York, would disclose the budget. But Lee Ann Daly, senior vice president for marketing at ESPN, said the network would spend more on this campaign than any other in its history. In recent years, the biggest ESPN spending came in 2000, with expenditures on major media advertising totaling $30.5 million, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
Known mainly for zany commercials featuring big-name athletes rampaging through its studios in Bristol, Conn., ESPN is adopting a slightly different -- though still humorous -- tone for "Without Sports." 
In one commercial, "Gathering," a group of Spanish relatives are in a small living room, watching a soccer match between the traditional rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona. Half the relatives support Real Madrid, the other half Barcelona. One player takes a dive and a penalty is called, leading to a huge argument among the relatives. The tagline is, "Without sports, what would bring a family together?"
The print and outdoor ads, including ones tailored for New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities, offer philosophical musings as "Without sports, would you know how to spell J-E-T-S?" and "Without sports, weekends would be weekdays"
"It's like holding up a mirror to all of us," Ms. Daly said. "The idea is that sports aren't a metaphor for life, sports are life. Sports really do forge connections between people. They shape how we interact with each other."
Ty Montague, co-creative director at Wieden & Kennedy, added: "The goal for the campaign is to re-energize sports fans' relationship with sports. There has been an inevitable decline in people's ability to pay attention to sports as the number of entertainment outlets has grown in the culture. This campaign is designed to put people back in touch with the elements of sports that are positive and uplifting."
The campaign could also help woo prospective advertisers for the various ESPN networks, said Chris Dixon, a media analyst at UBS Warburg. "The campaign catches those magic moments, but rather than catching the moment, it catches the people watching it," he said. "And by the way, advertisers, if you want to reach these people, you'd better come to us."
ESPN is ultimately planning to run up to 30 executions of the campaign. ESPN and Wieden used seven production houses and that many directors, including the documentary filmmaker Errol Morris.
TV ads will appear during the major college bowl games and also during the Super Bowl, which belongs to a fellow Disney property, ABC. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that any of the ads will appear during the N.F.L. playoffs. CBS and NBC won't broadcast ESPN's ads, and Fox remains a question mark, said Ms. Daly. "We might opportunistically buy local time at Fox," she said.
The campaign comes at a time when ESPN's hegemony over the sports programming world is just about complete. Fox Sports Net, a collection of 21 regional cable networks, has retreated from competing with ESPN on national news shows, and AOL Time Warner earlier this year closed CNN/SI. 
ESPN is the first network to have contracts for all four major sports -- football, basketball, baseball and hockey -- simultaneously. ESPN's ratings in 2002 have jumped 14 percent in the 24-hour time period and 16 percent during prime time, the president, George Bodenheimer, told analysts recently. The company is projected to produce $2.12 billion in revenue this year, up 1.5 percent from 2001, according to Broadcasting and Cable magazine.

HEADLINE: Bush Officials Vowing to Seek Tough Penalties In Wall St. Cases 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
As they try to restore confidence in financial markets, senior Bush administration officials are planning to seek tougher corporate fraud penalties and to prosecute vigorously the lawyers, bankers, accountants and others who have failed to detect the scandals that have rocked Wall Street.
 Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson said in an interview that he had instructed prosecutors to take a harder look at "what kind of advice the outside professionals gave to these companies and whether or not they were complicit in the wrongdoing." 
 The aim, Justice Department officials said, is to broaden the pool of suspects who may ultimately be prosecuted. Specifically, they want to move investigations beyond boardrooms and executive suites and into the offices of professional firms that advise companies, as prosecutors did with Arthur Andersen, Enron's accountant. 
"You will be seeing more prosecutions of individual professionals," a senior Justice Department official said.
"We're making this a focus," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "In the past, there's been a tendency to go after mainly the executives at the companies themselves. We want to make sure our investigations are broader than that. Major corporate accounting fraud cannot happen over an extended period of time without the complicity of accountants and lawyers and other professionals."
At the same time, the Justice Department -- criticized in some quarters for a sluggish approach to white-collar crime -- is pushing to enact tougher sentencing guidelines to punish companies, executives and outside professionals.
The United States Sentencing Commission has proposed stiffer sentencing guidelines under the corporate reform bill that Congress passed last summer, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. But the Justice Department is urging major revisions in the commission's plan because, the official said, the department does not think it goes far enough. "We have a very different idea of what Congress meant," the official said.
Mr. Thompson, who leads the task force the president created in July, said he thought that the government needed tougher penalties to deter executives from defrauding shareholders. "These people who abuse the public trust and adversely affect the lives of millions of Americans have to be appropriately punished," he said. "I think an adjustment would accurately reflect the magnitude and scope of the wrongdoing."
The push to broaden corporate crime investigations comes as the White House, after dismissing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and its top economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, is struggling to regain its footing on economic issues. 
Restoring investor confidence is seen as one crucial part of that effort, and it offers the administration a chance to seize the initiative and deflect criticism from some Democrats who believe that the administration has coddled big business.
Since the creation of the fraud task force, it has overseen more than 100 investigations into allegations of white-collar crime, securing about 50 convictions, according to newly compiled Justice Department data.
Investigations have ranged from high-profile cases at Enron, WorldCom and Adelphia Communications to lesser-known companies like Mercury Finance, a Chicago-based lender, and the El Paso Corporation, an energy trader in Texas.
Mr. Thompson, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer in Atlanta who is often mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee, said he is tracking 20 to 30 investigations and receives a weekly briefing on Enron.
"What we have done," he said, "is help restore America's confidence in the market and, most importantly, help send a message to Americans that these people who abuse the public confidence are not going to get away with what they did."
Others are not so sure.
Some corporate lawyers and Democrats in Congress have begun to question the performance of the task force. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that what Mr. Thompson is overseeing "is all important work, but it remains mostly a mystery since the Justice Department has been slow to respond to Congressional oversight requests."
Some critics question whether the fraud inquiries of the Justice Department may have lost some of their vigor after a burst of prosecutions of executives at Enron and Arthur Andersen. They say the problem may start at the top of the department.
Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the Enron investigation because of contributions he received as a senator from Enron executives.
Some critics have called on Mr. Thompson to step down from the case as well because his former law firm represented both Enron and Arthur Andersen. And a conservative public interest group, Judicial Watch, filed a lawsuit in August that accused Mr. Thompson of helping artificially inflate the stock of the Providian Financial Corporation when he was a director. Mr. Thompson made at least $1 million from the sale of his stock.
Mr. Thompson denies any wrongdoing in his sale of the stock and said questions about it have not distracted the task force. "I think my record speaks for itself," he said. "And more important, I think our results speak for themselves. I don't think anyone can say that we have been soft or done anything but vigorously assert the interests of the people of the United States in the prosecution of these terrible matters."
Stephen M. Cutler, head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, stressed in a speech last week that officials must adopt "a new enforcement model" to hold accounting firms responsible.
One cause of the recent scandals, he said, "was the laxity of the so-called gatekeepers -- the accountants, lawyers, research analysts, board members and others controlling access to our capital markets."
The Justice Department task force has given preliminary recommendations to Mr. Ashcroft and to the White House on legislative and regulatory proposals intended to reduce the number of corporate scandals, Mr. Thompson said.
A high priority, officials said, is to persuade the sentencing commission to enact tougher guidelines. In October, the Justice Department sent the commission a letter urging stronger guidelines "to ensure that all but relatively minor business crimes will result in prison time."
Justice Department officials said they were concerned the guidelines being proposed by the sentencing commission gave judges too much flexibility to use charitable work, employment records and family ties -- often strengths of white-collar defendants -- to reduce sentences.
This approach "feeds the public perception that businesspeople who steal are treated far more leniently than 'street criminals,' " the department said.
While the prospect of tougher sentences carries strong political value, some academic and industry experts say they doubt that many executives will receive long prison terms or that new penalties will provide much of a deterrent.
Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said tougher industry regulation and oversight were needed as well. "If you have to rely primarily on after-the-fact criminal prosecutions," he said, "that's in effect saying that the system isn't working as well as it should be."

HEADLINE: FedEx Profit Flat But Sales Are Up 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation said today that its second-quarter profit was flat despite a 10 percent increase in sales.
 The results were better than Wall Street expected. 
Executives said the company's diversified services allowed it to weather the difficult economy. 
 Shares of FedEx closed lower, falling 69 cents, to $52.91.
FedEx, which includes the world's largest cargo airline, reported net income of $245 million, or 81 cents a share, for the quarter ended Nov. 30, unchanged from the quarter a year earlier. Last year's second quarter included a $17 million tax gain. 
Revenue for the quarter was $5.67 billion, up from $5.14 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
The results beat Wall Street estimates of 78 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
FedEx Ground continued its strong growth, as its package volume grew 25 percent; FedEx Express package volume increased 5 percent. 
FedEx International Priority volume grew 13 percent in the second quarter, again led by exports from Asia, where volume increased 27 percent over last year.
"Our ground and freight operations are showing strong revenue and profit momentum," said Alan B. Graf Jr., the chief financial officer, "while Express continues to achieve solid growth in its international operations and excellent results from its U.S. Postal Service transportation agreement."

HEADLINE: Chief of Monsanto Resigns After String of Poor Results 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Hendrik A. Verfaillie, the president and chief executive of the Monsanto Company, resigned unexpectedly today after a series of bad profit reports.
 Monsanto, one of the world's largest agriculture and biotechnology companies, said that Mr. Verfaillie, who had been in the job for just two years, submitted his resignation this morning at a regularly scheduled board meeting. 
 Mr. Verfaillie, a longtime Monsanto executive who helped pioneer the introduction of genetically modified crops, did not give a reason for his resignation. But the board called his decision to resign "mutual," citing Monsanto's disappointing performance over the last two years. 
Through the first three quarters of this year, Monsanto has reported losses of $1.7 billion on sharply weaker sales of its popular Roundup herbicide in the United States and Latin America.
Monsanto said today that Frank V. AtLee III, the company's chairman, would serve as interim chief executive until a successor to Mr. Verfaillie was appointed. Mr. AtLee was formerly a top executive at the American Cyanamid Corporation.
Shares of Monsanto, which are down nearly 44 percent this year, tumbled 5.9 percent today, to $19.02.
Analysts praised Mr. Verfaillie, 57, as a skillful leader who played a crucial role in helping transform Monsanto from an old chemical company into the world's leader in herbicide sales and biotechnology seeds.
Monsanto now dominates the market with its popular Roundup herbicide and its genetically modified corn, soybean and cotton seeds, which are planted on about 100 million acres worldwide.
But several analysts said Mr. Verfaillie's performance as chief executive was hurt this year after the company was forced to acknowledge that its profit estimates were far too optimistic. Twice this year the company told analysts to lower their estimates because of weather problems in the United States and a continuing economic crisis in South America.
Some analysts said Mr. Verfaillie was the victim of a sluggish market.
"It's a disappointment that he's leaving," said John Moten, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. "He's a guy who helped build the business. Was he in a rough spot? Yes. But was it enough to resign? I didn't think so."
Other analysts said they thought there might have been philosophical differences between Mr. Verfaillie and members of the board. Some analysts also think Monsanto may be ripe for a takeover.
A spokeswoman for Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, declined to comment on such speculation.
Monsanto, however, has gone through tremendous changes over the last few years. The company's aggressive move into biotechnology has been attacked by environmental and antiglobalization activists. The company was acquired by Pharmacia in 2000 and spun off into a public concern with Pharmacia retaining an 85 percent stake. Pharmacia, which is being acquired by Pfizer Inc., completed a full spinoff earlier this year, separating itself from Monsanto.
Mr. Verfaillie, who was born in Belgium, has been with Monsanto for 26 years. He was president and chief operating officer in the late 1990's. After being named chief executive in 2000, he helped the company, known for its aggressive adoption of biotechnology, to develop a softer, more conciliatory image aimed at opponents of the technology.
As chief executive, he acknowledged that the company was blinded by its enthusiasm to move its products to market. In what the company called the Monsanto Pledge, he promised that Monsanto would be more open and respectful in its approach to pushing the biotechnology offerings, that it would share its technology with others and that Monsanto would not use genes taken from humans or animals for use in its products. Since then, opposition to Monsanto's biotechnology crops has subsided some even though biotech acreage has continued to rise.

HEADLINE: VISIONS FOR GROUND ZERO: AN APPRAISAL; 
The Latest Round of Designs Rediscover and Celebrate the Vertical Life

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Built or only imagined, architectural designs all contribute to the larger cause of making cities live. Yesterday, New York got its first look at the latest round of designs for ground zero. 
 In our hype-drenched era, a critic will have to risk raising cynical eyebrows with superlatives adequate to the occasion. Let them rise. Let them arch into furious knots. The architects have risen to the occasion. So should we. 
 Organized as a study project, the new set of plans is sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the state agency created to supervise new construction in the financial district. Unlike the initial group of proposals released by the agency last July, these plans throb with energy, imagination, intelligence and the sheer thrill of contributing to a battered city's rebirth. 
For that is what this is about. "Vertical is to live, horizontal is to die," the designer Buckminster Fuller once said. No one knows that better than New Yorkers. We come here to live the vertical life. We actually like vertigo. These architects have rediscovered verticality for a new generation.
The design teams and their offerings follow, in almost no particular order of preference.
Studio Daniel Libeskind. If you are looking for the marvelous, here's where you will find it. Daniel Libeskind's project attains a perfect balance between aggression and desire. It will provoke many viewers to exclaim that yes, this design is actually better than what was there before.
The project's power is partly rooted in Mr. Libeskind's immigrant experience: this guy actually arrived by boat. On a mythical level, at least, most of us have experienced the wonder and fright of arrival in the big city, the simultaneous sense of freedom and intimidation, the exhilaration of moving into the unknown.
Mr. Libeskind has captured these emotions, or, I should say, recaptured them, for in truth the twin towers, with their grand Egyptian scale, shattered the crystalline formation of the legendary Lower Manhattan skyline that once greeted voyagers as their ships slipped into New York Harbor. Mr. Libeskind has fashioned a new set of crystals, brilliantly faceted skyscrapers, forms that recreate the aspiration many architects felt when plate glass was new.
Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl. We owe to the 18th century the perception that beauty begins with fear. That is what 19th-century painters of the sublime sought to capture in their landscapes. New York's beauty starts from the same place: the sharp intake of breath that would eventually find its way into the words awe and aesthetic. Put another way, this design welcomes us home to the town that drives us nuts.
Titled Memorial Square, the design presents five towers arranged at a 90-degree angle at the northeast corner of ground zero. The towers are joined by aerial bridges to create a hinged megastructure that resembles a soaring pair of gates. 
The rectilinear geometry is crisply abstract. And the design draws on the power of abstraction to evoke emotions associated with presence and absence, separation and reunion.
This is the one people are going to be fighting about. Superficially, the design ignores the lessons that postmodernism was supposed to have taught us about context, scale, accommodation and reassurance. It may strike some as a throwback to the megastructural superblocks of the 1960's. So what? The project makes its own kind of statement. Continuity with the epic ethos of the modern era is part of what it has to say.
Foster & Partners. Norman Foster's design is one's favorite new hate. Sometimes it seems that when the British peer over the horizon, all they see is Singapore. Lord Foster is a great architect. He conducts his research with terrifying thoroughness, he integrates his information with elegant logic, and he renders it into deceptively simple forms.
Here, the twin towers are reborn as one, a Siamese twin of a skyscraper that would be the world's tallest. The footprints of the towers become walled enclosures, below ground level, for memory and contemplation. 
The project has success written all over it. But why does it leave us with the impression that it would be far happier in Hong Kong?
Because, at this moment in history, corporate smoothness, even at its most refined, cannot escape being read as a form of indifference to those who stand in its way. Yet some may consider the project's emotional reserve as a soothing relief from the overpowering emotions now attached to the site.
Think collaboration. Includes Rafael Vinoly, Frederic Schwartz, Ken Smith and Shigeru Ban. With two nods in the direction of Russian Constructivism and another at Louis Kahn, the Think group has imagined two helical matrices that would be the tallest structures in the world and contain buildings designed by different architects.
The towers would be entirely dedicated to cultural programming: performing arts, galleries, a convention center, viewing platforms, aerial parks and a memorial in the sky. Commercial and office spaces would be built incrementally in lower buildings on the site's perimeter.
The strategy is to channel public funds into public amenities, while it is available, and allow market forces to drive the timetable for future development.
United Architects collaboration. Includes Greg Lynn, Ben van Berkel, Jesse Reiser and Kevin Kennen. The designers might want to rechristen themselves The International House of Voluptuous Beauty. Greg Lynn is already the most influential form-maker of his generation. He has also pioneered the practice of multicity collaboration -- the paperless, virtual office made possible by computer technology.
The same technology drives Mr. Lynn's designs, which are often modeled with animation software. With this collaboration, however, Mr. Lynn is moving beyond the "blob" design that first brought him wide attention. As if progressing up the evolutionary scale, he and his partners have shifted from amoebas to worms.
United Architects' proposal reimagines the old modern dream of the vertical city, recasting it in the far more ancient image of dwellings carved into stone cliffs. Here, the stone has turned to quartz, the cliffs into rectangular tubes that gently twist and undulate as they rise skyward. The design is rooted in a love of form for form's sake. This is not an ignoble form of social service for architects to be undertaking in a city that has become all too accustomed to letting form follow fear.
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Michael Maltzan, Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, Elyn Zimmerman and others. Given Skidmore's passion for historical precedent, it is likely that memories of San Gemignano came up at least once while this group was at work. The proposal does indeed recall the medieval silhouette of that beloved Italian hill town, and the analogy between the Dark Ages and our time would be apt. All high-rise construction, not just at ground zero, will be driven by security precautions at a level not seen since the golden age of castle keeps.
Skidmore, in fact, has pioneered the development of the "sacrificial facade," a technique that allows architects to design glass-skinned buildings capable of withstanding the blast from car bombs. For this project, the designers have even endowed a moat with the shimmering poetry of Lancelot's lake. A cluster of glass towers rise from the water, which would cover more than half of the 16-acre site.
Peterson Littenberg. This team has sketched the portrait of a city with low self-esteem, a New York that has stopped believing in its present potential and future prospects. 
Though the project is intended to evoke some great golden oldies from New York history -- Rockefeller Center, Columbus Circle -- its outlook is actually rooted in the 1970's, when the city's fiscal crisis made many believe that our best days were past. Now this approach looks as dated as disco.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Higher Prices Become Norm In Gas Market

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
That natural gas prices have risen 40 percent in the last month seems normal at first glance. It is winter, after all, and a large portion of the country heats with gas.
 But industry executives and analysts say that natural gas prices at today's levels, more than $5 per million British thermal units, underscore a fundamental shift toward consistently higher prices. 
 Through most of the 1990's, natural gas prices generally were $1.75 to $2.50 per million B.T.U.'s, according to Vince White, a spokesman for Devon Energy, an oil and gas exploration and production company based in Oklahoma City. But in the last three years, they have hovered at $2.50 to $5 per million B.T.U.'s. 
"Relative to the past, prices are higher," Mr. White said, "and we think they will be higher for several years."
Several factors are keeping prices up, including a paucity of large producing fields, a broad hesitancy among companies to explore new reservoirs, and the erosion of trading in electricity and natural gas in the wake of the scandals at Enron and elsewhere in the energy industry.
"There is lower supply now, and the outlook is for less supply in 2003," said Bill Oliver, president of the midstream and marketing businesses of EnCana, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, and is the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production company in North America. "The industry may be 'prospect poor,' especially if you are talking about large exploration projects that could make a big difference in supplies."
As higher prices are becoming the norm, some analysts worry that they may exact a big toll on the economy, especially with the current recovery so tepid.
"Natural gas prices will play through the economy one way or another, and they will do major damage," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "It's used by industry, by homes, 95 percent of all new electric generation. The price of natural gas could prove a major consumption tax on the economy, and that isn't good."
At the core, prices are up because supplies are down. There is less gas in storage than there was last year, and the weather is much colder. Gas production this year is about 4 percent to 6 percent lower than a year ago, according to analysts' estimates.
But the twist is that prices this year have been relatively robust, averaging around $3.20, and in past years, such prices would have spurred more drilling for gas by companies like Devon Energy.
Still, there are fewer gas rigs functioning this year in the United States than last, according to data from Baker Hughes, an oil field services company.
"We've been surprised by the disconnect between high commodity prices and drilling activity," Mr. Goldstein said. "Companies have been husbanding their cash and have been very conservative about which projects they are pursuing."
Rather than pursuing the big new fields, Mr. Oliver of EnCana said, North American oil and gas companies are developing what holdings they already have, which are generally older, and therefore smaller, reservoirs.
The new North American fields are riskier than those discovered in the past, industry executives said, being situated in places like the harsh MacKenzie River delta in northwest Canada and in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration and development of these new reservoirs are extremely expensive. And companies now are using their cash to strengthen their balance sheets, the executives said, after a tide of mergers over the last two years that consolidated the industry.
Mr. White of Devon Energy says that newly unified, bigger companies are inherently more conservative about new drilling when prices are favorable, as they are now. "Just because you have a brief period of higher prices doesn't necessarily stimulate drilling more wells anymore," he said, "because you don't know what the future holds."
A year of energy trading scandals has also reduced participation in the over-the-counter markets in power and gas, industry executives said. Those still trading, the executives say, are less willing to take big hedging positions on prices, and as a result, prices have become more volatile.
Steps to ease the supply squeeze are still a few years away, executives and analysts said. Yesterday, Dynegy Inc. received approval from the federal government to build the first new liquefied natural gas terminal in the United States in the last 25 years. The CMS Energy Corporation also gained approval to expand its terminal in Louisiana.
Liquefying natural gas allows it to be transported greater distances. It is an expensive option, but high prices may support it, and the dwindling supplies in the United States may demand it. The new terminal is expected to be completed by late 2006.
Oil and gas companies are also trying to get the approvals and the tax breaks to build a pipeline to bring gas to the lower 48 states from Alaska and the MacKenzie River delta. But executives said the earliest the Canadian fields would begin pumping would be 2008, and those in Alaska, perhaps in 2011.
"Things will get better over time," Mr. Oliver said, "but it will take time."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The usual decorouswaltz between prices and sales becomes a lively tango in the world of online sales.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. E-mail: hal@sims.berkeley.edu.

 BODY:
ONLINE shopping was supposed to revolutionize the way we buy. That hasn't happened quite yet, but economic research on online commerce is booming.
 According to Census Bureau estimates, online purchases in the United States totaled more than $11 billion in the third quarter this year, up 34 percent over the period in 2001. 
 Despite this impressive growth, online sales are still tiny compared with total retail sales, which were $827 billion in the third quarter. 
Though online sales are not yet important economically, they are important to economists because they offer a rich source of economic data. It is much easier to collect online prices than offline prices, and with a little bit of ingenuity, you can even harvest data about costs and sales volume, information that is awfully hard to come by in the real world.
The economists Michael R. Baye and Patrick Scholten of Indiana University and John Morgan of the University of California at Berkeley have collected data from online price-comparison sites for over two years. They offer summaries of this information at www.nash-equilibrium.com.
Take a look, for example, at their measure of "Internet competitiveness," an aggregate statistic of various indicators of how competitive online prices are.
For the last year, prices advertised online have been increasing, so competitiveness has declined. But in the last few weeks competitiveness has spiked, perhaps because of an attempt by online merchants to clear out inventories of unsold products.
Another interesting statistic is "relative dispersion," which measures the variation in advertised prices. This measure has grown significantly in the last two years and now stands at about 11 percent. This means that about 32 percent of the advertised prices for a given item vary by more than 11 percent from the average price.
Why is the dispersion of advertised prices so high online? Glenn Ellison and Sara Fisher Ellison, both economists at M.I.T., have shown that "bait and switch" is a common practice among Internet sites.
A computer parts site may advertise a memory module at a rock-bottom price. But when potential buyers click through to the site, they find that it is an inferior model and that the price they must pay for a standard model is much higher.
One of the Ellisons' findings is that the online world can be incredibly competitive for commodity items. Their estimates imply that if a vendor of a low-quality memory module raises the price 1 percent, it could find that sales drop as much as 40 percent. It's rare to see such intense competition for products in the real world.
Judith A. Chevalier and Austan Goolsbee, professors at the Yale School of Management and the University of Chicago Business School, respectively, have looked at a particular case of online competition: Barnesandnoble.com versus Amazon.com.
Each seller ranks titles by total sales on its Web site and reports actual book sales to publishers. Some publishers, like the computer book publisher O'Reilly & Associates, have used these reports to determine the relationship between rank and actual sales.
Professors Chevalier and Goolsbee draw on such estimates, as well as other sources, to determine actual sales for particular books at the two online booksellers.
The data on actual sales can be used to estimate how demand responds to price changes. The authors find that a 1 percent price increase at Amazon reduces sales there by about 0.5 percent, but a 1 percent price increase at Barnes & Noble means a 4 percent sales decline -- eight times as large.
The difference in price responsiveness is striking. It appears that Amazon's investment in building customer loyalty has paid off. Of course, all that investment in customer loyalty is expensive, and loyalty doesn't necessarily translate directly into profit.
The impression one gets from looking at online consumer behavior is that there are two types of online consumers: some relentlessly shop for the lowest price, while others are happy to buy at a reliable brand-name merchant. Faced with these two groups of price-sensitive and price-insensitive consumers, sellers will find it in their interest to vary their prices. This allows them to sell, on average, at a high price to the price-insensitive group, while still competing for the price-sensitive customers.
The Baye-Morgan-Scholten team has developed some models of this sort of competition, based on earlier models of sales and other forms of price promotion. I wrote one of the early papers in the literature, in 1980, and it has been gratifying to see this work resurrected in recent years.
This experience shows what I have long believed: you don't need a new economics to understand the "new economy." Many of the phenomena that are unfolding now in online markets have their parallels in the real world.
What has changed are the transaction costs. Searching for the lowest price used to be a costly activity; now it can be performed automatically by shopbots. Changing prices used to be costly for merchants, but now it can be done with a keystroke.
In the first instance, this makes markets for commodity products, like memory modules, much more competitive. But by the same token, it also leads sellers to invest in finding ways to differentiate their products through their personalized services, policies on returns, services like recommendations and one-click shopping, and the like. Consumers who find these services valuable buy from the sites that provide them, while other, less demanding shoppers buy at bare-bones sites that offer low prices.
The same economic forces that lead to premium and discount sellers in the offline world are at work in the online world. But the differences in transaction costs make the price differences both more extreme and easier to observe, a result that is a great boon to economists who study retail behavior.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Says Del Monte Sale Was Rigged 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA with DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Early in 1996, a Mexican investment group with ties to the government received several preliminary bids, some worth more than $250 million, to acquire the equity of Fresh Del Monte Produce, the global grower of bananas, pineapples and other fruit and vegetables.
 But just as the investors -- who had taken control after their original chairman had become a fugitive -- were about to close a deal, the group's board abruptly sold Del Monte for a much lower price to a little-known company run by Palestinians. The terms were so unfavorable, a number of minority investors thought at the time, that they tried, unsuccessfully, to block the sale. 
 A lawsuit filed in a Miami court yesterday by seven private and corporate minority investors includes allegations that may shed light on why Del Monte was sold for so much less than it seemed to be worth. The suit accuses Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh and his company, the IAT Group, of bribing Eduardo R. Bours, a powerful Mexican politician who was chairman of the investment group and an important member of the country's ruling party, to rig the sale in their favor. 
The lawsuit is based in part on the affidavit of an executive who worked closely with Mr. Bours and who has evidence of a curious payment of $321,000 that ended up in Mr. Bours's bank account after the sale was completed. The suit contends that the amount represents just a portion of a payoff that Mr. Bours received to help the Abu-Ghazalehs buy Del Monte at bargain rates.
In a telephone interview from his home state, Sonora, Mr. Bours denied taking any bribe and defended the sale to IAT as the best deal at the time. Lawyers for Del Monte in New York called the accusations "utterly baseless."
Still, the allegations of bribery and fraud may cause trouble for Fresh Del Monte Produce, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Last month, rumors about another suit challenging the 1996 sale as fraudulent were enough to batter Del Monte stock. Trading was halted for an afternoon after the stock tumbled by more than $5, to $20.75 a share. The stock stabilized after the company rebutted the allegations, but it has languished below $20.
And while there is no evidence against him, the questions could also prove awkward for Marvin P. Bush, a younger brother of the president, who has been on Del Monte's board since 1998. Marvin Bush is not mentioned in the suit, and he had no links to the company at the time of the 1996 sale. He did not return several phone calls seeking comment.
Most of all, the suit opens a new chapter in the bizarre recent history of Del Monte, dating to the days before its acquisition in 1992 by Carlos Cabal Peniche, the fugitive chairman. At that time, associates say, Mr. Cabal turned to a spiritual adviser to come up with a unique bid that invoked the Mayan spirits of southern Mexico. The adviser, the Rev. Jacques Charveriet, urged Mr. Cabal to make an offer with as many fives as possible because that number is a figure of fortune in Mayan legend.
His associates say Mr. Cabal was ecstatic when the seller accepted his preliminary bid of $555,555,555.55 for Del Monte, one of the world's most recognizable brand names. The purchase fit right into the plans of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who was busy trying to modernize Mexico's economy and reform its agricultural sector. Buying Del Monte was seen as a way to give Mexican produce instant global recognition.
The government provided special financing to a group of 150 Mexican investors led by Mr. Cabal, a shrimp exporter who had already purchased two Mexican banks with government support.
The Del Monte operations already had a rocky past. The Del Monte Corporation was purchased in 1979 by R. J. Reynolds, which later acquired Nabisco Brands. After Kohlberg Kravis Roberts arranged its notorious leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in late 1988, Del Monte was split into three divisions -- canned fruit and vegetables, international canned foods and fresh produce -- and the divisions were sold separately.
The fresh produce division was purchased in 1989 by Polly Peck International, a conglomerate run by Asil Nadir, a financier. But allegations of fraud and financial irregularities caused Polly Peck to collapse, and Del Monte Produce was put up for sale again in 1992.
But in 1994, Mr. Cabal, bleeding cash, was charged with bank fraud. When he fled Mexico, the government seized the company.
After Mr. Cabal became a fugitive, the investors' group -- Grupo Empresarial Agricultura Mexicano, or G.E.A.M. -- took control of Del Monte. Mr. Bours, the head of a Mexican national business council, was named chairman and quickly hired Lehman Brothers as an adviser on selling Del Monte. 
The investors' suit, to support their claim that the Abu-Ghazalehs were able to buy Del Monte for far less than it was worth, cites a letter from Christopher B. Harned, a Lehman executive, to Mr. Bours on March 28, 1996. The letter indicated that two bids, for $250 million and $275 million, had been received for the equity of Fresh Del Monte Produce and a transportation company, Global Reefer Carriers, that it owned. Beyond that, the bidders -- who have not been publicly identified -- agreed to assume $300 million in debt.
But the lawsuit claims that their bids became moot as soon as the IAT Group entered the picture. IAT, the third-largest fruit exporter in Chile, was controlled by the Abu-Ghazaleh family, Palestinians from Jerusalem with business interests in the Middle East. Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, the current chairman of Fresh Del Monte Produce, had planted the family's flag in Chile in the 1980's, taking advantage of Chile's seasonal counterbalance to North America.
In May 1996, Mr. Bours traveled to Chile to see Mr. Abu-Ghazaleh. The next month, he signed a letter of intent to sell Del Monte to IAT. In contrast with the earlier bids for at least $250 million, the Abu-Ghazalehs offered about $120 million. The offer consisted of $22 million in cash; $43 million borrowed from Rabobank, the investment bank that helped package the deal; and $55 million in seller financing from the Mexican government. 
It proved to be an exceptionally good deal. Only 10 months after the purchase closed in December 1996, IAT sold 35 percent of Del Monte in an initial public offering for $255 million, putting a value on the company of about $730 million.
The lawsuit contends that one reason IAT could purchase Del Monte so cheaply was because of a write-off of nearly $139 million that G.E.A.M. took after Mr. Bours's trip to Chile. That helped bring the apparent value of the company in line with the offer. But the lawsuit says the write-off does not explain why the other bidders were still willing to pay more. Moreover, it came as a surprise to other investors in G.E.A.M., which had rejected an earlier suggestion from Coopers & Lybrand that it write down $56 million in assets.
Mr. Bours defended the terms of the sale, saying that when Lehman investigated the other bids more fully, it found that they lacked sufficient financial backing. "By far the best proposal was the one we had from IAT," he said. 
Lehman Brothers, which eventually signed off on the deal, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
But from inside the highest ranks of G.E.A.M., the transaction was looked on as doubtful. Edgardo Valencia, then coordinator general of the group and a member of its board, said in a recent interview that he had been troubled by the deal but had done nothing to stop it. About four months later, however, a mysterious note raised his suspicions again, he said. 
The note, on Del Monte letterhead, instructed G.E.A.M. to pay Del Monte $321,000 "in repayment of certain debts and related expenses." Mr. Valencia, who in his position had to approve all payments of $5,000 or more, thought the note was odd because it came four months after the sale and lacked detail. He asked Mr. Bours about it. "Bours instructed me to just sign it," Mr. Valencia said. "I didn't understand, but I knew that if I am instructed to do anything, I have to do it."
Mr. Valencia said in an affidavit and an interview that Mr. Bours later told him that the money had been intended to cover his personal taxes. Following instructions, Mr. Valencia arranged for Del Monte -- now under IAT's control -- to transfer the $321,000 into Mr. Bours's personal account at Bank One in Tucson.
In a strongly worded letter almost a year later, Coopers & Lybrand refused to approve G.E.A.M.'s 1997 audit until it found sufficient documentation authorizing the payment. The dispute was not mentioned in the October 1997 public offering.
It took another eight months before Coopers & Lybrand finally released the audit. Lawyers for Del Monte say it was all just a misunderstanding. They produced records showing that on Nov. 26, 1998, long after the $321,000 payment, G.E.A.M.'s shareholders approved a resolution ratifying the payment to compensate Mr. Bours for work he had done as chairman of the group, and, briefly, of Del Monte. Mr. Bours said the payment had indeed been for taxes, as laid out in his contract. He said he did not recall any problems with the Coopers audit.
Mr. Valencia, however, questioned why a big company like Del Monte would allow itself to be used to make such an unusual paymentunless there had been a prior agreement between IAT and Mr. Bours. "Any evidence of the big bribe, I don't have," he said. "But I do have evidence of something I consider to be illegal."
Mr. Bours said, "I didn't receive a penny" in bribes, and he denied all the accusations in the lawsuit. A Mexican senator, he is now a candidate for governor in Sonora. 
In 1999, Mr. Valencia sued G.E.A.M. and Mr. Bours in Mexican courts to recover some $2 million in profit sharing and bonuses that he claims he and five other former employees were owed. He made similar accusations against Mr. Bours at the time. Robert T. Greig, a lawyer with Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton in New York, which represents Del Monte, called the accusations in the lawsuit "nothing new" and said all aspects of the 1996 transaction had been done according to law.
But Andres Rivero, a lawyer with Sullivan Rivero and Chase in Miami who represents the Mexican investors, stands by the allegations. "Bribe payments to C.E.O.'s in order to commit fraud in the purchase of a public company are always novel and unusual," he said.
Del Monte also faces a threatened suit by Eastbrook Caribe, an offshore investment company owned by Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, a Saudi banker who financed many of Mr. Cabal's acquisitions in the late 1980's. In that suit, which set off the market rumors about Del Monte, Eastbrook claims that there was conspiracy and securities fraud that invalidated the 1996 sale.
Del Monte lawyers dismissed Eastbrook's allegations as "frivolous and without merit," saying that Eastbrook lost any standing when it accepted $14.1 million on behalf of itself and Mr. Cabal as a settlement in a previous suit.

PERSON: Charles E. Fraser 

HEADLINE: Charles E. Fraser, 73, Dies; Developer of Hilton Head 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Charles E. Fraser, a developer who took Hilton Head Island -- a woody, sparsely populated barrier island off the South Carolina coast -- and turned it into a haven of expensive homes, golf courses and tennis courts, died in a boating accident on Sunday in the West Indies. He was 73.
 Mr. Fraser and his wife, Mary, were on a chartered 29-foot boat in the Turks and Caicos Islands when the stern exploded, his daughter Wyman Fraser Davis said. Mr. Fraser was dead when his body was recovered. Mrs. Fraser suffered minor injuries. 
 They lived in Brevard, N.C., but maintained a home on Hilton Head.
Mr. Fraser's development of Hilton Head began when he persuaded his father, an Army general, to sell him the southern third of the island, which was named for a British sea captain who explored it. At the time the island had a population of about 600, mostly the descendants of slaves, who after the Civil War earned the rights to the rice plantations on which they had worked.
The two men were able to persuade the state to build a two-lane bridge in 1956 before beginning the 5,000-acre project, named Sea Pines Plantation, the next year.
Sea Pines became one of the first projects to combine golf and real estate development in a planned community, one of the first to use covenants and deed restrictions to protect the environment, and one of the first to promote intergenerational recreation in the same enterprise.
In 1994, Mr. Fraser received one of only five Heritage Awards ever presented by the Urban Land Institute. The award, which recognizes the lasting importance of projects, had previously been given to Rockefeller Center.
Sea Pines -- with its gated subdivisions, golf courses lined with multimillion-dollar homes of weathered wood and town square -- was far different from previous beach communities along the South Carolina coast. Small cottages perched atop cinder blocks had been the traditional accommodations.
To Mr. Fraser, its greater significance was as a model of planned growth for many resort and retirement developments to come, some that he built himself. The homes were built away from the oceanfront and designed to blend in with the pine forests. Hundreds of acres of parks and nature preserves were also established.
Mr. Fraser, a Yale-trained lawyer, thought sellers of property should be more aggressive in writing deed restrictions and covenants to enforce good overall planning. In the face of considerable skepticism, the covenants have been upheld by South Carolina courts.
"I felt you could be economically successful developing this beach either way, ugly or beautiful," he said in an interview with Southern Living magazine. "There's no law of economics that says ugliness pays. I selected beauty and set out to make it work economically."
His instinct for quality became legendary. At great expense, he reduced the size of the yacht basin to save a single oak tree. He established policies to protect alligators without needlessly endangering people. His lighthouse on Hilton Head, built in 1968, was the first put up on the East Coast for more than 70 years and was initially called Fraser's Folly. It would become a symbol for the state.
In 1969, he persuaded the Professional Golfers Association to begin the Heritage Classic on Sea Pines as a regular tour stop -- this on an island that had been home to several hundred people, at most, less than 20 years earlier. 
Charles Elbert Fraser was born on June 13, 1929, in Hinesville, Ga., where he grew up. His father, Gen. Joseph B. Fraser, served in both world wars and the Korean War and was commander of the South Carolina National Guard. He was also active in the timber business.
In the 1940's, his father joined with two partners to form the original Hilton Head Company, and they bought the island, one of the largest islands on the East Coast. They began cutting timber.
With the general away during World War II and the Korean War, he and his partners divided the island. General Fraser received the southern part. During the summer of 1950, Charles Fraser explored it and began to formulate development plans. He visited oceanfront communities from Maine to Florida for ideas.
Mr. Fraser, who had already graduated from the University of Georgia, went on to Yale Law School, where a professor coached him on the concept of protective covenants and deeds he would use so effectively. His father sold him his part of the island on a 20-year note.
Mr. Fraser went on to develop other projects, including Amelia Island Plantation in Florida, Kiawah Island Resort in South Carolina and the Palmas del Mar resort in Puerto Rico. He also consulted for Walt Disney's new town of Celebration, Fla., among other clients.
Besides his wife, the former Mary Wyman Stone, and his daughter Wyman, who lives in Atlanta, he is survived by another daughter, Laura Lawton Fraser, of Brevard; his brother Joseph, of Hilton Head, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: INMATES GO FREE TO REDUCE DEFICITS 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec. 18 

 BODY:
They began walking out of the Fayette County Jail here this afternoon, the first of 567 Kentucky state prison inmates that Gov. Paul E. Patton abruptly ordered released this week in a step to reduce a $500 million budget deficit.
 Governor Patton said only nonviolent offenders were being given the early mass commutation. But those let out today included men convicted of burglary, theft, arson and drug possession, some of them chronic criminals. 
 "A percentage of them are going to recommit a crime, and some of them are going to be worse than the crimes they are in for," Mr. Patton acknowledged in announcing the emergency releases. But, he added, "I have to do what I have to do to live within the revenue that we have." 
It is a quandary that confronts an increasing number of politicians across the nation in this time of deficits. After three decades of building ever more prisons and passing tougher sentencing laws, politicians now see themselves as being forced to choose between keeping a lid on spending or being tough on crime.
As a result, states are laying off prison guards, or giving prisoners emergency early releases like those in Kentucky. Some states have gone so far as to repeal mandatory minimum sentences or to send drug offenders to treatment rather than to prison in an effort to slow down the inflow of new inmates.
And in other locales, prosecutors or courts have placed a moratorium on misdemeanor cases like shoplifting, domestic violence and prostitution.
"What has happened is that as corrections has grown so enormously and consumed so many resources, it has finally become a target for budget cutters as the economy has turned down," said Chase Riveland, a former director of the corrections departments in Washington and Colorado and now a prison consultant.
The pressure to change stems from the math. Since the early 1970's, the number of state prisoners has risen 500 percent, making corrections the fastest growing item in most state budgets.
With more than two million inmates currently in state and federal prisons and local jails, the bill for corrections has reached $30 billion, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
To cope, Iowa has laid off prison guards. Ohio and Illinois have closed prisons. 
Montana, Arkansas and Texas, along with Kentucky, have discovered loopholes that allow them to release convicted felons early, getting around the strict truth-in-sentencing laws and no parole policies passed in the 1990's that were supposed to prevent such releases. 
In Oklahoma, Gov. Frank Keating, a conservative Republican who added 1,000 new inmates a year to the state's once small prison system, has asked the Pardon and Parole Board to find 1,000 nonviolent inmates to release early as a result of the state's budget crisis.
"Oklahoma has always prided itself on being a law-and-order state," said Cal Hobson, a Democrat who is president of the State Senate. "Now we've got more law and order than we can afford."
In Virginia Beach, Commonwealth Attorney Harvey L. Bryant III, the local prosecutor, has announced that because of state cutbacks to his office's budget, he will no longer prosecute the 2,200 misdemeanor domestic violence cases he gets a year.
"I deeply regret that the victims of domestic violence will no longer have a prosecutor on their side," said Mr. Bryant, a Republican. "But something had to go. I'm two assistant attorneys short."
All of these changes will save some money, but will not undo the fiscal imbalances caused by the prison boom of the 1980's and 1990's, said Nicholas Turner, director of national programs at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York, a research organization.
To make larger savings, a number of states have begun to look at more fundamental changes in the very laws they passed over the past two decades. 
Last week the legislature in Michigan, faced with a budget deficit and prison overcrowding, voted to repeal the state's strict mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug crimes which have led to even life sentences for possession of cocaine or heroin. John Engler, the departing Republican governor, is expected to sign the bill into law.
In Kansas, the Kansas Sentencing Commission will recommend to the Legislature next month a new policy under which people arrested for simple drug possession, with no record of prior arrests for violent crimes or drug trafficking, will be placed in mandatory treatment instead of sent to prison.
Since the sentencing commission is made up of a bipartisan group of legislators, as well as prosecutors and judges, the plan is expected to pass the Legislature.
Savings under the new policy will be sizeable, said Barbara Tombs, the executive director of the commission.
About 1,500 of Kansas' 9,000 inmates are projected to be eligible, with the cost for a year in drug treatment about $2,500 compared with $21,000 for a year in prison. And, because Kansas had earlier eliminated most drug treatment in its prisons, the commission forecasts that recidivism should be lower, saving the cost of locking drug addicts up over and over.
"I think this is critical for Kansas," Ms. Tombs said. "We are at capacity now in our prisons, and we are either going to have to build a new prison, which we cannot afford, or institute alternative sentencing policies for some offenders."
"We don't want to do what Kentucky is doing," Ms. Tombs said, "letting dangerous people out the back end."
Similarly, in Alabama, where a judge has fined the state for dumping inmates on county jails, a sentencing commission will make reform recommendations to the Legislature early next year to stem the inflow of prison inmates. These measures include restoring flexibility for judges in making sentencing decisions and placing more offenders on probation or in halfway houses rather than in the state's prisons. 
Georgia, Utah, Idaho and Nebraska are all considering some version of these sentencing overhauls to reduce the number of new state inmates.
Mr. Turner, noting that most of the states making fundamental changes are controlled by Republicans, said: "This seems like one of those Nixon goes to China things. After years of being tough on crime, only Republicans have the credentials to change prison policy."
Moreover, Mr. Turner said, the politicians making these reforms, and those ordering early release of inmates, have been helped by the decline in the crime rate over the past decade, reducing public anxiety about crime.
A few states have bucked the trend. New York, for example, which has one of the largest prison systems, has been able to avoid early releases or major changes in sentencing because the large drop in crime in New York City has meant fewer people going to prison.
In Lexington today, Vincent Thomas walked out of the Fayette County Jail a free man, without even the need to report to a parole officer or pass urine tests for drugs.
Mr. Thomas paused to shake hands with Glenn Brown, the county jailer, said thanks to Governor Patton for releasing the 567 inmates and promised he would stay clean and not come back.
Ray Larson, the Fayette commonwealth's attorney, expressed skepticism.
"By letting them out, we know they are sooner or later going to commit more crimes," said Mr. Larson, a Democrat who has been elected prosecutor here since 1982. 
The seven men released from the Fayette County Jail today, Mr. Larson noted, had a total of 21 prior felony convictions and 130 convictions for misdemeanors. And they probably have even longer records, Mr. Larson said, because in Kentucky first-time offenders seldom get convicted except for the most serious crimes.
"It is a discouraging day to people in law enforcement," Mr. Larson said. "It will probably follow that the crime rate will rise, and judges will be reluctant to sentence these people to prison only to see them released."
Governor Patton, a Democrat, specified that those released were all convicted of Class D felonies, the lowest level under Kentucky law. They had an average of 80 days remaining on their sentences. 
Most of those released today have been held in county jails around Kentucky, instead of in the state's prisons, because Kentucky's prison population -- now more than 15,000 -- has grown faster than the number of state prison beds.
The releases, some of which took place today, with another batch to be freed on Friday, will result in an immediate savings of $1.3 million, Governor Patton said. 
Some politicians expressed support for the governor's action, saying they do not oppose the early release of nonviolent offenders but do oppose higher taxes. 
"It's very expensive to warehouse someone who's not a threat to the community," said Dan Kelly, a Republican who is majority leader in the State Senate.
On the other hand, Kentucky's attorney general, Ben Chandler, a Democrat, said, "It is my opinion that the amount of time a criminal serves in prison should be based on the crime committed, not on the balance of the state treasury."

HEADLINE: Tax Increase Isn't Out of the Question, Pataki Hints 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki hinted in an interview today that he might soften his long-held opposition to raising some taxes or putting off planned tax cuts. For the first time, in answer to a question, he did not automatically reject tax increases and characterize them as an unwise economic policy.
 "I don't rule anything in or anything out at this point," he said during his annual end-of-the-year interview. "I don't think it would be prudent." 
 A senior aide later said the governor was not referring to broad-based taxes like the state income tax or the commuter tax, but was considering a host of smaller taxes and fees to help close a multibillion-dollar budget gap next year.
Looking back at the last year, the governor delivered a characteristically rosy verdict on his administration's performance. He highlighted a new law he helped push through the Legislature this week that bans discrimination against homosexuals. He also counted as major successes a new law that gives control of the New York City schools to the mayor and a program that finances high-tech research at universities across the state. 
"Here in Albany we got a lot done," he said, contradicting the view of many lawmakers here that too many major bills fell victim to partisan gridlock this year.
As he often has since the traumatic events of September 2001, the governor also spoke with reverence about the courage of ordinary state residents and marveled that New York City was now at the point of plotting future buildings for the site of the terrorist attack.
"All New Yorkers can and should look back and be proud simply of the fact that we are New Yorkers," he said. "We came together 15 months ago in the face of horrible tragedy in a way that made the rest of the country proud, and we met that challenge."
He added that if the sense of unity and common purpose forged during the attacks were carried forward, he thought the state would meet the challenges facing it now. Chief among those challenges is the yawning deficit in next year's budget. Mr. Pataki has yet to quantify the deficit, but most budget analysts estimate it will be at least $8 billion.
The governor was vague about his plans to close the gap and said he could no longer promise not to lay off workers. He added that it would have been easier to rule out layoffs in this fiscal year, which ends on April 1, had the Legislature passed his plan to float bonds backed by payments the state receives from tobacco companies as part of a court settlement. The Assembly's ruling Democrats killed the bill before it was even printed, signaling they would not consider it until the new session in January.
Asked about the Metropolitan Transit Authority's plan to raise the subway fare, Mr. Pataki acted as if the decision were out of his hands, despite his control over the agency.
"The M.T.A. is now going through the public process and they have to justify in those hearings the reasons why they have proposed a number of alternatives that would include fare hikes," Mr. Pataki said. "I'm sure that process will go forward, and it is their obligation to make the case to the people."
Mr. Pataki lashed out at critics who have faulted him for failing to negotiate a bill with Assembly Democrats that would soften the state's stiff mandatory drug sentences, passed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. He said that many of his critics on the left were using the call for changes in the drug laws as a fig leaf to cover a wider effort to reduce prison time for violent felons, a charge advocates for changing the laws later denied. 
"We proposed sweeping reform of the Rockefeller drug laws and for whatever reasons -- I think a lot of it had to do with politics -- there were those who didn't want to see that legislation pass," he said. "But I'm not about to turn violent criminals, people with a violent criminal history, out on the streets in the name of drug law reform, and much of what some of those are advocating is exactly that."
"Yes, we want to reform the Rockefeller drug laws to let those out who should have a second or even a third chance," he continued, "but we're not going to use that as a cover to go back to the policies when people with violent criminals, predators, were allowed out on the street with a slap on the wrist."
Mr. Pataki sidestepped another sticky subject -- the decision not to include transgendered people in the bill banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
Asked if he supported including the transgendered as a protected class in the state's human rights law, Mr. Pataki said: "I'm pleased that we were able to pass this legislation and I want to work with local officials and the people of the state to make this legislation a success."
A reporter asked, "But what about the transgender community?"
The governor said with a tight smile, "I am pleased that this legislation passed."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Share Prices Drop on Anxiety About Corporate Profits

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Micron Technology's report of an unexpectedly large loss prompted a sell-off on Wall Street yesterday, as investors unloaded stocks on renewed anxiety about the strength of corporate profits. 
 Analysts said investors were remaining cautious about committing to the market, particularly after an eight-week blue-chip rally in the autumn that some say came too fast. Light trading yesterday also contributed to exaggerated price swings, the analysts said. 
 "With the lack of a real catalyst, it doesn't take much news, positive or negative, to move the market," said Mike Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital in Charlotte, N.C. "It's going to be in that type of volatile trading range for a while." 
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 88.04 points, or 1 percent, to close at 8,447.35, after falling 92 points on Tuesday. 
The broader market also fell. The Nasdaq composite index declined 30.54 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,361.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.87 points, or 1.3 percent, to 891.12. 
Shares of Micron Technology, the chip maker, fell $3.06, or 23 percent, to $10.22 after the company reported a first-quarter loss that was worse than Wall Street expected. The news dragged down other technology stocks, including Intel, which dropped 76 cents, to $17.13. 
Concerns about a war with Iraq also weighed on the market. The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said yesterday that there were serious omissions and problems with Iraq's weapons declaration as President Bush pondered the nation's next move. 
Stock trading has been choppy in recent days as investors struggle to decide whether to buy in hopes of stronger prospects for 2003 or continue to cash in profits from the autumn rally. 
Still, some analysts say that investors remain largely upbeat and that they should push stocks higher by the end of the month on hopes of a year-end rally. December is historically the strongest time of year for stocks, with much of the gains coming in the last two weeks. 
Brian Bruce, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management, said trading during the rest of the week might offer the best indication of the market's future direction since volume tends to drop off significantly around Christmas. 
"My personal thought is that you're going to have a little end-of-year enthusiasm," Mr. Bruce said. "But it's totally dependent on retailers getting their sales." 
Investors largely shrugged off an encouraging economic report yesterday. The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit declined to $35.1 billion in October, the best showing in seven months. 
Several bearish corporate outlooks hurt stocks. 
Blockbuster slid $6.27, or 32.3 percent, to $13.13, after it lowered fourth-quarter and year estimates, citing a slowdown in rentals at its video stores during the holiday season. 
Bank of New York declined $4.11, or 15.5 percent, to $22.39 after saying it would take a fourth-quarter charge of $240 million, mostly because of its exposure to United Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection. 
General Electric dropped 34 cents, to $25.66, after the company said it was buying the Finnish medical instrument maker Instrumentarium for $2.05 billion in cash.
And Oracle fell 40 cents, to $10.62, ahead of its quarterly earnings report. After the market closed, the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Oracle rose in after-hours trading. 
In the bond market, Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday as the stock markets fell.
The 10-year Treasury note increased 19/32, to a price of 99 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, decreased to 4.04 percent, from 4.11 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 26/32, to 106 6/32. The bond's yield dropped to 4.97 percent, from 5.02 percent.

Federal Judge Clears Way For Qwest To Swap Debt

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
A federal judge cleared the way yesterday for Qwest Communications International, the troubled telecommunications company, to proceed with an exchange offer that seems likely to force bondholders to accept bonds with lower face values than the ones they have now.
 Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court in Manhattan told a packed courtroom that he had found no evidence of fraud in the exchange plan proposed by Qwest. 
 Qwest has filed no audited financial statements and has said it does not know when it will be able to do so. Judge Chin said that "lack of information makes it harder for a bondholder to make a decision" but that there was no fraud involved if the company did not disclose "something that does not exist." 
The exchange offer is scheduled to close at 11:59 p.m. tomorrow. Under it, holders of $12.9 billion in bonds are being asked to exchange their bonds for ones that pay higher interest rates but have lower face values.
Institutional holders who do not offer to exchange their bonds -- as well as individual investors, who are not being allowed to take part in the exchange -- will have their bonds subordinated to bonds held by those who do agree to the exchange. That would make the old bonds less likely to be paid if Qwest goes bankrupt.
If the deal succeeds, Qwest will reduce its debt by $2.3 billion and will delay until 2007 repayments of principal on bonds that are now scheduled to mature from 2004 through 2006. But it will have slightly higher annual interest payments, thus saving it no money until 2004.
If enough bonds are tendered, $4 billion in new bonds will be exchanged for $6.3 billion of old bonds. If more than $6.3 billion of the old bonds are tendered, the excess bonds will be exchanged for new bonds with unchanged financial provisions, but they will have priority in repayment to the bonds that are not tendered.
Alexander R. Sussman, a partner in Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, who represented four bondholders who sued to block the exchange, said in court that his clients feared that the company had inside information that its finances were better than they seemed and was trying to "stampede bondholders" into unnecessary sacrifices. 
But Charles E. Bachman, a partner in O'Melveny & Myers, who is representing Qwest, argued that plaintiffs were "unable to point to a single statement" in the offering memorandum that was misleading, and the judge agreed.
Mr. Sussman said that he would seek to appeal the decision but that if the offering went ahead, "everyone is going to be coerced to tender" because they would want to avoid subordinating their bonds. 
The judge accepted arguments by Qwest that the main issue was whether there was evidence of fraud and he did not ask the lawyers questions about the coercive aspects of the offering. "The issue for the court is not whether the offer is a fair one," he said, adding that the terms of the old bonds clearly gave Qwest the right to issue new bonds senior in repayment rights to the old bonds.
Shares of Qwest fell 15 cents yesterday, to $4.85, but remain well above the $3.90 price the day before the exchange offer was announced on Nov. 20.

HEADLINE: Germany Adrift 

 BODY:
Less than three months after winning a new four-year term as Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder appears to have lost his way. He should be reforming Germany's sluggish economy, modernizing its military and attacking wasteful European Union farm subsidies. 
Instead he has trimmed and hesitated. A post-election tax increase that Mr. Schroder neglected to mention during the campaign has driven down his approval ratings, and his Social Democratic Party is in disarray. Mr. Schroder needs to recover his balance and assert the kind of constructive leadership that the European Union could use from its strongest economic power and that America expects from one of its most important European allies. 
 Germany's once-vibrant economy has sputtered in recent years. Economic discontent helped bring Mr. Schroder to power in 1998, but the root problems, including one of Europe's most rigid labor markets, remain largely unaddressed. Mr. Schroder promised a bolder, more outspoken approach to international affairs. But while he has not hesitated to criticize Washington over Iraq, he has failed to make the needed investments in modern military equipment so that Germany can contribute its fair share to NATO and European defense. 
 Germany ought to lead the drive to cut back Europe's destructive Common Agricultural Policy. But in October Mr. Schroder disappointed reformers by unwisely cutting a private deal with President Jacques Chirac of France, the subsidies' biggest supporter, to extend current payout levels at least though 2006. 
In his first term Mr. Schroder led Germany's Social Democrats toward more modern economics, successfully fought for German participation in the Kosovo war and supported forward-looking reforms in German agriculture. That record helped him win re-election. Returning to its precepts could help revive his floundering chancellorship.

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: MATTERS OF RACE; 
Lott Case Complicates Administration Stand On Affirmative Action

BYLINE:  By NEIL A. LEWIS and LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Senator Trent Lott's lament that Strom Thurmond lost his segregationist campaign for the White House in 1948 has thrust race-related issues to the forefront and is already influencing an internal Bush administration debate on what approach to take on a major affirmative action case.
 Administration officials say Mr. Lott's comments have left them open to more intense scrutiny on several issues, including university admissions, judicial selections, government contracts, education and the role of religious organizations in delivering social services. 
 Even President Bush's coming trip to Africa, set for next month, has administration critics positioning for attack. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, said today that the trip, originally intended to discuss trade and security, must now also include a financial commitment to help the continent cope with AIDS. 
"The administration's minority outreach up to now has really been aimed more at whites than blacks," said David Bositis, senior policy analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that deals with African-American issues. "It has really been more thematic in nature, and now the substance of the initiatives will face considerable scrutiny."
No matter Mr. Lott's fate, Congressional and administration officials said it increasingly appeared that the first casualty of his problems would be Judge Charles W. Pickering's hope to be elevated to an appeals court seat.
Judge Pickering was rejected last March by the Democrats who controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee, in part because of his record on racial matters in his home state, Mississippi. Mr. Lott, his principal patron, and the White House had hoped to renominate him after the Republicans take control of the Senate in January. 
Several administration officials have said that the renomination is all but dead because Democrats would surely turn the confirmation into another debate about race in Mississippi.
Perhaps most striking, a senior administration official said today that Mr. Lott's statement of support for affirmative action, which he gave on Monday night in an interview with Black Entertainment Television, has complicated a developing debate within the administration over a coming Supreme Court case.
"This was a difficult matter already," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The official said an internal debate had already developed over what the position the administration should take in an appeal involving the University of Michigan's affirmative action programs.
"The Lott business has been like a powerful magnet distorting the debate on this," the official said about the internal discussion, which was first reported today in The Washington Post.
The administration has a Jan. 16 deadline to declare its position in the case. The administration could enter the case on either side or could choose to stay out of the case, leaving the justices to decide on the constitutionality of the Michigan program, which is based on the notion that "diversity" is a compelling state interest.
Linda Chavez, the president of the Center for Equal Opportunity and an opponent of racial preferences, said today that she believed that the controversy around Senator Lott had made it more difficult for the administration to consider taking a position in the Michigan case.
"As a result of this, there's no question that racial sensitivity is up now in the Republican Party," Ms. Chavez said. "Senator Lott has made it difficult for us on the right side of the civil rights issue to go out and oppose racial preferences."
She said his remarks declaring his support for affirmative action were his effort "to overcorrect" for his problems but were creating more problems for the Republican Party.
Prof. Chris Edley of the Harvard Law School said, "The traditional civil rights community is focused intensely on what the Bush administration will do in the Michigan case."
Professor Edley, an official in the Clinton administration who supports the Michigan program, said that before the controversy over the Lott remarks, he and his associates had only a faint hope that Mr. Bush would choose not to oppose the university's program.
"But the chances of the president deciding to either go the other way or at least stay out have only improved after Senator Lott's comments," he said.
Professor Edley said that because the Republican Party wanted to broaden its appeal to minorities, the White House might find this an opportunity to make a statement.
"You can't think of any single action that would more dramatically demonstrate that on matters of race the G.O.P. is the party of Bush not Lott," he said.
The Lott issue may also affect some of Mr. Bush's educational programs. In January 2002, Mr. Bush signed an education bill setting new standards for educational testing and opening doors to school choice. 
Now, Democrats hope to put Republicans on the defensive by arguing that few of the programs meant to help primarily minority children have been carried out, because appropriations are being squeezed for domestic security and defense. 
Democrats may also challenge Republicans on less prominent, but still racially sensitive issues like mandatory set-asides for minorities in government contracts.
Some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have already pointed out that on the same day that the president criticized Mr. Lott, he was in Philadelphia signing an executive order to finance community outreach programs by religious groups. Some Democrats charge that initiative allows participating groups to discriminate in hiring.
"The Republicans were gaining ground as being sincerely concerned and credible on civil rights issues," said Abigail Thernstrom, a conservative member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, who supports school choice and abolishing racial preferences in education. "Now conservative programs and those of us who support them will go back to being automatically racially suspect."

HEADLINE: Facing a Large Budget Gap, Mayor Lists Accomplishments 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered his view yesterday of his mayoralty's greatest hits so far, a veritable laundry list of accomplishments both large and small at a time of limited resources and little fiscal relief in sight.
 Surrounded by 15 commissioners, Mr. Bloomberg listed dozens of his administration's initiatives over the last year, most of them in the area of technology and economic development. From putting medical records on line at the city's public hospitals to reducing the number of city-owned cars to larger initiatives like his plan to restore or build 65,000 housing units over the next several years, Mr. Bloomberg said the city had found ways to improve despite a large budget gap. 
 His hourlong presentation, at the Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, was somewhat like the annual meeting of a publicly held corporation.
"Businesses are judged by performance, not by how much they spend," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Government should be judged by the same standard. Cutting $2.3 billion does not mean," he said, that the city cannot provide good or improved services to the public. "And that is exactly what we think we've done this year," he added.
Just as his own business does, Mr. Bloomberg said, the city needs to focus on customer service, and so innovations like permitting residents to pay taxes on line, improving parks and increasing the number of Business Improvement Districts have been part of his agenda since he was elected. He also said he would continue to seek ways in which technology could be used to improve government.
The event was the second of three year-end presentations the mayor has scheduled. On Tuesday, he talked about the decrease in crime. Today, he is to discuss the Department of Education, which came under his control during the summer.
Yesterday, more than a dozen commissioners spoke briefly about the use of technology in their agencies. Martha E. Stark, for example, the city's finance commissioner, extolled her agency's ability to let New Yorkers pay their property taxes, water bills, parking tickets and other fees on line.
Mr. Bloomberg ticked off a series of statistics that he said proved New York was recovering from the economic devastation of the terrorist attack last year. Fewer private-sector jobs were lost in the first three quarters of 2002 than in the previous year, he said, and occupancy rates have risen in the city's hotels. "In most industries we really have turned the corner," he said.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Woodstock, Conn.

BYLINE:  By MAURA J. CASEY

 BODY:
WOODSTOCK, nestled in northeast Connecticut, has the usual features of an especially beautiful country town -- tree-lined roads and forested hills, working dairy farms, a gracious 19-room inn. But it is also diverse enough to be home to a corporate headquarters and a 70-year-old nudist colony. 
 The corporate headquarters belongs to Crabtree & Evelyn, the fragrance and toiletries company. And the nudist retreat is the 450-acre Solair Family Nudist Resort, which unfazed locals cheerfully refer to as "Naked Acres." Its Web site (www.solairrl.org) advocates a "relaxed, clothing-free lifestyle" and while its presence may be startling to outsiders, people here take it for granted. 
 "It's been here forever," said Avis Spaulding, a lifelong resident, noting that her family sold the resort some of its land in the 1950's.
Rich Ross, the Solair manager, said the club (65 Ide Perrin Road) was busy between Memorial Day and Labor Day but tried to be as low-key as the town itself. "It's pretty rustic, real quiet," he said. Membership is $1,700 per family per year. 
An influx of newcomers has moved to Woodstock in the last several years and there is some tension between those whose roots run deep and those who, old-timers feel, have barely unpacked before they want to make changes.
Those seeking a respite from New York's hectic lifestyle should be prepared to gear back considerably. "I miss what New York has to offer sometimes," said Tom Hayden, who was born and raised in the Bronx. In 1999 he and his wife, Polly, bought Sweet Evalina's Stand, the combination store, ice cream parlor and restaurant that is the unofficial town center. "In the city, you can get anything you want in 5 to 10 minutes," he said. "The tradeoff here? Tranquillity."
Woodstock has always been an agricultural community but it also has a tradition of being a haven for outsiders seeking a respite from busy work lives. Founded in the 1600's, Woodstock had a period of industrialization during the 1800's, when it became known for its shoe factories. Business slowed in the mid-1800's and the town became a summer destination for affluent New Yorkers and Bostonians. Today, Woodstock is still largely agricultural; it has the highest concentration of dairy farms in the state.

The Scene
Woodstock from any direction is postcard-pretty, with sweeping views of meadows crisscrossed with stone walls, farms and gracious old homes overlooking forests. The northern part of town borders Massachusetts. Because the town is geographically large (at 61.8 square miles, Connecticut's third largest), it has six distinct sections -- North Woodstock, South Woodstock, East Woodstock, West Woodstock, Woodstock Hill and the Valley. The town has four public libraries. From the south, approaching on Route 169, you'll pass the Woodstock Fairgrounds, the site for the Woodstock Fair, held every year for the last 142 years, in recent years over the Labor Day weekend. There are craft shops and occasional antiques stores.
On the left is Sweet Evalina's Stand, with homemade bread, soups, pies and a cheeseburger called the Woodstocker; Fridays are crowded as customers pick up fish-and-chip dinners made with fresh flounder.
You can't help but notice the big pink house, the elaborate, Gothic-revival salmon-colored Roseland Cottage. Built in 1846, it served as the summer home of Henry C. Bowen, a wealthy New York newspaper publisher; presidents and other important figures visited him there. It is the scene of the Fine Arts and Crafts Festival the weekend after Columbus Day. Across the street is the Palmer Arboretum, a small park. The town has a pond with a beach in North Woodstock. 

Pros
Some people go to Woodstock to get away from it all, but residents like to say that it is within a three-hour drive of every place worth going to. Providence, R.I., is 45 minutes away; Boston, 90 minutes. Woodstock is a good base camp to visit regional attractions, like Old Sturbridge Village, just 20 minutes away in Massachusetts. Putnam, Conn., just east of Woodstock, has dozens of antiques stores and bills itself as the antiques capital of the Northeast. Half an hour away are Connecticut's Indian casinos, Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. 
There is no crime to speak of, although locals complain of speeders roaring through town on the main roads. The town has two privately owned golf courses, the Woodstock Golf Course and the Harrisville Golf Club. 
A sophisticated restaurant, ideal for Sunday brunch, is located at the Inn at Woodstock Hill (94 Plaine Hill Road; 860-928-0528), a large circa 1816 Georgian-style house listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

Cons
Woodstock's population grew more than 22 percent between 1990 and 2001, to 7,332 from 6,008. The population growth shows no sign of abating; in the first six weeks of this school year, 61 new children arrived unexpectedly to attend the elementary school.
Longtime residents worry that the influx will change the character of the town. Dairy farmers who have made their living there for generations are struggling to survive in the face of the lowest milk prices in a quarter-century and pressure to sell land to developers. It worries people like Ms. Spaulding. "To us, the town is booming," she said. "To you, it wouldn't be." 
Judy W. Alberts, the town clerk, concurs. "I like the rural character of Woodstock, but the way real estate is going people who made the town what it is can't afford to live here," she said, "although people coming here from elsewhere look at our real estate market and laugh." She said that a number of people from the New York area had been buying property there in the last few years.
Home prices, while modest by New York standards, have been steadily increasing in the last several years, along with demand for land. 
Getting away from it all means getting away from night life; it's nonexistent. The nearest supermarkets are several miles away in Putnam and in Webster, Mass. The town doesn't have a gas station.

Real Estate Market
Woodstock offers a nice mix of gracious farmhouses and new developments with an eye toward creative use of open space. One of these is Deer Meadow, a 30-acre development of new homes on one-acre lots arranged around a shared green, reminiscent of old New England communities. One such home, a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom colonial with a two-car garage, sold recenly for $279,600, according to Judith C. Tedeschi, a local real estate broker. "Those homes are sold faster than they can be built," she said. The town's first condominiums were built in the mid-1980's, and now there are newer developments, like Woodstock Meadows and Cornfield Point. Many of the condos are duplexes and town houses that look out over meadows.
Although residents say an influx of newcomers is driving up the cost of real estate, in the current economic slowdown there has not been an extraordinary rise in home prices; since 2000, the median price for a single-family home has risen to $150,000 from $132,900. An offer was recently accepted for one property -- 40-acre Maple Hill Farm, with a 10-room, post-and-beam colonial house, a peach orchard, a pond and a carriage house, after the asking price was lowered $50,000, to $675,000.
An early-1800's cape, with wide board floors, four bedrooms, three baths, a fireplace and an in-law apartment on nearly five acres, is listed at $309,900.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Sex Trade's Professional Courtesy

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
Veronica Chen's "Smokers Only" is a romance from Argentina steeped in sexual ambiguity. Though its atmosphere is intriguing -- particularly in its nighttime views of Buenos Aires, where the sex trade appears to be restricted to a modern, well-scrubbed pedestrian mall -- the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression.
 Reni (Cecilia Bengolea) is a rootless, rail-thin bohemian in her early 20's who performs (although that may be too strong a word for her sluggish, strung-out vocals) with a moderately successful rock band. In the interests of developing their moderate success into a living wage, the other members of the band kick Reni out, leaving her in a highly vulnerable state when she runs across Andres (Leonardo Brezicki), a young male prostitute turning a trick in full view in a brightly lighted ATM station. 
 Hypnotized by the unlikely spectacle, Reni approaches Andres, and soon the two of them are spending their free time together. The blithely bisexual Andres tells his new companion that being paid for sex makes him feel powerful and desirable, and Reni, curious and by now hopelessly in love, soon joins him on the sidewalk, where they offer themselves as a pair.
"Smokers Only" (the title is a translation of "Vagon Fumador," the notice that appears on the smoking car of a train) struggles with age-old themes of love and sex, and eventually it reaches an age-old conclusion: that sex without love is empty and meaningless, if reasonably profitable. Andres's liberated stance turns out to be a cover for a fear of genuine emotional commitment, a touch of Psych 101 that abruptly turns the hip detachment of the film, which opens today in Manhattan, into conventional moralizing.
Ms. Chen appears to be working under the influence of the French filmmaker Andre Techine, whose "J'Embrasse Pas" (1991) deals with a similar story of a young provincial who becomes a prostitute in Paris. Like Mr. Techine, Ms. Chen seems fascinated by the ways in which traditional romantic attitudes survive beneath the complications of a contemporary, gender-bending, polygamous sexuality, but unlike Mr. Techine she is quick to pontificate. She needs to trust her characters more and her judgments less.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; 
Back to the Kodak Moment When Light Was Captured

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
AMONG the earliest photographs William Henry Fox Talbot made was a picture of lace now in the Talbot show at the International Center of Photography. Talbot placed the lace on a piece of paper he had sensitized with silver salts, then put them both in the sun. After a few minutes he removed the lace. The paper, reacting to the sunlight, retained the impression of the fabric as a silhouette.
 Amazing. The image today looks mysterious: a fine, flat, abstract shape, irregular and ghostly. It takes a moment to recognize it. Before that, we assume the intent is art, accustomed as we are to seeing abstract images in museums that way, which was certainly not how Talbot thought about the photograph. 
 We can only imagine the original magic of it. Vision became a physical object fixed on paper; three dimensions became two not through the intermediary of somebody wrestling with a pencil or brush but directly through nature, and in more detail than anybody, or almost anybody, could match by hand. The famous story is that Talbot, frustrated at his own infelicitous attempts to sketch landscapes while at Lake Como in Italy in 1833, determined to find another way "to cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably." 
So photography was born partly as a kind of convenience, a labor-saving alternative to drawing, but also an impersonal machine, dispassionate, unlike the human hand, except that it soon became obvious to Talbot and every other thinking person that photography, like drawing, was still inescapably a tool of human manipulation and individual taste.
Nothing can return us to the state of innocence before photography was invented -- invented twice, by Talbot and by Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre, separately, using different techniques. But this show, the first thorough retrospective of Talbot in the United States, can remind us how utterly the world was changed by their invention. Talbot, the archetypal 19th-century polymath and inventor, came up with the negative-positive process, the chemical and mechanical method that did for visual images no less than what the printing press did for the written word. As a result he reshaped how people saw their surroundings: photography became, as a visual tool, the threshold between the past and modernity.
I stress what may already be obvious at the start because the exhibition recapitulates basic photographic truths. These include the simple pleasure of looking at a photograph. Organized by the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego (with support from the Talbot Committee), the show is installed here in galleries that include many of Talbot's letters. (He wrote so much that it's almost possible to track what he did every day of his adult life.) On the walls are what at a glance look like brownish blotches, each a subtly different tint: photographs, windows onto Talbot's universe, the slow world of landed, educated England in the early 19th century, both antique and Romantic. 
Talbot photographed Byronic landscapes and also pensive men sitting in plush armchairs gazing dreamily into the ether. The Rembrandtish quality of his prints, softly accentuated by the texture of the paper, enhanced the atmosphere of moody poetry. He contrived stagy scenes of laborers, who posed holding saws and hammers or stood beside ladders, pretending to work or do who knows what. Shadowy streets and university buildings, empty (because the photographs required long exposures and so couldn't capture people moving), look ghostly like ruins. Views of Paris make the city seem stonily inert.
We know these sorts of scenes from snapshots by shutterbugs who probably never heard of Talbot. He brought about a world now largely imagined through images people see through a viewfinder, accumulate, hold in their hands.
The family portrait. The class photo. The news shot. The passport picture. The view of Uncle Burt smiling before the Tower of London. Photographs define the rituals of our lives; they make everyone a potential artist and document reality, while also altering it, because photographs have their own particular truth and integrity. Talbot's photograph of lace, for example, recorded the existence of the fabric he placed on the sheet of paper but is not a reproduction of it. The picture is an image with properties specific to photography: flatness, tinting, cropping. Photographs fragment and dislocate the world, and reduce everything to the same scale, as Talbot recognized.
They also concentrate attention on what the eye might not normally bother to notice, which, when set apart on a sheet of paper, becomes strange, new and beautiful. Susan Sontag famously observed: "Nobody exclaims: 'Isn't that ugly! I must take a photograph of it.' Even if someone did say that, all it would mean is, 'I find that ugly thing . . . beautiful.' "
Not incidentally, Talbot called his early photographs calotypes, from "kalos," meaning beautiful.
Everything became potentially beautiful. Artists before Talbot painted banal and mundane things and made them look beautiful. But photography conveyed beauty differently. 
Talbot made a beautiful photograph of books on shelves, perhaps imitating a still life, perhaps suggesting photography's potential as evidence, legal or otherwise, perhaps implying a self-portrait. Those are Talbot's books, about subjects he studied, and include volumes with articles he wrote in them. We're meant to read the titles on the spines. Do they add up to a diary of a life?
The meaning is up to you. Talbot's genius was to raise the different possibilities. He identified from the start, with what now seems astonishing speed and clarity, photography's implications, which he laid out in "The Pencil of Nature," the first book illustrated with photographs.
One room of the show is devoted to prints from it. (The quality of the prints throughout the exhibition varies disappointingly, time often having taken its toll, but some are magnificent.) Talbot photographed a Daumier lithograph to demonstrate photography's function as a reproductive medium. He photographed a plaster bust of Patroclus. (He bought the bust at a shop in London; the curators have included it in the show.) 
This proved a different point: not just that art can be photographed and the photographs dispersed, but that lighting alters the appearance of whatever is in a photograph, as every Hollywood star knows.
Talbot saw the future, in which photography would become an industry. His panorama of the Reading Establishment shows the world's first commercial photographic company to produce prints from calotype paper negatives. 
He and his associates pose to illustrate photography's potential: a man sits for his portrait; a Velazquez engraving and a maquette of Canova's "Three Graces" await photographers; technicians monitor prints for "The Pencil of Nature." This is a picture of photographers photographing themselves while preparing the first book of photographs about photography.
Then Talbot stopped. By the mid-1840's, barely a decade after he had started, he seems to have taken his last photographs. He published papers about botany, mathematics and ancient Assyrian inscriptions. When he died in 1877, at 77, he was remembered in the journal Nature for deciphering the cuneiform inscriptions from Nineveh.
The word amateur derives from the word for love. Talbot, the ultimate amateur, invented photography for the love of it, in a spirit of curiosity, then he pursued other interests. 
A strong-willed man with a big ego, who was adamantly proprietary about his invention, he was only incidentally an artist. His artistry seems more eloquent for being secondary and economical, a byproduct of a sensitive mind.
Inventions age and are supplanted. Art is constant. Talbot's technique is being replaced by digital technology, but his pictures remain vivid and alluring. The art of his photographs is clearly in the enduring freshness of their wonderment.

"First Photographs: William Henry Fox Talbot and the Birth of Photography" is at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777, through Feb. 1. It travels to the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego in March.

HEADLINE: They Rise, but Do They Soar? 

BYLINE:  By Witold Rybczynski; Witold Rybczynski is professor of urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
It is a relief that the new proposals for the World Trade Center site represent a radical departure from the six projects presented last July. This time architecture is very much in the forefront, and great urban places are always a function of great buildings. That was the problem with the earlier projects -- assuming a generic architecture, the planners produced mediocre places.
 The new "study projects" are intended only to help the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in creating a land-use plan; this is not a competition intended to produce a winner. Still, we will each have our own favorite. I've already found a Web site, operated by the BBC, where the public can cast its vote. I clicked on the Foster & Partners entry. I particularly like the memorial park in which the footprints of the original towers are treated as two open-air rooms sitting on the bedrock. 
 At the same time, I clicked without enthusiasm. It seems to me that this latest round of designs has produced answers -- sometimes extremely complicated answers -- to the wrong question.
The challenge put to the designers was not simply, "What does Sept. 11 represent?" The original aim of the development corporation was to entirely rebuild the destroyed office space, hotel and shopping mall. After the July debacle, the corporation relaxed the requirements -- very slightly. The original 11 million square feet of office space was reduced to 6.5 million to 10 million on the site, along with up to 3.5 million at the perimeter. The shopping mall and hotel stayed.
These requirements were greatly complicated by the consensus that, as part of any memorial, the footprints of the twin towers should not be built over. This means leaving the western portion open and building all that office space only on the northern and eastern edges. The result: huge buildings.
Thus the five linked towers of Richard Meier & Partners, a subtle visual trope of the jagged ruins of the World Trade Center facade, are almost as high as the Empire State Building. Five teams proposed buildings taller than the original twin towers, in four cases taller than the 1,483-foot Petronas Towers in Malaysia, currently the world's tallest.
The problem is that while these skyscrapers bring a broad range of innovation -- some appear to bend and sway as if made of gelatin, others use crystalline forms echoing 1920's European expressionism -- none seems quite appropriate to the purposes of the site, or to the new direction in the city's development.
Repairing the Manhattan skyline should certainly be a part of any regeneration at ground zero. Yet the most successful New York skyscrapers are those that draw the eye upward, to their spires and beyond. They may be commercial office buildings, but they are also cultural icons. When we look at the the Chrysler Building or the General Electric building at Rockefeller Center, we don't think of cars or refrigerators, we think of the city itself.
I'm not sure that any of these proposals quite fits the bill. They are tall, but instead of soaring they all give the impression of great bulk. Although some of the architects referred to them as "cities in the sky," these are really offices in the sky. Like the original twin towers, they seem more like Brobdingnagian intruders than lofty but friendly neighbors.
Thus I'm relieved that we don't have to take these ambitious plans too seriously. Given the city's real estate values and rents, the economic limit for high-rise office buildings is thought to be in the range of 60 floors, or about 900 feet. Even after the destruction of the twin towers, there are still 17 million square feet of vacant office space downtown. Building the tallest building in the world might seem a bold gesture in the face of terrorism, but it makes little economic sense (unless it is heavily subsidized).
Last week Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered a compelling vision for the future that would transform the financial district into a "global hub of culture and commerce, a live-and-work-and-visit community for the world." This involves creating new neighborhoods, building thousands of housing units, as well as schools and libraries, and investing in transportation projects. Ten million square feet of office space, even in eye-popping buildings, would be a very large bull in this delicate china shop.

HEADLINE: Using a Weak Pension Plan as a Cash Cow 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
NAVISTAR INTERNATIONAL is a grand old company, a descendant of International Harvester, founded by Cyrus McCormick. But if its heritage comes from one of the greatest inventors in American history, these days the most creative things at Navistar seem to be coming from the financial department.
 Consider pensions, for example. Its pension and retiree health plans were badly underfunded even before the stock market tumbled. Now the gap is a yawning one of $2.7 billion. But Navistar found a way last month to take cash out of its pension funds. 
 It did that by selling $175 million of its stock to the plans. Some of that money went right back into the plans, and Robert C. Lannert, Navistar's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said in an interview that by the end of next October the rest of the money would find its way there. Wasn't Navistar using the pension plan as a funding vehicle? "You could look at it that way," he responded, noting that the stock had risen a bit since it was sold to the pension plans for $22.57 a share, closing yesterday at $23.18.
The maneuver impressed Chris Strube, a director at Fitch Ratings who specializes in pensions. "I've never heard of a company selling its own stock to its pension plan," he said, adding that companies often contribute stock to plans, but don't take out cash. "It's pretty ingenious," he added, speculating that some companies with difficulties in raising cash might imitate the tactic.
The pension move was not Navistar's only impressive financial tactic. Last week it raised $190 million by selling five-year convertible bonds in a deal underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston. Navistar's credit rating is below investment grade, but the interest rate on the bonds is only 2.5 percent.
On a normal bond issue, with no conversion feature, Navistar would have paid about 11 percent. But these days the convertible market is hungry for new bonds because so many of the old ones are hopelessly out of the money as far as conversion goes. (You see, there's a silver lining to every bear market.)
It helps that Navistar's stock is volatile, and its turnaround story an attractive one. Such volatility increases the value of options, and to financial engineers a convertible bond is nothing but a bond plus a call option to buy the stock. If the option is worth a lot, then a low interest rate is all that is needed to sell the convertible bond.
Navistar got clever -- too clever for my tastes -- when it entered into a complicated derivatives trade with First Boston that will assure that common shareholders experience no dilution from the bond issue unless the stock more than doubles in the next five years.
As such hedges go, it was far from the most outrageous one Wall Street has sold. Unlike the sad events at Electronic Data Systems and Dell, Navistar won't end up paying big bucks if its stock plunges. But the derivatives deal cost Navistar at least $20 million -- money that it will never recover.
That $20 million won't be charged as an expense, and entering into the derivatives transaction provided temporary support to the stock because First Boston had to buy shares to hedge its own exposure. But given Navistar's financial condition and the prolonged slowdown in its part of the truck market, it might have been the better part of valor to take the risk of dilution from the convertible issue, which will only kick in after the stock rises 30 percent.
Navistar is doing a good job of controlling costs while it awaits an economic recovery, and it deserves praise both for its willingness to explain what it did and for taking advantage of the convertible market's odd condition to raise money cheaply. But if business does not revive soon, Navistar may regret hedging against something -- dilution -- that would come only with prosperity.

HEADLINE: City Jobless Rate Rises to 8%, Continuing an Upward Climb 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The jobless rate in New York City continued to rise in November, and the unemployed are finding it increasingly difficult to get work and are running through their unemployment insurance benefits, according to several studies released yesterday.
 The unemployment rate rose to 8 percent, adjusting for seasonal factors, from 7.8 percent in October, the New York State Department of Labor said. The jobless rate, which dipped during the summer, has returned to where it was in the spring. 
 Unemployment in the city is far higher than upstate, where the rate is just 4.7 percent. For the state as a whole, the rate is 6 percent, which equals the national average.
The number of jobs in the city -- not all of which are held by city residents -- also continued to dwindle. Payroll employment dropped by 4,300 in November, according to the New York City comptroller's office, which adjusted the state data for seasonal factors and calculated a larger loss than some economists. Employment has declined for the last three months, dropping by a total of 28,500 jobs, according to the comptroller's office. 
Not all of the employment news was negative. Retailers hired slightly more workers in November than they have, on average, during other Novembers in the last decade, said James P. Brown, an analyst at the State Labor Department. Hotels have also added employees over the last three months, as both industries prepared for the holiday rush.
"We're having an average Christmas, and that's good," Mr. Brown said. "If we don't have a decent Christmas, in January the layoffs get really big."
An analysis of unemployment data by the Community Service Society of New York, which does advocacy work for the poor, found that more people who are looking for work are doing so because they lost their jobs, not because they quit their old jobs or are trying to re-enter the labor market. The report said that in 2000, the last boom year, less than 45 percent of those looking for work had lost their previous jobs; in the 12 months since September 2001, that figure rose to almost 58 percent.
And New Yorkers are remaining unemployed for longer than they did during boom times, the report said. On average, since September 2001, about half of all job-seekers remained unemployed for more than three months. In 2000, only about 40 percent of the unemployed did not find a job within three months.
"As disturbing as these figures are, they may understate the current reality," according to the society's report, which was written by Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst for the group. "It is likely that as the recession has worn on, the proportion of job losers among the unemployed has risen and the average duration of unemployment has grown longer."
The fact that people are remaining unemployed longer is particularly significant because regular unemployment benefits run out after six months, Mr. Levitan noted. A federal program to provide an extra three months of benefits expires on Dec. 28, and while President Bush recently said he favored extending the deadline, the House and Senate deadlocked over the issue earlier this fall. About 62,800 people in New York State who are now eligible for or are receiving extended benefits will lose them if the program expires as scheduled, according to a new estimate by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington. The group says that 84,200 people across the state have already exhausted their regular and extended benefits and have not found new jobs.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Up 0.7% For Best Monthly Gain in Year 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A stabilizing job market and higher stock prices helped push up a crucial measure of economic activity in November, the Conference Board, an industry group, reported yesterday.
 In addition, the Labor Department said yesterday that new jobless claims dropped last week but remained high, suggesting that the employment market is still sluggish. 
 Even so, gains in longer-term employment helped lift consumer attitudes, pushing the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators up 0.7 percent, the largest monthly gain in a year. 
The increase, which was slightly greater than analysts' expectations, leaves the index at 112.3, and comes after a revised 0.1 percent gain in October.
"The financial market slump seems to be lifting a little this autumn," the Conference Board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said. "Recent consumer buying figures have somewhat allayed fears about a weak holiday season, and consumer attitudes have also improved." 
The jump in the index means that the economic reading has regained the ground it has lost since May, and it is now 3.6 percent higher than its low in March of last year.
Five of the 10 indicators that make up the index rose in November, including stock prices and real money supply, the board said. Negative contributors included vendor performance and building permits. One component, average weekly manufacturing hours, held steady. 
In addition, three of the four measures in the board's coincident index, which measures current economic activity, rose. That index is at 115.0, up 0.1 percent from October. 
The index of lagging indicators, which show economic changes that have already occurred, declined 0.2 percent, to 99.7.
In the report on unemployment, the Labor Department said that new claims for jobless benefits fell by a seasonally adjusted 11,000, to 433,000 for the workweek ended Dec. 14. Numbers above 400,000 are associated with a lackluster job market. The previous week, new claims increased by 86,000, the biggest one-week gain since July 1992.

Talk of War Helps Push Shares Down for 3rd Day in Row

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
War fears overshadowed encouraging economic reports yesterday on Wall Street, sending share prices lower for a third consecutive day. The Dow Jones industrials fell to their lowest level in nearly six weeks. 
 Analysts said trading had been choppy as investors struggled to decide whether to bet on stronger prospects in 2003. They added that the escalation of the confrontation with Iraq yesterday ultimately gave investors another reason to sell. 
 "They're worried quite a bit about a war, and they're still worried about corporate profits and economic factors going forward," said Mark Donahoe, managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.55 points, or 1 percent, to close at 8,364.80, for a three-day loss of 262.60 points. 
It was the lowest finish since Nov. 11, when blue-chip stocks closed at 8,358.95. 
The broader market also declined. The Nasdaq composite index lost 7.41 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,354.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 6.87 points, or 0.8 percent, to 884.25.
The chief United Nations weapons inspector, Hans Blix, told the United Nations Security Council yesterday that Iraq's 12,000-page weapons declaration contained gaps and inconsistencies. The United States called Iraq in "material breach" of United Nations resolutions, setting a course toward a possible war early next year. 
Investors, meanwhile, largely shrugged off reports showing modest improvements in the economy. 
The Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week by a seasonally adjusted 11,000, to 433,000. Yet even with the drop, claims remained above 400,000, a level associated with a lackluster job market. 
And the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7 percent in November, the largest monthly gain in a year, after a revised increase of 0.1 percent for the previous month. The November figure slightly beat analysts' estimates. 
Analysts say investors in recent days have been trying to decide between committing to stocks in hopes of a strengthening economy or cashing in quick profits from an eight-week blue chip rally in the autumn. 
Many analysts are questioning whether Wall Street will see its usual holiday rally in the last two weeks of December.
"In the absence of really strong and compelling economic evidence, the markets are still subject to tax selling," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates, referring to the practice of dumping losing stocks at year's end to lower income tax payments. 
"It's just a mechanical thing," Mr. Moore said. "Stocks usually go sideways in early December and then lift into the so-called Santa Claus rally." 
Mr. Donahoe was not so sure.
"You're not going to get anything in terms of a rally with the talk of Iraq going on," he said. "We had such a big move up, we're basically just pulling back." 
Decliners included AT&T, which fell $1.20, to $25.11, and Eastman Kodak, which dropped $1.22, to $35.95.
But Oracle rose 37 cents, to $11, after it reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. 
Dole Foods jumped $4.13, or 14.5 percent, to $32.58, after its chairman, David H. Murdock, agreed to buy all of the company's outstanding shares that he does not own and take it private in a $2.5 billion deal. 
In the bond market, Treasury prices rose sharply again yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note increased 27/32 , to a price of 10016/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, decreased to 3.94 percent, from 4.04 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 1 8/32 , to 107 12/32 . The bond's yield dropped to 4.89 percent, from 4.97 percent.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Below Ground Zero Is at Issue 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
For months, vocal family members of the World Trade Center dead have called for the one-acre squares where the twin towers stood to be preserved for a memorial to the victims, not only on the surface but also down to the bedrock some 85 feet below street level.
 On Wednesday, when new plans for the site by seven groups of architects were unveiled, several drew on that sentiment. 
 But if those plans are adopted, space reserved for a memorial below ground level could create significant challenges for officials in planning the underground elements of a rebuilt trade center site. 
The biggest challenge of such a plan would be how acres of empty space would affect the huge concrete walls that keep river and groundwater out of the basement levels of the site. Those walls need support, which before the buildings were destroyed in September 2001 was provided by seven floors that stretched across the so-called bathtub and were used for parking and mechanical systems. 
Whether the walls can be adequately supported in some way while keeping some or all of the pit open is a challenge that officials involved in the rebuilding effort have not yet publicly addressed.
The seven teams of architects from around the world showed their designs Wednesday as part of an attempt by officials to devise a plan for using the land on the site. An exercise in July resulted in six designs that were abandoned after they were criticized for being unimaginative and dense with office space.
Four of the seven teams that presented new designs called for some space to be set aside as part of a memorial beneath the tower footprints, as the outline of the towers' exterior walls is known. 
Three of those plans extend the void down several floors below ground level, while one excavates to the bedrock not only the tower footprints but also most of the seven-acre bathtub, the area within the slurry walls that holds back the waters of the Hudson River.
Further complicating the issue for officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is charged with rebuilding downtown, is that some of the plans that go deep underground got the most positive receptions on Wednesday from the audience of city officials, victims' family members, downtown residents, architects and designers who attended the presentation.
Several organizations that are members of the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York called on the Port Authority and the development corporation yesterday to release more details about their deliberations on underground transportation connections and other elements of the site.
How the transportation systems and the deep memorial bases will be reconciled is not yet clear, a point that emerged yesterday in criticisms of the planning process by leaders of civic organizations that have been following the rebuilding. 
So far, officials have conducted almost all of the discussions about those elements in private, the critics said. 
"If decisions are made in the next month or two about the location of the infrastructure or the footings for office buildings, then we foreclose forever the possibility of changing what goes on on the surface of this site," said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association and chairman of the Civic Alliance, in urging more public discussion about the plans. 
"We'd be living with the consequences for hundreds of years," Mr. Yaro said. "In order to save two weeks, we might have to live with what might be an underwhelming plan and, in the end, a not-successful plan." 
Officials have set Jan. 31 as a deadline for the Port Authority and the development corporation to settle on a master plan for the site. In the coming weeks, a task force of officials from the development corporation, the Port Authority, the state and the city will meet to study the new plans more closely and settle on the most viable option.
The officials have not publicly outlined how they will assess the plans, other than to say they will use quantitative and qualitative criteria. But officials have said it is not likely that they will try to mix and match elements from different designs into a single master plan.
If they intend to select a single plan, there is a good chance that it will include some sort of empty space below ground encompassing the tower footprints.
The plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind, for example, envisions the bathtub walls as an integral part of the memorial, and proposes keeping the excavated pit nearly empty of new structures. During the presentation of his plan on Wednesday, Mr. Libeskind said it was during his first trip down into the pit that he realized its pull. 
"I understood the magnetic desire of everyone to be at that depth, and when you are at that depth you don't hear the cars, you don't see the cars," he said. "There is an atmosphere that is really spectacular."
Foster & Partners also expressed the memorial area as within the footprints of the towers. Bordered by "monumental walls of steel and stone" extending more than 30 feet below ground level, the spaces will include separate areas for the public and the family members of attack victims, said Norman Foster, the firm's leader.
Two other teams, the one known as United Architects and the team including Richard Meier and Peter Eisenman, used the footprints of the towers as skylights for underground areas devoted to the memorial. 
The United Architects plan creates great rooms 70 feet below ground level, from which visitors can peer skyward through openings formed by the tower footprints. And the Meier team's Memorial Square plan includes two glass-bottom reflecting pools demarcating the tower footprints; below them, "the volumes of the footprints become sites for memorial rooms lit from above," the team explained.
During a tour of the trade center site last month, Joseph Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority, and Peter Rinaldi, the general manager of the site, said they believed that it would be difficult to leave significant portions of the bathtub area open because of the need to brace the slurry walls, which after Sept. 11 were in danger of collapsing. 
In addition, officials had been considering using much of the area within the bathtub to house a bus station to accommodate the throngs of visitors who are expected to visit the memorial.

HEADLINE: In Tax Twist, Big Vehicles Get the Bigger Deductions 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Dr. Tedd March and his partners know a good deal when they see it. He and his fellow internists who share a practice are taking advantage of an odd confluence of tax breaks to buy giant sport utility vehicles, with a healthy subsidy from Uncle Sam.
 "I have one partner who just did it with a Suburban," said Dr. March, a 42-year-old physician in Monroe, Mich., about 30 miles south of Detroit. He said he planned to buy a Lincoln Navigator next month, "and I have a third partner who's going to buy one the year after." 
 The tax deductions -- a combination of longstanding provisions in the tax code and breaks instituted after the 2001 terror attacks to spur the economy -- are available only to small-business owners and the self-employed.
Environmental groups, alerted to the tax breaks by a report this week in The Detroit News, want them ended. They note that despite concerns about the nation's growing dependence on imported oil, the deductions provide far greater incentive to buy gas guzzlers like Ford Excursions and General Motors Hummers than to buy the most fuel-efficient cars, like the Toyota Prius. 
All together, an eligible buyer of a 2003 Hummer H2 could deduct $34,912 of the $48,800 base price in the vehicle's first year of service, according to tax rules. That would translate into a tax savings of nearly $13,500 for someone in the highest personal income tax bracket.
The biggest piece in the package of tax breaks is an immediate deduction for any depreciable capital expense of $24,000 this year, rising to $25,000 starting next year. Dr. March said that he and his partners are spreading their purchases over three years so that each vehicle would qualify for the full deduction. (He said that an S.U.V. was a necessity for a doctor who has to get to work during Michigan winters.)
In addition, businesses can take the normal depreciation on vehicles over five years, starting with a 20 percent deduction in the first year. An extra dollop of tax savings comes from a bonus 30 percent first-year deduction on capital expenses, part of an economic stimulus package approved by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks. Both are computed after the $24,000 deduction.
The deal is not nearly so generous for buyers of less-than-gargantuan vehicles. When the portion of the tax code governing these kinds of deductions was written in the 1980's, deductions for the purchase of an automobile were capped. Currently, a business can deduct no more than $7,660 for a car in its first year of service (including the 30 percent bonus), $4,900 in the second year and less in the succeeding years. 
The limits were imposed, tax experts say, to prevent businesses from loading up on Cadillacs and Mercedeses at taxpayers' expense. But the cap was not extended to trucks and vans with a gross vehicle weight -- basically the weight fully loaded -- of 6,000 pounds or more. 
Back then, that gave businesses the ability to take big tax deductions on vehicles used for construction, farming or hauling. Today, the tax benefits extend to dozens of vehicles that make the weight limit -- from sport utility vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade and BMW X5, which are typically used as family transportation, to pickups like the GMC Sierra and the Chevrolet Silverado.
That has made environmentalists livid.
"We think it's outrageous that the government is giving special treatment to these vehicles under the guise that they are used for farm or work purposes," said Michelle Robinson, a spokeswoman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group. "Congress needs to step up and close this loophole, especially at a time when we clearly, now more than ever, need to be saving oil and not promoting the biggest gas guzzlers."
Though there is a special $2,000 tax deduction for purchasers of alternative-fuel and electric-powered vehicles, the qualifying vehicles naturally weigh less than 6,000 pounds, and the benefits therefore are capped.
For example, an owner of a small business who takes the maximum deductions on a $20,500 Prius could trim $9,660 from his taxable income. To a taxpayer in the highest bracket, that means a tax saving of $3,500.
The Prius, a hybrid that teams a traditional gasoline-powered engine with an electric motor, gets an average of 48 miles per gallon, according to government data. The H2 is so big that General Motors does not have to report its fuel efficiency to the government; drivers say it gets a combined 11 miles per gallon in city and highway driving.
The Monroe doctors' accountant is spreading the word about the advantages of buying a behemoth.
"As soon as they passed the law, it dawned on me that this is a real tax break for some people," said the accountant, Jim Jenkins of Southfield, Mich. "For example, a self-employed realtor who buys, say, a Lincoln Navigator and pays $40,000, he puts zero down, he gets zero percent interest and gets a $32,000 tax deduction."
It is a deal he is considering for himself.
"I drive a Ford Explorer," Mr. Jenkins said, a sport utility vehicle not quite big enough to qualify for the enlarged deduction. The vehicles that do, he added, "are just bigger than anything I want, but with that tax deduction dangling in front of me, it's tempting."

HEADLINE: Plan for Airline Alliance Delayed 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines, the Northwest Airlines Corporation and Continental Airlines must wait 30 more days for a federal ruling on whether they can sell tickets to one another's flights, a plan that regulators have said raises competitive concerns. 
 The Department of Transportation extended its review a fourth time, into next month, and said in a filing that it had discussed the issues in detail with the airlines, without providing specifics. 
The agency can decide to allow the alliance to go forward or begin a legal proceeding to try to block it. 
 "The D.O.T. may be saying, 'Don't think just because you guys are losing money we're going to let you carve up the industry by lessening competition,' " said Clifford Winston, a Brookings Institution economist who specializes in airlines. The department may force the three airlines to exempt from the alliance some routes where they are dominant, analysts have said.
Delta, the third-largest airline in the United States; Northwest, No. 4; and Continental, No. 5; applied in August to share passengers and to coordinate routes and schedules. The alliance is intended to increase sales, which have been depressed since the 2001 terrorist attacks.
Opponents have said the alliance, which expands an existing Northwest-Continental link, would bring a total of $600 million in revenue to the three carriers.
The Transportation Department review may be extended one more time until late February as Continental continues talks with the department, said Dave Messing, a spokesman for the airline, which is based in Houston. Continental completed talks with the Justice Department and expects to be able to begin the alliance in the first half of next year.

HEADLINE: Arab Coexistence School Falls Victim to Uprising 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: AL KHADER, West Bank, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Even as it withers, the pink-and-white Hope Flowers school here on Bethlehem's outskirts is drawing at least a handful of Israelis and Palestinians together, if for a troubling reason.
 The school was founded 18 years ago by a Palestinian refugee, Hussein Issa, who hoped to teach the importance of coexistence and democracy -- along with Arabic, English and Hebrew -- to Palestinian children. 
 But the joint field trips held with Israeli schools ended with the start of the conflict more than two years ago. The collapsing Palestinian economy bit into tuition payments. The roadblock erected by the Israeli Army on the only route to the school halted the school bus. And for many Palestinians, the enduring conflict made the idea of coexistence seem increasingly Pollyannaish, if not disloyal. 
Then, before dawn on Tuesday morning, Israeli forces arrested the principal, Ibrahim Issa -- the founder's son -- and accused him of harboring two terrorists. Mr. Issa's family said he was duped by a man who claimed to be renting an apartment for innocent purposes. 
Desperate pleas from the family to contacts at the American Consulate in Jerusalem halted the demolition of the Issa home near here, though not before an Israeli bulldozer destroyed the garage and gouged out the garden.
Some Israelis with ties to the school from before the conflict have been badgering the Israeli government for news of Mr. Issa; some have been checking on the family and offering support.
"Oh, boy, those people were great," said Benjamin Waxman, who visited Hope Flowers just before the conflict began in September 2000. "First of all, they were nice, extremely nice. Secondly, what they were trying to do was to run a school where they teach people that coexistence is possible, the Zionists aren't the enemy. It's refreshing." He wanted to set up a computer lab at the school, but the conflict intervened.
Mr. Waxman's interest -- and his reception at the school -- were particularly striking because he is an Israeli settler, living in Efrat, just a short distance from Hope Flowers but far across the deepening Israeli-Palestinian divide. 
On Monday, two Democratic members of Congress, David E. Price of North Carolina and Jim Davis of Florida, visited the school. "I was quite impressed," Mr. Price said in a telephone interview. He met with Mr. Issa, 28, and said he was "baffled and dismayed" by the news of the arrest. Mr. Price's church in Chapel Hill has sent at least one volunteer to help at Hope Flowers.
Hind Issa, 52, the widow of the founder of Hope Flowers, said the school's goal was to "decrease the suffering of both peoples."
"Even now, we are convinced of the need for a peace process," she said. "Violence hasn't led to results for anyone."
During that conversation, in the family home on Wednesday, a Palestinian just released from the same prison where her son Ibrahim was being held telephoned to convey a request: Because Mr. Issa, an engineer trained in the Netherlands, had been taken away in his pajamas, he asked that his family send warm clothes and his medicine, for an ulcer and allergies. 
Eventually, an Israeli friend of the family helped deliver the clothes and medicine across the army checkpoints. The Israeli asked not to be identified for fear of being criticized for helping a jailed Palestinian.
Capt. Sharon Feingold, an army spokeswoman, called the raid on Tuesday morning a "pinpoint operation based on intelligence." She said the soldiers had found what they were looking for -- a commander of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, the violent group affiliated with Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction, and another militant from that organization.
Ghada Issa, Ibrahim's sister, said that her brother rented an apartment to a stranger two days before the army arrived and that the stranger had said he was a night guard in Bethlehem. "Ibrahim was deceived," she said.
Ami Isseroff, an Israeli software consultant and a friend of the Issa family, has been sending out e-mail alerts about their predicament to friends on Internet sites devoted to dialogue about the conflict. In an essay he posted at the Web site www.Mideastweb.org, Mr. Isseroff lamented what he called a lack of due process. He reported that it took a day even to find out where Mr. Issa was being held.
When he visited Hope Flowers in 1999, Mr. Isseroff was amazed to see an Israeli flag painted on an outside wall, beside the other flags of the world. Even before the conflict, such seemingly trivial recognitions of the adversary's nationhood were rare. 
Israeli soldiers removed the roadblock outside the school just last week. But today the school was shut down because of a curfew imposed on all of Bethlehem. Israeli armored vehicles clanked through the streets, occasionally pelted with stones thrown by children. 
From a high of about 500 children in 1998, enrollment has fallen to about 120 now. Mr. Issa's friends say he was considering borrowing against the school's bus to pay the monthly operating costs of about $7,000.
The Israeli flag was gone today from the mural; there is a blank white spot directly below the flag of Iraq. Ghada Issa, 25, said that an offended painter had covered it up, and that because of the Israeli closings, the family had not yet hired someone to restore it.
Another Israeli flag can be seen on a poster of "Flags of the World" in the school's entrance way. Nearby hangs an article from The Jerusalem Post of Jan. 26, 1999, before the conflict began. It describes how, on most Tuesdays, third graders from Hope Flowers joined with counterparts from an Israeli school to learn about agriculture.
Suleiman Salah, a 5-year-old kindergarten pupil at Hope Flowers, wandered through the empty grounds today as the school's guard, his cousin Khaled Salah, 37, showed some visitors around.
Suleiman said he had learned the English words for "bird" and "cat." He said that he liked Hope Flowers, and that it was closed because "they arrested Ibrahim."
His cousin asked Suleiman if he knew why the Israelis imposed a curfew. "Because they want Al Aksa and Jerusalem," Suleiman replied, in a reference to Al Aksa mosque. 
Asked if he would play with an Israeli, he said: "I don't like them. They shoot people."
But what about an Israeli boy who was not armed? "An Arab?" he asked. A Jew, he was told. "No," he said.

HEADLINE: Citing an Economic Slump, Verizon Lays Off 2,700 Workers 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
Verizon Communications, the region's largest telephone company, laid off 2,700 workers in New York and New Jersey yesterday. 
 The workers make up 10 percent of the company's front-line repair and installation work force. 
 Yesterday's cuts were the first major layoffs by Verizon in New York, said John Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman. Verizon has 46,000 employees in New York State, including those in its wireless division. 
Verizon has warned of big layoffs for months. The company announced in May that it would lay off 2,100 workers, but instead it offered workers retirement and buyout packages.
Then, in October, Verizon announced that it might lay off 3,800 workers. The company continued to negotiate with union officials over new contracts for workers and called the layoffs a last resort.
But layoffs came yesterday, effective immediately, to 2,352 workers in New York State and 361 workers in New Jersey.
Mr. Bonomo called the cuts unavoidable in a telecommunications industry that is in an economic slump. Verizon is losing customers and faces increased competition from cellular phones and cable modem services, he said.
"This is a difficult step to take, but one that is necessary if we are to ensure a healthy and successful company in the future," he said. "Verizon is faced with a difficult economy, tough competition and a changing industry where many customers are using other technologies in place of our more traditional wire line services."
Union officials had argued that Verizon could avoid layoffs by bringing back work it had contracted to outside companies.
Bob Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, called the layoffs "devastating for workers and their families." 
"Customers are going to have serious problems with their service," he said. "They'll have more problems on the line and longer waits for repairs."
Mr. Bonomo dismissed the notion that service would decline.
The Communications Workers of America represents about 19,000 Verizon workers in New York, and other telecommunications workers in New York, New Jersey and parts of New England. 
The two sides have waged fierce publicity campaigns over the layoffs, competing for public support through advertisements.
Mr. Master blamed Verizon for losing money on bad investments and then cutting jobs to show Wall Street that it was trimming costs.
Verizon reported third-quarter earnings of $4.4 billion. Mr. Master accused the company of continuing to pay bloated salaries to its top executives. Mr. Bonomo responded that Verizon's profits in the New York market had been meager.
Verizon officials have criticized the union for overspending on advertisements to bring attention to union leadership, instead of concentrating its efforts on negotiating a solution for its rank-and-file workers.
Verizon says that it offered union officials a deal earlier this year that would have avoided the layoffs, a contract that offered a wage freeze and a shortened workweek. Union officials rejected it. Mr. Master said the offer "wasn't even worth talking about."

HEADLINE: Carriage Drivers Say Horses Are in Danger of Being Evicted 

BYLINE:  By CECILIA M. VEGA 

 BODY:
There are not a lot of opportunities for out-of-work horses during the holidays in New York City.
 Passing as one of Santa's reindeer is a long shot, and it would be a tough squeeze in a Nativity scene. 
 So the drivers in top hats who guide 30 of the horse-drawn carriages in and around Central Park are especially nervous because the city-owned building where the horses are stabled will probably be sold at the end of the year. That means they have to find a new stable, or, they say, everyone is out of a job. 
"Unfortunately, New York City doesn't have a whole lot of stable space, and there are not a whole lot of co-ops where you can just take these as pets," said Richard Rosenthal, a lawyer representing the drivers.
For the past two years, Shamrock Stables has housed a third of the city's carriage horses in a building on West 45th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. Mr. Rosenthal said Shamrock's owner learned last week that the building would be sold to make space for a movie and television studio complex and that the month-to-month lease he has with the city would be canceled at the end of the month.
At a news conference at the stables yesterday, Mr. Rosenthal, who rode in on a horse-drawn carriage, said he would seek an injunction next week to prevent the eviction.
"They're part of the character and culture of this city," he said, standing in the stable surrounded by horses nibbling on hay meant for decoration. "Take a look at any movie with New York in it. They all show horses in Central Park."
Michael Sherman, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that the property sale is expected to close sometime in the coming weeks and that his office is trying to help find a new space for the horses.
"We have been working behind the scenes to try to find them a location," he said. "It's very hard to find suitable stable locations in Manhattan."
He also said the city gave the stable owner more than a week's notice that the lease would expire, but he did not know exactly how much notice had been given.
Mr. Rosenthal said he had not been told the city would help find the horses a new home.
The 45th Street building was originally meant to house Police Department patrol horses, but instead the city moved the carriage horses there two years ago from a stable near Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive because of construction in the area, Mr. Rosenthal said.
Neither Shamrock's owner nor the drivers know what will happen to the horses or the carriages come January. Some of the horses belong to owners who hire the drivers, and others are owned by the drivers themselves.
The thought of having to pack up those horses and leave the stable, especially during the holidays, has worried everyone at Shamrock.
"I don't think the mayor wants 30 more people in the unemployment line," a carriage driver, Brendan McMahon, said. "At this time of year it's like a death sentence hanging over our heads."

HEADLINE: 2 Rivals Vying for Control of Poland's Steel Group 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
With its huge, smoke-spewing mills, vast work force and billions of dollars in debt, Poland's state-owned steel conglomerate, Polskie Huty Stali, seems an unlikely industrial prize, a leftover dinosaur at the tail end of Central Europe's post-Communist privatization.
 But with the slimmed-down, privatized Western European steel industry in surprisingly robust health, and with Poland set to join the common market of the wealthy European Union in 2004, the company, known as PHS, is poised to become the object of a bidding war by two of the most successful steel makers in Europe: the United States Steel Corporation, based in Pittsburgh, and the sprawling empire of the entrepreneur Lakshmi N. Mittal, based in London. 
 The Polish government is expected to set terms for the sale of a 51 percent stake in PHS, a company that accounts for 70 percent of the Polish steel market and has annual revenues of around 7 billion zlotys ($1.8 billion).
Luc Pez, an analyst at ING Bank in Paris, estimated that all of PHS was worth about $1.3 billion, given its towering debts. But the government is requiring that the new owner invest at least $350 million in new equipment, Mr. Pez said, so that will push the cash price for control of the company down to about $300 million. 
Representatives of both interested buyers have been visiting the mills to gauge their fair value.
"PHS would be an important part of our strategy in Eastern Europe," said Annanya Sarin, director of communications for Mr. Mittal. Mr. Mittal's two chief companies -- the privately held LNM Holdings, which will be bidding for PHS, and Ispat International, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- own mills in the Czech Republic, Romania and Kazakhstan, as well as in Western Europe and the United States.
John Goodish, president of U.S. Steel Kosice, a factory that the American steel maker bought three years ago in Slovakia and that is now United States Steel's only profitable major unit, said United States Steel was equally determined to win PHS's five mills.
"Polish mills would put us into whole new product lines," Mr. Goodish said.
Still, the big European steel makers Arcelor and ThyssenKrupp have canceled plans to bid.
And last week, as the European Union approved Poland's bid for membership, Poland tentatively agreed to reduce its production of finished steel products by 690,000 tons, giving Western Europe's steel industry some protection against cheap Polish imports. The move had been expected, and Mr. Pez said it should not affect the PHS sale.
Since the dawn of the microchip age, steel has been a tough industry in which to make a profit.
In Europe, governments and unions bent on preserving jobs made mills notoriously inefficient. Billions of dollars subsidized money-losing steel mills in the last quarter-century, until privatizations and mergers in the last few years returned Europe's mills to profitability.
In the United States, steel makers have been hobbled by union work rules, imports from countries with cheap labor and the huge legacy costs of cleaning up pollution and paying pensions to armies of laid-off workers.
Eastern Europe's surviving state-owned mills are an attractive proposition to producers seeking a low-cost place to make steel for either Eastern Europe's own growing markets or for export to Western Europe when Poland and seven other post-Communist countries join the European Union in 2004.
"They have a very healthy steel market in Poland, forecast to grow quite healthily because accession will give a boost to the economy," said Harvey Gordon, managing director of London-based EuroStrategy Consultants, which examined the Polish steel industry for the European Commission. Poland produces lots of automobiles and consumer durables like refrigerators and ovens, he said, "so there is an enormous scope for an indigenous steel industry."
United States Steel and Mr. Mittal's companies would probably want to use Poland as a base for westward exports as well as for selling steel in Poland, Mr. Gordon added.
First, however, the Polish mills will have to revamp, at a time when the country's economy is still troubled. 
Though Poland's economy is expected to pick up a bit in 2003, it has been faltering in the last three years. As sales of new cars fell 49 percent from 1999 to 2001, major carmakers like Daewoo and Fiat scaled back production in the country. Revenues at shipyards, usually another strong market for Polish steel, dropped 12 percent in local currency terms last year. Even though demand should remain stable, it is not expected to rise.
Inflation and a stubbornly unreformed agricultural sector have pushed down the value of the Polish currency, further depressing consumer demand at home.
Steel imports have risen sharply, accounting for about 40 percent of domestic steel consumption in 2001. And Poland's steel exports have dropped in trade mostly with European Union countries, according to the Metallurgical Chamber of Industry and Commerce, based in Katowice, Poland.
The Polish steel industry has shrunk a lot since the days when it helped feed the illusions of the Soviet empire. From 1992 to 1998, production capacity was cut to 13 million tons a year from 20 million tons, and the industry's work force fell to 31,600 at the end of 2001 from 147,000 in 1990, according to Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy PBK in Cracow.
The industry is $1.25 billion in debt and is unable to compete, even in its home market, with foreign producers on price, quality or product range.
In October, Poland's center-left government announced a plan to cut the jobs of 6,000 more steelworkers, cut production 10 percent by 2006 and earmark 2.4 billion zlotys ($617 million) to help retire PHS's debt.
The five mills that make up PHS are Huta Cedler, which is focused on wire and wire rod; Huta Florian, a zinc-coating mill; Huta Katowice, an integrated mill producing I-beams, rail and similar so-called long products; Huta Sendzimira, which mostly makes flat and rolled steel; and Huta Czestochowa, a casting operation with a small rolling mill.
All are filled with aging machinery, some from the 1950's, and all are far behind their Western competitors in terms of quality. Last year alone, the two largest, Sendzimira and Katowice, lost more than 1 billion zlotys ($257 million) combined, and Sendzimira alone has debts of at least 1.5 billion zlotys.
Without investment, the Polish mills are unlikely to make a profit. Up to half of the production at some mills, including Sendzimira, is of low-margin unfinished products.
Mr. Goodish says his company, United States Steel, knows just what it would take to make PHS profitable. "Poland needs some dramatic restructuring," he said. "That's going to be a major challenge, to bring equipment up to today's standards and revamp the commercial, sales and marketing side."
Layoffs and investment will be needed, he said, but the most important factor will be the management practices that have made the Kosice plant such a success.
Mr. Mittal's companies would not divulge their plans for PHS.
Some experts wondered whether Mr. Mittal would be able to swallow the cost of acquiring and revamping PHS because this year he has bought both the Sidex steel mill in Romania and the Nova Hut mill in the Czech Republic. According to Ms. Sarin, Mr. Mittal's spokeswoman, money is not a problem for LNM. She said its profits were close to 25 percent of revenue in 2001.
Whoever buys the mills will have to move fast, said Michal Mierzwa, an analyst at Erste Securities Poland in Warsaw.
"Too many years were wasted in the 90's," Mr. Mierzwa said. "This is one of the last sectors to be privatized, and it is getting late."

Anger Raises Concern About Bush Run in '04

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The furor over Senator Trent Lott has ignited anger and unease at the White House in part because of the danger that it could derail President Bush's efforts to win over black and Hispanic voters and attract more of the white suburban moderates who are crucial to Mr. Bush's re-election in 2004, strategists in both parties say.
 Since his first race for governor of Texas in 1994, Mr. Bush has sought to reach out to minority voters, and since winning the White House, he has been more aggressive on that front than previous Republican presidents, driven both by political imperative and what his supporters say is a sincere belief in the need for racial reconciliation. 
 But strategists from both parties and independent analysts said Mr. Lott's approving statements about Strom Thurmond's run for the presidency in 1948 on a segregationist platform have already set back the president's efforts to bring more minority voters into his party without alienating its overwhelmingly white and largely conservative base.
The fallout from the controversy could have profound effects not just on Mr. Bush's re-election prospects but also on the Republican Party's efforts to build a broader coalition for years to come. 
Political advisers to Mr. Bush said simple arithmetic showed that the party could not afford to falter in its efforts to win a bigger share of the minority vote, especially among Hispanics, whose numbers are growing far faster than the electorate as a whole.
If the Republican ticket were to take the same percentages of the Hispanic, black and white vote in 2004 as it did in 2000, said Matthew Dowd, the White House's pollster, it would lose the popular vote by three million ballots and the Electoral College. In 2000, Mr. Bush received 544,000 fewer votes than Al Gore but won the Electoral College.
"This is not only something the president cares a lot about, but also something that's a political necessity for Republicans," Mr. Dowd said.
The political calculation goes beyond the controversy's effect on minority voters. The crucial political question now, strategists in both parties say, is whether Mr. Bush's condemnation last week of Mr. Lott's statements is enough to assure moderate white voters -- especially suburban women for whom racial tolerance is an important component of party identity -- that Republicans would no longer tolerate racism.
"Observing Bush's campaigns in Texas over the years, he talked very effectively about issues that motivated nontraditional Republican voters, black and Hispanic, to take a first look at the G.O.P.," said Scott Reed, a Republican consultant. "But the biggest Achilles' heel of the Lott episode is the damage it could do to our suburban women, the soccer mom moderate Republicans and independent women."
Recent Republican presidents have had consistent political trouble navigating racial issues. Each has taken steps under the pressure of campaigns that many political analysts interpreted as thinly veiled efforts to play the race card with conservative white voters.
Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., and invoked "states rights," a phrase many civil rights groups consider code for segregation. The current president's father invoked Willie Horton, a black man who raped a woman while on a weekend furlough from a murder sentence, to appeal to white voters in his race against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. 
At the time of his greatest political peril in the 2000 Republican primaries, the current President Bush appeared in South Carolina at Bob Jones University, which has a history of banning interracial dating.
Mr. Bush's African-American supporters said he feels strongly about helping to erase racial divisions regardless of the political implications.
Mr. Bush is "secure in making certain he's the president of all Americans and making sure that all Americans have a seat at the table," said the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of the Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston.
Mr. Bush has tried to address the priorities of minority voters in a way that blurs the line between the social attitudes supported by the traditional conservative Republican base and those that appeal to moderate voters. His main vehicle for straddling that line has been his "compassionate conservative" agenda, which supporters say will meet the needs of minority groups but in ways that conservatives assert will be more effective than the longstanding remedies prescribed by liberals. 
Mr. Bush has also relied heavily on symbolism, nowhere more so than at the 2000 Republican convention in Philadelphia. The convention featured prominent African-American Republicans like Colin L. Powell as speakers, but also gave time to gospel choirs, black preachers and other representatives of minority groups -- a sharp contrast to the audience of delegates, only 4 percent of whom identified themselves as black.
Mr. Bush won only about 8 percent of the black vote in the 2000 race, down from the 12 percent for Bob Dole in 1996.
Mr. Bush did better among Hispanics. He won 31 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2000, compared with Mr. Dole's 21 percent. Hispanic voters are much less politically homogenous than black voters, and it is unclear how much the renewed focus on the racial stance of the Republican Party might affect Hispanic voting patterns.
Asked about Mr. Bush's record in helping minority groups, his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, responded this week with a lengthy list of accomplishments, from last year's education bill to his advocacy of church-based social welfare programs.
"I think when you take a look at the administration's record in helping minorities, it's very broad-based and helpful," Mr. Fleischer said. "He's proud to be a different kind of Republican in that sense and to offer these proposals."
But Mr. Bush's record since taking office has done little to help him with liberal civil rights groups. In a report this week, People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, said there was a "yawning gap between the president's public pronouncements on equal rights and the ongoing record of his administration and Republican party leaders."
Other groups that track racial issues said Mr. Bush's record on judicial appointments, his selection of John Ashcroft as attorney general and his economic focus on tax cuts had done nothing to help win black support.
"The fact of the matter is that the administration's agenda is not by and large one that African-Americans find all that attractive," said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal-leaning research organization.

National G.O.P. Members Weigh Against Lott in Poll

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
By more than two to one, members of the Republican National Committee say that Trent Lott should step down as the Senate Republican leader, warning that he is damaging the party's image and undermining its efforts to appeal to minorities, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 In a sign of Mr. Lott's apparently tenuous situation, only 16 percent of the members of the national committee -- the organizational backbone of the party, made up of elected and appointed officials nationwide -- said they believed that Mr. Lott would survive the cascade of questions about his views on segregation. Mr. Lott, of Mississippi, said two weeks ago that the nation would be better off if Senator Strom Thurmond, who ran for president in 1948 on a platform that advocated segregation, had been elected. 
 At the same time, a Times/CBS News poll of Democratic National Committee members found that Democrats were glum about their performance in the November elections -- and worried about the next round. More than 50 percent of the committee members said it would be somewhat difficult or very difficult to unseat President Bush in 2004 in their states. By contrast, nearly two-thirds of the Republican committee members said they thought Mr. Bush faced a very easy or somewhat easy task in winning re-election in their states. 
To recapture the White House, the Democratic committee members said, their party needed to move to the center. But they also said the party's candidate in 2004 should press to roll back the Bush tax cuts, campaign for stricter gun control laws and challenge Mr. Bush on the war in Iraq and measures to increase surveillance of ordinary Americans, according to the poll.
The Times/CBS News polls of the two political committees pointed to one unexpected confluence of views: The perception that Al Gore would have been a weak candidate had he decided to run in 2004. In interviews conducted mostly before Mr. Gore announced on Sunday that he would not run, 43 percent of Republicans said they hoped the Democrats would choose Mr. Gore at their convention 2004, presumably because they believed he would be defeated. And 42 percent of Democrats said they hoped Mr. Gore would not run.
Just 17 percent of Democrats questioned before Mr. Gore's announcement said that Mr. Gore was their preferred presidential candidate, compared with 19 percent who named Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
The two polls of the members of the Republican and Democratic national committees -- the most active partisans in the nation -- were conducted by telephone and fax from December 9 to 18.
Among Democrats, 313 of the 440 committee members were interviewed, while 128 of the 165 Republican committee members participated in the survey. Each poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. And 97 Republican committee members were reinterviewed regarding Mr. Lott. The margin of error for that subgroup is plus or minus six percentage points.
The polls were conducted in what is typically a sleepy period in politics -- the weeks between Election Day and New Year's Day. But this season has given committee members plenty to talk about. For Democrats, it was Mr. Gore's exit from the presidential race, and the struggle by other candidates to take advantage of his departure. For Republicans, it was the battle over Mr. Lott, who has been in line to become the Senate majority leader in new Senate.
In the poll, 45 percent of Republicans said he should not be the party's leader, compared with 20 percent who said he should be. Thirty-six percent said they had no opinion. Nearly half of the committee members said they believed it would be bad for the party if Mr. Lott continued as its leader. But an overwhelming number said Mr. Bush should stay out of the fight, allowing the Senate to deal with its own difficulties.
"Trent Lott should step down," Lynn Windel, a Republican committee member from Oklahoma, said in a follow-up interview. "Our party has made such a concerted effort to dispel the myth that we are insensitive to minorities, especially to African-Americans, and his statement is so damaging."
But Arlene Ellis, a Republican committee member from Utah, said: "Trent Lott should continue because he has done a good job. What he said was repugnant, but he apologized."
If Mr. Lott steps aside, about one-quarter said they would like to see Bill Frist, the Tennessee senator who said today he was interested in running for Mr. Lott's post, get the job. 
Among many Democrats, the initial expectation was that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who was Mr. Gore's running mate in 2000, would inherit the bulk of Mr. Gore's support. But the poll of this decidedly unrepresentative group of Democrats, who tend to be more liberal than rank-and-file party members, suggested that this was not the case.
When committee members were recanvassed on the Democratic field after Mr. Gore made his announcement, Mr. Lieberman was the choice of just 2 percent, compared with Mr. Kerry, who was at the top of the field with 23 percent. 
Two other widely known Democrats who have been considering a race for president -- Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and Tom Daschle, the departing Senate majority leader -- have apparently not stirred much enthusiasm among this class of Democratic activists. Five percent named Mr. Gephardt, while just 2 percent named Mr. Daschle.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont was named by 4 percent of the respondents. Another likely Democratic candidate, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, was the choice of 8 percent.
If there was a scattering of opinion about 2004, there was something approaching a consensus about the presidential contest of 2008: Forty-four percent of the Democratic committee members said they expected Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York to run for president then.
Members of both party committees say the economy will be a crucial issue in the 2004 campaign. But Republicans were much more likely to say that the war with Iraq and terror would also be a decisive issue in the race; nearly 9 of 10 Republicans said they believed Democrats would be vulnerable on each of these issues.
Even in the midst of the turmoil involving Mr. Lott, Republican leaders are much more optimistic about the presidential election and say the party should stay the course. Nearly 6 of 10 Republican members described themselves and their party as conservative. And in contrast to the Democrats, Republicans said the party should oppose gun control and champion limits on access to abortion. 
Among Democrats, most committee members said they were generally satisfied with the quality of their presidential candidates, and notwithstanding the setbacks of the last election, 74 percent said they believed that Terry McAuliffe should remain the party's political chairman. 
But there is abundant evidence that the Democratic Party is confused about where it should go. More than one-quarter said the party should position itself more to the left on issues in the coming year, while nearly 50 percent said it needed to be "more moderate." About 70 percent described the Democratic Party as moderate on most issues.
Yet on a variety of subjects that are likely to be prominent in a presidential campaign, the Democrats wanted their candidates to stake out positions on the left side of the political spectrum. 
In addition to opposing Mr. Bush's tax cuts and pushing for stricter gun control, Democrats said their nominee should oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and opt for protecting the environment over producing energy. They also said the party should oppose any effort by the federal government to monitor telephone calls and e-mail of ordinary citizens as part of its anti-terrorism efforts.

How the Survey Was Conducted
The surveys of members of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee were conducted by The New York Times/CBS News on Dec. 9 to 18, mainly by telephone but also by fax if an individual preferred. 
Of the 440 members of the Democratic committee, 313, or 71 percent, were reached. Of the 165 members of the Republican committee, 128, or 78 percent, were reached.
Forty-three members of the Democratic committee who initially expressed support for Al Gore as the party's 2004 presidential nominee were called back after Mr. Gore said he would not be a candidate. Ninety-seven of the Republicans were called back about Senator Trent Lott.
Members of the national committees are either elected or appointed.
The sample for each committee was weighted by sex and census region to reflect the actual composition of that committee. 
In some cases, members answered the survey through their aides.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples will differ by no more than five percentage points in either direction from what would have been gotten by surveying every committee member.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any opinion survey may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Speech Focuses On Deflation, Not Inflation 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned tonight that deflation, a general decline in prices, could be more damaging to economic growth than inflation.
 In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Greenspan repeated past assertions that the United States was "nowhere near" falling into deflation. But he dwelt on the subject at considerable length in a somber speech that made it clear he is worried about the possibility. 
 "It now appears that we have learned that deflation as well as inflation are in the long run monetary phenomena," Mr. Greenspan said.
"Although the U.S. economy has largely escaped any deflation since World War II, there are some well-founded reasons to presume that deflation is more of a threat to economic growth than inflation," he continued. 
In a deflationary situation, he said, a central bank has somewhat more difficulty in responding because it is impossible to reduce interest rates below zero.
The Fed's benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between banks is now at 1.25 percent, its lowest level in 41 years and within striking distance of the "zero bound."
In both his discussion of deflation and his cautious assessment of the economic outlook, Mr. Greenspan reinforced the impression among many economists that the Fed did not plan to tighten monetary policy soon.
Speaking to the same forum in which he once warned about "irrational exuberance" in the stock market, Mr. Greenspan devoted himself today in large part to discussing the stock market bubble that burst two years ago.
As he has before, Mr. Greenspan disputed critics who have complained that he should have tried to prick the bubble before it became too big by tightening monetary policy sooner.
But his tone was subdued rather than defiant. "Weaving a monetary policy path through the thickets of bubbles and deflations and their possible aftermath is not something with which modern central bankers have had much experience," he said.
He offered a cautious assessment of the current economy. Though he noted numerous signs of health, he found at least as many reasons for warning that the economy is not yet out of the doldrums: the job market is weak, manufacturing is still in a slump, Europe and Japan are weaker than the United States, and "geopolitical risk" -- the euphemism for a possible war with Iraq -- is high.
This was the second time in a month that Mr. Greenspan has devoted considerable time to the topic of deflation. His comments tonight followed a more extended speech on the subject last month by another Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke.
In all those comments, Fed officials have insisted that they do not face a situation like that of Japan, which has had declining prices for the past several years even though the Bank of Japan's interest rates have been around zero for five years.
Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues argue that they could, if necessary, pump money into the economy by buying up longer-term Treasury bills and perhaps even foreign securities.
But at least some economists argue that the Fed ought to be acting more assertively already.
"The U.S. economy looks as though it may well be falling from the high wire of a sustainable economic recovery," wrote John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, earlier this month, soon after the Fed reduced the federal funds rate to 1.25 percent from 1.75 percent.
Mr. Makin, whose writings on the subject have drawn much attention at the Fed, contends that Mr. Greenspan needs to make a fundamental shift in strategy -- away from pegging monetary policy to interest rates and toward a renewed focus on money supply and price levels.
That would in some ways be a return to the strategy invoked by Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, at a time when inflation was soaring at double-digit rates.
Mr. Greenspan staunchly opposes a strategy based on money supply, which is very hard to measure in a world where money takes so many forms. He also contends that basing policy on inflation targets would be too much of a restraint on flexibility.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Strikers Ordered To Resume Oil Production 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered today that the state oil company, hobbled by an 18-day antigovernment strike that has choked off oil exports, must restart operations.
 The court said striking employees from Petroleos de Venezuela, one of the largest oil companies in the world and a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, must abide by "decrees and resolutions" issued by the government to reactivate oil production. The strike has almost halted oil exports and left most of the country critically short of gasoline. 
 Strike organizers, members of a broad coalition of business and labor groups stridently opposed to the left-leaning rule of President Hugo Chavez, promptly rejected the decision. 
"There is no step back," Juan Fernandez, a former financial planning manager at the oil company, said in a nationally televised news conference this evening. He argued that the government misinterpreted the court's decision and that the walkout "would not be affected." 
He added, "We are exercising the rights provided in the Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela." 
The decision to continue the strike was expected to heighten tensions as a growing opposition movement has debilitated the economy to pressure Mr. Chavez into calling early elections or resigning. 
Earlier in the day, government officials had warned that unless strike organizers adhere to the decision there could be sanctions, including jail time. "They have a chance to rectify," said William Lara, president of the National Assembly. 
The court did not elaborate on its decision, but legal experts called it a temporary restraining order until the court decides whether the strike should be declared illegal, a ruling that could take several more days.
The decision came as some basic foods disappeared from store shelves. The oil industry, which normally produces 3 million barrels daily and exports 2.5 million, has been severely debilitated, with the government saying production had fallen 70 percent. 
The standoff between the government and its opponents has caused consternation within the Bush administration, which has been urging both sides to negotiate in good faith under the mediation of the Organization of American States. The United States normally counts on Venezuela for up to 14 percent of its imported oil. 
Today, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the United States was "worried about the fact that the oil sector is slowly shutting down, with economic consequences for all Venezuelans, but as well as others outside of Venezuela." He said political turmoil in Venezuela could "create the possibility of violence and deep political unrest" and blamed both sides, saying they have "been acting in a rather intransigent way." 
World oil markets have been rattled by the turmoil in Venezuela, as well as the prospect of possible war with Iraq, and prices have risen to above $30 a barrel. After the Supreme Court here announced its decision, the price of a barrel dipped slightly. 
Across Venezuela, lines up to a mile long formed at gas stations as supplies dwindled and drivers tried to fill their tanks. Many stations had closed. 
"I got up at 4:30 a.m. today to pump in gas, but even at that hour there was a half-hour-long line," Jorge Figueroa, a 35-year-old cabdriver said. The station that sold him fuel limited Mr. Figueroa to a dollar's worth, though in Venezuela that still fetches more than four gallons. 
In the food markets, worried shoppers scrambled to get some hard-to-find items, like beer, milk and the corn flour used to make a traditional corn-based Christmas dish, hallacas. 
"They are still supplying us," said Luigi di Bello, 74, a butcher shop owner, "but the deliveries are very irregular. Yesterday we asked for three sides of beef, and we only received one. We do not have chicken, and do not know when its coming. I'm selling now, but tomorrow, who knows?"
The government, which at first denied the strike was having an effect, has recently acknowledged that the nosedive in production is costing the equivalent of $50 million a year. 
Mr. Chavez has responded to the stoppage by firing four executives who helped lead the strike and sending in troops to take over oil installations and tankers whose crews declared themselves in rebellion. The military has also been authorized to commandeer private tanker trucks to keep gasoline supplies moving. 
Across Caracas today, though, people expressed little faith that things would get better soon, promising a dire Christmas for a country that has seen its economy badly battered by a year of political turmoil.
"I am going to have a Christmas without a car, and without money," lamented Jose Valera, 34, an out-of- work cabdriver. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the general strike in Venezuela misstated the cost of the shutdown of oil production. It is $50 million a day, not a year.

HEADLINE: Hold Your Nose and Negotiate 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
President Bush finally turns out to have a clear, forceful plan to deal with North Korea's defying the West by restarting its nuclear warhead assembly line.
 The plan is to invade Iraq. 
 The White House is trying to play down the crisis on the Korean Peninsula so that it can focus public attention on Iraq instead. But North Korea raises risks that Iraq does not -- because it already has a couple of nuclear weapons, as well as artillery and missiles that can dump nerve gas on American military bases in Asia, and Taepodong missiles that can drop nuclear warheads on Alaska and, soon, the lower 48 states. 
Washington's failure to engage North Korea has in a few months turned a minor problem (a uranium program that would take years to produce weapons) into a major crisis (the restarting of a reactor with enough plutonium to produce five additional warheads). Now the administration is allowing the situation to drift on a trajectory that conceivably could end up as another Korean war. 
"The potential threat posed by North Korea at this point is worse than anything else that we face," said James Laney, a former ambassador to South Korea. "This needs to be attended to now, at the highest levels of this administration. We need to get engaged with South Korea and figure out how to solve this diplomatically, since war would be catastrophic." 
An official with an international organization puts it this way: "North Korea scares the hell out of me. I've been there, and it petrifies me. By comparison, Iraq doesn't scare me at all." 
Perhaps it's a cheap shot to complain about North Korea policy, because the North is a country made for pundits here in the peanut gallery -- it's possible to write with withering scorn about any alternative the administration could choose. All our options regarding North Korea are hideous, and those responsible for making policy on North Korea must have committed mortal sins in previous lives for God to torture them so. To his credit, Mr. Bush has so far shown a most un-Bushian patience in reacting to North Korean provocation. 
We now find ourselves with three choices. First, we can negotiate with North Korea, which shows some signs of seeking the same kind of tentative opening to the West that China pursued in the late 1970's. The downside is that negotiation would reward bad behavior, and so Mr. Bush has ruled out this option.
Second, we can ignore North Korea, focus on Iraq and hope that economic pressure brings the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, to his senses. That's what Washington is trying now, but it's not working. In fact, North Korea's economy is doing better than in the 1990's, and if it were pinched, North Korea could always raise cash by, say, selling smallpox virus to Al Qaeda. And even if we succeeded in squeezing North Korea economically, we would be bothered much more than the Dear Leader as tens of thousands of Koreans died of famine and disease.
Third, we can launch a military strike on the Yongbyon reactor. But North Korea would probably respond by turning South Korea (and American bases there) into what it describes as "a sea of flames."
"I think they would respond by shooting artillery toward South Korea and missiles toward Japan," said Kongdan Oh, author of an excellent book on North Korea. 
These are three terrible choices, but a president's job is to pick the least awful. And hands down that's the first one, negotiation. One way to hide our embarrassment at talking would be to get Russia to convene an international conference, in which the Dear Leader would give up his nukes and permit inspectors, and outside countries would recognize North Korea. 
As Robert Gallucci, a former ambassador with long experience in Korea, put it: "I don't have any difficulty with diplomacy backed by force. But what I don't understand is force with no diplomacy."
Ignoring North Korea doesn't work any better than ignoring a rambunctious toddler; it just encourages further provocation. Next North Korea may begin processing fuel rods at Yongbyon, a step that could give it five to eight more warheads in about four months. 
Granted there's no good North Korea policy, but it's still worth finding a better one -- like holding our nose and negotiating -- because North Korea is already what Iraq might become tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Quo Vadis, Karl? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The day after the Republican triumph in the midterm elections, a jubilant Trent Lott held a celebratory press conference. "Let's roll!" he exulted. (Good taste is not one of Mr. Lott's strong points.)
 Six weeks later, we have to ask: Roll where (aside from Baghdad)? The storm that has broken over Mr. Lott's head is justified. But it may also reflect buyers' remorse: post-election polls suggest broad public unease about where Mr. Lott's party is taking us. 
It's not even clear what the Bush administration wants to accomplish now that it has full control. Until now the administration has been all politics and no policy; John J. DiIulio tells us that there is a "complete lack of a policy apparatus," that all decisions are made by the political arm. For the past two years domestic policy has consisted of little more than checking off the boxes on a wish list drawn up circa 1999.
 Meanwhile, as problems that weren't anticipated in 1999 have arisen, the administration has done as little as possible, as late as possible. 
 This has been true even in the areas where George W. Bush gets highest marks from voters. Remember that the administration repeatedly rejected calls for a homeland security agency, changing its mind only when Coleen Rowley went public with tales of intelligence failures. And a growing chorus of critics say that hardly anything real has been done to make the country safer.
 Similarly, the administration tried to prevent any independent inquiry into what went wrong on Sept. 11, and how to avoid future attacks. Then, when he could no longer avoid an inquiry, Mr. Bush did his best to undermine that inquiry's credibility by choosing Henry Kissinger, of all people, to head it.
 And then there's corporate reform. At first the administration opposed doing anything. Then, after WorldCom blew up, it agreed to a modest reform bill -- only to undermine the bill's credibility both by trying to renege on promises to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with adequate funds, and by pressuring Harvey Pitt not to choose a real reformer to head a crucial new panel.
 Finally, there's economic policy. Fears that the economy would suffer a "jobless recovery" similar to that of the first Bush administration are no longer hypothetical: over the past year G.D.P. has grown, but employment has continued to shrink, and the risk that the U.S. will slide into a Japanese-style pattern of slow growth and deflation no longer seems remote. 
 Again, the response has been to do as little as possible. As Congress failed to agree on an extension of unemployment benefits -- which means that 800,000 families will be cut off on Dec. 28 -- the administration simply stood on the sidelines. Last weekend, too late to help those families, Mr. Bush finally spoke up in favor of an extension, but failed to say whether he favored the merely cosmetic House plan or the more serious Senate plan; those who follow the issue know that this makes all the difference.
 Will things improve now that there's a new economic team? John Snow seems to be Paul O'Neill without the charm. Stephen Friedman will probably be more vigorous than his predecessor; The Washington Post reports that one of Mr. Bush's frequent complaints about Larry Lindsey was that he didn't get enough physical exercise. But Mr. Friedman will have plenty of time to work out; it has been made clear that his duties as economic adviser don't include actually giving any economic advice. 
 Meanwhile, if the trial balloons floated by the administration are any guide to the forthcoming "stimulus" package, it will consist of more items from the checklist: making the tax cut permanent, reducing taxes on dividends. Nice stuff if you make more than $300,000 a year and have a net worth in the millions, but pretty much irrelevant to the actual problems of the economy -- except the long-run deficit, which will get even worse. It seems that Karl Rove and his merry band of Mayberry Machiavellis are still calling the shots.
 It may be that the bad few weeks the administration has just had were the result of random events. But I think the public is finally waking up to the fact that the people in the White House know a lot about gaining power, but not much about what to do with it.

HEADLINE: SEOUL MAY LOOSEN ITS TIES TO THE U.S. 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Roh Moo Hyun, who favors continued engagement with North Korea and greater autonomy from the United States, triumphed today in a tight presidential election. The outcome, after a campaign marked by huge anti-American demonstrations, sets South Korea and the United States on the most divergent diplomatic paths in half a century of close alliance.
 The Bush administration has spent the last three months pressing traditional friends like Japan and newer ones, like Russia and China, to put heavy pressure on North Korea to force that country to abandon a once secret nuclear weapons program and to end its missile sales to the Middle East and Pakistan. 
 Mr. Roh, a lawyer, was the candidate of the governing Millennium Democratic Party. He staked his campaign on continued engagement with North Korea, despite its threatening nuclear program and quirky, often impenetrable diplomacy. He has forcefully ruled out deadlines for compliance or economic sanctions to force his country's impoverished Communist neighbor to respect its international engagements. 
In Washington, James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, told reporters that the Bush administration viewed today's election as an opportunity to work with President-elect Roh "to build an even stronger relationship between our two countries for this new century."
Mr. Kelly sought to minimize differences between Mr. Roh and the administration on North Korea and other issues, suggesting that those differences might have been unfairly magnified during the heat of the campaign.
Mr. Roh's main rival, Lee Hoi Chang, a staunchly conservative former Supreme Court justice, said during the campaign that South Korea should suspend its assistance to North Korea until it cooperated on a host of issues, from arms control to the reunion of families separated since the Korean War. 
Mr. Lee's defeat today was his second; he lost even more narrowly to the departing president, Kim Dae Jung, five years ago. Mr. Kim was barred by the Constitution from seeking a second term.
Mr. Roh's commitment to engagement with North Korea, the most important legacy of his political mentor, President Kim, has been so pronounced at times that it produced a stunning last-minute turn of events that many here thought could have cost him the election.
In the final day of campaigning on Wednesday, Mr. Roh's comments about North Korea shocked a former rival candidate and 11th-hour supporter, Chung Mong Joon, scion of the Hyundai empire, causing him to drop their painstakingly arranged alliance.
With Mr. Chung standing nearby, Mr. Roh said that "if the U.S. and North Korea start a war, we will stop it," a comment read by some as implying that South Korea would take a neutral position.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Chung denounced the speech, saying, "The United States is our ally, and our view is that the U.S. has no reason to fight North Korea."
Mr. Chung's abrupt withdrawal of support was front-page news in every daily this morning, and most commentators here assumed that it would wreck Mr. Roh's chances.
The two men forged their alliance only last month after opinion surveys consistently placed Mr. Lee as the front-runner. Mr. Roh, who had been placing third in the opinion polls, defeated Mr. Chung in a hastily arranged primary and was catapulted into the front-runner's position.
This afternoon, with his triumph not yet assured, Mr. Roh restated the assertive diplomatic position he had taken throughout the campaign.
"We must have dialogue with the North and with the U.S.," Mr. Roh, 56, told a crowd in downtown Seoul. "In this way we must make sure that the North-U.S. dispute does not escalate into a war. Now the Republic of Korea must take a central role. We cannot have a war."
South Korean politics have a long history of treacherous twists, bold dirty tricks and corresponding conspiracy theories. So theories abounded today about Mr. Chung's motives. People invoked everything from a fear of a vendetta against Hyundai if Mr. Lee won to heavy backstage lobbying by Washington, which has 37,000 troops in South Korea.
"Almost everyone expected that Chung's move would do a lot more damage," said Yim Young Soon, a political scientist at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. "In the end, the fact that Chung defaulted seemed to solidify Roh's support. 
"On the North Korean nuclear threat, the conventional wisdom said it would help Lee Hoi Chang, but people who live close to the demilitarized zone turned out to prefer Roh's more peaceful approach."
Hwang Yeon Yae, 53, who owns a snack shop in a working-class Seoul neighborhood, said he and his friends talked all night about "Chung's betrayal." He added: "But the people here are strongly behind Roh, and I don't think it will change many people's minds. That's Korean politics."
That judgment proved correct. Nearly complete election results showed Mr. Roh winning with 48.9 percent of the vote, compared with 46.6 percent for Mr. Lee.
If relations with North Korea were at the center of the campaign from the very start, South Korea's ties with the United States were the barely concealed subtext.
Huge crowds have massed in Seoul and other cities to protest the recent acquittal by a United States military tribunal of two American soldiers in the accidental death of two schoolgirls who were crushed by an armored vehicle in June.
The outpouring of anti-American sentiment appeared to help Mr. Roh, who advocated the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea when he was a labor lawyer in the 1980's. The protests appeared to put Mr. Lee, whose diplomatic views are close to those of the Bush administration, on the defensive.
Already assured of strong support from the young and the working class, Mr. Roh edged toward the center, repeatedly stating that his opposition to American bases had been mistaken and that he valued the alliance with the United States.
Often asked during the campaign why he had never visited the United States, though, Mr. Roh was quick to flash his diffident side, replying pointedly that he was not interested in going to Washington "just for the sake of a photo op."
Mr. Roh's challenge now is to reconcile the dual yearnings of South Korea's sophisticated and increasingly affluent younger generations for more autonomy from the United States and reduced tensions with North Korea with continued reliance on American security.
"The challenge will be between accommodating popular aspirations and meeting the demands of the Bush administration," said Scott Snyder, Korea representative of the Asia Foundation. "The new president is going to face critical decisions in three areas: redefining the relationship with the U.S., managing relations with North Korea and reorienting Korea's relations in the regional context."
Mr. Roh's victory represents a rise against tremendous odds. In South Korea's highly class-conscious society, he was born to a family of peach and chicken farmers in a ramshackle farming village now within the city of Kimhae in the southeast. 
Mr. Lee, his chief rival, is a patrician lawyer and former prime minister, and Mr. Chung one of the richest men in South Korea.
Mr. Roh was too poor to attend college. Yet he studied law for years and was admitted to the bar in 1975. Mr. Roh spent the politically turbulent early 1980's defending student and labor activists against the military government and formally joined the democracy movement in 1987, winning a seat in Parliament from Pusan in 1988.

HEADLINE: Growing New Life at Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By Michael Ableman; Michael Ableman, author of "On Good Land: The Autobiography of an Urban Farm," is founder of the Center for Urban Agriculture.

DATELINE: GOLETA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Proposals for rebuilding the World Trade Center site were unveiled this week -- a collective vision of towering skyscrapers, amphitheaters and broad avenues. Almost completely missing from the plans, though, was an essential element -- a sense of the earth.
 And so I'd like to add something to the mix: an urban farm to be built on a portion of the trade center site. 
 Two to three acres could feed hundreds of people, provide employment for many and connect New Yorkers to the source of their food. As a generator of jobs and food, a downtown farm would demonstrate that a successful economy can have local roots -- that it need not only be global.
As with all agriculture, the foundation of the project would be soil and seeds. Communities across America could send handfuls of earth, thereby building the farm from the soil of the entire nation. Seeds could come from various parts of the world and grow into a living example of our cultural diversity.
Imagine an orchard with hundreds of varieties of apples, where people could stroll down the alleys of the trees -- enjoying the shade and witnessing the gradual cycle from flower to fruit. Consider what it would be like to walk in the middle of winter through beautifully designed glass houses filled with the earthy smells and brilliant colors of an array of fresh food and flowers. Picture outdoor gardens winding through and around the new buildings -- gardens overflowing with herbs and berries and spring, summer and fall vegetables.
A market could be built, so people working in the new buildings and living in the neighborhood could buy fresh vegetables. They could also take part -- during their breaks or at the end of the day -- in tending the soil and producing something real for themselves and their community.
There could be classes and workshops on cooking and gardening, as well as celebratory public meals, to make use of the farm's yield. Joined to other proposals for rebuilding the site, the farm would provide New Yorkers with a new version of the town square, one that balances the hardscape of buildings and pavement with fertile soil, lush plantings and fresh foods.
The farm could be installed at street level -- or, to conserve valuable real estate, it could be placed atop buildings, where it would benefit from better sun exposure and air quality. As part of this sky-high farm, greenhouses could be warmed by the spent energy from the buildings beneath them and gray-water recycled for irrigation, creating a world-class model and laboratory for rooftop food production and energy conservation.
A World Trade Center farm could become a gathering place, a sanctuary, a cultural and social center as important for the health of Manhattan's civic life as its art museums, concert halls, theaters and restaurants. The gardens would be a symbol not just to Americans but to people all over the world. They would show that we know how to bring forth life and nourishment from the rubble of hate and destruction.
I do not believe that it is enough to consecrate the site with steel and concrete and extraordinary architecture. We must also honor lives lost with living seeds planted in their memories -- seeds that would grow and prosper for years to come.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Layoff Upsets Quest for the Good Life

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
The good life. That's what Manuel Requejo envisioned, what he dreamed of, when he left Peru with his family about four years ago and came to the United States.
 The good life. He is still dreaming of it, still waiting for it to begin. 
 Mr. Requejo is 68, an age when many people are enjoying retirement or looking forward to it. 
But Mr. Requejo is not one of those people. He still feels that he must be the breadwinner in a family of seven, despite his age, his diabetes and his struggle to find a steady job in a flagging economy.
"I feel bad because I'm the head of the house and it's difficult," Mr. Requejo said.
Life was not always this hard. Until recently, Mr. Requejo (pronounced re-KAY-ho) had work and a regular paycheck. But he was laid off from his job at Kennedy International Airport cleaning floors, throwing away garbage and washing food containers for LSG Sky Chefs, a caterer for airliners.
Now, instead of a job, he has a job search. Instead of hope, he has worries.
"Rent payments worry me the most," he said in Spanish. "I worry about the food sometimes, too. But rice and beans you can eat every day. It's nutritious. I can stop eating myself so I can feed my grandchildren."
Five years ago, Mr. Requejo, his wife, Lidia, and their daughter Lily lived in Lima, Peru. Their older daughter, Gladys, had moved to New York in 1988 and found a steady job. In Lima, the Requejos were troubled by a constant stream of news reports about kidnappings, guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks. Knowing of their daughter's success in New York, Mr. and Mrs. Requejo decided to follow her there in 1998.
Mr. Requejo found work with Sky Chefs. His weekly paycheck was more money than he could have hoped to earn in a month selling clothes on a street corner in Peru.
The Requejos were happy, and when they spoke to their daughter Lily in Peru, they urged her to join them in America. She came to New York last year with her son, Bryan, now 11, and her daughter, Evelyn, now 17 months old. (Lily Requejo's husband stayed behind in Peru, hoping to join her later.)
Five people became seven when Gladys and her son, Louis, now 11, joined the rest of the family in a $1,300-a-month apartment in Woodhaven, Queens.
The family was making enough money to put some of it in a savings account. "It was a good feeling for us to come to another country and have a good life," Mr. Requejo said.
He lost his job in October 2001 during a slowdown in the airline industry after Sept. 11. Since then, he has been on and off unemployment benefits, which, at best, provide $100 a week. He is applying for unemployment again until he can find work.
One of Mr. Requejo's co-workers at Sky Chefs recommended that he go to the Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven local charities that participate in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
There, Mr. Requejo met a caseworker, Rosa Orihuela, herself from Peru. That meeting led to a shift in fortunes for the family.
Mrs. Orihuela secured $1,300 from the Neediest Cases Fund to pay their rent in October 2001. At the end of November, Catholic Charities also gave him Christmas gifts for the children.
"I'm very grateful to God for this agency for providing assistance," he said.
Mr. Requejo was well liked at work, a hard worker who often took overtime shifts. His employers told him that they would call him back to work if business improved. In the meantime, the Requejos lived off their meager savings, and Mr. Requejo looked for work at restaurants as a dishwasher. Work was hard to find because of his age and poor health, which often left him tired. Some days he rests before hitting the pavement in search of work.
In late April, Mr. Requejo got a call from Sky Chefs to return to work. But on the anniversary of the terrorist attack, he was laid off again. A few weeks later he was asked back again, only to be laid off once more, this time in October -- on his birthday.
"He called me back to explain what was going on," Mrs. Orihuela said. "But funds are very limited."
Her sympathy for the family stems, in part, from common experience. "I had the American dream too," she said. "I came because I knew how great this country was."
Ms. Orihuela was a social worker in Peru before she came to America, so Mr. Requejo feels comforted when discussing his situation with her.
Mr. Requejo's oldest daughter, Gladys, helps out when she can. His other daughter, Lily, sometimes escorts neighborhood children to school and back for $5 per family. The family has stuck together, though paying those bills is still hard.
"I'm grateful that I've been helped, and I hope to be called back to work," Mr. Requejo said. "But I don't know how much longer I can work."
Lily said, "We worry because when he's working he feels alive." 
Still, there are small pleasures. And hope for that good life persists.
His grandsons, Louis and Bryan, are fluent in English, do well in school and have made the transition to living in New York.
Under the television is a collection of English lessons on videotape. Gladys used them when she first arrived in New York years ago. They helped her get her job. Now Mr. and Mrs. Requejo are using them, too.
"It's a good thing she bought it when times were good," Mr. Requejo said with a laugh.

Trade Talks Fail to Agree On Drugs for Poor Nations

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization failed tonight to break a yearlong deadlock over providing impoverished countries with access to life-saving medicine, but the United States pledged that until a deal was reached it would not take any country to court for breaking current trade rules by exporting cut-rate medicine to poor countries.
 The United States said during the late-night sessions that it was unable to accept the draft accord because it covered medicines for more diseases than Washington thought should be included, according to a trade official at the sessions. 
 At issue is a draft agreement that would allow pharmaceutical companies in developing nations to export generic versions of patented drugs to countries too poor to make the medicine themselves. The corporations holding the patents would not be consulted. 
Wealthy nations, led by the United States, wanted to limit the number of diseases covered by the agreement to H.I.V. and AIDS; malaria; tuberculosis; or other infectious epidemics of comparable gravity and scale.
Developing nations like Brazil, India and China argued that governments deserved the right to determine which diseases constituted public health crises in their countries and that the proposed restrictions would undermine the original agreement reached at Doha, Qatar, at the start of a round of world trade negotiations in November of last year. An agreement on the drug issue would fulfill the mandate set at the Doha conference.
Supachai Panitchpakdi, director general of the W.T.O., said in a statement tonight that he was disappointed by the inability of the trade envoys to meet the year-end deadline on the matter. 
"I call on all governments to summon the political will and commitment that will be required to bridge their differences," he said.
The trade organization will take up the issue again next year, and officials said they hoped to reach an agreement by Feb. 11.
During the final debate, a representative of the Vatican reminded the trade representatives that their "promises to the poor must be honored," according to a W.T.O. official.
The United States made its pledge minutes after the talks broke down. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, issued a statement saying that the Bush administration would call on other nations to join in the pledge and allow poor countries to import inexpensive generic medicines even if that amounted to breaking a patent.
"The United States has worked intensively to find a solution that will provide life-saving drugs to those truly in need, and will continue to work towards that end," Mr. Zoellick said. 
"We urge others to join us in this moratorium to help poor countries get access to emergency life-saving drugs."
The United States held the crucial role in meetings throughout the day. The chief aim was to find a compromise that "was not a general assault on the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies," according to a senior trade official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"What got us into this debate was a year's worth of demands by outside groups and the W.T.O. that the W.T.O. rules did not hinder countries from dealing with the AIDS crisis," the official said. "Now it seems that the original purpose is lost.
But several developing nations and nongovernmental organizations objected that it was unfair to rule out medicine to treat diseases like cancer and asthma in the new rule.
"President Bush wants to argue that the diseases American children receive treatment for are off limits to poor children in poor countries, but they cannot win that argument," James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a Washington lobbying group, said in an interview from Geneva.
Throughout the last week, Mr. Panitchpakdi appealed to trade envoys to have a sense of compassion and responsibility for the poor countries, said Peter Ungphakorn, a spokesman for the director general.
"Government after government has said this is vitally important, that it could save lives," Mr. Ungphakorn said. "While this is certainly an important political issue, no one knows economically or medically how much this will be used."
But officials at Doctors Without Borders, which has led a global campaign to broaden poor countries' access to medicines, said they were worried that the new rules would be so complicated and carry so many restrictions that they would discourage the importation of less expensive drugs.
"We're basically talking about a system that could help save millions," said Ellen 't Hoen, program director at Doctors Without Borders. "If a good system isn't created, you can imagine a world a few years from now where multinational companies control the patents for everyone."
The health implications of this trade decision often overshadowed the specific issue of protecting the intellectual property rights of the pharmaceutical companies.
Officials from the United States, Canada, the European Union, Switzerland and Japan said they were determined to protect the patents of their research-based pharmaceutical companies while ensuring that medicines were available to millions of people with AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
But they insisted that the lower-price drugs should be available only for major epidemics in poor countries and not for a wide variety of ailments. They fought proposals that would allow countries like Brazil, China and India to make generic copies of patented medicines and then sell them abroad without the consent of the corporations that hold the patents, saying it would open the door to copying Viagra as well as ointments for baldness.
"We can, and we must, find a reasonable balance between access and patent protection," said Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group.

HEADLINE: US Airways And Unions Agree on Cuts 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
US Airways reached tentative agreements on concessions last night with unions representing its machinists and flight attendants, completing a package for an additional $200 million in wage and benefit cuts that the airline needed to avoid liquidation.
 The moves came as US Airways prepared to file a reorganization plan in United States bankruptcy court. The plan, which a judge will consider at a hearing on Jan. 16, was set to include proposals for returning the airline to profitability. It hopes to emerge from bankruptcy by spring. 
 The airline, however, planned to withhold details of the proposal until this morning, said David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways, which is the country's seventh-largest carrier.
The International Association of Machinists and the Association of Flight Attendants were the final two employee groups to agree to give US Airways additional cuts in pay and benefits, on top of an initial round of $850 million in concessions in the fall. The machinists originally refused to give more in concessions, while the flight attendants' union had said it would agree to more cutbacks only after other unions at US Airways had done so.
The machinists' union, representing 11,100 mechanics and other maintenance workers, said leaders at the airline agreed to cuts worth $59 million. A vote on the cuts was scheduled for early January. The flight attendants' union, representing 7,500 workers, did not disclose the size of its concessions. It said its members would vote on the package by Jan. 10.
Their concessions were part of a new round of cuts, worth a total of $200 million, that were sought by the airline over the last few weeks after its revenue fell short of the projections made when it filed for bankruptcy protection in August. 
David G. Bronner, the chief executive of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which is serving as the primary lender to the airline, this month threatened to withdraw the debtor-in-possession financing he had extended to US Airways and seek liquidation if the unions did not agree to further concessions.
Scotty Ford, president of the machinists District 131-M, representing the airline's mechanics, alluded to Mr. Bronner's threat in announcing the tentative deal last night. "We believe the agreement affords US Airways the best opportunity to avoid liquidation and preserve our members' jobs," Mr. Ford said in a statement.
The Alabama pension system agreed in October to provide $500 million in financing in exchange for a 36 percent stake and voting control of the US Airways board. It has already given the airline $300 million, with the remaining $200 million to be provided after US Airways emerges from bankruptcy protection. Mr. Bronner could not be reached for comment last night.
This week, the pilots' union agreed to its share of the new round of concessions, worth about $99 million. On Wednesday, the airline reached a tentative agreement on new wage and benefit cuts with the Communications Workers of America, representing gate agents and customer service representatives, as well as the Transport Workers Union, representing flight controllers. Neither group has scheduled a vote on the proposals. 
Specific details on the contracts were not available, although the communications workers said they had won a seat on the airline's board after it emerges from bankruptcy protection. US Airways has promised 3 of 13 seats on the board to employee representatives. Mr. Bronner, however, will appoint seven members of the postbankruptcy board.
US Airways has won provisional approval from a federal loan-guarantee board for $900 million in financing, but that, like the remaining $200 million in the Alabama pension system's financing, cannot be drawn from until it emerges from bankruptcy protection.
Along with winning wage and benefit cuts, US Airways has begun cutting costs extensively throughout its operations. In the coming year, it plans to reduce spending on food and beverage service on its flights by 25 percent, according to a memorandum that was distributed to members of the airline's flight crews.
"What is crystal clear is that we are in a tough position with our goal of emerging from bankruptcy at the end of the first quarter," the memo said. "To assist in achieving this goal, cost savings measures have been announced. One of the most impacted areas is our on-board levels of service."
The memo said that US Airways passengers ranked in-flight food service as the fourth most important priority in choosing a carrier, behind personal attention, a frustration-free experience, and reliable flight schedules.
Specifically, the memo said US Airways would eliminate meal tray service on all transcontinental flights, and would serve only sandwiches aboard flights lasting more than 3 hours and 15 minutes, the memo said. 
International passengers will still receive hot meals. But by April, the airline plans to eliminate glassware on all its flights.
Among other amenities that have already been discontinued are printed menus for passengers on cross-country flights, along with souvenir pilots' wings for young passengers, the memo said. Mr. Castelveter said he was not familiar with the memo, but said the airline was focusing on reducing its costs wherever possible.
US Airways announced yesterday that it had asked the Transportation Department to allocate six slots at Reagan National Airport in Washington so that it could begin regional jet service from there to three new cities: Mobile, Ala.; Pensacola, Fla.; and Savannah, Ga.
One of Mr. Bronner's goals when he invested in US Airways last fall was to win new service to Alabama. Approval of the new routes would accomplish that; Mobile is about 160 miles from his office in Montgomery.

HEADLINE: Bargains Are Plentiful For Shoppers This Season 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
Even intrepid bargain hunters are shocked by the prices they are seeing in the stores this holiday season.
 Last year, Old Navy sold ribbed cotton turtleneck sweaters for $30; this year, a comparable sweater is $24.50. Women's wool dress pants at Banana Republic dropped to $98 from $116 for a similar pair last year. DVD players are selling for an average price of $130.53, down about $50 from last year. Sears is offering Panasonic digital cameras for $400, more than $100 less than last year. 
 Even as consumers are getting hefty discounts, the stores have been cutting deals of their own. Retailers have been squeezing suppliers even harder this year: agencies that buy apparel for retailers estimate that factories have cut prices 10 to 20 percent, particularly on popular items like sweaters and cotton pants. 
As a result, some retailers are able to offer big markdowns while still preserving their profit margins. And consumers are reaping the benefits.
"It is going to be a promotional Christmas," said Dorothy S. Lakner, a retail analyst at CIBC World Markets. "The big difference between this year and last is that some of the promotions have been planned, which should be a better profit for the retailer."
Factory prices in apparel and electronics have been declining for at least a decade, pushed down by cheap overseas labor, competition from new suppliers in Asia and Africa and pressure from American companies like Wal-Mart Stores that have made low prices their mantra. 
But the decline in the factory price of goods is particularly acute this year partly because of the terrorist attacks last year, according to manufacturers and retail analysts. After the attacks, orders were drastically cut, leaving many suppliers with full warehouses and idle equipment. When retailers starting make orders for this year's holiday, manufacturers had little choice but to agree to further price cuts. 
Considering that retailers typically strive for markups of at least 50 percent on apparel and 15 to 20 percent for electronics, those price cuts mean more leeway for retailers. 
"This has provided some margin cushion to the retailer in these difficult times," said Richard E. Jaffe, a retail analyst at UBS Warburg. "Retailers were quick to mark down but had the cushion to be able to take the first markdown without getting hurt."
For example, hooded fur-trimmed coats by Sean John cost $265, about the same as last year. But according to Wongo Enterprises, a Hong Kong-based agency that deals in outerwear, the factory price of the coats, which are also made for DKNY -- a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton -- dropped to $56 from $65 last year. 
Samson Cheng, the general manager at Wongo, said the drop in price of the down jackets mostly resulted from bargain-hunting retailers.
"When we quote the price they usually say, 'Oh, your price is very high,' " Mr. Cheng said. "In order to survive, you've got to lower the price."
Jonathan Mayer, the vice president for corporate communications at Perry Ellis International, said that last year the company bought a suede fabric shirt from a Chinese factory for $8 and sold it under a private label at a specialty men's chain for $15. This year, Perry Ellis got an 8 percent discount from the manufacturer and sold the shirt for $13.75 in stores, keeping the company's profit margin intact. 
Retailers were also able to eke out further discounts on consumer electronics, where costs can fluctuate wildly from one year to the next. The average factory price of plasma televisions, for example, dropped to $5,556, a decline of 23 percent from last year, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. Camcorders dropped 5.4 percent, to about $400; MP3 players fell 32 percent, to $94. 
Retailers generally do not like to talk about their manufacturing contracts and several companies declined to speak specifically about pricing, citing policies against discussing proprietary information. Gap, which makes its clothing in 50 countries including China, did confirm that a pricing war of sorts was taking place.
"It always is a global competitive environment when you're negotiating prices with vendors," said Alan Marks, vice president for corporate communications for Gap, which owns Old Navy and Banana Republic.
Where the pricing squeeze is being most felt is in the factories themselves. Apparel manufacturers enjoyed some relief this year from cheaper raw materials. Cotton prices are at a 20- to 30-year low, according to Nancy Chen, a spokeswoman for Li & Fung Ltd., an apparel buying agency based in Hong Kong. 
But William Mak, the director of Greenway Garment Factory Ltd. in Hong Kong, which makes women's underwear and pajamas for Federated Department Stores and for the May Company, said that while lower prices allowed him to trim prices by 5 percent this year, he was still being pressured to cut them further. 
"Other factories, other countries are lowering their prices, so I can't keep my price," Mr. Mak said. "And buyers are screening you. They are facing a very tough business also." 
Some of the hardest hit apparel manufacturers are in Pakistan, where factories were shunned after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks over concerns about security. According to one T-shirt and sweatshirt manufacturer in Faisalabad, even aggressive discounts and low prices have not been enough to bring back business. 
"This year I have not been able to sell any goods to America at all," said the manufacturer, who did not want to be identified, but said he once had contracts with American Eagle, Polo and Kohl's department stores. "If I've not been able to do business with them, you can imagine the state of affairs with me." 
Even if the economy improves, manufacturers said they believed that pricing pressure would continue. They are also concerned about what will happen to their businesses in 2005, when the World Trade Organization is scheduled to eliminate quotas on textiles, a move likely to elevate the price war to new levels. 
George Fontini, a partner at Mudd Jeans, a marketer of denim pants to teenage girls, said that lower manufacturers' prices had helped retailers -- his company paid 5 percent less to his suppliers in China this year -- but that much of the difference was already being passed on to shoppers. 
"The consumer's done very well," he said. "Retailers are not getting windfall profits. We do fancier finishings, we put more embellishment on the garment, and we sell it cheaper than we did years ago."

Judge Rules Most Players In Enron Case May Be Sued
A federal judge in Houston ruled that virtually all of the banks, law firms and investment houses that played roles in the construction of Enron's off-the-books partnerships could be sued by investors seeking to regain billions of dollars they lost when the company collapsed.
 The decision only dismissed claims against two defendants -- Deutsche Bank and Kirkland & Ellis, the Chicago law firm -- while allowing the suit to proceed against almost a dozen other institutions and firms, including Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Vinson & Elkins. Page C3. 

No Deal Made on Low-Price Drugs
The World Trade Organization failed to break a yearlong deadlock over how to give countries access to life-saving medicine, but the United States pledged that until a deal is reached it would not take any country to court if it broke current trade rules and imported cut-rate medicine to the world's poor countries.

HEADLINE: Left Has Hard Time In Era of Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
In a 1976 symposium published in Commentary called "What is a Liberal -- Who's a Conservative?" the novelist Tom Wolfe offered an unorthodox explanation of those vexed political terms. He declared that they were more the result of instinct than reason and more a reflection of schoolyard wrangling than adult sophistication. Forget political philosophy. Political conflicts grow out of rivalries like those between jocks and freaks that once split the nation's high schools. "My Childhood Enemy!" Mr. Wolfe cries out in epic extravagance, "O My Faithful Schoolyard Phantoms!"
 But as Mr. Wolfe also knows, schoolyard enmities are hardly matters of innocent play. Caricature and mockery abound, but consequences are serious. Trent Lott's recent declarations, for example, did indeed have an adolescent aura, mixing exaggeration with elastic principles. His first comment portrayed a liberal caricature of the conservative: a racist wanting to turn back the clock. Then, in his apologies, he became a conservative's caricature of a liberal, guiltily and naively donning the mantle of virtue. But more was always at stake than posturing and declarations of allegiance. 
 In fact, conservative and liberal categories really do offer opposing views of the world, providing different explanations for events in history, different descriptions of human nature and different philosophies of political justice. These ideas have always changed with historical circumstances, but after 9/11, some of liberalism's perspectives have come under increasing scrutiny. 
In an article called "The Case for Liberalism" in the December issue of Harper's, for example, George S. McGovern tries to revive liberalism as a loyal opposition in the face of possible war. He says its definition as a political philosophy is "based on belief in progress, the essential goodness of man and the autonomy of the individual, and standing for the protection of political and civil liberties." In contrast, conservatism's function, Mr. McGovern argues, is "to cling tightly to the past"; it cannot be relied upon for "constructive new ideas" that might lead to a "more just and equitable society or a more peaceful and cooperative world." Conservatism's main contribution, he suggests, is just to keep a critical watch on liberalism, whose virtues should be transparent.
Mr. McGovern's version of conservatism is hardly recognizable as the conservatism of recent decades; his version of liberalism is also formulaic. But if liberalism is considered in its broadest sense, Mr. McGovern's sweeping assertions about its obviousness might be true. Much of political modernity, with its ideas of democratic rule, individualism and human rights, actually represents a triumph of classical liberalism. In fact, attitudes like Mr. Lott's aside, much contemporary conservatism honors similar ideas, making it less an opponent of liberalism than an alternative interpretation of the liberal world.
This is one reason that events since 9/11 have been so traumatic. While ethical and political acclaim for this larger sense of liberalism in the West is uncontested, it is barely present in Arab governments, virulently opposed by Islamic radicalism and rejected by many in the growing Muslim fundamentalist populations in European urban centers. Meanwhile the United States has been engaged in a new form of war, one goal of which is to transform preliberal societies into modern democracies while protecting against incursions at home. This requires an uncompromising scrutiny of liberalism's doctrines, ambitions and limitations.
Yet Mr. McGovern avoids the issue. He refers to terrorism as "one of the more vexing problems facing us" but argues that it does not justify an "obsession with external threats and internal security." Other liberals have been more attentive. Last spring in Dissent magazine, for example, Michael Walzer argued in an essay called "Can There Be a Decent Left?" that the overemphasis on civil liberties misses the real nature of the threat. Mr. Walzer more broadly accused the American left of having been "stupid, overwrought, grossly inaccurate" in its condemnations of the United States. Its rationalist and materialist analyses, he continued, have also led to an inability "to recognize or acknowledge the power of religion in the modern world." The left has thus become alienated from its own country, he said, and unrealistic in its expectations. Comparable arguments have been made by Todd Gitlin in Mother Jones and by Michael Kazin in the current Dissent.
Each of these writers says one strain of American liberalism has gone awry when its celebration of equality and its distrust of power are taken to extremes. Liberalism also presumes a society in which equality and liberty have been established and disruption controlled through the use of reason. So when force becomes necessary, it is a source of discomfort, because it implies the failure of reason and the curtailment of liberty. 
Recent events increased discomfort because in many ways, liberalism's international future is at stake. In the West liberal democracy became possible only after centuries of economic growth and philosophical debate. In his classic 1927 book, "The History of European Liberalism," the Italian scholar Guido de Ruggiero showed how principles of liberal government developed in England, France, Germany and Italy over three centuries. How, then, can preliberal or fundamentalist societies be quickly transformed into liberal democracies? And if they are not, how are their militant threats to liberalism to be addressed?
There are no simple answers to these questions, but they address issues at the heart of the liberal idea. Consider, for example, the philosopher John Rawls, who died last month. He struggled to define a philosophy that could take the messiness of the world into account while preserving an ideal of reasoned and just liberalism. In a 1993 essay, "The Law of Peoples," he tried to envision a reasonable international counterpart to his ideal of a just society made famous in his 1971 book, "A Theory of Justice."
But Rawls began that essay stipulating that he would consider only peaceful, nonexpansionist, legitimate governments who honored human rights.
The same limitation applies to Rawls's vision of "justice as fairness." He imagined that if a group of people were designing a just society without knowing what their place in that society would be, behind that "veil of ignorance" they would make sure that the society would be most fair to its least privileged members because that is who they might end up being. Inequalities in intelligence, character and wealth would still exist, but in Rawls's view "men agree to avail themselves of the accidents of nature and social circumstance only when doing so is for the common benefit."
But this noble ideal assumes that human decisions have a fundamentally rational foundation, that material goods are the main measure of privilege, that an interest in egalitarianism is paramount, and these hypotheses are surely not universally accepted.
Rawls's notion of fairness also assumes an almost static world that can be managed without worrying about the irrational and the unexpected. But it is in response to challenge and disruption that the system would be tested. In the face of internal challenge and external attack, Rawls's system might even display the kind of intolerance outlined by Mr. Walzer.
None of this means, of course, that the broad liberal ideas of the West are to be discarded; just the opposite. But the challenges being mounted also mean that the particular incarnations of liberalism will change under pressure; conservatism will also have a role, leading to other kinds of intellectual confrontations. Edmund Burke once wrote, "Politics ought to be adjusted, not to human reasonings, but to human nature, of which reason is but a part, and by no means the greatest part." That is something that really is learned in the schoolyard.

HEADLINE: A Nation That Exports Oil, Herring and Peace 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: OSLO 

 BODY:
With a population of about 4.5 million, a cruelly tenacious winter and an awful lot of herring, Norway will never stand out as an economic powerhouse, a vacation paradise or the culinary envy of the world.
 But its claim to global fame is an arguably rarer one. Now more than ever, Norway seems to be the international capital of peace. 
 The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded here since 1901, is only a glossy part of it. Just before former President Jimmy Carter swept into Oslo earlier this month to receive this year's medal, Norwegians brokered a once-unthinkable power-sharing agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil rebels, who had been at war for two decades. 
Just after Mr. Carter left, the Indonesian government and separatists from Aceh Province signed a peace treaty, the fruit of negotiations financed by the Norwegian government.
True enough, the 1993 Oslo accords between the Israelis and the Palestinians did not, ultimately, turn out well.
But the effort was valiant, and it touched off a frenzy of Norwegian peace-making, or at least peacetrying, that has put peace somewhere alongside oil and timber as one of this country's signature exports.
"If we can make a difference, we feel it is our obligation," said Foreign Minister Jan Petersen, perhaps understating the Norwegian knack for, and interest in, all matters peaceful. "We do what we can."
That turns out to be quite a bit, and it inevitably raises the question: what makes Norway such a welcome interloper and lulling force?
"We're small, we're way up here and we have no colonial past," said Vidar Helgesen, a deputy foreign minister with a leading role in the Sri Lanka talks.
Because Norway does not -- and, really, could not -- have grand designs on other countries, it does not engender suspicion, Mr. Helgesen and other diplomats here said.
In addition, Norway is not perceived to be doing the bidding of larger, more muscular and more meddlesome nations. While it belongs to NATO, it does not belong to the European Union. It has its alliances, but wears them lightly.
"We are not Americans and we are not Europeans," said Nils Morten Udgaard, who writes a column on foreign affairs for Aftenposten, one of Norway's largest newspapers. "We are just ourselves."
Norway has never really lorded it over other countries, so it does not carry its olive branch across reservoirs of bad blood.
Rather, the Norwegian government and Norwegian charities have financed so much humanitarian work in volatile countries that Norway is often a welcome guest in those places. 
Norway is rich -- its per-capita gross domestic product is among the highest in the world -- and relatively untroubled, so it has money and time to lavish on faraway missions with uncertain deadlines.
It is also remote, an incalculable benefit when negotiations actually end up here. Several diplomats said that the 1993 Oslo accords worked, at the time, because the participants were so far from the glare of television cameras and the second-guessing of political peers.
"It's easy to be discreet here," said Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo. "This is not, after all, the center of the world."
But it is certainly peaceful. Candles flicker in countless windows. Professional boxing is against the law. Drivers rarely honk, and are seldom given reason to.
"We're not known for being aggressive," said Henrietta Berggren, the manager of a trendy Oslo restaurant where, on a recent night, the conversation never rose above a tranquil hum. The background music -- the softer side of Alanis Morrisette, the moodier reaches of Moby -- was, in two honestly chosen syllables, peaceful.
Over the last decade, Norwegians have had a hand in peace talks between Communist rebels and the Philippine government; Croatia and Yugoslavia, and Colombia's government and the FARC rebel movement. Norwegians have ventured into Cyprus and Somalia and Sudan.
In 1996, they helped negotiate a cease-fire, signed in Oslo, between leftist guerrilla leaders and the Guatemalan government, ending an armed conflict that had claimed 100,000 lives over 35 years.
Norwegian diplomats say there is no one model that they follow, and that such flexibility is crucial.
Sometimes they ferry proposals between the two sides in a conflict. Sometimes they merely provide the meeting rooms. Sometimes they consult early, and closely, with the United Nations, and sometimes not.
Always, they say, the two sides must already be willing to talk, and often, a key to success or nearsuccess is Norway's willingness to let the process begin quietly or even secretly.
Mr. Helgesen said Norwegians had been working with Sri Lanka, at the invitation of its government, since 1998, which was about two years before the world got a whiff of it.
Much of what Norway did, he said, was simply remind the two sides of their interests, although Norway also helped draft a cease-fire agreement that the sides signed in February and the power-sharing plan that was announced in Oslo in December.
He said Norway was also careful not to hurry the talks.
"As long as the discussion lingers, we don't interfere," he said. "We're very patient."
Indeed, since most Norwegians endorse these efforts, no one government feels political pressure to get quick results, and that allows Norway to assume an informal, unthreatening posture, he and other diplomats said.
Norwegians say they have been propelled in their peace efforts by a heritage of Lutheran missionary work and socialist idealism.
But Norwegians also get something more than satisfaction out of their deeds.
"We gain some access," said Mr. Petersen, explaining that Norway's place at so many negotiating tables elevates its relevance and usefulness to larger countries with which it trades.
Norway recently got the ears of European countries to which it exports seafood, he said, because Norway had privileged insight into elections in Africa that those countries wanted to monitor.
"You can put it this way," Mr. Petersen said. "We talked about Zimbabwe and fish."
Norway also gains a source of pride and a mission and identity all its own.
After Jan Egeland helped forge the 1993 Olso accords, he wrote a book that compared Norway and the United States. Its title was "Impotent Superpower, Potent Small State."
Mr. Helgesen, in a speech in Jakarta earlier this year, noted that Norway "cannot be the fire brigade" for the world.
"But," he added, "we can be a kind of social worker."
The association with peace-making, Ms. Matlary said, "makes Norway interesting."
"Our reputation," she said, "is impeccable."

HEADLINE: Democrats Pondering Approach On Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Faced with the certainty that President Bush can get Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, Democratic lawmakers are still struggling with how to put their own stamp on the issue.
 The question for Democrats is no longer whether to support tax cuts, at least as part of a short-term economic stimulus package, but how deep the tax cuts should be and who should get them. 
 On Thursday, one senior Democrat, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, outlined a $160 billion stimulus package that included $75 billion in block grants to states, a one-time income tax break worth about $300 a worker and more money for highway construction.
"It's designed to provide stimulus and to be as immediately effective and responsible as possible," said Mr. Baucus, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. 
But the senator's announcement of a plan on his own startled some Democratic colleagues, a number of whom have quite different ideas of the best way to proceed.
Today several Democrats quietly questioned the large size of Senator Baucus's proposal for new grants to the states, as well as the absence of any conditions on how state governments would use the money.
Other Democrats like the idea of funneling money to states, many of which face huge budget shortfalls, but have other ideas about where to cut taxes. Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey, for instance, has proposed giving every worker a reprieve from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes on the first $10,000 in wages. 
As in the Senate, Democrats in the House have yet to agree on a plan, and officials predict they will not do so until sometime in January. 
About 170 House Democrats attended a two-day closed-door forum on economic issues this month. According to some present, there was almost unanimous agreement on a need to support some kind of short-term tax relief as well as other assistance for lower- and middle-income workers, including an extension of unemployment benefits.
"The key is to get money in people's pockets," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. "The direction we're going is a tax cut for the middle class, the people who will be spending money."
That appears to be in sharp contrast to proposals being drafted by the White House, which are likely to focus on accelerating rate reductions for people in upper income brackets and reducing taxes on corporate dividends, a step that would primarily benefit wealthy taxpayers.
As a practical matter, Republicans have sufficient control of the House to pass almost any tax package the president proposes. Senate Democrats have some ability to block legislation through filibustering, but even that ability is limited.
Where Democrats can make an impact is in scoring political points by accusing Republicans of catering to the rich and portraying themselves as promoters of tax relief for working families.
Mr. Bush is not expected to announce his tax plan until January, but administration officials have said it will almost certainly include speeding up tax cuts that were expected to take effect in 2004 and 2006, some kind of reduction in taxes on corporate dividends, added tax write-offs for business on new investment in equipment and more incentives for people to put money into their pension plans.
Most of those proposals would be of primary benefit to the wealthiest taxpayers. According to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, the top 5 percent of income earners would receive about 64 percent of tax reductions if cuts scheduled for 2004 were pushed ahead to next year. A similar pattern holds for the impact of cutting taxes on corporate dividends.
Democrats have seized on the idea of a stimulus package to argue for one-time tax breaks rather than permanent tax reductions, and for a mix of spending programs in addition to the tax cuts.
In the House, though, there is little incentive for compromise, if only because Republicans there need little help to pass legislation. The situation could be quite different in the Senate, where last year Mr. Baucus reached a deal with Republicans that helped the president get his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut enacted.
Some Democrats fear that Mr. Baucus will be too ready to compromise for their taste. On Thursday he said he was "open" to working with Republicans, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who will become chairman of the Finance Committee in January, said he looked forward to "working with Senator Baucus on a job-creating plan that will have bipartisan support."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ON IRAQ'S BORDER; 
U.S. Demands for Help Roil Turkey's Government

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
With the United States pressing Turkish leaders to cooperate in a possible invasion of Iraq, senior officials describe a government in turmoil as it struggles to decide.
 Officials of Turkey's recently elected government said in interviews this week that they had missed deadlines set for them by American officials eager for a Turkish commitment, and that they were weighing how far to go in helping the United States. 
 Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said the effects on his country of a possible war were almost entirely negative. He also said that Turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against cooperation with the United States. 
"There are many demands from the U.S. government," said Mr. Gul, who became prime minister last month. "Turkey is a democratic country. We have to convince our people, we have to convince our Parliament. Whether we fully cooperate or do nothing, we are going to suffer." 
He and other officials said what they feared most were the economic consequences of another war in the region. Turkey is suffering through its worst recession in 50 years, and officials say a new war could cripple any new chances for recovery. 
If Turkey did cooperate with the United States, officials added, they also fear that it would gain a reputation among Islamic nations as a kind of Muslim policeman for the West. They noted that their country's soldiers were already called upon to supervise security forces in Afghanistan, and that American planes had run hundreds of missions into Afghanistan from the Turkish air base in Incirlik. 
"We will be seen in the Muslim world as a country that is killing other Muslims," said one Turkish official. "This would be very difficult to accept."
Yet if the government chooses not to cooperate, it risks serious damage to its most important alliance, with the United States. Turkey, a secular Muslim democracy, is a longtime member of NATO. 
As Mr. Gul put it in the interview, "Everything is happening out of our control." 
A specific concern for him and others in any American-led assault is its size, which is likely to be large and ambitious. Local press reports indicate that American officials have asked Turkey for permission to bring as many 90,000 American troops through Turkey for an operation in northern Iraq, using several Turkish air bases and seaports.
Mr. Gul declined to discuss details of his talks with American officials, but he did not dispute the accuracy of the reports. "There is no smoke where there is no fire," he said. 
Western diplomats here said they could not confirm the Turkish reports, though American officials have indicated that an attack from the north would most likely involve tens of thousands of troops.
A senior Turkish official told The New York Times early this month that the Pentagon wanted the option to deploy "tens of thousands."
For all the angst, a senior official here said he expected the government to make a decision "in a matter of days." Western diplomats cite "positive signals" in recent days. 
"In a short period of time, we will let them know," Mr. Gul said. 
Yet some Turkish officials say they are still not sure that the Americans fully appreciate their dilemma. The Turkish economy has shrunk as much as 10 percent in the past year. A recent public opinion poll found that 83 percent of Turks oppose allowing the United States to use Turkish bases for an Iraqi operation. 
"The Americans are polite, but they are very insistent, they are very focused," said a Turkish official. "The Americans want us to make a decision immediately."
Turkey's Kurdish population also looms large in the equation here. Iraq, too, has large numbers of Kurds. 
It fears a reprise of what happened during the Persian Gulf war in the early 1990's, when a half million Iraqi Kurds arrived at Turkey's border seeking refuge from the Iraqi Army.
An overarching fear for Turkish officials is that an American war would break up Iraq and clear the way for an independent Kurdish state. That, they point out, could restart the Kurdish insurgency in their own country, which led to fighting that took many lives in the 1990's. 
The Americans have assured the Turks that they would block the creation of an independent Kurdish state from Iraq. But Mr. Gul indicated that he was concerned that the current American-backed Kurdish groups in northern Iraq were already acting as an independent state. 
"There is a de facto situation in Iraq now despite the official denials," Mr. Gul said. "This a reality we cannot deny." 
Another reality is that the looming decision on helping the United States is being seen as a test for the governing Justice and Development Party, whose leaders have flirted with Islamist politics in the past. 
Since taking power, new leaders, including Mr. Gul and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party leader, who may become the prime minister, have reaffirmed their ties to the United States and Europe and avoided any hint of bringing Islam into public life. 
But if they do decide to accommodate the United States, Turkish leaders have done little to prepare the public for a large role in an Iraq conflict, which could come early next year. There have been no parliamentary votes on the subject, and few speeches by Turkish leaders. 
"Everybody knows that 80 to 85 percent of the Turkish people would say no to war in Iraq," said Cuneyd Zapsu, a senior adviser to Mr. Erdogan. "As a democratic country, how can we say yes?" 
If Turkey joined in with the United States it would probably be asked to let American planes use its airspace to fly missions over Iraq, and to use its air bases as a staging area for American troops. And a senior Turkish official said the Americans had also requested that Turkish forces join the Americans in the attack. 
"They want our troops as well," the official said. 
Although Mr. Gul did not indicate what Turkey would decide, he seemed to be searching for some kind of compromise that might fall short of what the Americans want but which might be acceptable to Turkish public opinion. 
"We are a strategic ally of the United States," he said. "It is our right to exercise all the alternatives. We want to be honest about what we can do and what we cannot."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE: THE REACTION; 
Fear of Economic Fallout In Senator's Hometown

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The Northrop Grumman shipyard here is shut down for the holiday season, so Jeff Walters, 37, had time today to pick up a couple of shirts at the Bargain Annex in Pascagoula's faded downtown shopping plaza -- and to chew over the news that Trent Lott had resigned as Republican leader of the Senate.
 "It's going to hurt the shipyard," said Mr. Walters, who on workdays spends his hours banging sheet metal into shape in the bowels of what will eventually become a destroyer. "It's going to hurt bad." 
 Like many of the thousands of people who work in the defense industry here, Mr. Walters, of Big Point, praises Senator Lott for bringing home the federal contracts that have kept the Mississippi Gulf Coast afloat for decades. In Pascagoula, a city of 26,000, Northrop Grumman Ship Systems employs 11,000 workers. 
Mr. Lott also helped land the $47.5 million high-rise bridge that will open across the Pascagoula River next year, cutting down on traffic backups for shrimpers and drivers alike.
Mr. Walters, like many Mississippians who have watched Mr. Lott's downfall in the last two weeks, called the whole thing unfair. "I don't think he needs to step down," Mr. Walters said. "I think he just made a mistake."
A few steps away, Vincent D. Jones, who builds the hulls of Navy ships, was Christmas shopping with his sons Vincent Jr., 14, and Eric, 16. Mr. Jones, who is black, rolled his eyes when he said that he works in a shipyard building named for the Confederate States of America. His view of Mr. Lott's decision to step down was more nuanced.
"What he said at the time was a wrong thing to say," Mr. Jones said of Mr. Lott's Dec. 5 remark that the nation would have been better served had Strom Thurmond won the presidency in 1948. Mr. Thurmond ran that year as a segregationist.
"We're not living back in 1948," Mr. Jones said. "He shouldn't have brought that up. He burned some bridges. But he's done a lot for this community. It's going to hurt the economy."
As Pascagoulans learned of Mr. Lott's decision to give up his leadership post, Mr. Lott avoided a crowd of reporters and photographers gathered outside his waterfront home.
At one point a local real-estate broker walked up and drove a homemade sign into the lawn with "We love you Sen. Lott" scrawled on it in black ink. Mr. Lott's wife, Tricia, came outside with a handwritten note signed by the senator, asking the news media to "please go home."
Elsewhere in Mississippi, Republican and Democratic officials alike seemed to take Mr. Lott's resignation in stride, balancing compassion for the senator with the hope that some gain could come from the episode.
"I know that Republicans around the state are hurt and angry about the way Senator Lott has been treated," said Jim Herring, the state Republican chairman. "I encouraged them to take out their frustrations next year at the ballot box by electing Republicans from top to bottom, from governor to coroner."
Phil Bryant, the Republican state auditor, said he was friends with Mr. Lott. "I am just incredibly sad about the whole ordeal," Mr. Bryant said. "Us politicians are human, also, and it's difficult to watch him go through this."
But he added: "Our party ebbs and flows. We'll get through this. We intend to use it as an opportunity to energize our efforts to reach out to the minority community."
Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, called Senator Lott's departure from his leadership post "unfortunate for Mississippi, just as his recent remarks were unfortunate for the state." He added, "His remarks are not a reflection of the Mississippi of 2002, and we hope they will not have a negative impact on our efforts to build a better quality of life in Mississippi."
Rickey Cole, chairman of the state Democratic Party, called on Mr. Lott to concentrate full-time on Mississippi's needs, to "develop a greater sensitivity on issues of race," and to take the lead to demand that Republicans "repudiate the Southern strategy of subtle appeals to and appeasement of racism."
But Freda McKissic Bush, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Jackson and a Republican political operative, called Mr. Lott's resignation a defeat for her party. "It saddens me to think that the Democrats will rattle their cage and we'll jump," she said. 
Dr. Bush, who is black, said that partisan politics, not race, were at the heart of the campaign to oust Mr. Lott. "It was a political agenda to undermine the strength of the Republican Party," she said. "They saw an opening and they took it. Unfortunately, the Republicans responded to it by removing Trent Lott. I shudder to think what the next thing will be."
At the Singing River Mall in Gautier, a few miles west of Pascagoula, Charles T. Hollis, 49, sounded a slightly more hopeful note. He was, after all, ringing a bell for the Salvation Army. "It may be for the best, the best for Mississippi," Mr. Hollis said of the senator's announcement. "It might heal old wounds. We need to get on to other problems like the economy."
He paused, stopped ringing his bell, and looked out at the setting sun. "It's one bad stink," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
After 3 Losing Days, Stocks End the Week With a Flurry

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, as investors shrugged off worries about a war with Iraq and drew some optimism from the latest assessment of the economy by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. The three main gauges posted a weekly gain and snapped a two-week losing streak. 
 Analysts said many investors were looking for bargains after three days of declines. News that brokerage firms had reached a settlement on conflict-of-interest charges and that the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, had resigned his leadership post added to the good mood. 
 "The fewer of those types of things people have to worry about, the more people can focus on the fact that the economic news is not all that bad and the prospects for the stock market in 2003 are pretty good," said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons. 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 146.52 points, or 1.8 percent, and closed at 8,511.32. In the previous three sessions, blue chips fell 262 points, to their lowest level in nearly six weeks. 
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.95 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,363.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 11.51 points, or 1.3 percent, to 895.76. 
For the week, the Dow rose 0.9 percent, while the Nasdaq edged up 0.05 percent and the S.& P. 500 gained 0.7 percent. 
Mr. Greenspan told the Economic Club of New York on Thursday that since the Fed's last rate cut on Nov. 6, there was some evidence that the "U.S. economy has been working its way through a soft patch." He added that the country faced no immediate threat of deflation. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy posted a solid growth rate of 4 percent in the third quarter, unchanged from the estimate made a month ago, even as worries persist about just how much the economy is weakening. 
And 10 of the country's largest brokerage firms, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, agreed to pay about $1.4 billion to resolve conflict-of-interest allegations in one of the largest settlements ever with securities regulators. 
That helped lift the financial sector stocks, with Citigroup rising $1.14, or 3.1 percent, to $38.14, and Morgan Stanley jumping $1.74, or 4.3 percent, to $42.04. 
Analysts say investors have been hesitant to commit to stocks in recent weeks, particularly amid escalating talks about a possible war with Iraq. On Thursday, the United States declared Iraq in "material breach" of a United Nations disarmament resolution. 
In addition, some investors are still looking to cash in some gains from the blue chips' eight-week surge in the autumn, and are uncertain whether Wall Street can stage its traditional holiday rally in the last two weeks of December. 
Nike climbed $3.57, or 8.6 percent, to $45.10, after it said net profit grew 18 percent in the second quarter on strong international sales. 
But Halliburton fell 42 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $19.08, after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission's inquiry into the company's accounting practices had become a formal investigation. 
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 100 10/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.96 percent from 3.94 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 107 7/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 4.89 percent.
The two-year note declined 2/32, to 100 16/32. Its yield rose to 1.74 percent from 1.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Medicare to Cut Payments To Doctors 4.4% Next Year 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The Bush administration announced today that Medicare payments to doctors would be cut 4.4 percent next year, after a 5.4 percent cut this year. Federal officials predicted that doctors would, as a result, be less willing to accept new Medicare patients.
 If the cuts are not reversed, Congress and the administration will face the wrath of two politically potent constituencies, elderly voters and doctors who care for the elderly. But administration officials are desperately trying to control federal health costs, which they see as a major factor that contributes to federal budget deficits. 
 Doctors, outraged at the cuts, faulted both Congress and the administration for failing to avert the cuts, which start on March 1.
Dr. Mark H. Krotowski, a family doctor in a working-class neighborhood of Brooklyn, said: "The new cuts will force more physicians to turn away Medicare patients. That's the reality. Doctors will not have any incentive to accept new Medicare patients. While Medicare reimbursements are going down, our expenses are rising 5 percent to 10 percent a year."
The Department of Health and Human Services said the cuts might "cause fewer physicians to accept new Medicare patients" and could prompt doctors to increase their charges to some of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries.
Dr. Jose V. Angel, president of the Iowa Medical Society, said, "Elderly and disabled patients will have to wait longer and travel farther to see doctors."
Doctors said the existing payment rates were already too low to cover the costs of caring for the elderly. 
"Physicians cannot afford to treat Medicare patients" under the new rates, said Dr. James C. Martin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he was making the cuts reluctantly.
"The reduction in physician fee schedule rates results from a formula specified in the Medicare law, and we believe that formula is flawed and must be fixed," Mr. Scully said. "Although Congress considered several options for fixing the fee schedule formula for 2003, and the House actually passed a bill to address these issues, no final action was taken before Congress adjourned."
The administration announced the cuts in issuing the Medicare doctors' fee schedule for 2003. It specifies the amounts paid to doctors for more than 7,000 services and procedures from routine office visits to complex surgical procedures.
Next year, Medicare is widely expected to pay $45 billion to more than 750,000 doctors and other practitioners.
Mr. Scully said that if the formula accurately reflected doctors' costs, they would receive a 1.6 percent increase next year, rather than a 4.4 percent cut. Congress should "fix the formula," he said.
But that was not always the position of the administration. In his budget request in February, President Bush assumed that Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced next year and did not offer any proposal to stop the cuts.
Then in March, the administration told Congress that any infusion of new money into Medicare should be used for prescription drug benefits, "not for increasing payments to fee-for-service Medicare providers."
In the last few months, scores of lawmakers have called for an increase in Medicare payments to doctors. But some members of both parties insisted that if doctors received an increase, then Congress should also raise Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations, and such changes would have greatly increased the cost of any legislation.
John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, said the cuts in Medicare payments to doctors were "an unintended consequence" of the payment formula.
"Congress should correct it as soon as possible," Mr. Rother said. "We are getting complaints that it's becoming difficult for Medicare beneficiaries to find a doctor willing to accept them in some parts of the country. We don't want that problem to spread."
Under the formula for paying doctors, spending increases with Medicare enrollment and economic growth, among other factors. Doctors say they have been shortchanged for several years because the government underestimated economic growth in the late 1990's and the number of people who would be in the Medicare fee-for-service program.
While acknowledging the errors, administration officials said they did not have the legal authority to correct them.
Dr. Yank D. Coble Jr., president of the American Medical Association, said he hoped that patients would join doctors in lobbying Congress to "fix this Medicare debacle."
Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: "I am deeply troubled by these successive and significant cuts to physicians who serve Medicare beneficiaries. I remain committed to addressing this issue and reforming Medicare when Congress reconvenes."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
After All These Years, What Do You Say Now, Chevy Chase?

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Bellbottoms and disco dancing are still out, but one relic from the mid-1970's is decidedly back in: the Ford administration.
 President Bush continues to reach past more recent Republican administrations, including his father's, to tap the team of a leader sometimes called the accidental president. 
 That is helping Gerald R. Ford, once parodied as the Rodney Dangerfield of presidents, to enjoy a rehabilitation of sorts, bringing new respect for his leadership skills.
Only last week, Mr. Bush chose two men who cut their teeth in government under Mr. Ford: John W. Snow is the president's nominee for Treasury secretary, and William H. Donaldson for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
If confirmed, they will join a group thick with Ford proteges. Vice President Dick Cheney was Mr. Ford's chief of staff. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is reprising a role he had under Mr. Ford. Paul H. O'Neill, whom Mr. Snow would succeed at Treasury, was on the Ford budget team. And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, was chairman of Mr. Ford's Council of Economic Advisers.
The former president calls them "my boys," and beams with pride to see them running the show, associates say.
David Hume Kennerly, the official White House photographer during the Ford administration, said: "I feel like Rip Van Winkle. It's like I woke up 25 years later, and not only are my friends still in power, they're more powerful than ever."
Of course, some Bush appointees made their mark under Ronald Reagan (think Colin L. Powell) or George Bush pere (Andrew H. Card Jr.), and many of those from the Ford administration served in succeeding administrations as well. 
Still, "Bush's administration resembles the Gerald Ford cabinet more than it does his own father's," notes Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans.
While many Americans associate Mr. Ford with the pardon of former President Richard M. Nixon, the retreat from Vietnam and the lapel buttons exhorting the nation to "whip inflation now," some students of government say he deserves greater recognition for having assembled a team of decent, pragmatic and capable leaders who were untainted by scandal or self-promotion.
"It was one of the classiest cabinets I can remember," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in government studies at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Ford surrounded himself with officials who had a strong sense of how to get things done, said James M. Cannon, a biographer of his.
"He had a remarkable array of managerial talent in his administration," Mr. Cannon said. "Literally scores came out of that administration and succeeded in business, an unusually high number."
One was Mr. Cheney, who became chief executive at the Halliburton Company. Early on in the Bush administration, the president made him top headhunter.
Mr. Cheney had built up an impressive Rolodex in the Ford White House, and quickly lured former colleagues back into government. He is the connective tissue in Ford redux.
The Fordites bring an ethos that seems to suit Mr. Bush. Loyalty is paramount. Leaks are abhorred. Grandstanders are unwelcome. Mr. Bush's administration, like Mr. Ford's, insists on team players.
It may seem odd that in putting together his team, Mr. Bush has largely overlooked the Reagan administration. After all, he shares Mr. Reagan's Western style, tax-cutting zeal and hail-fellow personality.
But some analysts say the Bush family -- and no one doubts that the first President Bush had a hand in personnel advice for the second -- has been very pointed in bypassing the Reagan loyalists. The Bushes are simply less ideological than Mr. Reagan's faithful, says Mr. Brinkley, of the Eisenhower Center.
"Centrist Republicans are never comfortable with right-wing conservatives," Mr. Brinkley said. "Gerald Ford doesn't like Ronald Reagan."
The Ford-inspired cabinet, by contrast, is filled with "people who are not ideologues," Mr. Brinkley said. "They're conservative, but they're flexible."
Mr. Ford, who turns 90 next summer, was not available for an interview, his spokeswoman said. He meets periodically with his former charges, who at an event last summer included Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Cheney and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
Mr. Kennerly, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, joked that his friends from the Ford years had returned in order to atone for past fashion crimes. Back then, Mr. Cheney wore plaid, Mr. Kennerly recalled, adding that "everybody just wanted to come back wearing better suits."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE CONSEQUENCES; 
A Nixon-Era Distraction Steps Out of Limelight

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Six weeks after a midterm election that returned Republicans to power in the Senate, consolidated President Bush's political influence and seemed to assure Trent Lott's future as majority leader, the furor over his words has hurt the Republican Party and the White House in ways that only time will measure definitively.
 On issues like judicial nominations, affirmative action, welfare reform, tax cuts and even the environment, many Republican leaders, conservative commentators, White House advisers and business groups had quietly agreed in recent days that the Lott imbroglio would complicate the Republican agenda in Congress and the country at large. 
 "Regardless of what one may think of the words he spoke or what one may think about race, an objective observer cannot argue that Trent Lott could do anything but distract from the opportunity that a new Republican majority in the Senate presents," an official of a major trade association said on Thursday. 
Today, some of those people were quick to pronounce Mr. Lott's retreat as the end of an unpleasant episode. 
"I think most Americans will conclude that Trent Lott did the decent thing, that the Republican leadership, including the president, chastised his statements, and that the party has shown its clear resolve to have zero-tolerance for insensitivity to these racial issues," the Florida Republican chairman, Al Cardenas, said. "And that the Republican Party is a mature and courageous party, moving forward."
Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said, "Lott is really virtually the last of the products of Richard Nixon's 'Southern strategy' to be in major positions of power in the Congress, and with his leaving, you will have cleared out people who, fairly or unfairly, have a somewhat compromised image to the country as a whole."
But the past may not be so easy to leave behind, given race's enduring hold over politics, from the Civil War and Reconstruction to the civil rights revolution and affirmative-action debates of today. For all Mr. Bush's desire to broaden the Republican appeal to black and Hispanic voters and for all his personal rejections of prejudice, he and his father before him have used the symbolism of the past to political advantage.
Indeed, no sooner had Mr. Lott stepped down, sped by Mr. Bush's stern condemnation, than the president's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, found himself faced with renewed questions from reporters about whether Mr. Bush regretted his visit in 2000 to Bob Jones University, which then banned interracial dating.
By midday, Democrats were circulating questions about the civil rights records of Mr. Lott's all-but-certain successor, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, and the new chairman of the party's Senate campaign committee, George F. Allen of Virginia, including Mr. Allen's acknowledgment that he once had the Confederate battle flag in his living room.
Mr. Lott's departure from the leadership will do nothing to increase the Republicans' narrow working control of the Senate, and Democrats predicted that their party would be emboldened to press issues of its own that might have otherwise languished, including expanding the earned-income tax credit for the working poor as part of any Republican drive for deeper tax cuts.
Some Democrats have even suggested the possibility of bringing up other issues previously thought to have little hope of passing, including an increase in the minimum wage, legislation banning racial profiling, increased financing to combat AIDS and the like.
But in other ways, having helped to oust Mr. Lott by his strong public comments and his aides' private lobbying, Mr. Bush will be riding higher than ever on Capitol Hill, with the help of a close friend and telegenic new Senate leader in Mr. Frist, a transplant surgeon who has a conservative record but also embodies the face of the New South as surely as Mr. Lott evoked the Mississippi ghosts of 40 years ago.
"It could be a hangover for them, or it could be cathartic," said Don Fowler, a former Democratic national chairman from South Carolina. "It is clear to anyone who has been involved in this process for as long as I have that underlying the Republican revolution of the last 30 or 40 years has been a deep-seated undercurrent of racism. And what Trent Lott has said and done just peels that right back and makes it clear to anybody who wants to look at it.
"What this has done is created an opportunity for Republicans to cleanse themselves by casting Senator Lott out of the temple, and that might serve to be therapeutic. I don't know." 
Mr. Fowler also said it was possible that Mr. Lott's serial apologies might "alienate some of their base" and drive some Republicans to vote Democratic because of economic interests.
Mr. Cardenas, the Florida Republican chairman, said he believed that "the burden shifts to the Democrats" to explain, justify and account for racially charged comments made over the years by party officials. Some Democrats cautioned quietly of the risks of overplaying their hand, lest they, too, be accused of playing the race card and fanning the controversy.
But at least one prominent Southern Democrat spoke out with unusual forcefulness. This week, before Mr. Lott stepped down, former President Bill Clinton told CNN that he was being scapegoated for saying out loud what Republican strategists have known privately for years.
"How do they think they got a majority in the South, anyway?" Mr. Clinton asked. "I think what they are really upset about is that he made public their strategy."
What upset some conservatives most was Mr. Lott's increasingly effusive apologies, including one on Black Entertainment Television this week.
"That tended to cast a racial shadow over many legitimate and widely held conservative views," said Douglas J. Besharov, a welfare policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. "They can be wrong. But they're widely held, and they're innocent of racial animus." 
Mr. Besharov said it was hard to predict the ultimate effects of Mr. Lott's case on public policy.
"There's been talk all around town," he said, "that the president wants to reform various social programs from the 60's, modernize them, not abandon them, but update them. This would cause me, if I were in the White House, to think twice about that."

HEADLINE: City Hall Memo; 
Bloomberg, With Year Inside, Shows What Outsiders Can Do

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The theory was as simple as it was improbable: Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire entrepreneur who squeaked into office with no government experience or clear base of political support, would succeed precisely because of those very liabilities.
 In an interview yesterday at City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg said the first year of his administration has "absolutely" been a success. Clearly, Mr. Bloomberg's outsider status has shaken up the way business is done in City Hall, emboldening him to mull and attempt things without many of the political motivations that have traditionally fueled the machine of government. 
 Impervious to the political pressures from the real estate and hotel industries, he imposed a rule forbidding New York drivers from making turns on certain Midtown streets, enraging many. Owing nothing to social policy advocates, Mr. Bloomberg put homeless families in a former jail and refused to move them, even in the face of a political storm. Now he is exploring turning cruise ships into shelters. 
He spoke openly about building incinerators in residential neighborhoods or shipping garbage to the Caribbean when contemplating his garbage policies last spring, ignoring seasoned government types who insisted neither plan would fly.
In seeking control of the public schools, this mayor's lack of political baggage or clear educational ideology paved the way toward gaining that control -- government, political and educational experts agreed -- giving him a prize that had eluded the three mayors before him.
"He is much more focused on whether or not something is a good idea," said Martha K. Hirst, the commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, who has served under three other mayors. "He doesn't have an initial political reaction to things, and what that means is that you get a chance to talk about ideas."
Mr. Bloomberg, 60, has impressed even his critics, who have noted the circumstances -- a political novice facing a yawning budget gap and the psychic lesions left by the 2001 terrorist attacks -- along with the accomplishments.
But Mr. Bloomberg's distance from New York's traditional political circles has led many City Council members, policy advocates, lobbyists, government officials and others to complain that this mayor is remote from, if not disdainful of, the larger workings of government and the city he oversees. Mr. Bloomberg, for example, dismissed the role of the City Council early on, a political miscalculation that almost cost him his antismoking legislation.
And while his enthusiasm for new ideas and his allergy to polls is refreshing to city commissioners, deputy mayors and his other fans, supporters of Bloomberg confess that he can also appear insensitive to the patchwork quilt of agendas in the city. Many close to him cringed when he warned last summer against turning ground zero into a cemetery -- and then would not back down.
And some critics say he is often impatient with those who do not cotton to his management style.
"People who spend a lot of time in the public sector can, over time, convince themselves that fundamental changes can't happen," said Bill de Blasio, a councilman from Brooklyn. "I think it is a virtue that he can look at things as a clean slate."
"At the same time not being beholden to any interests can have a downside too," Mr. De Blasio said, "because it can lead to less sensitivity to what New Yorkers are actually experiencing in their daily lives. For instance, if you are connected to the labor movement, you learn about the needs of working people. I imagine it has been years since he has had to grapple with what most of us grapple with, like how to reach the mortgage payment."
Indeed, though he takes the subway to work most days and keeps his security detail as far from him as possible, Mr. Bloomberg still has had little contact with average New Yorkers. He has gone to a total of two town hall meetings in city neighborhoods since he was elected (Rudolph W. Giuliani did them monthly), and takes few phone calls on his weekly radio show. He rarely spends weekends selling his fiscal and social policies in ethnic enclaves and working class neighborhoods.
How New Yorkers feel about all this is unclear. His poll numbers have dropped precipitously in the last month, but it is impossible to say whether his smoking ban, his tax increase or his now ubiquitous Boston twang account for that slide.
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg is impatient with those who criticize his style, which was honed in the private sector, and, he concedes, is quite different from other mayors. It relies heavily on keeping a small circle of those who are in the know and delegating many key functions of government. He allows his aides close and frequent access, and pushes ahead with ideas in the face of extreme political pressures.
"If there is anybody that can sit back and say 'Hey, stop all this. I do know what I'm doing in terms of managing,' " it is he, Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday. "It's pretty hard to argue that I don't. I mean, given what I've built," he said, referring to his financial information company, Bloomberg L.P. He admitted that he often ignores his aides' pleas to do a better job of promoting his accomplishments. "That's not my style," he said. "I think the facts in the end are what matters."
Mr. Bloomberg's wealth, which has freed him from the debts that campaign contributions beget, can also be a burden at a time of high unemployment and economic uncertainty, as the weekly rash of scathing letters to editorial pages denouncing the "rich mayor" has demonstrated.
One example that many political experts cited was the fancy mountain bike the mayor bought to prepare for a possible transit strike. "I really don't think he understood that buying a $600 bike -- for a lot of New Yorkers, that was a lot of money," said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. "It made him seem like he lives in a different world when they are thinking about whether they could afford to take a livery cab."
But it is also clear that Mr. Bloomberg's wealth and connections have played a role in helping the city through tough fiscal times. When it came time to pay for the commemoration ceremonies for Sept. 11, Mr. Bloomberg quickly reached out to wealthy friends to foot the $9 million bill. And when he needed to lean on state lawmakers to help New York with new taxes, he whisked them on his private plane to his home in Bermuda to play golf.
Striking the balance between the upsides and the pitfalls of Mr. Bloomberg's wealth and political insouciance will likely be a theme of the next three years of his mayoralty.
But contradictions define the mayor in other ways as well. He bought the apartment next door to his town house to accommodate his dining room table, which seats 20, but he serves meatloaf and potpies to the luminous guests who sit there. He held his tongue when the head of the transit union told him to shut up. He appears utterly unruffled to even those closest to him when discussing the city's $4 billion budget gap. But he is moved to scream at aides over something mundane like the food served during a ceremonial function or the wrong color of paint chosen for a public project, said those who have witnessed his fury.
Mr. Bloomberg set a new tone at City Hall even before his inauguration. He remodeled the former Board of Estimate chamber on the second floor of City Hall into an open, bullpen-style office similar to the one he had at his company, and situated his five deputy mayors and numerous key aides in the same room.
This change has profoundly altered the culture of City Hall, where the mayor's chief of staff or other aides traditionally serve as the gatekeepers to the mayor. In this setting, Mr. Bloomberg has constant contact with aides, and can see who else does, too. When commissioners come to City Hall to visit other officials, Mr. Bloomberg descends on them, providing unprecedented access, many said, but also immediate scrutiny.
Tongue-lashings are infrequent, but always in full view. "People only think of accessibility as a good thing," one official said. "But sometimes you need concentric circles around you."
But Mr. Bloomberg and his commissioners agree that he gives them latitude to do their work in ways not seen since the Koch administration.
This too, Mr. Bloomberg insists, is an outgrowth of the fact that he is politically unencumbered, and was thus able to pick the most qualified aides. "I don't think anybody has ever put together as good a team as we did," Mr. Bloomberg said, "and that was only possible because you didn't have the obligations you would have had had you been out raising money or come through an organization."
Mr. Bloomberg said members of his transition team who spent years in government continually wondered about his intentions. "I know he says independence, but who does he want, who does he owe?" they said.
"The transition team felt a lot freer to look for competency only," he said. Not everyone will last, Mr. Bloomberg added, and some could be moved to different posts as the mayor seeks to consolidate some agencies and make other changes next year.
"Upgrading your people, you should always be doing that," said Mr. Bloomberg, citing Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein's pledge to remove 50 poorly performing principals.
"Anyone who says you don't have a bottom 10 percent is just not realistic," he said. "That's the kind of process you always want to have on. You can do it humanely, you can do it nicely, but you always want to keep improving."
Mr. Bloomberg does have one major political debt -- he unexpectedly grabbed the mayoralty in large part thanks to the endorsement of Mr. Giuliani. That nod led many to cast their votes for Mr. Bloomberg, with the expectation that he would continue his predecessor's policies of keeping crime low.
In many ways, Mr. Bloomberg's need to tether himself to his predecessor's record -- even as he has quietly undone many of Mr. Giuliani's policies -- has contributed greatly to his successes. If Mr. Giuliani left the expectation that Mr. Bloomberg, who is liberal by his own definition and inexperienced in government, could not keep law and order in Gotham, those expectations have been settled for the time being.
Crime has not only remained low, but in fact has dropped to historic lows, as have fires, pedestrian deaths and the city's welfare rolls. The mayor's aides insist that once again Mr. Bloomberg's unusual management style has created the atmosphere for those accomplishments even at a time when the police force has shrunk and budgets are being slashed.
In part, officials say, this is because no one has the political chits to cash in and undermine senior officials. "He wants to be involved," said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, "but he lets the managers of the department manage. He just uses his favorite expression, 'Don't screw it up.' There is a sense of you've got the opportunity, you've got the support."
But Mr. Bloomberg's debts to Mr. Giuliani have hampered him as well. He is unable to blame his predecessor for the city's fiscal woes. He recently incurred the wrath of millions when he instituted the largest property tax increase in the city's history less than a year after he promised, to Mr. Giuliani's cheers, not to raise any taxes.
And Mr. Bloomberg's very private style means the former mayor still often overshadows him. On Thanksgiving, for instance, the mayor stopped by the breakfast for police and fire widows and orphans, but kept the event off his public schedule; the evening's news instead was peppered with images of Mr. Giuliani dishing out stuffing to the poor.
By gaining control of the schools -- which will take years to turn around, by his own admission -- getting sweeping antismoking legislation through the Council and balancing the city's budget at a time of great fiscal distress, Mr. Bloomberg has left many impressed with his first year. The mayor, who also dodged a transit strike and got New York through a minor snowstorm unscathed, agrees with them.
"The whole administration has done a good job," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday. "And that's why you see the breadth of support in this city that lets you continue to build for the future. Nobody screams at me when I walk down the street."
Well, one guy, this week, he conceded. But he was a smoker.

HEADLINE: The Gathering Storm Over Iraq 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Powell Says Iraq Raises Risk of War by Lying on Arms" (front page, Dec. 20): 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's statement accusing Iraq of hiding information about its unconventional weapons, and warning that Iraq is "well on its way to losing this last chance" to avoid war, failed to explain why the regime of Saddam Hussein poses a great enough threat to warrant our unleashing a vast military attack on that country. 
Mr. Hussein may be a liar and a villain, but the chief victims of such an attack would inevitably be the 22 million Iraqi people, who are still suffering from the effects of our bombing in the first Persian Gulf war: power blackouts, contaminated water, a shortage of medicine, a crippled economy and a greatly diminished educational system. 
Iraq may well be hiding dangerous weapons, but we have yet to hear why continued and stringent inspections are not the safest and least costly way to expose them and prevent their further development.

HEADLINE: Growth Set Strong Pace In 3rd Quarter; 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Strong consumer spending pushed United States expansion ahead briskly in the third quarter, the government said today, but a sharp slowing in the closing months of the year has fanned concerns about the steadiness of the recovery. 
 The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the gauge of total economic activity within the nation's borders, grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter. 
 That was the same pace of growth the department estimated a month ago and was triple the 1.3 percent pace of expansion of the second quarter. 
 The gross domestic product report showed business spending on plant and equipment dropped 0.8 percent in the third quarter, a bit steeper than the 0.7 percent decline expected earlier and the eighth consecutive quarterly decline in such spending. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Thursday night that the economy was working past "a soft spot." He singled out sagging business investment and uncertainty about possible war with Iraq as restraints on 2003 prospects. 
 "Any significant fall in the current geopolitical and other risks should noticeably improve capital outlays, the indispensable spur to a path of increased economic growth," he said.
The G.D.P. figures had little effect on financial markets because they were considered old news, but Mr. Greenspan's remarks were cited by stock traders as bolstering investors' hopes and stocks managed respectable gains by the end of the day.
The Commerce Department will not release its first estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product until Jan. 30, but consensus forecasts already project it at less than half the third-quarter pace before a gradual pickup begins in 2003. 
 William Poole, the Federal Reserve Bank president in St. Louis, said today that a run-up in oil prices was another factor to watch for its potential impact on 2003 economic performance.
 Crude oil futures prices in New York topped $30 a barrel briefly today. Political turmoil in Venezuela has disrupted markets and a conflict with Iraq would potentially do the same.
A report from the New York-based Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading indicators, which signals the economy's direction three to six months ahead, gained a strong 0.7 percent in November after edging up 0.1 percent in October.
That pointed to a healthier pace of recovery by about mid-2003.
Consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of national economic activity, increased in the third quarter of this year at a 4.2 percent annual rate. That was a touch stronger than the 4.1 percent rate estimated a month ago and more than twice the 1.8 percent pickup of the second quarter.
Auto sales were strong on the back of widespread zero-percent financing deals and other incentives offered by major manufacturers.
In a potentially optimistic sign, businesses added to their third-quarter inventories at an $18.8 billion annual rate. That exceeded the $15.5 billion estimate for inventory building that Commerce issued a month ago and implied that businesses were adding to their stocks in hope of a strong holiday shopping season.

 However often you tell yourself that the comic book is a legitimate art form, with its own language and style, its Chaucers and Shakespeares (although there are some high-culture snobs who would argue that even Stan Lee at his best fails to approach the heights that "King Lear" attains), its critics, its ability to get us to see the world in a new way, you may still feel an urge to explain yourself if you are caught reading one in public. (This is especially true if you find yourself reading a page that contains a misspelling. Comic-book artists seem to have a little trouble in that department.) This defensiveness is more likely to come upon you if you have reached a certain age; in the course of preparing for this review, I was tempted more than once to explain to taxi drivers and fellow bus passengers that I was being paid -- paid by The New York Times Book Review, no less -- to read these works, and that there were all sorts of proper books by proper writers waiting for me on my bedside table at home.
The truth, of course, is that many of these proper books will remain unread, or half-read anyway, whereas these comic books were devoured, quickly and with great pleasure: comic books are never dull, in the excruciating way that prose fiction can be, and it's as hard to imagine half-reading most graphic novels (Chris Ware's brilliant, dense, long and occasionally obscure "Jimmy Corrigan" is an exception) as it is to imagine half-reading a sonnet. Indeed, one of the problems with a book like Eric Drooker's startlingly beautiful "Blood Song" is that it is hard to know how to savor it. "Blood Song" -- subtitled "A Silent Ballad" -- contains not a word of prose, no description or dialogue of any kind, and most of its pages hold only one or two frames. Yet "Blood Song" has a strong and compelling narrative that works like a fancy water chute at a theme park: one has no sooner sat down to read Page 1 than one finds oneself, perhaps 20 minutes later, propelled straight through and out the other side, having barely absorbed the whole experience. Prose can be turgid and indigestible, as we all know, but "Blood Song" -- a mythopoeic account of a young woman's flight from a ruined Eden to the corrupt and terrifying urban world -- helps one to understand that writing's density can be purposeful: if one had read a book with the same theme, one would have days -- weeks, months -- to contemplate its complexities and nuances. I ended up feeling that I'd shortchanged Drooker's impassioned tale. You can try stopping to stare at the pictures, but their strength is their simplicity, so there really isn't an awful lot to grapple with; maybe we need lessons in how to read books like this. 
The more exposure to graphic novels one has, the more one realizes that the relative youth of the medium, at least in its current adult form, presents its artists with problems of appropriateness that the more established arts don't have. Whereas most established writers know what constitutes a novel, and filmmakers understand what will sustain a film, even the best comic-book artists sometimes seem unsure of their material and their intended audience. Jason Little's "Shutterbug Follies," for example, is essentially a sweet-natured adventure yarn, the sort of thing in which a dangerously curious young heroine gets in over her head and finds herself pursuing and being pursued by bad men with beards. (That's old-school bad men with beards, by the way, rather than the post-9/11 variety.) Those familiar with Herge's Tintin will recognize Little's Bee -- she even has the same red hair -- and Little is clearly an admirer of Herge's strong, crisp, bright graphic art. The temperament and style of "Shutterbug Follies" suggested that it might make a perfect -- and, let's face it, free -- Christmas present for my 12-year-old niece, but I'm not sure how her parents would feel about the references to masturbation or the mutilated and naked bodies. (Bee works in a photo lab, where she sees lots of things unsuitable for a young niece, and many of them are reproduced in the book.) The resulting tone is curious, like a Nancy Drew mystery adapted by Brian De Palma, and one suspects that Little may have alienated both of these potential audiences. He's a great illustrator, and he tells a convoluted story with economy and flair; he will, I'm sure, find his range eventually.
Adrian Tomine's "Summer Blonde" (which is beautifully published by the very smart Canadian company Drawn and Quarterly) aims for the readers of Daniel Clowes's "Ghost World," and will almost certainly hit them, too. Tomine's characters, like Clowes's, can be as sour and as sarcastic as real people, and consequently, reading a comic book suddenly becomes as rewarding as reading good contemporary fiction. "Summer Blonde" consists of four novellas, three of them populated by marginalized, lonely and sexually inept Gen Xers (the fourth features marginalized, lonely and sexually confused high school kids). Regrettably, it would appear that sometime during the next few years -- they are not quite miserable or alienated enough yet -- Tomine's characters might find themselves on the same party circuit as some of Todd Solondz's folks. Though these stories are cheerless, they are never less than smart; Tomine cites both the alternative comic "Love and Rockets" and Raymond Carver as inspirations (and each story ends with an elliptical resonance), which suggests he knows that comic books are like all art forms: just because you have the talent doesn't mean you have anything to say. Tomine has both talent and a writer's eye for the truth.
KIM DEITCH'S "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is an ambitious, surreal and occasionally baffling attempt to narrate the history of animation in the last century -- a companion piece to Michael Chabon's novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay," which fictionalized the golden age of the comic book, and Elizabeth McCracken's equally wonderful "Niagara Falls All Over Again," which trailed after a couple of vaudeville comedians as they crossed over to movies and then to television. Deitch is of a different generation from Tomine and Little; his drawings are comparable to R. Crumb's in their feverish, angry energy (Deitch almost certainly wakes up in the morning exhausted and with his head full of delirious images), and come as something of a shock after the clean lines of his younger colleagues. But his experience and sophistication allow him to do things that the youngsters are not yet capable of: "The Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is full of metaphor and imagery that shift meaning, flashbacks and flash-forwards and a bagful of tricks that give the book heft. What is particularly impressive is the way that Deitch juggles the personal -- his artist hero is plagued by a cartoon demon that simultaneously inspires and destroys him -- and the cultural dimensions of his narrative: his book is just as much about the neutering and Disneyfication of animation as it is about the self-destructiveness of genius.
Almost as impressive, not least because of the freshness of the subject matter and milieu, is Baru's "Road to America," which is set during the Algerian struggle for independence from France in the late 1950's. Baru's protagonist is a talented young boxer who becomes an unwitting political symbol for both sides. The colonial oppressors want him to demonstrate that their patronage can work, and his native countrymen and their resistance movement want him to demonstrate his loyalty to the cause by giving them hefty chunks of his purses. This is an exemplary graphic novel, informative and gripping, and Baru's muted colors and mournful caricatures are a welcome break from the American style. I shall give this to my 10-year-old nephew, thus discharging my avuncular pedagogical duties, and he will never open it.
"Nobody feels the need to provide deep critical insight to something written by hand," Lynda Barry writes at the end of her book "One Hundred Demons." "Mostly they keep it as short as a want ad. The worst I get is, 'Too many words. Not funny. Don't get the joke.' I can live with that." I am not sure that I am able to provide deep critical insight, but Barry deserves more than perfunctory attention, because "One Hundred Demons" is a terrific book (not, please note, "comic book" -- no qualification is necessary): brutally honest, thoughtful and soulful. Barry's work is clearly heavily autobiographical -- she refers to it as "autobifictionalography," although one gets the impression that the "fictional" part of that neologism refers to form rather than content. The 17 vignettes here are shaped like stories, but they have the unmistakable whiff of self-revelation and self-analysis about them. Barry is, underneath the wonky handwriting and the quirky, naive drawings, a great memoirist, and "One Hundred Demons" could happily sit on a shelf between Tobias Wolff's "This Boy's Life" and Dave Eggers's first book -- unless, of course, you arrange books alphabetically, in which case Barry belongs between Julian Barnes and Donald Barthelme, and that makes a kind of sense too. Like Wolff and Eggers, she finds a tone that accommodates self-criticism and self-irony without tipping over into self-loathing (although her self-portraits can be pretty fierce, and are invariably very pimply), but what she is particularly good at is resonance. These stories all contain little grenades of meaning that tend to explode just after you've read the last line. One can deduce that Barry had a tough childhood, but she prefers to concentrate on the details that connect rather than those that may exclude -- it's an innate talent, and one that separates the artists from the self-pitying bores.
In "One Hundred Demons," Barry chooses a disparate range of evils, annoyances and little disasters -- head lice, dancing, the 2000 election, dogs -- and finds a personal narrative that never quite goes where you might anticipate. "Magic," for example, refers to the Lovin' Spoonful hit "Do You Believe in Magic?" and deals with a friendship that ground to a halt when the author started junior high; in 9 pages and 18 frames Barry touches on her parents' separation, guilt, betrayal and the potency of cheap music. The words of the last frame, which uses a real photo of Barry and Ev, the lost friend in question, have all the rhythm and regret of a great Springsteen song. In "Lost and Found," Barry pokes fun at herself for being ignorant of "story structure" and "arc" and "plot points," but I think she's being disingenuous: she knows. 
In the end, asking whether graphic novels are a waste of time is exactly the same as asking whether all novels are a waste of time: the answer is that it rather depends on who's writing them. Barry seems to me almost single-handedly to justify the form; she's one of America's very best contemporary writers. If I give anyone a copy of "One Hundred Demons" for Christmas, it'll be one I pay for, because I'm keeping this one.

 DOWN BY THE RIVER
Drugs, Money, Murder, and Family.
By Charles Bowden.
433 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $27.
 THE river in "Down by the River" is the Rio Grande, a sewage-laden stream that, like the border itself, serves as much to join the two nations of Mexico and the United States as to divide them. In El Paso, where the river first becomes the international boundary, the pollution is so severe, so out of control, that it is essentially ignored. There is no mystery about the source: the waste comes almost entirely from the river's south side, from Ciudad Juarez, a typical Mexican border city that over the past decade has swollen with several million of the desperately poor, drawn north to answer some of the baser needs of the United States markets. 
Juarez is said to be a boomtown. But assembly-line jobs in the factories there currently pay about $4 a day, which is not nearly enough to live on in the new economy; the annual turnover of the workforce runs as high as 200 percent; huge shantytowns sprawl across the low hills of the desert; children live wildly in the streets, struggling to help their families survive; and malnutrition, disease and criminality are rampant. The plain truth is that for ordinary Mexicans, of whom 80 percent live in poverty, according the World Bank, the country's formalistic emergence into "democracy" and "free trade" has been a failure. The misery they suffer is not the fault of the United States -- or even necessarily of global capitalism. But it would be dishonest to pretend that El Paso residents, for instance, are just the hapless victims of a tough and dirty neighborhood -- or that the rest of us who live farther away have little to do with the varied forms of poison that flow in our direction through Mexico's ditches. 
Charles Bowden is a serious writer with a reputation for thoughtful narrative and a devoted following that on the basis of this book deserves to grow much larger. The subject he has chosen here is not transborder sewage or industrial waste, but a more insidious form of pollution -- the huge and illicit trade in narcotics that feeds in equal proportions on the hungers and expediencies of many Americans and the dishonesty and cynicism of successive Mexican governments. At the core is the story of an apparently simple street crime -- the shooting of an innocent man named Lionel Bruno Jordan, on the evening of Jan. 20, 1995, in the parking lot of an El Paso Kmart. At 27, Bruno Jordan was the youngest son of a large and respected El Paso family, an easy-going bachelor who sold suits at a Men's Wearhouse, planned to attend law school and had no connection to the drug trade. He was shot twice in the upper body, without warning, and as he staggered away, the pickup truck he had been driving was stolen. He was taken to the hospital, where he remained conscious. His family gathered. Typically, Bowden's description of what then took place seems perfectly matched to the event: 
"The bullet wounds in Bruno at first seem manageable. No major organs seem damaged, the vital signs are good. But the initial diagnosis is deceptive. The two rounds entered the body and then wandered at high velocity, shredding him inside. The 9 millimeter is a favored round in the drug business. The cartridges are small, so a clip in even a pistol can hold a dozen or more. The high velocity means a small bullet can wreak enormous havoc. As the staff fusses over Bruno Jordan, he is slowly bleeding to death. He dies in surgery at 9:45 p.m."
That's it -- one quick paragraph in the present tense, without elaboration, as sudden and irreversible as death itself. By then the shooter had been arrested. He was one of the street kids from across the river, a boy who had just turned 13. He was typically tough. He confessed to the killing, but refused to elaborate, was convicted and went off without a whimper to serve time. The American justice system treated the affair as a carjacking case, unusual and tragic, but the consequence of the neighborhood, an essentially simple crime.
And so it would seem to have been, except for one peculiar coincidence: the dead man's oldest brother happened to be Phillip (born Felipe) Jordan, a high-ranking official of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, who had spent decades busting drug traffickers along the border, and had recently come home to head the D.E.A.'s secretive El Paso Intelligence Center -- known as EPIC -- a high-security facility that serves as the government's central brain in its war on drugs.
Phil Jordan had plenty of sworn enemies just across the Rio Grande, most notably an elusive man named Amado Carrillo, head of the hugely powerful Juarez cartel, which is said to employ tens of thousands of people, and is suspected of reaching into the highest levels of the Mexican government. Carrillo serves as the evil genius of this story, a stand-in for the entire Mexican drug trade, and in that sense the oddly necessary companion of Phil Jordan, the D.E.A. and the United States itself. Was it possible that Carrillo or someone like him had murdered the innocent Bruno as a carefully tailored message, meant not merely to punish Phil Jordan and tear his family apart but to taunt him privately and mock his inability to respond? Jordan clearly suspected so, and he set out at all costs to uncover the truth. Bowden takes it from there.
His devotion to the subject is evident on every page. He took significant risks, immersing himself for seven years in a shadow world of outlaws, betrayal and violent death -- to the extent that at one point, apparently, a price was put on his head by Mexican drug traffickers. In the introduction, Bowden, who writes frequently about dreams here, calls that shadow world a "nightmare" and this book its "archaeology." The result is certainly much more than a crime story: it is a mature, deeply felt exploration of the hidden connections binding two very different parts of North America, as well as of the ties that bind a family. The narrative is masterly. It moves out from Bruno's murder in successive waves, surging, receding, sometimes swirling back in time, but generally flowing forward. One gets the sense of Bowden as a fiercely independent writer, saying exactly what he believes and ignoring the conventional classifications of the nonfiction trade.
Is "Down by the River" an expose, a history, a biography, a memoir, an adventure story, a philosophical musing? It is all of those things, reportage on the highest level, and it moves between the categories without hesitation or apology. It is a sort of poetry, too. When Bowden lets loose, he writes as if in a fever. This, for instance, is a single sentence about the uncontrollable memories of another Jordan brother, a professional singer named Tony, who in his Mexican wanderings had become aware of the savageries of the shadow world:
"Everyone has seen such storms, veritable warlocks that threaten our immortal souls, that rip down the walls of the flimsy homes and slobber against the panes of glass, gales that threaten all the dreams of safe homes and pleasant gardens, patios filled with partygoers, a band striking up and then the show tunes that bring such a cargo of fine memories and nights of love, a storm that takes everything before it, that snuffs out the barbecue, blows the band off its stand, kills the sound system, uproots the big tree that gives such generous shade, a storm that erases a world once seen as sure and solid, and at that moment everyone is left with just the hope implied by the white light cascading down from the circular fluorescent bulb, a light like the one light splashing down in the kitchen of the Jordan family home on Frutas Street, like the one in Tony's mind flowing across the reassuring old wooden table where the man lies strapped and looks upward, his eyes burning as they stare, reach past the glare of the light into the blackness waiting in the place called forever."
Who else writes like that? Is the process instinctive or calculated? Whatever his method, the images and rhythms are beautifully chosen. Indeed, how better could anyone convey the textures of the shadow world? Bowden calls himself a reporter, and in a pure sense of the word he really is one. He is also an authentic talent. Even at his most stylistically extreme, he does not seem strained or self-indulgent. If his writing in "Down by the River" is sometimes elliptical, the story he is getting at is elliptical too. From the start it is clear that his protagonist, Phil Jordan, is essentially just trying to "fix" the wrong that was done to his family. But how do you "fix" a murder? In no sense does it detract from the ending of the book, or the tension that runs throughout it, to reveal that almost nothing here will submit to solution.

 BODY:
 UNIFORMS
Why We Are What We Wear.
By Paul Fussell.
204 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $22.
 THIS is not a book about uniforms, it's the notes for a book about uniforms -- the contents of a file folder of clippings and jotted thoughts on the subject. Paul Fussell may have been keeping the file for some time, to judge by statements like "The practice of not wearing a bra is spreading." Given Eddie Izzard, RuPaul and Harvey Fierstein in "Hairspray," that should be "The practice of not wearing a bra is spreading -- among women." But I don't blame Fussell for giving uniforms what might be called cavalier treatment.
Uniforms belong to the category of interesting things that become less interesting the more somebody goes on about them. Other people's children are another example, although men and women dressed as children don't rescue us from burning buildings. But an obsession with the uniform itself is boring. Or worse, as Fussell points out in his chapter on Civil War buffs and their ilk "wearing authentic uniforms . . . to re-enact the bloodiest of infantry slaughters." Fussell gives the re-enactors the parade ground inspection they deserve: "Some onlookers may prefer the term 'weirdos.' Others, peering more deeply into psychiatric causes, may go further and call these folks 'sickos.' " 
A main point in this ditty bag of off-duty observations and apercus is that uniforms are not costumes. We don't call the Rockettes when our car is stolen. Fussell says, "Uniforms ask to be taken seriously, with suggestions of probity and virtue . . . expertise . . . trustworthiness . . . courage . . . obedience." 
Fussell, however, defines uniforms broadly. He discourses upon the tweed jackets of the professoriate, Roman Catholic vestments, pants and shirts worn by employees of the United States Postal Service, bluejeans, Klan robes and the Gilbert and Sullivan get-ups of the White House police during the Nixon administration. These uniforms may ask to be taken seriously, but with suggestions of grade inflation, sexual abuse, going postal, feckless youth, bigoted cowardice and Richard Nixon. 
Fussell, whose earlier books include "The Great War and Modern Memory" and "Class," says he previously assumed that people who donned livery for low-paying jobs felt resentment toward their uniforms. He claims to have looked into the matter and found "all but universal pride in a uniform of any kind, comparable with that felt by an enlisted marine." Hard to picture the fry crew from my local Burger King on the front line in Iraq, glad as the marines would be to have the Whoppers.
Still, it's worth the raggle-taggle of topics and less than spit-and-polish analysis in "Uniforms" to get a chapter titled "Ernest Hemingway, Semi-Weirdo." Fussell describes Hemingway's "sorry career of personal military imagining." 
Papa told fibs about being a non-noncombatant in World Wars I and II. Fussell speculates that such is the ability of the uniform "to signify a desirable kind of manliness" that Hemingway wasn't satisfied with mere display of courage in mufti, although that courage, Fussell says, "was never in doubt." And indeed Ernest went bravely into the bush, several times, to finish off badly wounded novels.
Fussell is himself a combat veteran but doesn't credit war as the source of his "thing about uniforms." He writes that "fantasy suffered a cruel deflation . . . when I had to trade my pseudo-officer's gauds for a real private's baggy fatigues." What inspires him are memories of his childhood sailor suit and Boy Scout regalia. Fussell turned up at his first Scout meeting in full fig right down to the official oxfords -- and got laughed at. "The rest of the troop appeared in bluejeans or corduroys, with perhaps a neckerchief fastened by a rubber band." It's an irony Fussell does not explore. Everyone wants to exhibit probity, virtue, expertise, trustworthiness, courage and even -- if video surveillance cameras are around -- obedience. But to wear all this, as it were, on your sleeve is a burden. The more so when the probity, virtue, expertise and so forth have to do mostly with tying clove hitches, and the other kids are making fun of your shoes.
Neither does Fussell really examine the use of uniforms to clothe bad behavior with respectability. We get dressed up to show our good intentions when we go to church or get married. But the more cunning among us put on the dog to do wrong. This has been a particular problem with the uniforms of the past hundred years. (Castro is still wearing one from the last century.) Nazi uniforms were as exaggerated and elaborate as a school marching band's. That fooled a lot of people until France got stuffed into the tuba.
Fussell does devote a chapter to World War II German uniforms but mostly in view of how they inflated Nazi egos. He makes the same point (about nicer egos)
in his chapter on those marching bands. Fussell's obsession with uniforms has to do with spiffiness or, in the case of baggy fatigues or bedsheets with eyeholes cut out, lack thereof. 
This is an engrossing enough engrossment, at least for male readers. Although women wear them, uniforms are attired in masculinity, so to speak. Men, left unsupervised to shop at the mall, dress with uniformity. Fussell's book shows how that is the opposite of us not caring about our clothes. We are better than the peahens at being peacocks. Note the dreary lack of individuality among fashion models as they march down runways clad in wildly diverse duds. Meanwhile, each headwaiter, in a tuxedo the same as all other tuxedos, is so much of an individual that we have to slip him a twenty for it. We men also know how to display our bodies, which is to say we don't do it. The older we get the more clothes we wear until finally we appear in public in astrakhans and hats, gloves, mufflers and (identical) galoshes, while women of a similar age are going around in nothing much by Versace. 
It can be hard to tell whether a woman has been dressed by Isaac Mizrahi or has pulled down the living room drapes. But the extreme similarity of men's dress causes the eye to be immediately drawn to distinctive details: the Lobb shoe on the foot, the Bulgari cuff link on the wrist, the Laura Ashley lampshade on the head that tell us a man's precise social position (and when he should stop drinking and go home).
Fussell thinks there is a tension between man's ancient love of uniforms and modern man's adoration of individualism. "Everyone must wear a uniform, but everyone must deny wearing one, lest one's invaluable personality and unique identity be compromised." Bare nonsense. A uniform invests my invaluable personality with the power of a respected and disciplined group. Just try squirting a hose on your next-door neighbor's stinky barbecue grill if you aren't wearing a fireman's uniform. And then, far from being compromised, my unique identity gets to disappear in a cloak of probity, virtue, expertise and trustworthiness while my next-door neighbor wonders how come there isn't a big red truck in front of his house. This is why all men wear the same plaid shirts and khaki Dockers when they go to Home Depot with the family on Saturday mornings.
Wife: "You could see the kids were acting up. Why didn't you come help?"
Husband: "That wasn't me. I was over in the paint department."

HEADLINE: Football Is A Sucker's Game 

BYLINE:  By Michael Sokolove; Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine. He last wrote about Tiger Woods.

 BODY:
The University of South Florida sprawls over nearly 1,500 acres in a once sparsely populated section of Tampa, close to where the city bleeds into unincorporated Hillsborough County. The campus is pancake flat and in desperate need of more trees and shade. Grass comes up in stubborn clumps through sandy soil. I can't say that I was shocked when I learned of a previous use of this parcel of land: a practice bombing range. 
 In many other ways, though, the University of South Florida is attractive -- and useful. It has produced about 170,000 graduates in its four-decade history. It has a medical school and some well-regarded academic programs. Current enrollment stands at 39,000, and students tend to be grounded and hard-working rather than rich and entitled. (A professor told me that one challenge of his job is teaching morning classes to students who may have worked the late shift at Chili's.) What U.S.F. does not have is any kind of national profile. It has no standing. No buzz. The latest edition of the Princeton Review's "Best 345 Colleges" does not rank it low on the list -- it leaves it off entirely. 
 University officials want U.S.F. in the guidebooks. They want fewer commuters, more out-of-state students, more residence halls and more of a "traditional" campus feel, by which they mean a campus with a soul and some spirit. It is a big job, and the burden for getting it done has fallen, largely, to Jim Leavitt. 
"Sit down," he says as I enter his office one morning this fall. It's clear to me that I'm not only supposed to sit, but to do so in silence. His office is a mess. Clothes are strewn everywhere. About 50 videotapes are scattered on the floor by his desk. Leavitt himself doesn't look so great, either. His brown hair is a tousled mop, a modified crewcut gone to seed. He gives the impression of being simultaneously weary and wired. 
Leavitt continues at what he was doing before I arrived, drawing with a red pen on an unlined sheet of paper. At one point he reaches behind him on the floor for his Pepsi, which he drinks by the two-liter bottle. When he finally speaks again, his voice leaks out in the weak rasp of someone who does more yelling than sleeping. "I'm sorry," he says, "but I was in here late last night and I never even got to this. To be honest with you, there aren't enough hours in the day. But I've really got to get through it. It's important."
After several more minutes, when he is finally done, I walk around behind Leavitt to inspect his handiwork. On the white paper are a series of squiggles and arrows, 11 on each side of the page.
"What is it?" I inquire.
"A punt return," he says.
Football is the S.U.V. of the college campus: aggressively big, resource-guzzling, lots and lots of fun and potentially destructive of everything around it. Big-time teams award 85 scholarships and, with walk-ons, field rosters of 100 or more players. (National Football League teams make do with half that.) At the highest level, universities wage what has been called an "athletic arms race" to see who can build the most lavish facilities to attract the highest-quality players. Dollars are directed from general funds and wrestled from donors, and what does not go into cherry-wood lockers, plush carpets and million-dollar weight rooms ends up in the pockets of coaches, the most exalted of whom now make upward of $2 million a year.
The current college sports landscape is meaner than ever, more overtly commercial, more winner-take-all. And just as in the rest of the economy, the gap between rich and poor is widening. College sports now consists of a class of super-behemoths -- perhaps a dozen or so athletic departments with budgets of $40 million and up -- and a much larger group of schools that face the choice of spending themselves into oblivion or being embarrassed on the field. (Which may happen in any case.) It is common for lesser college football teams to play at places like Tennessee or Michigan, where average attendance exceeds 100,000, in return for "guarantees" from the host school of as much as $500,000. They are paid, in other words, to take a beating.
Any thought of becoming one of the giants and sharing in the real money is in most cases a fantasy. Universities new to Division I-A football (in addition to U.S.F., the University of Connecticut and the University of Buffalo have just stepped up to the big time) know that the first level of competition is financial. It is a dangerous game. "The mantra of the need to 'spend money to make money' can be used to justify a great deal of spending, without leading an institution to any destination other than a deeper financial hole," write James Shulman and William Bowen in "The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values," their 2001 examination of the finances of college athletics.
The current college bowl season began last week and ends Jan. 3 with the national championship game, the Fiesta Bowl. This year, the cartel of teams belonging to the Bowl Championship Series -- members of the six most prominent conferences plus independent Notre Dame, a total of 63 teams -- will split a guaranteed payoff of at least $120 million from the Fiesta, Orange, Sugar and Rose Bowls. Teams outside the B.C.S. are eligible to play in such low-wattage affairs as the Humanitarian Bowl, the Motor City Bowl and the Continental Tire Bowl. For the privilege, they will almost certainly lose money, because the bowl payouts will not even cover travel and other expenses. 
"We are receiving letters and calls from conferences that want in," Mike Tranghese, coordinator of the five-year-old B.C.S., told me. "And we have formed a presidential oversight panel to form an answer." But letting more members in would mean splitting up the money more ways. I asked Tranghese if I was missing something in assuming the B.C.S. had no incentive to cut more schools in. "If you were missing something, I would let you know," he said. "The B.C.S. consists of the major teams as determined by the marketplace. Any other system is socialism. And if we're going to have socialism, then why don't we share our endowments?"
One reason B.C.S. members do not want to share is that college sports have become so immensely expensive that even some of the biggest of the big lose money. The University of Michigan, which averages more than 110,000 fans for home football games, lost an estimated $7 million on athletics over the course of two seasons, between 1998 and 2000. Ohio State had athletic revenues of $73 million in 1999-2000 and "barely managed to break even," according to the book "Unpaid Professionals: Commercialism and Conflict in Big-Time College Sports," by Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor. A state audit revealed that the University of Wisconsin lost $286,700 on its Rose Bowl appearance in 1998 because it took a small army, a traveling party of 832, to Pasadena.
The endemic criminal and ethical scandals of college sports are connected by a straight line to the money. Teams that do not win do not excite their boosters, fill up stadiums, appear on national TV or get into postseason play, thereby endangering the revenue stream that supports the immense infrastructure. It is the desperation for cash, every bit as much as the pursuit of victory, that causes university athletic departments to overlook all kinds of rule-breaking until it splatters out into the open. 
One day this fall I opened my morning sports page and, in glancing at the college football briefs, took note that it was a particularly bad day for the Big Ten. The headlines were: "Spartan Tailback Dismissed"; "Iowa Player Arrested"; "Wisconsin Back Stabbed." The Michigan State Spartans dismissed two co-captains within 10 days: the starting quarterback, who checked into rehab for a substance-abuse problem, as well as the tailback, who was accused of drunken driving and eluding arrest by dragging a police officer with his car. The next day, the head coach, Bobby Williams, with his team's record at 3-6, was fired -- and sent off with a $550,000 buyout. 
At tiny Gardner-Webb University in Boiling Springs, N.C. -- a Baptist institution in its first season of Division I basketball -- the university president resigned in the fall after acknowledging that he ordered a change in the calculation of a star basketball player's grade-point average. At Florida State University, quarterback Adrian McPherson was suspended days before his arrest for supposedly stealing a blank check, then expressed shock at the discipline meted out by the normally lenient head coach, Bobby Bowden. (When a star player was accused of theft a few years back, Bowden said, "I'm praying for a misdemeanor.") The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which started football just over a decade ago, is playing this season under a cloud. The trustees of the Alabama higher-education system have given the university two years to reverse a $7.6 million budget deficit or face being shut down. In addition, pending civil suits charge that a 15-year-old girl who enrolled at U.A.B. was sexually assaulted, repeatedly, by a large number of football and basketball players, as well as by the person who performed as the school's mascot, a dragon. 
The list goes on. Ohio State's thrilling 14-9 victory over Michigan on Nov. 23 occasioned a full-scale riot by inebriated Buckeye fans who burned cars, looted businesses and caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage before 250 police officers finally restored order at 5 a.m. These sorts of things have become the background music of college sports. 
Being a striving team trying to keep up in a big-time conference can be a particular kind of debacle. Rutgers University, in this regard, is Exhibit A. It belongs to the Big East, a B.C.S. football conference that also boasts powerful basketball programs. Rutgers can't compete in either sport. Its cellar-dwelling teams draw poor crowds, and the athletic department ran a deficit of about $13 million last year.
A dissident group, the Rutgers 1,000, has waged a passionate campaign to get Rutgers to leave the Big East and to de-emphasize athletics. This has led, indirectly, to yet an entirely new way of throwing money away on sports. The administration tried to block publication of a Rutgers 1,000 advertisement in an alumni magazine. Not only did Rutgers lose the ensuing court battle, but it also spent $375,000 fighting it, including court-ordered reimbursement of legal fees to the A.C.L.U., which took up the case of the Rutgers 1,000 as a free-speech issue.
"Schools get on a treadmill, and there's no getting off," says James Shulman, an author of "The Game of Life." "They have to stay on; they have too much invested." The former Princeton basketball coach Pete Carill once said of the big-time programs: "If you want to get into the rat race, you've got to be a rat."
Another way to look at big-time college sports is as a sucker's game, one with many more losers than winners. Notre Dame, a great football team before it was a great university, is the prototype for all schools hoping to hitch a ride on the back of a popular sports team. Duke certainly has become more celebrated and academically selective in the years its basketball team has been a perennial Final Four participant. But Notre Dame and Duke are exceptions. For every Notre Dame and Duke, there are many more like Rutgers and U.A.B., schools that spend millions in a hopeless mission to reach the top. 
The University of South Florida, nonetheless, wants in on the gamble and in on the perceived spoils. The new gospel there is that football is "the tip of the marketing sword." I heard the phrase from several administrators at U.S.F. Vicki Mitchell explained the concept to me. She had directed a highly successful university-wide fund-raising campaign, but in May, not long after the team jumped to Division I-A, she moved to the athletic department to raise money specifically for sports. Under Mitchell, the office devoted to sports fund-raising was ramped up from three staff members to eight, and in the first three months of this fiscal year she and her team brought in $1.6 million, just $200,000 less than the total raised in the previous 12 months. "The easiest way to build a U.S.F. brand is to build an athletic program that is known, and that means football," Mitchell said. "Maybe that's not what the university wants to be known for, but it's reality." 
Nearly two decades ago, the exploits of the Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie and the success of the team were credited with increasing applications by 25 percent and transforming B.C. from a regional to a national university. The syndrome was even given a name: the Flutie effect. That's the kind of magic U.S.F. is trying to catch. 
U.S.F. didn't play football at any level until 1997. Its founding president, John Allen, who presided over the university from 1957 to 1970, was that rare thing in football-crazed Florida -- a staunch opponent of the sport. In the 1980's, U.S.F. alumni and Tampa businessmen began pushing for football, and the U.S.F. administration began lobbying a reluctant state Board of Regents for a team. In 1993, the outgoing president, Frank Borkowski, in his final weeks at U.S.F. and with the Regents' decision on football pending, hired Lee Roy Selmon -- a former N.F.L. star and one of the most admired men in Tampa -- to lead football fund-raising. That was the pivotal moment. "I was in a pretty tight box," recalls Borkowski, now chancellor at Appalachian State University. "The Regents did not want us to have a team." But to deny football would have been a slap to Selmon.
Jim Leavitt was hired in 1995, two years before the University of South Florida Bulls played their first game. From the start, the university intended to move quickly to the N.C.A.A.'s highest level and eventually challenge football factories like Florida State, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. By the time the current U.S.F. president, Judy Genshaft, arrived in 2000, the program was in full bloom. Genshaft's term has so far been marked by a thorny dispute spawned by her suspension of Sami Al-Arian, a tenured professor of computer science, over charges that he had ties to terrorism. Compared to the fallout from that, football has been pure pleasure. 
Genshaft, who attends the team's games and keeps a jersey in her office with her name on the back, was an undergraduate at Wisconsin and a longtime administrator at Ohio State. "I know big sports," she says, "and I love big sports. It brings more visibility, more spirit, more community engagement. Even researchers coming to us from other big universities, they are expecting sports to be part of campus life."
The rationales put forth for big-time sports are not easily proved or disproved. One example is the assumption that successful teams spur giving to the general funds of universities. "The logic is reasonable enough," Zimbalist wrote in "Unpaid Professionals." "A school goes to the Rose Bowl or to the Final Four. Alumni feel proud and open up their pocketbooks." But Zimbalist looked at the available evidence and concluded that winning teams, at best, shake loose dollars given specifically for sports. And only for a time; when on-field fortunes reverse, or a scandal occurs, the money often dries up. 
Genshaft says that U.S.F. can play football at the highest level without financial or ethical ruin. "It's a risk and it is expensive," she says. "But we've decided that football is part of who we are and where we're going."
But others see disaster as the only possible result. At Rutgers, the sports program has split the campus community and spawned an angry and unusually organized opposition. "The reality of sports at this level is it can't be done right," says William C. Dowling, an English professor and one of the leaders of the Rutgers 1,000. "It's not possible, anywhere, even at the so-called best places. Look at the differences in SAT levels."
One study showed the SAT scores of football players at Division I-A schools to be 271 points lower than incoming nonathletes. "You have kids brought to campus and maybe, maybe they could be real students if they studied 60 hours a week and did nothing else," Dowling says. "But everyone knows that's not happening. It's not their fault. They've been lied to in high school, all these African-American kids who get told that playing ball is their way up in society, even though it's never been that for any other ethnic group in America. It's dishonest. It's filthy."
When Vicki Mitchell pitches U.S.F. donors, however, she sells the program as if it were in a state of grace -- unsullied by scandal, at least so far, and still operating with a degree of fiscal sanity. She begins by painting a picture of what life is like at the really big football powers. To secure a season ticket at one of those schools in a desirable part of the stadium, if that's even possible, can set a donor back tens of thousands of dollars. "I'll say to someone: 'You're a sports fan. You need to get on board, because everyone knows what it costs at those other places. Our aspirations are no less, but we're not there yet. We're young. We're fun. We're a growth stock. Get in now while it's still affordable."'
I met head coach Jim Leavitt for the first time just a few days before the biggest home game in the history of University of South Florida football. The opponent, Southern Mississippi, was the strongest team ever to visit U.S.F. and a favorite to break its 15-game home winning streak. U.S.F. had lost an early-season road game at Oklahoma, then the second-ranked team in the nation, but outplayed the powerful Sooners for long stretches. Leavitt's team was surging in the national polls; the New York Times computer rankings would place it as high as 18th in the nation, ahead of such tradition-rich football powers as Tennessee, Florida State, Auburn, Clemson and Nebraska. These accomplishments, for a program playing just its sixth season, were nothing short of astounding. 
As the showdown against Southern Mississippi loomed, two things obsessed Leavitt: winning the game, and money. "The kind of money we need is big, big money," he said to me not long after saying hello. He kept returning to the same point. "We have what we need for a beginning program, but we're not a beginning program anymore." Then: "I don't know what this program will look like in the future. It can be big. But you've got to have money. You've got to have facilities. If you don't, it ain't gonna happen."
Leavitt, 46, grew up in nearby St. Petersburg. He was a high-school sports star, a defensive back at the University of Missouri, then an assistant coach at several universities before he came home to be the first coach of U.S.F. football. 
Leavitt has won praise not just for winning, but also for doing so on the cheap. He and his nine assistant coaches work out of a complex of four trailers, in front of which Leavitt erected a split-rail fence "to make it look like the Ponderosa." Leavitt proudly told me that the couch in his office, on which he sometimes lies down for the night, is a $700 vinyl number rather than one of those $5,000 leather cruise ships to be found in the offices of so many other coaches. 
This era of frugality, though, has just ended. In early November, the university unveiled drawings for a long-hoped-for training and office complex that will be as big as a football field -- 104,000 square feet over two floors that will serve most of the university's men's and women's teams but will be dominated by football.
Leavitt views this as natural and right. He tells me about Oklahoma, coached by his close friend Bob Stoops, which already has "an outrageous setup, everything you can imagine," and has just raised yet another $100million. "I imagine they'll tell you it's not for football only, and I would assume it's not," Leavitt says. "But I'm pretty sure football will get what it needs first. As it should, in my opinion."
Like many football coaches, Leavitt is no fan of Title IX regulations that mandate equal opportunity for female athletes. "Don't get me wrong," he says, "I am a big proponent of women's sports. I want us to be great at women's sports. But football should be separate from the Title IX thing, because nobody else operates like we do. We're revenue-producing." 
To build the U.S.F. athletic complex will cost as much as $15 million. To furnish it -- starting with $425,000 in weight-training equipment, a $65,000 hydrotherapy tub, portable X-ray machines, satellite uplinks and downlinks, trophy cases for a U.S.F. sports hall of fame in the atrium entrance -- will cost up to $5 million more.
Despite aggressive fund-raising, private pledges for this facility have reached only $5 million, so it will be built on borrowed money. The construction bond will be backed partly by the "athletic fee" charged to students, which for those who attend full time has reached $224 a year -- a fairly substantial add-on to a tuition of only $2,159.
Mitchell says the university considers students "its biggest donor," and student leaders are, in fact, courted like boosters. In October, the student government president and vice president flew on a private jet with President Genshaft to the big game at Oklahoma. 
U.S.F. calculates that the football team brings in, roughly, $4 million in revenue and spends about the same amount. But as in most athletic departments, the accounting makes no attempt to measure the true resources used. 
One day, I stood in a humid basement room and watched the laundry -- muddy Bulls jerseys and pants, T-shirts, sweat socks, wrist- and headbands, jockstraps -- from 105 football players being cleaned. Several colossal washers and dryers were fed by three athletic-department employees. They perform this task early August through late November, six days a week, 10 hours a day.
None of this -- the salaries, the utility costs, the $8,000 a year just in laundry detergent -- is charged against football. Nor is there any attempt to break out football's share of such costs as sports medicine, academic tutoring, strength and conditioning, insurance, field upkeep or the rest of its share of the more than $5 million in general expenses of the athletic department not assigned to a specific sport. 
In the papers I was shown, I also could find no evidence that a $2 million fee to join Conference USA (which is not a B.C.S. conference) as a football-playing member in 2003 was accounted for in football's expense ledger. The money was borrowed from the university's general endowment, and the athletic department is paying the interest. 
So when Jim Leavitt says that his football team is revenue-producing, that should not be understood as profit-generating. I would not pretend to know what football really costs at U.S.F., but it's clearly a lot more than $4 million, maybe even twice that. And another big bill is about to come due: Leavitt's next contract.
Just in case Judy Genshaft didn't know she had a hot coach on her hands who needed a big raise, she could have learned it from reading the local press. The articles began after the end of the 2001 season, when Leavitt entertained some job feelers. "U.S.F. Needs to Make Commitment to Leavitt," read a headline in The Tampa Tribune. "U.S.F. said it wanted to play in the big leagues and built an impressive foundation," the columnist Joe Henderson wrote. "Now it has to finish the job, or risk that Leavitt will listen the next time someone calls."
Columns like these are the essential component of setting the market for a coach and driving up his price. An echo chamber of sports journalists, boosters, alumni, fans and national sports pundits anoints the coach a civic treasure and then campaigns that this indispensable figure must be properly rewarded lest the community risk having him stolen away. This is how it happens everywhere.
As Leavitt's Bulls piled up victory after victory this season, it got ever noisier in the echo chamber. A story by The Tampa Tribune's U.S.F. beat man noted that Leavitt's $180,000 salary was way out of whack, that the average for Conference USA coaches was $410,000, that the coach at Houston -- whose team Leavitt's slaughtered, 45-6! -- could approach $1 million and that Leavitt was in fact one of the lowest-paid coaches in all of Division I-A. 
A St. Petersburg Times columnist, Gary Shelton, celebrated Leavitt's single-mindedness -- he has never purchased a CD, doesn't go to the movies, was barely aware of the Florida governor's race -- and implied that the coach was too dedicated to the next game and next victory to properly focus on his own self-interest.
The drumbeat on Leavitt's behalf overlooked two things. One is that Leavitt's original contract runs through 2005, although that probably doesn't matter since college coaches are rarely held to the deals they sign. The other unaddressed question was more significant: how would U.S.F. square its big-time ambitions with its still small-time revenues?
For all the fevered energy and earnest expectations behind U.S.F. football, attendance at home games has long been stuck between 20,000 and 30,000. The team plays way across town, at the 65,000-seat Raymond James Stadium, home of the N.F.L.'s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. "We've flatlined," says Tom Veit, associate athletic director. "We had tire-kickers in the beginning, something like 50,000 at the first game in '97, and we need to bring them back in."
Students have not been dependable fans. About 3,500 live on campus; nearly 10,000 more live in off-campus garden apartments, most of which have swimming pools and frequent keg parties. Fifty-nine percent of U.S.F. students are female, so young men, the natural college football audience, may have a particular incentive not to stray too far from home. "If you want it to be," says the student government vice president, Dave Mincberg, "it's like spring break 24/7 around here." 
One function that U.S.F. football does serve is as content, cheap programming in the 500-channel universe. Under a contract with ESPN Plus, U.S.F. football (and basketball) games are constantly up on the satellite -- along with dozens of other games to be pulled down by viewers with a dish and a college sports package. The ubiquity of these televised college games makes the dream of a marketing bonanza -- Jim Leavitt's fightin' Bulls as the tip of the sword -- all the more difficult to achieve. Instead of becoming a "brand" like the well-known sports schools, U.S.F. is more likely to blend in with its anonymous brethren in Sports Satellite World, the Northern Arizonas, Coastal Carolinas and Boise States. 
But U.S.F. has set its course. It's on the treadmill. It plays Alabama next season, Penn State in 2005 and the University of Florida in 2008. It didn't schedule these games to be embarrassed. Rebuilding with a new coach would be difficult competitively and, even more so, commercially. "If we lose Jim Leavitt, from a marketing point of view, that's not a place I want to be," Veit says. "I don't want to be me at that point. He's a hometown guy. He wins. People like him."
When the local sportswriters ask Leavitt about his contract, he gives carefully bland responses. He doesn't have an agent, and it could be argued that with his fawning press, he hardly needs one. The articles clearly please him. One day he says to me: "The Tampa paper is going to have another piece coming up on my salary. But you know, I don't pay too much attention. I don't deserve anything. I'm just glad I have a job. I'm blessed.
"And I mean that. I have zero interest in leaving here. But then people say to me, 'What if you were offered $1 million to go somewhere else?' Well, then I'd probably leave. Let's be realistic."
I asked him what he thought his market value was, and he did not hesitate. "About $500,000 or $600,000," he said. "At least."
The biggest of the big-time college sporting events are intoxicating. The swirl of colors, the marching bands, the deafening roars, the over-the-top political incorrectness -- Florida State's Seminole mascot riding in on horseback; a Mississippi State coach some years back, on the eve of a game against the Texas Longhorns, castrating a bull. The whole thing is a little reminiscent of what I've heard some Catholic friends of mine say: even if you're a little ambivalent about the message, the pageantry will get you every time. 
In college sports, the heady mix of anticipation, adrenaline, camaraderie and school pride is the gloss over the grubby reality. Pro sports operates within some financial parameters, governed by a profit motive. College sport, by contrast, is a mad cash scramble with squishy rules. Universities run from conference to conference, chasing richer TV deals; coaches from school to school, chasing cash. It's a game of mergers and acquisitions -- of running out on your partners before they run out on you. 
It's understandable why universities with hundreds of millions already invested in sports can't find a way out. Far less understandable is why a school like U.S.F. would, with eyes wide open, walk in. "I felt then and still feel that U.S.F. could be a model football program," says Frank Borkowski, the former president. "One with clear policies and rules, attractive to bright students, that would not go the way of so many programs -- a corrupt way." 
But the whole framework of college sports, with its out-of-control spending and lax academic and ethical standards, is rotten; it's difficult to be clean within it. The "student athletes," as the N.C.A.A. insists on calling them, feel the hypocrisy. When one is caught taking the wrong thing from the wrong person -- not the usual perks but actual money -- what ensues is a "Casablanca"-like overabundance of shock, then a bizarre penalty phase that almost always punishes everyone but the guilty parties. Thus, when the University of Michigan finally acknowledged this fall that some members of its famed "Fab Five" basketball teams of the early 1990's may have accepted payments from a booster, the university tried to get out in front of N.C.A.A. sanctions by disqualifying this year's team -- whose players were about 8 years old in the Fab Five years -- from participating in the 2003 N.C.A.A. tournament. 
With the greater opportunities being afforded female athletes, it should be no surprise that an outsize sense of entitlement now extends to the women. Deborah Yow, the athletic director at the University of Maryland (and one of the few women leading a big athletic department), told me about a conversation she had with an athlete who had rejected Maryland. 
"We just lost a great recruit in the sport of women's lacrosse, in which we have won seven national championships," Yow said. "And one of the comments that the recruit made was that the school she had chosen over us had a beautiful new lacrosse stadium with a lovely locker room, and she even described the lockers in some detail. They were wood; that was the word she kept using. And, as she said, they all had that Nike gear hanging everywhere. And I've been to that facility. And I know that what she said was true."
In theory, Yow could have been pleased to be rejected by such a spoiled child. But she does not have that luxury. Instead, she felt relieved that a planned complex to be used by the Maryland's women's lacrosse team would be the equal of this other palace. "We, as athletic directors, are interested in having the best possible facilities because we have noticed along the way that recruits are interested in this, that it does matter," she says.
College sport could not survive if it were viewed only as mass entertainment. On another level, it serves as a salvation story. The enterprise rests mostly on a narrative of young men pulled from hopeless situations, installed at universities, schooled in values by coaches and sent off into the world as productive citizens. 
No one is better suited to tell the story than Lee Roy Selmon. The youngest of nine children in Eufala, Okla., he excelled in athletics and earned a football scholarship, as did two of his brothers, to the University of Oklahoma. Lee Roy Selmon became the first-ever draft pick of the new Tampa Bay Buccaneers, an N.F.L. Hall of Famer, then a Tampa banker. The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway is one of the city's major thoroughfares.
To Selmon, who became U.S.F.'s athletic director a year and a half ago, college sports is a giant scholarship program for needy children. Of football's 100-player rosters, he says, "The more people here, the more people getting an education, the better. It's about generations -- about student athletes developing abilities, being citizens, having families and being able to nurture their children." 
One evening, I visited with some U.S.F. football players at their mandatory study hall, which takes place inside a wide-open rectangular room as big as a good-size banquet hall. Their monitor, Vik Bhide, a trim engineering student, sat just inside the front door, paging through a book called "The Dimensions of Parking." The players clustered at round tables, reading textbooks or writing. Most had started their day very early and had already attended classes, lifted weights, endured a three-hour practice and gone to meetings in which they watched game film with coaches.
I took a walk through the room and peeked at the players' coursework. John Miller, a freshman offensive lineman, was studying vocabulary words from a textbook. On his list were "burgeoning," "inflection," "emanate," "insidious" and "obscenity." "It's a lot of hard words," he said. "But they're good for you."
Vince Brewer, a junior running back, was about to start an informative speech, which he thought he'd write on the subject of what causes a player to pass out during practice. "We get told a lot about dehydration, and the professor said to pick something you know a lot about." Chris Carothers, a massive offensive lineman, told me bluntly that he does not much like school, "but as a football player, it's something you've got to do."
In all of my interactions with U.S.F. football players, I was struck at how mannerly they were. Nearly all are from Florida, many from small towns, and in a classically Southern way, they are yes-sir, no-sir types. Maybe because U.S.F. has not yet reached its ambitions and neither the team nor its players are widely famous -- not even on their own campus -- there wasn't a lot of swagger.
"My mom and dad had me when they were in 11th grade," Marquel Blackwell, the Bulls' star quarterback, said. "I was raised, basically, by my two grandmothers. The main thing they taught me was how to respect other people."
Not a whole lot of trouble has attached to Jim Leavitt's boys in the six years of U.S.F. football, nothing of the sort that occurs at some places and serves to indict a whole program. There have been some scuffles, as well as a gunplay accident in which a player was wounded. 
"We encourage the players to be as much a part of normal campus life as possible," said Phyllis LaBaw, the associate athletic director for academic support. But no one pretends that they really are much like the typical U.S.F. student. 
Nearly 70 percent of the U.S.F. football team is black on a campus that is otherwise 70 percent white. (Only 11 percent of U.S.F. students are black; the rest of the minority population is Hispanic and Asian and Native American.) The football players tend to be poorer than other students and more in need of academic help.
To be a football player at U.S.F., or an athlete of any kind, is like taking your mother to school with you -- or several mothers. Academic counselors meet with athletes at least weekly. They sometimes follow them right to the door of a classroom, which in the trade is known as "eyeballing" a player to class. Where a lot of players are grouped in one class, tutors sometimes sit in and take notes. Counselors communicate directly with professors. "We don't ever ask for favors," LaBaw said. "But professors do provide us with information, which is vital."
Football players who miss a class or a mandatory study session get "run" by coaches -- meaning they must show up on the practice field at 6 a.m. to be put through a series of sprints by a coach who is not happy to be there at that hour. "It is very punitive," LaBaw said.
LaBaw's department employs four full-time counselors and about 40 tutors and has an annual budget of $400,000. The staff serves all 450 intercollegiate athletes at U.S.F., so the 105 football players are less than a quarter of the clients -- but as is the case with so much else, football sucks up more resources than its raw numbers would indicate. "They need more help," LaBaw said of the footballers, "but what we're doing works. Last year our football players had a mean G.P.A. of 2.52, which if we were already in Conference USA would have been the best in the conference -- including Army."
LaBaw is part den mother, part drill sergeant -- loving and supportive or confrontational and blunt, depending on the needs of the moment. Under her desk, she keeps a big box; when the season began, it had 5,000 condoms in it, all different colors. She hands them out like lollipops along with however much sex education she can blurt out. 
Her effort, while well intentioned, is a version of closing the barn door after the horses have run out. Of the 105 players on U.S.F.'s football team -- most of them between 18 and 23 years old -- about 30 are fathers and many have produced multiple children. "I would say there's a total of 60 children from this team, and that's a conservative estimate," said LaBaw. "It's amazing how quickly it occurs, usually in the first year. Or they come to school already fathers."
What this means is that the recipients of Lee Roy Selmon's scholarship program for needy young men are recreating the need that many of them came from -- children living in poverty, without fathers at home. With their five hours per day of football-related activity on top of class and studying, the fathers have no time even to change a diaper, let alone work to financially support their children. Most of the children live with their mothers or aunts or grandmothers. Some who are nearby spend the day at the university's day-care center, yet another cost of college football since the service is offered virtually free to U.S.F. students.
In DeAndrew Rubin's portrait in the U.S.F. football media guide, it says that his father drowned when he was 11 months old. It adds, "Father had given him a teddy bear for his first Christmas in 1978, and he places it in his locker during every game."
Rubin, 24, has two children, 3 years old and 10 months, and is engaged to their mother, his girlfriend since high school. They live just 30 minutes away in St. Petersburg. "I see them as often as I can, so if I would pass, they would remember me," he said. "I can't help that much financially, but emotionally I want to be there for them." 
Unlike several other U.S.F. fathers who said they planned to make the N.F.L., Rubin is considered a prospect, although no sure thing. "It would be good for our situation," he said. "I don't want to have to work a 9-to-5; I guess nobody really does."
LaBaw spends a lot of time talking to the players. "Those who are fathers, there's a comfort aspect -- having children is an opportunity to be surrounded by more love. Which is what they've always had, from grandmothers and aunts and cousins. But there is also this trophy aspect. It's let me show you the pictures, or the multiple pictures."
Football is at the center of Jim Leavitt's world, so he is not one to question the time or money devoted to it. He does not seem to have a great deal of interest in the nonfootball world. Leavitt makes appearances on campus and in the community, often related to fund-raising, but several people told me he can be brusque. If he says he has 20 minutes to give, then he's normally out the door in 20 minutes. There is always a practice to conduct or a football tape to be watched. He watches game tapes, and tapes of practices. "I sit and watch film all day long," he says. "I'm a recluse."
Because football is so central to him, he assumes his team's success is widely known and that it translates into other realms -- he believes, without a doubt, in the concept of football as tip of the marketing sword. "We've had guys drafted into the N.F.L.," he says. "We have two guys with Super Bowl rings. How much does the university spend for that? What's it worth? That's worldwide publicity for the University of South Florida, right?"
I asked Leavitt if his long football hours left him much time with his 7-year-old daughter. "Quality time," he said, then repeated it as if trying to convince himself. "Quality time. It's got to be quality time."
There is one slice of humanity that Leavitt connects with -- his players. "That's why I'm in this," he says. "The players. The relationships I have with those young men and the ability to make a difference in their lives. My mission is to help young people in every aspect of life. If I lose sight of that, I'll get out of coaching. The other reason I coach is for that moment when you are victorious. That's hard to create in any other part of life. You feel such contentment. That moment is so powerful." At halftime of U.S.F.'s season finale against Houston, Leavitt grew so agitated that he excitedly head-butted several of his helmeted players and came away bloody.
Beyond the field, Leavitt had reason to believe he had made a difference. His players respond to him as an authority figure and as a friend. They have absorbed his laser focus. They play football. They go to class and mandatory study hall. When the season is over, they lift weights and run. Marquel Blackwell, the quarterback, told me that more established programs like Florida and Nebraska showed interest in him but wanted to switch his position. Of Leavitt, he says: "He believed in me, and I believe in him back. I've given my heart to that man."
On the night of the big game, with U.S.F.'s home winning streak on the line against Southern Mississippi, President Genshaft played host to a couple of dozen guests in a luxury box at Raymond James Stadium -- a crowd that included Florida's lieutenant governor and an assortment of local business types and politicos. Mike Griffin, the student government president, was in the box, too, wearing a "Bulls for Jeb" campaign button. 
Because of Selmon's icon status, his box is the more coveted invitation, and Vicki Mitchell and her staff put together his list for maximum impact. They had targeted a wealthy U.S.F. graduate and Los Angeles lawyer as a potential big donor, but he had become critical of the athletic program on chat rooms devoted to U.S.F. sports. (Fund-raisers monitor such things.) Selmon called the lawyer during a trip to Los Angeles, just to warm him up, then invited him to fly in and sit in his box for the game. The lawyer accepted and showed up at the game with a friend who wore a muscle shirt. But both men fidgeted and looked impatient, then bolted at halftime.
The large-framed woman sitting in a corner of the box paid much more interest and stayed to the end. Selmon spent time visiting with her, at one point positioning himself on one knee in the aisle next to her. She was another potentially deep-pocketed donor: Lucille Harrison, a Florida resident and Shaquille O'Neal's mother.
U.S.F. beat the odds. It preserved its home winning streak in a stirring game decided on the last play, a missed Southern Mississippi field-goal attempt. By season's end, Leavitt's long hours had paid off beyond what any football prognosticator could have predicted. The Bulls finished the season with a record of 9-2, including a dismantling of Bowling Green, then ranked 25th in the nation. A bid to a minor bowl, the money-losing kind, looked possible, but the bowls snubbed U.S.F. in favor of teams with lesser records but bigger names. Leavitt immediately surfaced as a possibility to fill open coaching jobs at marquee schools, including Alabama and Michigan State. The new program was at a crossroads. Was it going to ante up for its coach, and his assistants too, which could easily add an instant $500,000 or more to the annual football budget? Or would it start all over with someone new? 
As the field goal flew wide in the Southern Miss game, one of Selmon's guests, an alum and successful stockbroker, jumped out of his seat, threw his arms around the U.S.F. athletic director and got right to the point. "We've got to keep this man!" he shouted, referring to Leavitt. "Let's raise this man some money and keep him here!"
On Dec. 12, the University of South Florida ripped up Jim Leavitt's contract and signed him to a new five-year deal that more than doubled his salary. If he keeps winning, he probably won't make it to the final year of this contract, either, when he's scheduled to make nearly $700,000. U.S.F. will have to pay more to keep him, or other programs will come looking to steal him away. That's how it is when you decide to play with the big boys. The bills just keep on getting bigger.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 2 New Reports on New York City Published; 
Analyzing Housing Trends

 BODY:
Two reports offering data and analysis of housing trends in New York City have recently been published.
 "The State of New York City's Housing and Neighborhoods, 2002" -- a community-by-community look at indicators like housing prices, mortgage originations, foreclosures, tax delinquencies and vacancy rates -- is being offered to the public by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law.

HEADLINE: Some Millionaires Say Tax Is Unfair 

BYLINE:  By LEAH NATHANS SPIRO 

 BODY:
ON Dec. 4, Gov. John G. Rowland called for a new income tax on millionaires, raising their rate to 5.5 percent, a percentage point higher than almost everyone else. Earlier this year, he was strongly opposed to the tax, saying it would instigate "class warfare." The state budget gap changed his mind.
 Connecticut residents overwhelmingly support the new tax on those who earn more than $1 million a year. Nearly nine out of 10 favor the tax as the best way to help close the spending gap, according to a University of Connecticut poll. 
 But some of those who will be affected are, not surprisingly, unhappy about it. They said tax rates should be the same for everyone and that forcing them to pay more, even by 1 percentage point, makes for an inequitable tax system. They said they were being unfairly singled out, but realized there was not much they can do to stop it. 
"I can't say I like the idea, but what do you do?" said a Westport resident who makes more than $1 million a year in the financial business. "Am I going to go out and picket? No."
None of the residents affected by the millionaires' tax interviewed for this article wanted their names used, some saying it was extremely poor manners to talk about their wealth. And those who admitted to at least being wealthy wouldn't say if the tax would apply to them. Still, all of them said they resented the tax.
Russell S. Reynolds Jr., whose family has been in Greenwich for 11 generations and who was the founder of Russell Reynolds Associates, a headhunting firm that he has sold his interest in, would not say if he would be affected by the tax, except to say, "I'm not poor." He did say, though, that the wealthy shouldn't be treated differently than anyone else.
"Any tax that is discriminatory is a mistake," said Mr. Reynolds, now the chief executive of the Directorship Search Group, a headhunting firm in Greenwich. "Wealthy people are willing to do their share, more than their share. I don't think they like being singled out as scapegoats."
One Fairfield County money manager who often earns more than $1 million a year said Governor Rowland was taxing millionaires because, politically, he could get away with it. With about 6,500 residents earning more than $1 million a year, he said the governor doesn't have to worry about losing many votes.
"It's very easy to tax the wealthy," the money manager said. "There are 3.2 million people in the state. And 0.2 percent of them would be unhappy with a millionaires' tax."
Mr. Reynolds said it would be a big mistake to treat millionaires unfairly because of how they contribute to the state's well-being.
"They're the people who are taking care of people, employing people, supporting charities, museums, contributing to the nonprofit world," he said. "The most wealthy people tend to be generous."
Both millionaires and other business people said for all the debate, the tax doesn't go very far to solve the state's fiscal crisis.
"Members of our board are not happy campers," said Joe McGee, vice president, public policy for the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a Stamford-based Chamber of Commerce. "They think it's unfair. Let's be real. We all know the size of the budget deficit." 
According to the legislative Office of Fiscal Analysis, a 1 percentage point increase from 4.5 to 5.5 percent on incomes of more than $1 million would raise about $100 million in the seven months ending June 30, and another $170 million the next fiscal year. All together, the state has to come up with $500 million in the current fiscal year and $1.5 billion next fiscal year.
Mr. McGee worried that the tax will exacerbate the economic fault lines in the state. "When you separate one group from the pack, it is never good," he said. "It plays on class and wealth differences and it is not good public policy."
The biggest danger many people expressed is that by singling out millionaires, the state will kill the golden goose. If millionaires are being singled out, they could simply go live somewhere else and maybe take their companies with them.
State Representative Lile Gibbons, a Republican of Greenwich, said that's a real concern.
"It's a very elastic group," she said. "They have second homes and they will vote with their feet and move. I don't know if we can afford to lose any of them." 
Actually, there are already far fewer millionaires in the state than a few years ago. While there were about 10,000 people earning more than $1 million a year in 2000, the state estimated there are only 6,500 now, said Robert Wysock, an economic analyst with the state Office of Fiscal Analysis. 
He said it's the stock marketthat in large part determines the number of millionaires in the state. "There's not a huge identifiable group that are consistently millionaires," Mr. Wysock said. "There are a lot who come in and come out due to capital gains or sales of property."
Russ Mitchell, the co-president of Mitchell's, a high-end, family owned clothing retailer with stores in Westport and Greenwich, said that many of his customers are in the financial industry and they could easily move somewhere else.
"The financial services business today, pieces of it, you can do from anywhere," he said. "Over time, they will decide, 'Why don't I do it in Florida or Nevada?' Losing those people doesn't help the state.".
A Greenwich man who earns more than $1 million a year in his job on Wall Street said the tax affected decision makers and what may only be a 1 percentage point increase today, could go higher tomorrow.
"Hedge fund managers say 'I don't have to do this here, I can go to Florida,' " he said. "These businesses are highly portable. They won't move for 1 percent, but they will move for a 5 percent increase.
"What if you're a C.E.O. living in Greenwich who can move to Texas?" he asked. "These are people who have the ability to move the company. Why do companies change their headquarters? It comes down to economic lifestyle -- the cost of living and marginal tax rates."
And never mind Florida or Texas. What about Westchester County, where taxes have been traditionally higher?
"Taxes are a lot of the reason that people are living in Greenwich as opposed to Rye," he said. "It's taxes that affect your economic well being. It's not reason No. 1. But it is No. 2 or No. 3. Greenwich is a great place. If suddenly it becomes a high tax place, you think twice. It only affects a handful of people, but these are the economic decision makers that are driving the state economy.
Mr. McGee predicted that the state will ultimately raise taxes for every income group, including business.
"Connecticut has had historic advantage in taxes vs. New York City, Westchester, and New Jersey," Mr. McGee said. "This pretty much levels it off."

HEADLINE: How Did Such a Rich State Get So Poor? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
MARK WATTERSON has a pretty balanced view of Connecticut. By day, he sells BMW's, ardently convincing upscale residents of Darien that they need a Z4 roadster or an X5 S.U.V. At night, he returns home to the middle-class town of Milford. And, each way, he drives through Bridgeport, one of the poorest cities in the United States. 
 But when it comes to Connecticut's finances and budget, Mr. Watterson is at a bit of a loss. "I don't understand," he said. "We were very bountiful. All of a sudden, we're broke and it's an emergency. I missed something. The whole thing came up pretty quickly." 
 Last week, the General Assembly convened in a special session for the second time this year to deal with the state's crumbling finances. Gov. John G. Rowland, long a rabid tax-cutter, has had to raise taxes two years in a row to balance the books. All of this leaves Mr. Watterson and many other state residents asking a lot of questions: 
*How did Connecticut, arguably the richest state in the nation with the highest per capita income, end up facing a gaping $500 million hole in this year's $13.4 billion budget and a projected shortfall of as much as $1.5 billion next year?
*After five years of gigantic surpluses that allowed virtually every city and town to benefit from Hartford's largesse, how could Connecticut find itself on the brink of a cash shortage, its rainy-day fund vaporized, with no choice but to borrow to balance its books? 
*How did a state known for excellent government services and a superior quality-of-life wind up needing to lay off nearly 3,000 state workers and to make deep cutbacks to popular social service programs, including assistance to the mentally ill and the blind?
*How could a state that once functioned without any personal income tax, that first elected its current governor on his pledge to eliminate it, have become so dependent on the revenue that the state is now forced to raise the tax on its wealthiest earners? 
*And how could all of this happen in a state that is home both to one of the largest concentrations of mega-wealthy individuals earning more than $25 million a year, and also to two of the world's busiest casinos, which give the state a steady stream of cash?
Of course, Connecticut is still pretty bountiful. Mr. Watterson and his colleagues at the dealership are still making the coffee-run up to Starbucks for the good stuff. And Connecticut is far from alone in its budget woes. In fact, neighboring states have it worse and some much worse. 
"Nearly every state is in fiscal crisis," according to an annual report, published last month by the National Association of State Budget Officers. "State revenues have shrunk at the same time that spending pressures are mounting. As states fight to balance their budgets, the solutions available to them are increasingly dire." 
But Connecticut's quick descent from the high-flying surpluses of the 1990's is not simply the tale of a falling national tide that lowered all boats. Economists and budget experts disagreed as to how much of the budget woes could have been predicted and, perhaps, prevented.
Some said Governor Rowland cut income taxes too far over his first two terms in office, depriving the state of needed revenue. Others said that in hindsight the state should have put far more of its surplus money into the rainy day fund. At the same time, many said the situation would be worse had Mr. Rowland not kept spending in check.
The state's fiscal troubles -- and the measures that Governor Rowland and the General Assembly have proposed to address them -- also underscore some fundamental and wide-ranging changes to Connecticut's economy in the decade since the last downturn, changes that economic experts said have mostly made the state stronger.
So, how did Connecticut get in so much trouble so fast? Virtually all of the experts agreed on at least one thing: Connecticut's problems lie mostly on the revenue side. In other words, the state has too little income as opposed to being overburdened by too much spending, overextended by too much debt or overwhelmed by failed industries. 
"We only have a 4.2 percent unemployment rate," said Fred V. Carstensen, the director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis. "We have net growth in household income. We have new business creation. We are one of the healthiest economies in the country. This is not a crisis created by an economy that has gone bad." 
Mr. Carstensen continued, "Our economy doesn't have the vitality that it had a few years ago, but it's actually in reasonably good shape. And historically we'd say it's actually in very good shape. The problem is not the health of the state economy so much as it is a problem with state revenue."
The revenue problem first appeared as one of those arcane bits of fiscal data that make the average citizen's eyes glaze over. But it immediately grabbed the attention of state budget officials at the Office of Policy and Management in Hartford, who were both alarmed and perplexed -- as if someone had loudly clanged a fire bell with no sign of smoke or flame in sight. 
In March 2001, after more than five years of robust month-to-month growth, the state's revenue from income-tax withholdings, the tax money taken out of people's paychecks, suddenly slowed down. Budget-makers who specialize in this sort of minutiae were mystified. Employment data remained strong; personal income was still growing. 
"We were sitting here scratching our heads," said Marc S. Ryan, the secretary of Policy and Management who is also Governor Rowland's budget director. "If personal income is still growing modestly, your withholdings would stay the same." Neighboring states were experiencing the same phenomenon and were equally perplexed. 
"States like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts were calling around to our state and saying, 'We don't get it either,' " Mr. Ryan said. 
Revised employment data would later show a peak in July 2000 and that Connecticut had been actually been losing jobs since then.
And in hindsight, the significance of that initial slow-down in withholdings was abundantly clear. Through the boom of the late 1990's, gains reaped from the soaring stock markets, year-end bonuses and other "windfalls" became such a mainstay of personal income that taxpayers accounted for them in weekly withholdings, rather than in their quarterly estimated tax payments to the state.
"Withholding ended up being a proxy for some of the stock market activity each year," Mr. Ryan said. 
Six months later, terrorists struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Connecticut's economy, like New York's and the nation's, went into a dive. Estimated taxes paid to Connecticut that September were down 8.7 percent from the year before. The slow-down in withholdings had been a signal of much worse things to come.
The budget adopted by the General Assembly in the spring of 2001 fell far short of expectations. The budget had projected a 4.1 percent decline in non-withholding income tax receipts, which are the payments mailed directly by taxpayers, known as the estimates and finals portion of the income tax. The actual drop was 23.7 percent. The budget predicted 6.2 percent growth in withholding revenues; actual growth barely reached 1 percent. 
Over all, state income tax revenues dropped 10.1 percent to $4.3 billion; the sales tax dropped 4.1 percent to $3 billion and corporate income tax dropped 30.8 percent to $400 million. To balance the budget, the state raised its cigarette tax, liquidated its $600 million budget surplus fund, and agreed to issue more than $200 million in debt. 
At a hearing this month before the General Assembly, Mr. Ryan noted that state officials faced an added obstacle in preparing for this economic slowdown. A decade ago, during the last downturn, the state did not have an income tax, so there was no prior experience, no benchmarks to gauge what might be in store. 
In an interview, Mr. Ryan offered an example of the forecasting challenge. "We had this huge ramp-up, extremely strong double digit growth in capital gains tax paid," he said, referring to the tax on the sale of such assets as stocks. "We turned down our growth rate expecting the market to fall. It turns out we were wrong by about 50 percent."
There is no question that capital gains revenue drove the surpluses in the late 1990's. Capital gains reported by Connecticut residents rose by double digits from 1995 through 2000.
"The big impact on income tax receipts is the drop in capital gains," said Todd Martin, chief economist with People's Bank in Bridgeport. "I have seen some estimates that up to a third of all income tax receipts were based on capital gains."
Mr. Carstensen of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis said it was inevitable that capital gains would drop off and state budget makers could have prepared for it. 
Mr. Carstensen praised Governor Rowland and the General Assembly for making great efforts in cutting corporate taxes and generally improving the climate for businesses in the state. But he said Mr. Rowland bore responsibility for the state's revenue problems because he cut personal income taxes too far. 
"The governor campaigned on his accomplishment at cutting our revenue by $2.5 billion," Mr. Carstensen said. "It's a little like a blackjack player on a winning streak at the casinos who thinks the winning streak is going to go on forever and therefore quits his day job." 
Mr. Rowland, in his current budget-cutting plan, has proposed $200 million in tax increases, including increased income taxes on people earning more than $1 million a year; $200 million in broad spending cuts, and $100 million in union concessions or cuts in state aid to cities and towns.
"We reduced the tax burden imprudently both in scale and in type," Mr. Carstensen said. "Correcting the problem is not very difficult. It may be difficult to do politically to go back to people and say, 'you know, we decreased taxes more than we should have.' " But, he said, "This is not the crisis it's being made out to be. This is a revenue crisis, not an economic crisis or spending crisis." 
Mr. Ryan, the budget director, defended the tax cuts, saying voters had demanded them. "One of the attractive things about this state is that it has a moderate income tax," he said. "We're not going to apologize that we gave income tax cuts that essentially meant 50 percent of all tax filers saw their income tax drop by 50 percent." 
Mr. Ryan credited disciplined adherence to the state's spending cap for Connecticut's relatively better position compared to New York, New Jersey or Massachusetts.
"Given the frenzy of surplus monies and the willingness by everybody to spend it, I think we did a pretty good job of controlling our appetites," Mr. Ryan said, though he acknowledged the state might have saved more. 
Mr. Ryan noted that Connecticut had lost relatively few jobs, about 32,000, compared to the recession in the early 1990's, when the state lost 158,000 jobs. Since the early 1990's the state's economy has undergone dramatic changes. Not only was the income tax created, but Foxwoods casino opened in 1992 creating thousands of jobs. 
Foxwoods and the Mohegan Sun generate about $400 million in annual revenue for the state. While the casinos have been a huge help, especially in replacing defense industry jobs in the southeastern part of the state, officials noted that the casinos provide a relatively small portion of the budget. "Casino revenue only represents 3 percent of our entire budget," Mr. Ryan said.
Mr. Ryan said that the casinos offered one example of how the state's economy diversified and strengthened over the last 10 years. Thousands of other jobs were created in research and development, in biotechnology and in the service sector, he said. 
No matter how diverse the state economy, Mr. Ryan said the state would still be subject to the whims of Wall Street. For residents earning more than $1 million a year, he said, more than half of their income is unearned, that is it is income from dividends, capital gains and the like. 
"Any income tax state that is very wealthy, no matter how diverse you might say its tax structure could be," he said, "is always going to have ebbs and flows."

HEADLINE: Moonlighters at the Mall: a Holiday Struggle 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON 

 BODY:
RITA CONNOR, 37, of Bethel, works during the day as a teacher in the birth-to-3 program at the Danbury Even Start program. But after work three nights a week, she hurries over to K-B Toy Works on Newtown Road in Danbury. There, she stands on her feet for several hours helping customers find Thomas the Tank Engine tracks, Spiderman Monopoly and the latest Yu-Gi-Oh cards, to make a little extra cash for Christmas.
 Ms. Connor knows firsthand the difficulty some people have had getting a job -- any job. The program she works for during the day helps educate teenage mothers. Those same young mothers are competing with the Ms. Connors of the world for holiday work, to give them a boost during the biggest spending spree of the year. 
 "Jobs are very difficult to come by," Ms. Connor said. "The stores are looking this year for people who really want to work, who can commit for a 2 to 10 shift, for example, odd hours. Nowadays, when you get a job, it's very precious."
Securing holiday help has long been a challenge to large mall retailers in Connecticut, where the work force is better educated and more affluent than average. Even employee discounts of 25 to 30 percent have failed to draw holiday applicants in droves over the years, particularly in the Fairfield County market. Couple that with stores extending their holiday hours, some opening at 6 a.m. and keeping their doors open until midnight. To accommodate this, they ratchet up their employee count threefold. 
K-B Toys, for example, gets by with 15 to 18 employees during the year. Once Halloween hits, the manager of K-B's Danbury store, Bill Tamboia, brings on 25 or so more.
This year, he had more applicants for seasonal jobs than in past the five years.
"I don't think the overall retail environment was hiring like they normally would be at this time of year," Mr. Tamboia said. "They were thinking that the fourth quarter wasn't going to turn out for them well. But it all seems to balance out at the end."
Edward J. Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, said upscale mall merchants such as Filene's, Lord & Taylor and Macy's were more selective in their hiring this year.
"The stores were not very optimistic, and I think correctly so," he said. "And although the data seems to contradict this, people are going to spend the same amount they did last year, but they'll be spending it at the Wal-Marts, the Targets, the J. C. Penneys, trying to get more value for their money."
Executives at Filene's looked at the increased availability of workers and opted not to advertise seasonal jobs in their typical way: by newspaper classifieds. Shoppers at Westfield Shoppingtown in Meriden, formerly the Meriden Square Mall, are greeted by a sign the size of a billboard hanging above the entrance to the Filene's store, with the words "Now Hiring." Inside, small postcards are set by cashier booths, with words luring would-be employees to work at Filene's for the holidays. In turn, the stores were surprised when fewer than the normal numbers filled out applications.
"The feeling is that the economy is worse and we should have more applicants," said Robin Riebel, a spokeswoman for Filene's. "We are not advertising in the same ways; we did less outside recruiting and that made sense. Either way, we had a sufficient number of employees to take care of our seasonal opportunities."
Smaller retailers bypass new hires in favor of returning high school and college students. The retailers also extend hours for both part-time and full-time employees. Even toy stores -- the privately owned ones, anyway -- tend to avoid taping up "positions available" signs in their windows during the holidays. 
"We don't hire many people during the holidays because we need people who have a knowledge of what we're selling," said Steve Amato of Amato's Toy and Hobby shop in Middletown and New Britain, which does three-fourths of its annual business between Halloween and Easter. "We have part-timers during the year who we hire with the understanding that they will be available more during this season. In the chain operations, those people are just cashiers. But we need knowledgeable people, and you can't teach somebody what they need to know here in a week."
Roxanne Coady, owner of R.J. Julia Booksellers in Madison, uses college students who have been chipping in to help for years and know the store.
"Around the edges, the quality of who we have been able to hire has improved, for the holiday season and in general," Ms. Coady said. "I attribute it to two things: It's a weaker economy, instead of the sort of atmosphere where no one would work for less than $500 an hour. Now people have become more practical. We've also seen a post-Sept. 11 thing. This is the kind of place people want to be in to work -- an appealing atmosphere. Here, you feel good about what you're doing. The appeal has become that much more compelling."
Unemployment in Connecticut is still low compared to the rest of the nation, at 4.2 percent in October compared to 5.7 percent nationally. Retailers come to depend on high school and college students, and at-home parents to fill in the ranks of holiday workers, although teenagers are limited by labor laws and inexperience. Retailers may only hire people 18 or older for work past 10 p.m. 
"Retailers are looking for older teens, and people with a little more experience," said Michele Mesek, the work force coordinator for the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association. 
"They want people who know how to speak with the public. The high school students I deal with don't have that experience." 
So there were more applicants for jobs, but not quite as great a need this year, retailers said. 
Mitchell's, an upscale clothing store on the Post Road in Westport, hired six gift wrappers for the Christmas season. Students looking for holiday money applied in abundance, said Tom Maleri, the manager.
"I think there are more people looking to make some extra money," he said, "especially the kids."

Gateway to Pet Heaven On an Economy Fare

BYLINE:  By ZUZA GLOWACKA 

DATELINE: NEW PROVIDENCE 

 BODY:
WITH a statue of St. Francis looking over his shoulder, the Rev. Alan French picked up a cement spaniel, moved it aside and used a red shovel to dig a hole. Then, by hand, he poured in the ashes of Nicole, a Yorkshire terrier, and Minuet, a miniature poodle. With a red Bible in hand, he blessed the dearly departed, covered the grave and returned the statue of the spaniel to its original location.
 Ornamented with three statues, two wooden benches and a row of potted flowers, Mr. French's pet cemetery at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church here in Union County could easily be mistaken for a backyard garden. But beneath the unmarked ground where the stone statue of St. Francis stands lay the ashes of more than 100 animals: mostly dogs and cats, one or two gerbils and possibly a Hollywood lion. 
 Mr. French, who is the rector of St. Andrew's church, says his burial services are motivated by both his devotion to animals and his love for people, particularly children and the elderly, who have lost their companions.
"He's a dog lover," said Margaret Roeck, whose dog recently died. "Only a dog lover would understand."
The cemetery is an alternative, Mr. French says, to the growing number of privately run pet cemeteries around the country that charge as much as $1,000 for a plot, burial, service and a coffin. At many of those places, headstones, upkeep and other services for the bereaved are available, at extra charges.
At the Abbey Glen Pet Memorial Park, in nearby Lafayette, for example, a pet cremation can run $160 to $280, burial plots begin at $450, headstones cost at least $260, and caskets go for a minimum of $165. Transporting the deceased to the cemetery adds about $85, and everlasting upkeep of the grave goes for about $500. Referrals to grief counseling services come at no cost.
"I think charging money for burying pets is a ripoff," said Mr. French, who assesses his pet mourners no fees for burials. "It takes advantage of people, especially the elderly, whose pets are often their only companions."
Someone who wants to bury a pet at the St. Francis cemetery would pay only for a veterinarian to cremate the animal. No grave markers are allowed, and volunteers maintain the cemetery grounds.
The burial of Nicole and Minuet was at the behest of Helen Smink, who had chosen the spot beneath the spaniel's feet for their grave. Mrs. Smink, who lives near the church in New Providence, had already buried five dogs elsewhere in the St. Francis cemetery. 
A week later, the red shovel was out again as Mr. French prepared for the burial of Mrs. Roeck's Yorkshire terrier, John Barrymore, who had lived to 19. The Roeck family waited by the garden with a wooden box containing the ashes of John Barrymore, who went by J. B. 
"He was our companion for three generations," Mrs. Roeck said as she and her family sat on a bench before the service and looked through a stack of pictures.
"He was handsome," she added, "an absolute doll."
The Roecks, who live about 20 minutes away in Union, wanted J. B. to be buried at the St. Francis cemetery. "When J. B. was sick, we prayed to St. Francis, and now he's with him," Mrs. Roeck said.
Mrs. Roeck's mother, Margaret Angelo, wiped away tears as she looked at a photograph of J. B. sitting by a Christmas tree. "J. B. used to open his own presents," she said.
The St. Francis pet cemetery is not part of the Accredited Pet Cemetery Society, which sets standards for issues like maintenance of grave decorations and appropriate attire for cemetery workers. And no one should come here for a silk-laced, marble coffin. But for some it is much more important to have a minister preside over their animal's funeral.
"I feel more comfortable knowing that J. B. is buried at a church," Mrs. Roeck added soon after his service. 
The cemetery is named for St. Francis in part because he has long been considered the patron saint of animals. At the cemetery, the statue of St. Francis stands in the middle of the garden and faces the entrance to the church. His arms extend just enough to support the three stone birds that rest upon them. His gaze is fixed on the ground, almost as if he is watching over the animals buried beneath it. 
One of those animals, local legend has it, is that of Leo, the lion whose roar has been introducing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films since 1928.
Apocryphal or not, the Leo story is of use to the St. Francis cemetery in drumming up interest among volunteers to help with the upkeep of the cemetery and pet owners who want the burial services. But when Mr. French mentioned the MGM lion to Mrs. Smink for the second time, she told him she thought it was a myth that Leo's remains were at St. Francis. She had heard someone say that Leo was really buried on his trainer's old farm in Gillette, several miles away.
Chris Christopher, a volunteer who helps maintain the cemetery, says the truth eludes him, too. 
"I don't know where that lion is," Mr. Christopher said. "One of the statues of the dogs over in the garden looks a little like a lion, but that's all I can tell you for sure."
For its part, MGM says the people in New Providence may or may not be barking up the right baobab. Lea Porteneuve, an MGM spokeswoman, said last week that the studio took no position on where Leo was in fact buried. "No one really knows for sure," Ms. Porteneuve said.
For most people, the story is immaterial. What matters is the comfort they achieve by burying their own pets under St. Francis's watchful eye.
"I'm not prepared to tell you whether animals have souls," Mr. French said as he brought his red shovel back into the church. "But I do know that we all end up in the same heaven."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Newtown, Conn.; 
Debate on Developing Old Hospital Site

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: NEWTOWN, Conn. 

 BODY:
ON a 189-acre spread of pastoral land where deer, foxes, pheasant, wild turkey, rabbits and groundhogs thrive under a hunting ban, the defunct state-owned Fairfield Hills Hospital sits forlornly. The 16 massive, deteriorating brick buildings of the former psychiatric center, with a total of 1 million square feet, and several outbuildings are vacant except for one that houses satellite town offices.
 Contracts conveying the land and buildings from the state to the town for a purchase price of $3.9 million have been expected since the allocation was approved by the town voters in June of last year, but there is no deadline. "I thought we would be finished by now," said Herbert C. Rosenthal, Newtown's first selectman, "but I'm optimistic that the lawyers and the Office of Policy and Management will have a contract and a deed by June 30 of 2003." 
 The question is, What then? The potential for developing hundreds of thousands of square feet of offices, hundreds of units of housing, thousands of square feet of retail space, a hotel and other uses has the town deeply divided. Not surprisingly, there is a wide difference of opinion among residents about whether buildings should be torn down and about what kinds of development should be allowed. Some are not swayed by the prospect of substantial tax revenues from commercial and residential development and favor limiting development to open space, a new Town Hall, municipal playing fields and cultural activities in the existing buildings. 
Newtown is a 60-square-mile residential community of 25,000 people, where the average price of a home is $500,000. A recent public opinion poll produced conflicting results. Respondents to questionnaires distributed by The Newtown Bee, a local newspaper, revealed that economic development was generally favored for producing revenues, but options for developing specific commercial projects that would generate such revenues were all met with disfavor.
"Economic development is the biggest point of contention," Mr. Rosenthal said. "It probably would be better for the town and for developers to demolish some buildings and have open land that can be built on. We're pressed for housing." 
With the state's 12th-highest median income, at $90,000 per household, Newtown implemented its own regulation requiring that new multifamily housing contain 20 percent affordable units, but only one complex, River View, is in compliance. "We're not even close to the 10 percent per town that the state wants," Mr. Rosenthal said. 
At the same time, there is resistance to allowing open space to be overrun with development. "Newtown is concerned about housing pressure from too-expensive lower Fairfield County," said Richard A. Harral, principal in the planning firm of Harral Michalowski Associates, which was hired by Newtown in 1999 to come up with a master plan for the property. It will be presented to the town early next year.
"It costs $8,000 a year to educate a child," Mr. Harral said. "Houses don't pay that in taxes. There is also concern for open space and the loss of it through housing." 
Mr. Harral has been working with the Fairfield Hills Committee, appointed by Mr. Rosenthal. He indicated that the master plan would probably designate half the property for municipal, educational, cultural and recreational uses, and most of the rest would be commercial, with minor amounts of housing and small stores. Half the existing buildings would probably be torn down. The town will retain ownership of the land, no matter how the existing buildings and new construction are developed.
THE town has approved issuing bonds to raise $21.8 million to cover removal of asbestos and lead paint, demolition or rehabilitation of some buildings, insurance against unknown environmental liabilities, creation of a new Town Hall on the site, preparing a master reuse plan and securing water rights. The payments would be spread out over three years beginning in 2004, according to Ben Spragg, Newtown's financial director. "Tax increases would be gradual," he said. "$7 million a year accounts for just four-tenths of a mill."
Newtown homeowners pay 33.8 mills, or tax dollars, for every $1,000 of assessed value, while towns it sometimes compares itself with keep taxes low with commercial development. Greenwich, for example, has a mill rate of 10.3, New Canaan, 13.2 and Darien, 14.98, but house prices are extremely high. Some argue that lower house prices in Newtown mitigate the higher tax rate. 
Newtown's state representative, Julia Wasserman, a Republican, said: "In the early 90's, there was a hue and cry for more commercial land in Newtown. Business people have said at public hearings that we need more space for corporate offices and commercial development." 
In 1992, when the hospital closing was decided, the State Legislature established a study committee for disposing of the property. It was then an 800-acre tract with 60 buildings, including the remains of a former farm with a piggery, dairy barn, greenhouses, slaughterhouse, root cellar and a barn for 37 horses of the Governor's Horse Guard. 
Richard Nuclo, director of asset management for the Office of Policy and Management, said: "Through legislation, 350 acres was given to the Department of Agriculture for haying, experimental farming and open space; the Garner Correctional Facility got 114 acres; 22 linear acres were created on both sides of Deep Brook; and various other allocations of land went to the Governor's Horse Guard, a power plant and a new sewer plant. Seventy-five acres were allocated for Wasserman's Way, a new east-west road through the property that connects Route 25 on the west end to the intersection of Interstate 84 and Route 34 on the east end. The hospital remained on its 189 acres." 
Ms. Wasserman said: "People don't realize that they have all that state-owned acreage in open space. The town is correct in purchasing the hospital property, but it can't rush into a finite plan. I would love to see one of the biotech or pharmaceutical companies move into some of the existing buildings."
How the property is developed will be determined by the town's Planning and Zoning Commission after public hearings. Despite mixed use zoning, developers of housing and commercial projects would have to apply for special exceptions, said Elizabeth Stocker, community development director. 
The Harral Michalowski plan synthesizes and embellishes several plans that have been floated over the years. In 1998 the state, unhappy about spending $1.2 million annually to maintain empty property, put out requests for proposals from developers. Three were chosen out of 12 responses.
Becker & Becker in New Canaan turned in a mixed-use plan for preserving all the buildings for municipal offices, a school, 200,000 square feet of offices, 100 units of housing with a 20 percent affordable component, 200 other units restricted to those over age 55 and a regional Y.M.C.A. The plan would have added a swimming pool at the Y.M.C.A., but no other new construction.
Wilder Balter Partners of Westchester proposed an 18-hole golf course and a mix of housing for families and people 55 and older, and a central cluster of about 25,000 square feet with small stores and restaurant space. It called for demolishing all buildings. "They are functionally obsolete," said Robert Wilder, the firm's principal, "and a huge deduction of the value of the property."
Spectrum Skanska of Westchester offered a plan for 575 units of housing for people 55 and older and combination residences and studios for artists and craftsmen. Additional uses would include 45,000 square feet of local retail, a country inn, a children's museum and a choice of three sites on which the town could build a new school. 
A year later, all three proposals were tabled by the state when the town decided it would buy the property rather than lose control to an outside developer. The three developers, who had spent a year and from a few hundred thousand dollars to $1 million each on preparing and presenting their proposals, were not amused. Mitchell C. Hochberg, a partner in Spectrum Skanska, is still smarting from the abrupt cutoff. "After a year the state said never mind, we're selling it to the town," he said.
According to Mr. Nuclo, the state made it clear to developers that the Office of Policy and Management is legally required to offer surplus state property to the town in which it is located and that therefore the developers were taking the assignment at their own risk. "As soon as we heard from Mr. Rosenthal that the town wanted to pick up its option of first refusal, we called the developers and followed up with a letter," he said.
Mr. Wilder argued that the situation was not quite that simple. "The problem was when a town spends three years working with the state to come up with a mixed use zoning ordinance and the state then sends out a request for proposals, you are led to believe the town is not going to buy the property," he said. "The state wanted out in the worst way, and it has not been a winner in this. We offered $9 million."

HEADLINE: Hot Under the Buttoned-Down Collar 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
THE genteel town of Princeton is up to its buttoned-down collar in controversy over redoing its storybook downtown.
 With tempers raised and lawsuits threatened, the borough council last week approved a $13.5 million bond ordinance to finance the biggest downtown development project in this college town in almost 20 years. 
 Like so many older suburban towns facing smart growth issues, Princeton is struggling to retain its village-like character while competing with the lure of giant shopping malls. Unlike other municipalities, however, Princeton is home to the state's most prestigious university, where a symbiotic relationship requires that both the Ivy League school and the patrician town live up to a near impossible standard of taste and excellence.
And so the facelift will not go through without a fight. It was standing room only in the council chambers, where for three hours last Tuesday night the public expressed its opinion on the controversial project that will add a 5 1/2-level parking garage, a 15,000-square-foot public plaza, 77 apartments, a grocery store and 6,000 square feet of retail space to the heart of an already crowded downtown. 
"You have 100-120 people show up at a meeting to tell you how upset they are with this project," said one resident, Mark Freda, who seemed to express the sentiment of the majority of speakers. "You have a petition with over a thousand signatures, you have letters to the editor against it. Why are you still supporting this project as it is presently designed?"
Nonetheless, by the end of the evening, five of the six council members sided with the mayor in approving the financing, saying the development was need not only to ease parking problems but also to take better advantage of two underusedparcels of land in the heart of town. Through parking fees and land leases, the project is expected to pay for itself over the next 25 years, and, according to the mayor, generate additional revenue for the borough in the future.
"This is the last piece of space where we can do anything in town," said Mayor Marvin Reed. "In other towns people buy up older houses, then redevelop the land. We don't do that in Princeton. We can't afford to."
Of course, it is the very fact that it is the last piece of developable land in Princeton Borough that has turned this proposal into the most divisive issue to confront this community in recent history.
Critics of the proposed development have accused the borough council of acting in bad faith by ignoring growing opposition and pushing through a plan, the details of which were largely decided on behind closed doors. The plan, they say, will not solve the town's severe parking shortage, but rather create more traffic and put added pressure on Princeton's already ailing retail community. After last Tuesday's vote, they vowed to fight approval of the development plan itself, which the council is to vote on next month, with the threat of a lawsuit.
But for many, last week's vote signaled the end of a two-year dialogue about what to do with the two borough-owned parking lots on Spring Street between Witherspoon and Tulane Streets. The discussion began in September 2000, when a newly formed civic group, Princeton Future, took up the task of assessing how Princetonians felt about their town. 
"The idea was to assemble the talent in town on a volunteer basis, and figure out a way for people who know things to get together with the neighborhoods so the citizens could be more informed," said Sheldon Sturges, a cochairman of Princeton Future, along with Robert Goheen, a former president of Princeton University, and Robert Geddes, a former dean of the university's architecture school.
Over the next several months, the group met numerous times and held open panel discussions. Along the way, the borough council had contracted through Princeton Future the services of a Philadelphia firm, Brown & Keener, to develop a plan for the Spring Street lots. The plan Princeton Future came back with was called "Madison Square." Backing up to the site of a new public library, the design included a 24,800-square-foot civic square, 15,000 square feet of additional walkways and open space, a 25,000-square-foot marketplace, 18 apartments and a 483-space parking garage.

A Plan Evolved Over Months
Using this blueprint as a working model, the borough council began negotiating the specifics of the plan in closed sessions over the next seven months. Relying on a section of the state's Sunshine Law that allows government bodies to consider financial matters behind closed doors, the council heard proposals by five developers in private, ultimately choosing the design of Nassau HKT Associates, whose principal, Robert Powell, is a former borough councilman.
When the council emerged this June with a project that more than quadrupled the number of apartment units, significantly reduced the size of the public space, and added an extra level to the parking garage, many residents felt they had been sideswiped. One council member, Wendy Benchley, now concedes that the process might have gone more smoothly if the public had been let in on it sooner -- though her qualms did not stop her from approving the financing.
"I felt that the plans themselves and even the finances could have been out in the public domain faster," said Ms. Benchley. "But I also knew we had to negotiate with the developer privately in order to get the best deal we could."
As for the goodwill Princeton Future tried to foster, the end result was just the opposite. Many began seeing the group as an "elitist triumvirate" trying to foist its expertise on local residents.
"Princeton Future was set up for all the right reasons, but by the very nature of how it was set up, it was going to come to all the wrong conclusions," said David Newton, vice president of Palmer Square, the block-long retail center in downtown Princeton.
As a result of the squabbling, a new civic organization was formed, Concerned Citizens of Princeton, which spent the summer gathering signatures seeking a referendum on the proposed development. The group also distributed a survey to 1,000 households, asking residents' opinions of the project. Asked whether the council should approve or abandon the project, only 28 percent of the 670 respondents expressed their approval, 43 percent preferred to abandon it and 29 percent suggested revising the plans, said Herb Hobler, a resident here who developed the poll. On the question, "Do you feel the borough council should move forward without surveying the community?" 74 percent responded "no."
The poll was promptly dismissed by the council as biased when Mr. Hobler refused to disclose the name of the polling expert whom he consulted.
"I'm appalled by the resistance they seem to have to the opposition," said Mr. Hobler. "It doesn't surprise me that if you have a survey that you happen to disagree with the results, you're going to question it. But if they don't like it, then do their own survey."
Which is exactly what many residents have been urging the council to do, in the form of a nonbinding referendum.
"We were told that to get a referendum, we had to have 628 signatures, so we had 25 or 30 people working the streets in the heat of the summer," said Jim Firestone, the chief organizer of the opposition. "Three out of four people we talked to said, 'We don't want that.' "
After collecting almost 1,100 signatures and presenting them to the mayor, the group was told last month that because the land was being developed under the state's Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, previously reserved for blighted areas, the borough was exempt from a binding referendum usually required before financing a bond, although nothing precludes a nonbinding vote. The property in question, formerly the site of a PSE&G gasworks plant, is considered a brownfield, where the gas company is currently removing coal tar residue. 
"You have this prime property in the middle of town," said William Potter, a lawyer here. "To find it blighted just because PSE&G is cleaning it up, then to say, 'We have a trump card and you can't have your referendum,' that's not what the law and the constitution intended."
Mr. Potter said he warned council members that they "could end up in court, tying up this project for many years."
As the lone voice on the council against the proposed development, Roger Martindell has encouraged the citizens' grassroots efforts while lobbying his colleagues to slow the process and hold an advisory referendum to measure the pulse of the community.
"We don't have to run off to lawyers to see if we should seek input from the public," said Mr. Martindell, a lawyer himself. "It's controversial, there are a lot of people on both sides, and nobody can count noses. Shouldn't the voters have a say on something they're going to have to live with for the rest of their lives?"
The original impetus for redeveloping the two parcels of land was to find a solution to what most people agree is a severe parking problem in town. Between the demands of local residents, the estimated 1,000 restaurant and shop employees, spillover from the university and tourists, nearly all the metered parking spaces on the street are constantly occupied, as well much of the existing garage space. 
The town's merchants have been feeling the pinch, particularly in the last seven months since PSE&G closed the 189-space parking lot to clean it up. In surveying 30 area merchants, Mr. Firestone found that business has been off about 25 percent compared with the same period last year. The first casualty of the parking crunch was Pyramid Books, the used bookstore on Witherspoon Street that went out of business a couple of weeks ago, with Witherspoon Bread Company threatening to be next.

Stores Fear for Their Lives
Shopkeepers fear that disruption from construction of the development, which is being planned in two phases and could tie up the downtown for the next three years, will find more stores following in Pyramid's footsteps.
"If they do go through with this project, we'll see a lot of mom-and-pop stores go out of business, and that includes me," said Ray Wadsworth, owner of the Flower Market for the last 24 years, who joined a dozen other merchants last Tuesday night to oppose the project.
As the situation has become more critical, parking has risen to the top of the political agenda here, with the project becoming a leading campaign issue.
"I've been elected three times now and the last time I ran I made no bones about it that I was determined to work on this problem and find a solution, as I was elected to do," said Mayor Reed. He stopped short of the kinds of comments that one fellow council member, Peggy Karcher, was chastised for earlier this fall after she claimed she had a mandate to see this project through.
The new garage will have 500 parking spaces; however, after the loss of the two surface parking lots, allocating spaces for the new apartments and retail space, and giving over the 85 spaces promised to Princeton Township in front of the new library going up adjacent to the development, the borough will end up with about 60 new parking spots.
"They're going to create more parking, but they're also going to create a need for more parking, so what is the net gain?" asked Mitch Forest, the owner of Forest Jewelers on Nassau Street.
Alternative solutions to the parking problem have included creating a lot on the outskirts of town and shuttling workers, tapping into the underused space in the Palmer Square parking garage, opening up more on-street parking, or even, as one speaker suggested, putting the money toward building bike lanes throughout town. Mr. Martindell said he might have voted for the proposal if it had addressed these long-range planning issues.
"If we had included any of these alternatives, the project would have probably won my vote," he said. "Instead, we've got a garage that's too big, that will cause a major disruption and that will adversely affect the quality of life in town. We're going to end up being more like a downtown Trenton or New Brunswick, and not a town I look forward to living in."
Notably quiet throughout most of the discussions has been Princeton University, except in the role its two former leaders have played in Princeton Future. Often criticized for not doing more for the borough of Princeton, the largest landowner in town has again come under fire by residents like Bob Zagoria, a Princeton alumnus, who calls the university the "elephant in the room that nobody seems to see."
"The university has said it has a vested interest in the future of this town," said Mr. Zagoria. "When they recruit professors or students, they're selling this town as part of the attraction. They have an $8 billion endowment. They're the obvious party to step in and help when the town is hurting."
As a charitable tax-exempt institution, much of the university's property cannot be taxed by the borough. But Pam Hersh, Princeton's director of community and state affairs, said the university was still the biggest taxpayer in town by virtue of the numerous properties it has on the tax rolls. In addition to the $2 million in taxes and $1 million in sewer fees that Ms. Hersh said the university paid the borough each year, she noted that Princeton had provided large gifts for major projects in town, like the new library and borough hall landscaping, that average a quarter-million dollars a year. The borough has also recently renegotiated the university's voluntary contribution, which will rise from the current level of $100,000 a year to about $400,000 in the next five years.

University Defends Its Role
"I'd be the first one to come down on the university if I thought they didn't care, but we do a really good job," said Ms. Hersh, who questioned the idea that the town is hurting. "This is a healthy town and it's healthy because we contribute about a billion dollars in economic activity here. If we weren't here, it wouldn't be so healthy." As to tapping into its endowment funds, Ms. Hersh said that money went toward financial aid programs. 
"People look at our endowment as though it is their endowment," she said, "but we happen to be serving a higher purpose here. We're here to educate kids, not to build municipal garages"
In addition to the garage, the 77 proposed apartments are also stirring up controversy. With 12 units being designated affordable housing, the apartments have been praised as a chance to add more diversity to Princeton's population. Six of the units will be set aside for low-income and six for moderate-income tenants. The rest are expected to rent for about $3,000 a month. Mr. Firestone said promoting this project in the name of diversity was absurd.
"With this project, we're going to lose the diversity of this town," he said. "Because when the restaurants and shops start closing, all those low-income workers who now walk to work are going to have to move out of town."
While he is personally unable to afford a court action, Mr. Firestone said others were talking about putting their money together to file a lawsuit seeking a referendum.
"I don't think this is over," he said. "With people going out of business one after another, nobody's talking about walking away. Would you be willing to walk away if you thought your rights were being taken away from you?"

HEADLINE: Lighting Up The Stage, The World 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART

DATELINE: PURCHASE 

 BODY:
JENNIFER SCHRIEVER saw "Phantom of the Opera," her first Broadway play, as a teenager, and what bowled her over was not the acting or the music or the chandelier but the lighting. "I connected with it right away," she said.
 Immediately, she said, "I knew this was something I wanted to do." 
 She experimented with lights at Ridgewood High School in New Jersey, spotlighting the honor society inductees and "hitting the drum and players" of the jazz band with orange lights surrounded by deep blues. "Really sexy for high school," she said. 
Now, as a junior in lighting design at Purchase College, she is one of a few dozen students learning a skill that is more and more in demand, not just in show business but by museums, restaurants, cruise ships and department stores. 
Still, because the Purchase program is part of its Conservatory of Theater Arts and Film Department, many students have their hearts set on show business, where jobs, especially in New York, are "extraordinarily tight," said Daniel Hennesian, the conservatory director. That in fact is Ms. Shriever's dream: Broadway, Off Broadway, the opera or the ballet -- anything, as long as it's in New York. Others, like Sarissa Michaud, are leaning toward something more specific, in her case, dance. 
Lighting design occupies a peculiar niche -- an art that is ephemeral and intangible, that almost never exists by itself.
"It's the air we breathe," said Michael J. Cesario, head of graduate studies at the Theater Arts Department. "You know how some days there's electricity in the air? Or the reverse? You can show that with lighting."
Lighting design has been taught at Purchase since the early 1970's, shortly after the college's creation, a time when rock concerts, with their wild, pulsing lights, were expanding its possibilities.
Bill Mintzer, a Broadway designer, founded the program with ideas that are still central to it: that lighting is as important to a show as acting or sets and that lighting designers should know not only theater arts inside and out but should also be able to articulate their feelings about a show.
Nevertheless, audiences rarely notice the lighting. They leave a show talking about the actors, the music, the sets or costumes but hardly ever the lighting.
"The only time our stuff is noticed is when it's bad," said David Grill, a Purchase teacher and graduate who recently completed the lighting design for Radio City Music Hall's "Christmas Spectacular."
But bad lighting, he said, can turn beauties into hags. Skillful work -- perhaps amber combined with other warm colors -- can remove wrinkles and years from an actor's face, he said. Lighting can also can create storms or sunshine. It can move the play seamlessly and quickly through time and space.
"It's telling the audience what to look at and what to feel," said Mr. Cesario. "How do you help a character be happy or sad? What color is the nighttime sky? Most people say blue. But is it blue and lavender and black and puffy gray with red in the distance? Is a sunlit room warm amber? Or bright and sharp?"
Only a handful of universities offer lighting design as an academic degree program and at nearly all, it is a graduate degree. But Purchase offers both bachelor's and master's degrees, which are nearly identical. There are six lighting design professors, most of whom also work on Broadway or at the opera or ballet and who have several Emmys and Tonys among them.
Currently, there are 30 undergraduates and two graduates majoring in lighting design. Graduate degrees are for students unfortunate enough to have chosen another school first, said Mr. Cesario.
That approach is a bit controversial among theater academicians.
"You put kids 18, 19, 20 immediately into lighting design and they're too young," said Ming Cho Lee, chairman of the Design Department Yale University School of Drama. "You need to study the history of architecture, the history of art and music and literature. You need to know why the plays were written, what is the content, how it relates to society. So you need economics and political science. Otherwise you're just doing lighting as spectacle."
Mr. Cesario has heard that before. It still makes him raise his voice.
"Yes, we take 18- and 19-year-olds!" he shouted. "Yes, we assume that at 18 they're grounded. Can 18-year-olds make a choice about their life's work? We say they can. Can a 20-year-old understand the emotional depths of plays? We say they can. Not just any 18-year-olds. We won't take any, 'Hey, that looks like fun!' kids. But the kids we graduate with bachelor's degrees are ready for jobs and when others are still in graduate school, they'll be out there working."
Six or seven undergraduates nodded knowingly as he spoke. Purchase undergraduates begin to study lighting design in their sophomore year. They study the tools: color theory, electricity, mechanics and technique. They use a lab with about 50 lighting devices -- lights, dimmers, a computer to control them. They use mannequins to learn about the effects of angles, shadows and degrees of brightness and then transpose what they have learned to performers.
Out of the lab, they are steeped in the liberal arts of the theater: philosophy, history, plays as literature and costume and design. They also learn to write and to articulate their opinions and feelings about a work. "They have to be able to sell a director on their ideas," said Mr. Cesario. "They don't just walk in to the director and say, 'Tell me what you want.' They say, 'This is what I want.' They know the play with their gut and intellect. So if the director yells: 'Give me more blue!' they know it's odd icy crystal blue, not a soft blue."
They are taught that the core of the lighting decision for each play is a personal image, which should be concrete but should not necessarily come directly from the play. The image that Ms. Michaud, 21, chose for "A Streetcar Named Desire" was a delicate Faberge egg clutched and gradually crushed by the sweaty hand of a laborer. As the play progresses and Blanche DuBois slides into insanity, the color of the lighting, like the sweat-dissolved dye of the egg, becomes washed out and faded.
Ken Posner, a Purchase graduate who designed lighting for the Broadway show "Hairspray," said he was not upset that the actors and musicians and set and costume designers get all the applause. "The one occupation in theater that's fairly egoless is the lighting designer," he said.
But Ms. Michaud does not agree. "That's why a lot of lighting designers are cocky," she said. "If the lights aren't on, nobody's going to see you."

The Tax ClockIs Ticking. Quick: Pick a Charity.

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LOOK at the calendar. It's almost the last minute, and you still haven't decided which charitable groups will receive your end-of-year checks. You have this week to do a little research.
 Baby boomers aren't the most generous generation, but they're not bad. Statistics from Independent Sector, an association of nonprofit groups in Washington, show that people aged 40 to 49 gave, on average, $1,827 in 2000, the most recent numbers available. That's a bit more than the amount from younger age groups, but not as much as from 50- to 64-year-olds, a mix of boomers and people who were born just before and during World War II. They gave $1,912, on average. 
 But boomers are also pressed for time, or at least we complain that we are. So we often give without checking to see if the charity is worthy of our money. Luckily, there are organizations that do the research for us, and the one I found easiest to use is the Charity Rating Guide and Watchdog Report from the American Institute of Philanthropy in Chicago (www.charitywatch.org; 773 529-2300).
Using various criteria, the institute gives hundreds of charities letter grades, from A+ to F, making the process as simple as looking at your child's report card. And like the teacher's note that accompanies that card, the guide also explains how an organization ended up with its grade.
My dad died a couple of years ago from a type of lung cancer, so I'm curious about cancer charities. The guide breaks down charities by category; the cancer group has 23. Of those, five received A's, six got B's, two C's, two D's and eight F's. Of the A's, two received the highest grade of A+: the Cancer Research Institute of Manhattan and the Foundation for the Children's Oncology Group, now called the National Childhood Cancer Foundation of Bethesda, Md.
The guide measures the percentage of a charity's expenses that are spent on program services instead of on fund-raising or administration. Usually, the higher the percentage spent on services, the higher the grade. Both the A+ cancer charities had more than 90 percent of their expenses going to program services; the guide says the percentage should be 60 percent or more.
Along with that, their cost of rasing money was low, $10 or less to raise $100. The guide says that cost should be $35 or less. One of the cancer charities that received an F, the National Cancer Center of Plainview, N.Y., had 7 percent of its expenses going toward services and spent $81 to raise $100, according the the guide.
Of the more than 400 charities rated by the guide, 155 received A's, including 26 at A+; there were 58 F's.
Jeanne Gillert, the grants manager of the foundations of the Zarrow families in Tulsa, Okla., that were in the oil field services business, said she uses the guide all the time.
"It's a quick-and-dirty way to easily look and see how an agency is doing and how they are doing in their category," she said. "You can look at services to youth and see how the Boy Scouts compare to the Girl Scouts." (The girls get an A-, but the boys get a C for reasons I'll get into below. It's not as simple as girls rule, boys drool.)
Ms. Gillert said the guide is just one resource for her. She also looks at a charity's Internal Revenue Service Form 990, which gives a more complete breakdown of revenue and expenses. These forms, also used by the guide to arrive at its grades, are available at www.guidestar.com. Another resource is the site of the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, at www.give.org, which also evaluates charities and breaks down their numbers.
Pat Nolan, program director of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, a volunteer service organization in Washington, said she has been using the institute's guide for about five years.
"I can use the guide and tell our president, 'This is a very good group,' " she said. "I could also steer her away from a particular group if it didn't do well in the guide."
THIS is where the Boy Scouts' problem comes in. Just because a group received a poor letter grade doesn't mean it is unworthy. The guide reduces an otherwise good grade if a group has what the guide deems as large financial reserves (the idea being that other charities need the money more). The Boy Scouts would have received an A, but got that C because they had four years of reserves. 
But Ms. Gillert said a lot of assets aren't necessarily bad. "I like to see agencies with three years of reserves for times just like these in the economy," she said. "That way, they are stable and can ride the ups and downs that come with fund-raising."
Sara E. Melendez, the chief executive of Independent Sector, also urged caution when using a guide.
"It may not be a compete picture," she said. "A group may have invested in computers one year, so administrative costs have gone up, but their services haven't changed."
That's why donors should do more active research of charities, she said.
"Go visit them and offer to volunteer," she said. "There is no better way to know what an organization is like than by volunteering with them. You get to know them and see if the money is wisely spent."
Of course, that bumps into our lament that we're too busy. Nothing is ever easy, even giving our money away.

From President to Prof

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLL 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK 

 BODY:
THERE is grade inflation. Then there is inflation.
 At least that is the way some former colleagues see the recent appointment of Francis L. Lawrence, the former president of Rutgers, who will be returning to the classroom in the spring with a salary of $225,000. 
 Dr. Lawrence weathered many storms during his 12-year tenure -- including a controversy over remarks in 1995 linking genetics to test scores -- and now he faces another.
"This is obscene, a travesty, and a slap in the face to the whole Rutgers family," said William C. Dowling, a professor of English at the university. "Fran Lawrence does not have a publication record that would earn him a teaching job at Rutgers in even our weakest department."
According to the university, when Dr. Lawrence returns to teach and lecture here and at the Camden campus he will hold the title "university professor" and head the Center for Organizational Development and Leadership Roundtable within the communications department, where he will organize forums among leaders in education, business, health care and government.
Not that Dr. Lawrence is a stranger to the classroom. During his time here he presented guest lectures, though he never taught a course. Before coming to Rutgers, Dr. Lawrence -- who has degrees from St. Louis University and Tulane University -- held the title of distinguished professor at Tulane, where he was provost, academic vice president, dean of the graduate school and taught 17-century French literature.
"By his own choosing he did not teach a full course because he knew that given the demands of a full presidency he would miss classes and that would be unfair to the students," said Mark Maben, a spokesman for Rutgers.
Others on campus were less generous.
Professor Dowling complained: "Letting Fran Lawrence teach a course in leadership is like bringing Dr. Kevorkian in to run your hospice operation at a local hospital. He is notoriously the worst at the thing he will be teaching."
Thomas J. Figueira, a professor of classics and ancient history and who heads the university's faculty association, told The Philadelphia Inquirer: "He is almost entirely unqualified for the position. He has none of the credentials you would expect for a top-line scholar."
Dr. Lawrence was on vacation and unavailable for comment, according to Mr. Maben.
As president, he earned $287,000 a year and received a $75,000 stipend for fund-raising activities. Dr. Lawrence, who weathered growing discontent among the members of the faculty, stepped down in February when his Republican supporters lost power in Trenton and new Democratic governor and a changed Legislature took over.
There are currently 17 professors at Rutgers who earn more than $200,000 a year, Mr. Maben said, with the highest paid being Kenneth Breslauer of the chemistry department.
To be sure, when Dr. Lawrence left he was not without his supporters, who pointed out that under his leadership the university's fund-raising increased nearly fivefold, faculty research almost tripled and the percentage of minority students doubled.
Last week, Gustav Friedrich, dean of the Rutgers School of Communication, Information and Library Studies, praised Dr. Lawrence's work and said the students would benefit greatly.
"He has many decades of teaching experience," Dr. Friedrich said, "and he has a wealth of experience in leadership, so he will bring a lot of talent to the students."

It's Not Too Late to Reinvent Your Own Wheel

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
 HERMINIA IBARRA, the author of "Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career," argues that economic, social and technological forces will continue to encourage midcareer professionals to reinvent themselves. Following are excerpts from a telephone interview in Paris, where she lives. WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. You say that more people are reinventing themselves now than two decades ago. How do you know that?

A. We don't have a good count. Anecdotally, most people have seen people around them make pretty big changes in what they do for a living. We just don't have the comparative data. But I think there are strong economic forces and some social forces behind this trend. Economically, we've been through a real boom economy. Until very recently, people haven't been as focused on mere survival. It's the classic hierarchy of needs. When your economic needs are satisfied, you move into the realm of self-actualization: "What would I really like to do?"
Another effect of the economic boom was that people saw other people doing new and different things. That encouraged them to give it a try: "If so and so has made a much more fulfilling life as a free agent, maybe I don't have to stay stuck in something I don't see as fulfilling."

Q. What are the social forces behind the trend?

A. Maybe because we spend more time at work, people expect more and more out of it. Maybe 30 years ago, I put in my hours whether the job was interesting or not. People nowadays expect much more out of their jobs in terms of fulfillment and challenge. Yet at the same time, they want to strike a better work-life balance. Another aspect is that the employment contract has broken down over the past 15 years. Employers are saying: "Look out for yourselves. Maybe we can better equip you for the next job. But don't expect a job for life."

Q. Is professional career change largely an American phenomenon?

A. Not at all. In Continental Europe, the social contract has been strong. Companies have had somewhat less freedom to downsize until recently, but now that is breaking down. The United Kingdom has been closest to the American model, but I'm seeing a lot of interest in this subject here in France. Reinvention isn't as easy to do here as it is in the United States.

Q. Why is reinvention easier in the United States?

A. The Americans have a culture that says reinvention is good. It's a place where you want to create a new life. That has not been the history in Europe. Here the school system is different and institutions are different. Historically, people have been encouraged to stick to the path they choose early in life, in high school. But that has been breaking down.

Q. What is the intellectual contribution of your book?

A. I would say there are two major contributions. One is that when you're making a very big change, there is a period when you're truly in between. You're exploring many possibilities but you're not wedded to any, including your own job. There is a limbo-like period.
The other major contribution, and I would rank this higher than the first, is that the way we make progress is by experimenting about what I call "possible selves." It's not that self-reflection or self-assessment is useless. But a lot of times the only way we learn about ourselves is by doing, by testing. We may have an idea of what it's like to become a teacher at age 40 and develop that in our minds and take tests that show our aptitude. But all that means nothing until we actually try it.
So my most important argument is: Do not try to figure it all out before you make a move. Use small steps. You can't make a big move in the dark. You need more information. And the only actionable information comes from experimenting and interacting with people in that area you're exploring.

Q. Is the trend toward career reinvention permanent?

A. I think it's a trend we're going to continue to see. When I started this project in early 1999, everybody said what a great time for this topic. Of course, that was a time when people were making changes to take advantage of the incredible economy. Over the past year or two, people tell me it's a great time for this book because the economy has sunk to these depths. The economic factors seem to cancel each other out.
I think there are some underlying forces having to do with the knowledge economy and globalization that will continue to push this trend. People expect to get a lot out of work, and they want to do it increasingly on their own terms.
Technology is another major force. People have information about and exposure to different possibilities. There is much more information available online, for example. How many people do you know who work from their homes today compared with 15 years ago?

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
In Pennsauken, Winners and Losers

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN 

 BODY:
AT first glance, this faded township of about 36,000 made up largely of homes that sprang up in the prosperous years after World War II -- would hardly seem like a place where someone would want to sink $24 million.
 But that is exactly what James B. Kennedy, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, is doing -- even after he said, "If you are at all familiar with Pennsauken, it's a dump." 
 Nonetheless, last month the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority approved $24 million for development of an arena here to seat from 5,000 to 7,000 spectators, which is expected to cost about $65 million. The remaining $41 million is expected to come from bonds issued by the Camden County Improvement Authority.
At a time when more and more cities view stadiums and arenas as a panacea for impoverished urban cores, the selection of Pennsauken -- situated on the Delaware River between Camden and Trenton -- is puzzling to some, particularly with the state committed to resuscitating neighboring Camden with a $175-million infusion and the gaze of two state-appointed officials. 
"If you are going to have an arena, you should put it in the largest city in the area," said Ali Sloan-El, a Camden City Councilman. "It only makes sense."
But an arena in Camden did not fit in with the plans of George Norcross III -- widely regarded as the political boss of South Jersey and a close ally of Governor McGreevey -- who has for years been shopping for a place to house a minor league hockey franchise. Mr. Norcross, an executive with the Commerce Bank, could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Sloan-El is not the only person to question the selection of Pennsauken as the site of what is being called the South Jersey Civic and Conference Center, an arena with other rooms for meetings and other events.
Development of a 35-acre site here -- bounded by a labyrinth of highways made up of State Routes 90 and 73 and U.S. Route 130 -- would mean the uprooting of the Pennsauken Mart, a shabby collection of 150 stores. The Can-Can, a strip club, and the South Jersey Expo Center, would also go.
"It would do better in a depressed place like Camden, which needs as much enhancement as it can get," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
State Senator Diane Allen, a Republican whose district includes Pennsauken, said she would be pleased if things worked out, though "I haven't seen any drawings or heard any specifics."
But Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg, a Republican from Sussex County who is a vocal opponent of spending state funds for sports or entertainment projects, questioned the need for a minor league hockey arena given the economic climate. "If Mr. Norcross wanted to spend his own money to build it, I'd be all for it," said Mr. Gregg.
Then, even more sarcastically, Mr Gregg continued: "I admire his creativity, getting all that money from C.R.D.A. I'm stunned that the people of Atlantic County aren't wondering why that money isn't going to build roads or schools there."
For now, there is no tenant for the proposed center other than a hockey team, and the vendors at Pennsauken Mart have questioned whether the arena is needed, particularly when the price is their livelihoods.
"I've been here 14 years and this is the first time the Mart has been 100 percent occupied that I can see," Gary Belfus of M&M Lock at the mart said one recent Sunday morning. "We have a wonderful clientele here and there is all this free property nearby in Camden for an arena. I don't understand, except they view the mart as downscale. This business has been in the family for 50 years and lots of kids have gone to college on it."
Not that Pennsauken was Mr. Norcross's first choice for a hockey team. Initially, he focused on Lawnside, an historic middle-class black community. State Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Lawnside, and his brother, Mark, who is the town's mayor, were both pushing a site on the edge of town. But residents did not want the disruptions. Then the campus of Camden County College in Gloucester Township was considered but dismissed as being too far from major highways.
While Mr. Norcross was looking for a location, various groups in Camden lobbied for the arena, though they said their interest was summarily dismissed. "This is George Norcross, and he wanted it somewhere else, so that is where the politicians in his pocket will put it," Mr. Sloan-El charged.
Merchants at the Pennsauken Mart have been presented with an alternative location on the busy Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Camden, part of which was bulldozed before the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 2000 so that visitors passing through would not be greeted with a scarred landscape.
Camden's city attorney, Christine Tucker, said the city would go along with any plan to attract businesses, which have been fleeing for 40 years. "Our residents just don't have many places to shop," said Ms. Tucker.
While questions have arisen about the location of the arena and its potential for success, the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority as well as the Camden County Improvement Authority seem to have no such qualms. "We looked for funding in many ways, but until the C.R.D.A. money came through, I don't think we could have done it," said Philip P. Rowan, executive director of the improvement authority.
The $24 million grant for the Pennsauken arena is the largest amount that the agency has spent outside Atlantic City -- for what Mr. Kennedy characterized as "a dump."
"I think Mr. Kennedy regrets that statement," said John J. Tarditi Jr., a Haddonfield borough commissioner and Commerce Bank executive who is a partner with Mr. Norcross in the hockey franchise. "But what is good about the Pennsauken site is that it is adjacent to so many major roadways."
While most of those lobbying for the arena would certainly not characterize Pennsauken -- at least publicly -- as a dump, they do say the area qualifies for outside assistance.
"We consider Pennsauken part of the urban core, said Mr. Rowan. "It is not just an inner-ring suburb, but a place with 50-year-old housing and industrial and commercial areas that need redevelopment."
Pennsauken itself has hired a consultant, Public Solutions Inc. of Haddonfield, to help determine how to redevelop the non-residential sections of town. It hopes to eventually refurbish some areas along the Delaware north of Camden, but first wants to concentrate on the area of Pennsauken Mart, said Louis S. Bezich, the president of Public Solutions and an ally of Mr. Norcross.
"The demographics are just right there for this kind of arena," said Mr. Bezich. "Certainly this is a positive for Pennsauken. We have figured it would bring in $1.5 million a year in jobs and contracts. And though there would be a loss of some tax revenue for the public project, it would make the redevelopment of the surrounding site for offices, housing, restaurants, maybe even a hotel that much more attractive."
It is Mr. Bezich's use of the word "demographics" that burns in the ear of opponents like Mr. Sloan-El, who scoffs at using funds intended to for inner cities to build a hockey arena that will primarily cater to middle- and upper middle-class suburbanites.
"Do you think there will be many African-American or Latino construction jobs there?" asked Mr. Sloan-El. "Do you think it will cater to those patrons?"
Defending the hockey team, Mr. Rowan said that "you need an anchor tenant for these arenas."
He added: "If it weren't for George Norcross's hockey team, we wouldn't have that. But it will only account for 11 percent of the uses. There will be conferences and small conventions and scholastic sports events and concerts."
Mr. Rowan's optimism about the profitability of an arena here is not shared by everyone. Dr. Hughes of Rutgers said that at best the arena would be a money-losing attraction for other businesses.
"The Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, for instance, is not self-supportive, and we have no other similar arenas to compare it to," he said. "Even the Meadowlands development. The best you can say is that it brought other office buildings to Secaucus and enhanced its image somewhat."
But Jeffrey Nash, the Democratic director of the Camden County freeholder board and an ally of Mr. Norcross, said the region needed its own arena.
"Every time there is a big high school basketball game or an indoor track championship, it always goes to Newark or New Brunswick or Elizabeth, maybe sometimes to Atlantic City," Mr. Nash said. "When Camden had its great basketball team a couple of years ago with Dujuan Wagner and they played Roman Catholic High School from Philadelphia, they had to do it at Temple University because there was nothing that could hold it here. Graduations, school concerts, gymnastics meets, even local board meetings should have a place to go. I am sure hockey will be a big attraction."
Yet the record of how minor league indoor professional teams have fared would seem to undercut such confidence. Attendance at the Sovereign Bank Arena where the Trenton Titans, a minor league hockey team, play has declined. In 1999. the Titans' first season, more than 7,000 fans attended each game; so far this year only about 5,600 have come. The Boardwalk Bullies, Atlantic City's minor league hockey team, attracts fewer than 3,000 spectators a game.
Other sports have done even worse. The Trenton Shooting Stars of the International Basketball League, despite a winning record, disbanded after two seasons because of sparse attendance. The Lightning, Trenton's entry in the Indoor Professional Football League, ceased operations after only five games in 2001.
Still, the plan to raze Pennsauken Mart and move it to the Admiral Wilson Boulevard is a notion that has intrigued Mr Rowan, who would like to see someone take over an abandoned 15-acre parcel. To try to make this happen, Mr. Rowan said he was to meet with Eliot Kattan, the mart's owner, though Mr. Kattan's tenants are skeptical.
"This is a good business here," said Rita Ponomarev, who has owned Rita's Candies at the Pennsauken Mart for six years. "We work hard. But what can I do if they close us down? Nothing."
However, Mr. Nash, the freeholder director, had a lower opinion of the Pennsauken Mart -- with shops featuring bargain electronics, clothing, knick-knacks and food stalls connected by a series of dingy corridors. He noted that while there were a lot of good businesses in the shopping center, there had also been problems there that required police assistance.
"And I'm not sure we would need the tattoo parlor or head shops," he added.
Mr. Rowan was a bit more sympathetic.
"I grew up in Camden, and a great day as a teenager was to go to the Pennsauken Mart," he said. "Even now, I go there to Cass's Soft Pretzels. I buy half a dozen and when I get home, my wife sees four-and-a-half left and says, 'What happened?' So I'm hoping a lot of these people will want to come to Camden."

Dances With Tastebuds

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
TRYING to come up with a drink that holds the holidays in a glass is a tall order.
 I've never been sold on eggnog, to me a nauseating idea from its name on down to the nutmeg. The fact that you can buy it in supermarkets, in dairy cases, like a quart of brunch omelets, doesn't help. 
 But Champagne -- what's not to like a lot? It pops; it bubbles; it knows how to work a glass. It acts like a party guest. And Champagne cocktails can be an improvement on the drink, which is strangely banal after a flute or two, like beauty without any social backup. 
A midpriced bottle of Champagne or a similar sparkling wine, $18 or so, is a useful economy too, served as kir royales, with the addition of a fruit liqueur like creme de cassis or creme de framboise. You can look for less likely, more exotic flavors, like creme de peche, which is peach, or creme de mure, blackberry. It's a nice touch to have a bar stocked with an interesting variety. With white wine, they make a good rotation of aperitifs year-round.
The standard Champagne cocktail is Champagne poured over a sugar cube soaked in Angostura bitters. The drink dates back to the 19th century and had a heyday in the 1930's. A variant with Cognac was called the Gloria Swanson in the late 1940's, shortly before she played Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard." The drink, besides being Ms. Swanson's calling card, was also known in other circles as the king's ruin, named for the society cafe and hotel bar habits of deposed European royalty. You feel lightheaded without the crown anyway -- why not drink all day?
The diamond fizz is Champagne with the juice of a lemon and a teaspoon of sugar. The black velvet adds Guinness stout. My favorite, the stratosphere (who wouldn't try it to find out?), calls for creme Yvette, which is produced from Parma violets and turns out a purple cocktail. You garnish it with cloves.
At Craft, Tom Colicchio's ingredient-fanatical restaurant at 43 East 19th Street in New York, the house drink is a Champagne cocktail that is seasonal like the food.
During the fall and winter, Matthew MacCartney, the beverage director, mixes Champagne with cubes of Bartlett pear, bathed briefly in a pear liqueur. The taste, as simple as something perfectly ripe, is fresher than the sum of its parts.
"You don't want to overcomplicate it," Mr. MacCartney said. "You don't want to cover up its taste. Adding pear gives the drink an extra subtlety, more aroma, and it's pleasing to the eye."
Craft claims that if you make the cocktail correctly, the pear will "dance" in the glass.
For a holiday drink, how much happier can you get?

CHAMPAGNE COCKTAIL
From Craft

1 teaspoon fresh Bartlett pear, cut into 1/4-inch dice and macerated in pear liqueur, to cover (Craft uses Belle de Brillet.)
5 ounces Champagne.

1. Peel, seed and dice 1 pear into equal 1/4-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a plastic container, and pour in enough pear liqueur to cover. Let the pear macerate in the refrigerator for 2 hours (not more, or the cubes will become oversaturated). If the pear is properly macerated, the cubes will dance in the glass.

2. When ready to serve, spoon about 1 teaspoon of macerated pear into the bottom of a Champagne flute. Pour Champagne slowly into the flute (Craft uses a Riedel Restaurant Series glass, with more of a wineglass shape), because it tends to bubble up in reaction to the pears. Serve.

Yield: 1 serving.

How Wal-Mart Changed the Game

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
 LAST WEEK, FAO Inc., owner of F.A.O. Schwarz and Zany Brainy toy stores, warned of possible bankruptcy, Blockbuster sharply reduced its 2002 profit estimate, Best Buy cut its profit forecast and Circuit City warned of a loss. Among the reasons, the common denominator was Wal-Mart Stores, which has been moving aggressively into toys, consumer electronics and DVD's, and selling them more cheaply than these stores do. So, what should have been the strongest part of their year, the Christmas selling season, has ranged from disappointing to disastrous. Claes Fornell, a business professor and director of the National Quality Research Center at the University of Michigan, and the chairman of the CFI Group, a consulting firm on customer satisfaction, talked last week about Wal-Mart's latest impact. JULIE FLAHERTY

Q. Buying a digital television or laptop at Wal-Mart was inconceivable a few years ago. How did that change?

A. Three things have changed. The first one is that information is more readily available now to evaluate these products and to know more about them, primarily via the Internet. Second, the question is really what service is here, and from our research it does seem that the service one gets from the personnel in the specialized store is not as useful or good as it was 10 years ago. Third is that prices for all these items have come down drastically, so they are no longer quite as significant in the basket of things we buy.

Q. Specialty retailers have long tried to distinguish themselves with better service than places like Wal-Mart. Do consumers not care about service now, or is Wal-Mart offering better service than it once did?

A. At the University of Michigan, we measure customer satisfaction in something called the American Customer Satisfaction Index. When we started in 1994, a high-service retailer, Nordstrom, for example, had very high customer satisfaction scores, whereas at the other end of the spectrum we probably had Kmart and Federated parent of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other department stores . Now everybody, including Wal-Mart, scores about the same in customer satisfaction. Even Nordstrom seems to have lost its edge. So it's more difficult to compete when everyone is offering the same level of service. Kmart is still below the others, and so is Federated, but not by a whole lot. Even Wal-Mart has dropped a little bit.
Everybody is becoming more similar. There is a tendency toward sameness. And that will only help the biggest player, that will only help Wal-Mart, because of their size and their power in negotiations with suppliers. Wal-Mart is also offering good service in terms of convenience -- it's easy to get to, it's easy to park -- and selection. We shouldn't discard those two things.

Q. What is likely to happen to Blockbuster, which seemed surprised by the extent of the discounting that has made DVD's almost as affordable to buy as to rent?

A. Here we have another fairly extreme situation. The marginal costs -- the extra cost of developing another DVD -- is almost nothing. Whenever you have high-level competition, no uniqueness, and you have marginal costs diving quickly toward zero, it's a lethal combination, because it drives profit margins also to zero. And it's very, very difficult to get out of. So Blockbuster is in for a very, very tough ride.

Q. Does Wal-Mart face danger in selling too much?

A. If they venture into areas that are different, where they need to pay more attention to customization, more personal service, it would be risky. You look back on Sears and others that have tried to get into areas of financial advice, tax advice, stock advice -- those are very different markets. It would be risky to pursue things where they don't benefit from economies of scale. I don't know if they can sell cars, for example. But the step from computers to cars? Maybe not totally impossible.

Q. If specialty retailers can't compete on price, how can they fight back?

A. We've seen this before. If you go back 50 years ago or so, we had the same kind of discussion: Will specialty retailers be driven out? And many of them were, of course, by the big retail chains like Kresge and Sears. But some managed to stay in business. These days, they may have an even tougher time. We know they can't compete on price, but can they compete on service and quality? That's very doubtful. I'm not so sure they can attract the high-quality staff, because the margins are not there to pay for a compensation that such people would demand. They can fight back by having unique merchandise and catering to a segment of the population that is smaller, obviously, but that appreciates that uniqueness. It's pretty obvious that it may be doable to be small, and difficult to be medium-sized, where the big players will squeeze the medium player out. Just look at Kmart being squeezed between Wal-Mart and Target.

Bottom-Fishing for German Stocks

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
GERMANY has led the world's stock markets on their two-and-a-half-year downhill run. The country's benchmark DAX index has lost more than two-thirds of its value from peak to trough, and a new survey of Germany's economy, Europe's largest, is unlikely to persuade investors that their assessment has been harsh.
 Little headway has been made in alleviating chronic slow growth and high unemployment, the survey concluded. Its results, issued on Tuesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an institute set up by the world's developed countries, cited deep-rooted causes for Germany's woes -- high taxation and government spending, an inefficient labor market and excessive business regulation. It said the weak global economy had made the afflictions more acute. 
 The DAX, which peaked at 8,136.16 nearly three years ago, fell as low as 2,519.30 this October; it has since recovered to 3,024.22. But even with that rally, the the German market is still among the world's worst performers in 2002. The DAX is down 41 percent for the year, although the recent strength of the euro makes the decline 32 percent for American investors. 
Still, many German companies are global heavyweights that trade in the United States and are widely held in blue-chip portfolios. These include DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Allianz, the insurer. Some analysts and fund managers, even those who are wary of the overall market, contend that some German stocks are opportunities -- sound companies whose prices have been dragged down unfairly.
"There is a danger of throwing out some very good companies by throwing out everything with a German tag," said Stephanie Gerrard, senior fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London and a specialist in Continental equities. "They've got good businesses and products, and managements who have demonstrated, long term, that they can deliver. And you're not paying much for them, because expectations are so low."
But trying to find diamonds in the rough can be tricky when the rough is so large. Many investors find it hard to look past the weak returns and dismal economic backdrop. They often compare Germany to another economic power that fell on hard times more than a decade ago.
"Germany seems to be in an awfully difficult situation," said Peter Wright, co-manager of the Morgan Stanley Institutional International fund, which Morningstar credits with the best 10-year performance among diversified foreign stock funds. "It's doing a good job of imitating Japan in many respects. There are a lot of banks that tend to be low quality and high risk, and industry is heavily capital intensive and export dependent." None of the fund's 25 largest holdings are German companies, according to Morningstar, which said that the fund is now closed to investors.
Germany has been unable to right its floundering economy partly because it is in the euro zone. German authorities cannot lower interest rates; the 12-nation euro group has a single rate, set by the European Central Bank. They also cannot reduce taxes to stimulate growth, because Germany's fiscal deficit already breaks the 3 percent ceiling allowed for euro members under the Growth and Stability Pact.
Especially disheartening to many economists and investors are the continuing increases in taxes in Germany, which already has one of the highest tax burdens in the world. "Everyone else ignores the stability pact, but Germany persists in raising taxes and cutting expenditures in a downturn," said Gabriel Stein, an economist at Lombard Street Research in London.
The economy is heavily unionized, and pay in major sectors is set by collective bargaining between the unions and employer federations. It is rare, Mr. Stein said, to pay lower salaries to less-skilled workers or to allow temporary or part-time employment. Many workers retire at 55, and the population is aging, so the work force is likely to shrink.
Over the next decade, Mr. Stein said, the economy is likely to grow no more than 1 percent a year. "There will be years when the economy doesn't grow, not because of recession but just because growth is slower than average," he said.
Ms. Gerrard at Aberdeen looks for companies that will succeed despite the inhospitable climate. In choosing a stock, she said, "you need to find one with a product so different or special that it transcends the internal economic issues or has a very strong management that can offset some of the drags of the political situation."
Two that qualify are BMW and its rival, Porsche. "Both have products that are envied across the world, and they have executed extremely well," she said. "The fact that they are German-based shouldn't be held against them. They have actively looked for markets outside Germany."
She warned, though, that a proposal to raise taxes on company cars may hurt the stocks, especially BMW's, in the short term.
She is avoiding another -- DaimlerChrysler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars. "The problem is not the Mercedes element, but Chrysler," she said. "The risk is that U.S. consumers can't carry on supporting the economy for as long as they have."
Ms. Gerrard also likes Schering, the drug maker, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock fell when the company issued a profit warning after the government announced plans to cut reimbursements for drug purchases by 6 percent. But that should mean only a one-time hit to profits, she said, and the stock "is starting to look like pretty good value" after the sell-off.
W. George Greig, manager of the William Blair International Growth fund, is keeping his portfolio light in German holdings, but said he expected a few companies to have strong growth, including Altana, the drug and chemical maker; Medion, a distributor of computers through discount retailers; and Puma, the shoe and sporting goods company. Altana trades on the New York Stock Exchange.
Morgan Stanley's European model portfolio has six German stocks: Allianz; Fresenius Medical Care; BASF, the basic-materials company; Fraport, the airport operator; and Merck and Schering, the drug makers. (Merck & Company and Schering-Plough of the United States began as subsidiaries of the German companies but are now independent.) Allianz, Fresenius, Schering and BASF trade on United States markets.
Allianz has not been a model performer. The American shares fell about two-thirds between the end of May and their October low, and declined 4 percent on Wednesday after the company said its chief executive, Henning Schulte-Noelle, would resign in April.
Lehman Brothers includes four German companies in its European model portfolio: Porsche; Deutsche Bank; SAP, the software maker; and Infineon Technologies, a semiconductor company. All but Porsche trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Merrill Lynch is neutral on Deutsche Bank, but it advises selling two other banks, Commerzbank and the HVB Group, formerly Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank. Frustrated by the slow pace of consolidation in the banking sector, Merrill's analysts call it a "structural underperformer." They also have sell ratings on Allianz and another insurer, Munich Re, whose stock has experienced a similar large fall. 
JAMES LATORRE, research consultant to the Harbor International fund, said that one of the few German stocks he likes is the tire maker Continental, which is in the portfolio because "it's not run like a German company; it's run for profit." 
Mr. LaTorre previously invested in Deutsche Bank to try to take advantage of an effort at industrial reform in 1999, when the government took steps to encourage corporate giants to untangle their web of cross-shareholding. But not much came of it, he recalled, and he unloaded the stock.
"We cooled on Deutsche because the whole German story never added up," he said. "The sense was that these cross-holdings would be sold to more return-oriented shareholders and that the managers of these sleepy German companies would have to wake up. We thought Deutsche would be right in the middle of this, but it didn't happen. Germany is not reforming as fast as we hoped. But that's Germany."

The Big Question for Gold: How High Can It Fly?

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE surge that sent gold to a five-and-a-half-year-high of $346.50 an ounce last week is not just one of those mirages that have tantalized investors periodically over the last 15 years, only to vanish quickly.
 This rally has lasted since March 30, 2001. The price of gold has risen 34 percent since then, making it the strongest move of this duration since the rally that ended in early 1988, with gold at $477.80 an ounce. 
 As usual, explanations vary for gold's climb. They range from a change of heart by speculators, who now are betting on higher prices, to the three-year decline in the stock market. The expected war with Iraq may be prompting some investors to seek gold as a haven. And gold enthusiasts are worried that the Federal Reserve's determined effort to avoid deflation could guarantee some jump in inflation soon. 
This time, though, gold has built a floor, for now, around $300 an ounce. That floor is a result of a major decline in hedging by gold producers over the last two years. Such hedging, involving the selling of huge amounts of borrowed gold, helped to break the back of gold rallies for years.
So there is little reason to believe that this rally will abruptly disappear. Instead, the question is this: How much higher can gold go?
The answer, some analysts say, will be found in the behavior of individual investors, who have yet to make a big move back into the gold market. If they make that move, the price may climb higher. If they don't, the rally may falter when speculators, who seem to be powering gold now, decide that the run has gone far enough. Still, no big decline appears in store.
Philip Klapwijk, the managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services in London, a precious-metals research firm, said there was little hard evidence of current investor inclinations. Most information is anecdotal. But the sales of American Eagle gold coins and of precious-metals mutual funds can give some hint of individual investors' sentiment, while trading of gold futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange can give a sense of speculators' views.
Sales of American Eagle gold coins jumped to 43,500 ounces in November from 31,000 ounces in October, according to the United States Mint. But sales for the year still might not beat the 325,000 ounces sold in 2001, and they are far behind the almost 2.1 million ounces sold in 1999, at the height of year-2000 computer fears. So there is interest, but no run yet.
Another sign of individuals' interest is the flow of money into mutual funds that buy stocks in precious-metals companies. This year through last week, $465 million had poured in, after a net outflow of $251 million in the same period a year earlier. The 2002 pace is well above the average annual fund flow of just $84 million since 1992, according to AMG Data Services. 
For investors in the stocks of these companies, the payoff has been even better than the rally in gold itself. For the year, the CBOE Gold index, which includes 10 gold mining companies, is up 47 percent, while the price of gold is up 22 percent, after it slipped on Friday to finish the week at $341 an ounce. But that money is not pushing up the price of gold, just the price of gold mining stocks.
SPECULATORS, meanwhile, are hungry for gold. Based on reports from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, noncommercial traders, including speculators, held about 87,000 futures contracts to buy gold and about 32,000 contracts to sell gold as of Dec. 17, a net buying position of 55,000 contracts. That is the largest since 1996, a sure sign that the sentiment these days is to bet on a price rise -- not the price falls of the past.
This sentiment pleases John Hathaway, a gold fund portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management. "Here is an asset class asleep for 20 years," he said. "You have room for reallocation of world financial wealth to gold and just a small amount going into gold would have a big impact because it is such a small asset class."
But first, investors have to catch Mr. Hathaway's fever.

When the Going Gets Tough, Learn From a Book

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Many a book is marketed as a recipe for success or a formula for inspirational change. But, it appears, some recipes for success and wellsprings of life-altering change are found in unlikely literary sources.
 These days, Steve Kavalgian is the president of Mill River Media in Old Lyme, Conn. He's a publisher's representative, selling advertising space in journals of medicine and professional societies. Life, he says, is terrific. 
 But a few years ago, in 1996, things weren't so good. Mr. Kavalgian had had a wonderful business in New York, also as a publisher's representative, for 16 years, but eventually, he says, "the bottom fell out." 
"It may sound strange that a novel rather than a business text or how-to book was the help I used" in the aftermath, he writes.
"I was depressed, concerned I wasn't going to make my mortgage payment, my son's college bills or even pay the most minor expenses," he says of that time. "On a business trip, I bought a paperback in an airport newsstand because the cover looked exciting. Here began the adventures of soldiers in Burma, Germany and Vietnam, fighting for their lives, covering each other's butts, dealing with military bureaucracy in an attempt to survive and go home. Here were men exhibiting courage in the face of death, exhibiting bravery in what seemed like impossible situations and exhibiting the strength to get the job done."
Mr. Kavalgian had discovered the novels of Leonard B. Scott, including "Charlie Mike," "The Last Run," "The Expendables," "Forged in Honor" and "The Iron Men."
Mr. Kavalgian writes, "The characters in the stories showed me that even in the worst of scenarios, they could prevail, and so could I."
He took a series of jobs. He got one as a part-time pharmaceutical representative. He worked part-time for the United Parcel Service deliverying packages. He started selling photographic equipment at camera shows, and he got a new journal client.
"It all worked," he says. "I survived and came home."
Ben Friedell, a physician in Oneonta, N.Y., offers a prescription -- one that changed the way he practices his profession.
It is "A Whole New Life" by Reynolds Price.
"He is a novelist and teacher of English at Duke University who developed a tumor on his spinal cord, which ultimately left him paraplegic and in constant pain," Dr. Friedell writes. "Yet he continues to teach and write, adapting to his new body to continue to do the things he loves.
"I am a family physician who deals with many patients with chronic pain and physical disabilities which challenge them. Price's story has given me, as an able-bodied person, an insight into the life of those with pain and disabilities.
"I recommend this book to anyone in the health professions."
Poetry was the answer for Carol LaChapelle of Chicago.
"In 1985, while stuck in a hateful administrative job at a local university, I registered for a seminar in English literature at the Newberry Library in Chicago," Ms. LaChapelle writes.
"I needed something uplifting and inspiring to keep me from quitting outright -- never a good career move.
"The seminar focused on 'Lyrical Ballads,' a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge published in 1798.
"What I didn't know but learned during the eight-week class was how situated these poets were in the revolutionary times within which they wrote," Ms. LaChapelle writes. "England was in the midst of a massive cultural revolution, moving from an agricultural to an industrial economy. There were the American Revolution, of course, and the fall of the Bastille in 1789.
"Learning all this, seeing this revered poet, a laureate of England, as a young fired-up revolutionary, both politically and artistically," she says, referring to Wordsworth, "put me in mind of my own generation's coming of age in the 1960's.
"But the most important thing I learned during that seminar, and the reading of the 'Lyrical Ballads,' was of the quiet, yet insistent power of literature to connect the experience of a 20th-century American woman with that of a canonical male writer two centuries earlier.
"Six months later, I quit my job and returned to graduate school, at the age of 41, to study literature and writing. Since then, I have been self-employed as a writing teacher, offering seminars in various adult education venues, including the Newberry Library."
David M. Tenenbaum says, "Thanks, Tom Clancy."
Mr. Tenenbaum says "a casual Christmas read" in 1985 -- the paperback version of Mr. Clancy's "The Hunt for Red October" -- "helped show me a way to stand on my own two feet, changed my career and changed the way thousands of people do their jobs."
Mr. Tenenbaum is now president and chief executive of MerlinOne Inc., based in Quincy, Mass. It provides systems that search for and retrieve digital photographs, graphics and other files for business needs. The company supplies more than 100 systems to 91 companies in 5 countries. 
But in the mid-1980's, Mr. Tenenbaum had been a staff photographer at The Associated Press for about 10 years. "My job typically entailed going somewhere involving a breaking news story, setting up a temporary darkroom, covering the story, processing the film and making a print of the best image," he writes.
"The print, with a typed caption, was inserted into a photo transmission device, which would translate various shades of gray to an audio tone of varying strength. The signal would be sent over a telephone line, usually to the A.P. office in New York, for retransmission to thousands of newspapers in the case of a major story."
The system had been in use for some 50 years. Transmitting a single black-and-white picture took eight minutes, and any noise on the phone line meant that it would have to be resent.
That was where Tom Clancy came in. In "The Hunt for Red October," he tells of a Navy sailor who uses a computer system to remove random noise so the sonar sounds of a submarine can be distinguished from a noisy environment. 
"It got me thinking," Mr. Tenenbaum writes. What if he built a system that could fool the telephone system into thinking it was receiving a constant signal rather than a disrupted one?
He spent his nights building and testing prototypes. The A.P. and other news organizations bought them. He got a patent.
A few years later, he left to start his own company. His systems are now used by major news organizations.
Kenny Moore says his college philosophy professor made him read Dostoyevsky's "Brothers Karamazov" and told him it would change his life. 
He did. It didn't.
That was more than 30 years ago, and though the professor insisted that the novel be read annually, "for insight and moral grounding," Mr. Moore, now the corporate ombudsman and director for human resources at the KeySpan Corporation in New York, says he has probably read it once since then.
"I'm still left unmoved and morally ungrounded," he writes.
"Of greater value to me is the book '10 Fun Things to Do Before You Die,' by Karol A. Jackowski, a New York City nun with a sense of divine humor and sparkling insight. Over the past decade, I've regularly picked it up and found sound business advice, like No. 3, 'Get some depth,' and No. 7, 'Make yourself interesting.'
"Last year I had a heart attack and open-heart surgery -- and almost died. I picked up Sister Karol's book and read it again. It made me smile, cry and helped me heal. I found humor in No. 2, 'Get some insight' and hope in No. 10, 'Live like you have nothing left to lose.'
"Had Fyodor Dostoyevsky had access to this book, I believe that the four Karamazov brothers would have fared a lot better than they did.
"Even former Enron executives would have found some helpful advice here, like No. 4: 'Find a place to escape reality.' "
Judith Steininger of Milwaukee says she owes it all to Martha Gellhorn.
"Gellhorn may be best known as the third wife of Ernest Hemingway, but that shortchanges this terrific writer of numerous first-rate short stories and seven novels," Mrs. Steininger writes.
So how did Martha Gellhorn change her life? It all started a couple of decades ago, when Mrs. Steininger's husband, Daniel, was a newly minted chief executive of an insurance company, "enduring the sleepless nights such awesome responsibility usually visits."
Mrs. Steininger continues: "Always looking for new material to introduce to my literature classes at the college where I taught, I closeted myself one day in the office with Gellhorn's novella 'In the Highlands,' about a British survivor of a German concentration camp during World War II. He had purchased a farm in Kenya and was determined to be the world's greatest, kindest boss -- an attitude similar to my husband's. But the survivor learned that just letting employees do what they want isn't always best for the business or relationships."
When she finished the book, Mrs. Steininger left it in her husband's study with what she calls "a you-gotta-read-this note."
"I knew he'd find it about 2:30 a.m. He did, and he experienced the magic of narrative to complement the analysis of managerial books. Over the next few years, as I watched my husband grow into his job, I was amazed to discover numerous literary works that provided outstanding metaphors for business problems." 
Before long, Mrs. Steininger was teaching a course called "The Business World Through the Eyes of Fiction" at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. The class explored contemporary writers , as well as early Americans like Horatio Alger.
Then Mrs. Steininger dropped off a letter at The Business Journal of Milwaukee, proposing a monthly column on literature and business. Soon she was being invited to speak at companies and professional organizations. She talked about estate planning lessons from "King Lear" and Dr. Frankenstein on research and development.
"My time upon the world stage was brief," Mrs. Steininger says. "For budgetary reasons, the newspaper let me go. But people still remember. Periodically someone stops me and asks if I am the person who wrote that column called Shelf Life.
"I thank Martha Gellhorn from the bottom of my heart."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
In Telecom, Optimism On Overseas Companies

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
It is certainly too early to declare that the telecommunications industry is rising like a phoenix from its ashes. But there are signs that the decline in the business may have ended.
 This quarter, investors have actually been buying the stocks: the Morgan Stanley World Telecommunication Services index is up 29 percent. Still, for the year, the index is down more than 30 percent. And it is trading at well under half its value in 1998, when the index was created. 
 Robert N. Gensler, portfolio manager of the $500 million T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications fund, discussed the industry's prospects last week. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What is your appraisal of the current state of the telecom industry?

A. Over the last two years, investment in the business has come down dramatically. In North America, it has been cut in half; worldwide, by 40 percent. Investment will be down again next year, by as much as 15 percent. But that helps free cash flow.
Also, ambitions have been shrunk, which means that industry practices have gotten dramatically better. Instead of chasing market share, these companies are chasing profitability. That is a dramatic change.
There have been a lot of bankruptcies, but almost all of the companies that are still around have an improving balance sheet and improving returns on capital. They still don't have revenue growth, which is the remaining issue. But that issue is pervasive across the economy.

Q. Have investors reduced their expectations for growth in the telecommunications companies?

A. I think investors are back to the mind-set of this being a slow-growing industry. But I think we will go back to growing at a little bit less than the overall economy. But that would be an improvement from now: this year, telecommunications saw its share of gross domestic product shrink modestly.

Q. Given your modest forecast for the industry, why are you optimistic?

A. I am excited, but only internationally. The businesses are much more consolidated internationally. In the United States, you have seven players in local and long-distance service. Most of the other countries have just one dominant player.

Q. Which foreign companies do you like?

A. Our biggest holding in telecommunications services is Verizon, which is a domestic company. But other than that we own Vodafone Group; SK Telecom, a wireless operator out of Korea; Korea Telecom; Telefonos de Mexico; and Telecom Italia. All of those stocks trade in this country as American depository receipts. I also own some Deutsche Telekom, which is a restructuring story.

Q. Will wireless stocks continue to rise?

A. There has been a tremendous rally in wireless, but we still have the dilemma of having six players in a business with slowing subscriber growth. Cellphones are no longer the Christmas gift of choice. Revenue per customer is unchanged, but minutes per customer are up 30 percent, with no end in sight. Because it has so many players, wireless has no pricing power.

Q. Is the federal government likely to provide the industry with regulatory relief?

A. Many of these stocks took off after Michael Powell, head of the Federal Communications Commission, gave a speech at a Goldman, Sachs conference. In that speech, he made clear his desire to roll back some of the regulations.
I am cautious about regulatory relief. I think it will come, but I think it will disappoint the public market. What changes there are will help the regional Bell companies.

Q. What's your take on the equipment manufacturers?

A. All of the problems at Lucent Technologies and at Nortel benefit Cisco Systems, which is clearly gaining market share.
Cisco is not a stellar growth company any more. It will probably grow on the order of 8 percent to 10 percent. The stock isn't cheap, but I think it is very reasonably valued.
Lucent and Nortel will have down years in 2003 from 2002. They will survive, because they both raised a lot of cash over the summer. But pricing power is absent in this business right now. The customers have the power.

Q. Aside from Verizon, do you like the regional Bell operating companies?

A. My concern with BellSouth and SBC Communications has to do with Cingular, their wireless asset. It has a lot of issues.

Q. Have these stocks gotten way ahead of themselves?

A. We had the rally because they were oversold, and because there are signs the business is stabilizing. But we have come too far too fast and may need to drift lower. But I don't think we will retest the October lows. That would be irrational.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Robert W. Smith; 
T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
EDGY investors have pushed down prices of blue-chip companies sharply this year despite strong company fundamentals, says Robert W. Smith,manager of the $3.9 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund.
 "Valuations are being cut in half because people have lost faith in the stock market and don't know who to trust," Mr. Smith said from his office in downtown Baltimore. "Minor issues have become major problems," he added, and price-to-earnings multiples have taken big hits. 
 In this environment, he said, investors ignore past performance and treat all companies equally. "Citigroup has done a great job," he said, "but investors don't like the fact that it's such a complicated company, so it trades at just a small premium over J. P. Morgan." 
Citigroup is the fund's biggest holding, at nearly 4 percent of assets, and, he said, the company's stock price will rise as it demonstrates "that it can take market share, redeploy capital well and show better-than-market growth with less volatility.".
The fund lost 9.7 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing in the top 4 percent of all funds that buy large growth stocks -- a category that lost 20 percent, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.5 percent during that time. The fund declined 22 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 27.5 percent for its group and 22.1 percent for the index.
Mr. Smith, 41, is a vice president of T. Rowe Price Associates, the fund's adviser. He also manages about $1.4 billion, mostly for institutions.
Six analysts work closely with Mr. Smith to pick the roughly 115 stocks in the Growth Stock fund from companies with market capitalizations over $3 billion.
Mr. Smith prefers companies that are well established in their industries and have potential earnings growth of at least 12 to 15 percent a year during the next three to five years. 
Ideally, he likes companies that are finding strong demand for products or services, based on technological, cost or other competitive advantages. "We're looking for places where somebody can take market share with better mousetraps," he said. 
One important variable is free cash flow as a percentage of earnings. A high ratio reflects a well-run business, he said. He defines free cash flow as earnings and depreciation minus capital spending and working capital.
Improving cash flow also indicates that management can allocate capital efficiently, he added, by making acquisitions, buying back stock or paying dividends.
Mr. Smith recently added shares of the UnitedHealth Group, a provider of health care insurance and management services based in Minnetonka, Minn. As demographics change, health care spending is increasing as a percentage of gross domestic product, he said, and the company is gaining market share because of its broad choice of health care plans. 
He started buying shares in 1997 and has paid $32, on average, for his position, adjusted for stock splits. The stock is now at $81.09.
In October, Mr. Smith added shares of Target, which operates the Marshall Field's, Target and Mervyn's stores. The company is expanding and is extremely well run, he said. It operates more than 1,100 Target stores; Mr. Smith projects a total of 2,000 in five years. He started buying shares in 1999 and has paid $33 a share, on average. They now trade at $29.89.
ANOTHER holding is the First Data Corporation, which owns Western Union and operates electronic money transfer and credit card processing services. Mr. Smith originally bought the stock in January 1999 at an average price of $22 a share, adjusted for stock splits; it is now at $35.72. 
"First Data is a company benefiting from Western Union's international expansion as well as the movement of preferred forms of payment from checks and cash to credit and debit cards," he said. He expects annual revenue growth in the low double digits, and earnings growth in the mid-double digits, over the next three to five years.
The shares now trade at about 20 times projected 2003 earnings. "So it's selling at a slight premium to the market with much better than market growth," he said.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
Making a Career Leap, Sore Muscles and All

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
AS everyone who reads these pages knows, the ranks of mid- and late-career professionals are in upheaval.
 In some cases, professionals are just not happy doing what they are doing. According to a study last summer by the Conference Board, job satisfaction is lowest across all occupations in the 35-to-44 age group, and the 45-to-55 group is not far behind. Anecdotally, job dissatisfaction seems worse for professionals. No wonder so many lawyers become teachers, so many investment bankers join the Peace Corps and so many journalists become, well, anything else. 
 Then there is another category, for professionals who have been downsized, outplaced or rightsized because of mergers, acquisitions and outsourcings. (Disclosure: I fall into this category, having once received a letter of termination after less than six months in a job because of a corporate takeover.) 
In both categories, professionals are finding it difficult to reinvent themselves. One can blame ageism (an interesting explanation, considering that many baby boomers, the don't-trust-anyone-over-30 generation, are often the ones being disinvited from the party) or one can blame sheer economic necessity. The net effect is the same: these are tough days for many people who never expected to experience adversity at the peak of their careers.
All of that makes two new books particularly timely: "Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career" by Herminia Ibarra (Harvard Business School Press, $26.95) and "50 Plus!: Critical Career Decisions for the Rest of Your Life" by Robert L. Dilenschneider (Citadel Press, $22.95).
Ms. Ibarra, 41, is a trilingual, Cuban-born professor of organizational behavior at Insead, the elite French business school. Mr. Dilenschneider, formerly head of Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm, is now head of a New York-based public relations firm that bears his name; he is 59.
Their approaches are very different. Ms. Ibarra has written a more analytical book, describing the various stages that professionals in both the United States and Europe must realistically pass through as they try to reinvent themselves. She interviewed 23 professionals on both sides of the Atlantic, most of them between the ages of 38 and 44. "The numbers of people taking the leap to something completely different have risen significantly over the last two decades and continue to grow," Ms. Ibarra writes.
Mr. Dilenschneider makes no pretense of being an academic. His is a more practical kind of book, with an inspirational flair. His most compelling argument is that older people must learn how to work with, and for, people who are many years younger. He also offers wise words about the dos and don'ts of networking.
People who have the luxury of time to reinvent themselves will find that "Working Identity" is aimed at them. Ms. Ibarra has studied the steps taken by her research subjects in reinventing themselves and has come up with a vocabulary for describing them.
In her view, many professionals are "frozen" into one particular identity. When a "triggering" event occurs, like an exciting conversation with someone in a different profession, for example, they begin their search for what comes next. But she says they have many possible new roles, not just the one true path that seems to be the conventional wisdom among self-help books of this genre.
THESE professionals, Ms. Ibarra writes, must be willing to explore different "possible selves." She dismisses as hogwash the notion that anyone can accurately project, in a sudden flash of insight, what they want to be doing in five years. To overcome their strong sense of identification with their current profession, they must conduct experiments in a new field. That could mean consulting jobs, volunteer work or board memberships.
Professionals who truly want to reinvent themselves have to tolerate a period of ambiguity -- maybe many months, or even a year or two.
"We like to think we can leap directly from a desire for a change to a single decision that will complete our reinvention," she writes. "As a result, we remain naive about the long, essential testing period when our actions transform (or fail to transform) fuzzy, undefined possibilities into concrete choices we can evaluate."
Reinvention also implies shifting the kinds of people one associates with.
"We cannot regenerate ourselves in isolation," Ms. Ibarra argues. That, again, flies against the conventional wisdom that the best way to change careers is to retreat to an ashram and contemplate one's navel.
"Changing careers is not merely a matter of changing the work we do," she says. "It is as much about changing the relationships that matter in our professional lives."
She calls this process one of "shifting connections." People interested in a radical new direction must meet those who can help them feel their way into a new field. Career counselors, outplacement specialists and headhunters are of limited help, she says, because they want to help a professional make very gradual, conservative career shifts.
The authors agree on at least this point: People should pursue what they are passionate about. Shifting from doing something that doesn't excite you to something vastly different that also fails to excite is a wasted opportunity.
Mr. Dilenschneider's book is aimed more at professionals who have already been displaced and are trying to get back into the swing of things. Late in his book is a particularly moving passage, which might not be expected to come from someone who counsels chief executives. It turns out that Mr. Dilenschneider's office in Manhattan adjoins an outplacement firm.
"More than once in the months since Sept. 11," he writes, "I have gone to the washroom that we share and seen grown men literally bent over the sink crying because they have lost their jobs."
Oddly, protections for older people under federal law are actually a disincentive for companies to retain or hire 50-somethings, writes Mr. Dilenschneider.
"As one executive told me, off the record: 'It's an example of the law of unintended consequences. People over 50 are walking liabilities,' " he writes.
Some of his advice may seem obvious: Don't lie on your resume. Don't try to dress like a teenager to make people think you are younger than you really are. Don't reveal any hint that you are bitter about being thrown out of the work force. And give up any aspirations of becoming a writer. It's an impossible way to make a living, he counsels.
PROBABLY his most important advice revolves around relationships with younger people, who may be in positions of authority.
Mr. Dilenschneider allows how he personally may prefer Frank Sinatra but also listens to Hootie and the Blowfish from time to time. "Let's face it: Young people are unlikely to be up to speed on the singers of my youth," he writes. "I'm the one who has to accommodate them. If my awareness of their cultural touchstones enables them to feel more comfortable with me, we both benefit."
He recommends finding a way to communicate your experience to a younger executive while making it clear that you are not competing with that person for a promotion. "Recognize that you have an opportunity to transfer your experience to that younger person in a way that may ultimately help you," Mr. Dilenschneider writes. His point is this: If you help a younger supervisor climb the corporate ladder, you, too, will benefit.
Mr. Dilenschneider, a consummate networker, writes about the right ways to ask for favors from one's network of acquaintances -- and the wrong ways: Don't ask for crucial introductions from someone you barely know. Don't ask for a list of all attendees at a dinner party. Don't ask for "informational" interviews that require a busy person to spend an hour telling you things you should have already researched.
Of course, entire forests have been felled for self-help and career-help books over the years. But amid an epidemic of professional flameouts, buyouts and firings, both of these books are valuable reading.

HEADLINE: A Regulator Takes Aim At Hazards of S.U.V.'s 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
DR. JEFFREY RUNGE had seen many cases like Sarah Longstreet's in the 20 years he served as an emergency room physician in Charlotte, N.C. But this one was as tragic as any he remembered: Ms. Longstreet, a 17-year-old on her way to high school, was killed when a 1991 Ford Explorer collided with her Mazda sedan head-on.
 The accident occurred just two months before Dr. Runge's departure to Washington to become the Bush administration's top traffic safety official. And it reinforced what has become one of his main missions: addressing the dangers that S.U.V.'s and other trucks pose to occupants of passenger cars. 
 "The theory that I'm going to protect myself and my family even if it costs other people's lives has been the operative incentive for the design of these vehicles, and that's just wrong," said Dr. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (known by its abbreviation and pronounced NIT-sa), in a recent interview. 
"Not to sound like a politician, but that's not compassionate conservatism."
Now Dr. Runge's agency is reviewing several safety issues involving sport utility vehicles that could have wide-ranging implications for motorists and automakers. Detroit's Big Three, especially, derive a lopsided share of their slim profits from these vehicles.
Intent as he is on attacking the dangers of S.U.V.'s, Dr. Runge is still part of an administration that is not enamored of regulation. Yet he says that if he cannot address this nettlesome problem, his agency has little purpose.
Some automakers have already taken steps to make S.U.V.'s safer, for other drivers and for their own occupants. But to Dr. Runge, there is much more to be done. As head of the traffic safety agency, he has the authority to set vehicle safety standards, though they are reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, whose administrator, John D. Graham, rejected a tire safety proposal in February. Automakers will undoubtedly continue to put up a determined fight if they feel that their cash cows are threatened.
But Dr. Runge's mission is just part of an effort by regulators and insurers to rethink auto safety in a country increasingly dominated by light trucks, the government designation for S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans. Although light trucks now outsell cars -- and account for nearly 40 percent of vehicles on the road, versus 15 percent in 1976, according to R. L. Polk & Company -- auto safety standards still reflect a car-dominated society. Government crash tests, which began in the late 1970's, principally gauge how well vehicles of all kinds fare in collisions with cars.
Next month, a panel assembled by Dr. Runge will suggest measures to address the threat of S.U.V.'s and pickups to passenger cars.
Meanwhile, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a coalition of auto insurers, has started a series of side-impact tests to see how cars and small S.U.V.'s stand up when hit by bigger S.U.V.'s. The first results are expected in April. But the insurers' group concedes that without supplemental testing or standards imposed by the government, their testing could actually lead manufacturers to make small S.U.V.'s bigger and worsen the problem. 
What, exactly, is the problem?
There are two related issues, known in the industry as compatibility and aggressivity. The first involves how different vehicles match up in a collision, and the second involves one vehicle's ability to inflict damage on others. S.U.V.'s ride higher off the ground than passenger cars, and their bumpers, engines, frame rails and hoods are higher. This mismatch puts the occupants of cars at a disadvantage because a colliding S.U.V. can skip over many protective features, like the sill of the passenger door. 
Big S.U.V.'s are built on stiff steel frames and are more unforgiving than cars in collisions. The results can be seen in statistics. When a light truck hits a car in the side, an occupant of the car is 29 times more likely to die than a person in the truck, Dr. Runge said. When a car hits a light truck in the side, occupants have an even chance of dying.
THE industry has started, slowly, to address these issues. The Ford Motor Company, for instance, lowered the frame rails and front bumper of its 2002 Explorer by about two inches so it is closer in height to car bumpers, like that of Ms. Longstreet's Mazda 626. "It improves the situation," said Jim Boland, Ford's manager for advanced safety and regulations. "If you were to line up a Taurus bumper with an Explorer bumper, you would see there is significant overlap there. It would not be a guaranteed override."
Lowering a bumper does not necessarily lower the spot where force is centralized -- a far more important factor, Dr. Runge said. 
"They can plot where the maximum force is being delivered," he said, adding that some standard is needed to make cars and light trucks match each other better.
Automakers have hardly been a friend of new regulation, particularly when it might force them to rethink how they make S.U.V.'s.
"Compatibility is an issue the industry has been focusing on for several years now," said Robert S. Strassburger, vice president for safety at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group. "Everybody has activities and countermeasures that they are incorporating into their vehicles. The general philosophy is making sure you're enhancing self-protection. The question from NHTSA's point of view is if there is a need to go beyond self-protection and look at what countermeasures can be taken with respect to the striking vehicles."
Regarding the kind of compatibility standard envisioned by Dr. Runge, Mr. Strassburger added: "We understand that's what NHTSA is looking at. As an industry, I don't know if we are ready to say if that's an appropriate way to proceed."
The traffic safety agency is also seeking ways to make S.U.V.'s and other light trucks safer for their own occupants. It is reviewing existing testing on rollovers and the crashworthiness of roofs. 
S.U.V.'s roll over three times as often as cars, because they ride higher off the ground and have a higher center of gravity, counteracting the benefit of being bigger. The safety agency is trying to come up with a more demanding test for rollovers.
Many safety advocates say the government needs to be much more aggressive in updating its crash tests and its minimum performance standards. "These behemoth vehicles have to be redesigned," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, and the former head of the traffic safety agency in the Carter administration. "You need to redesign them to improve fuel economy, reduce aggressivity, make them less likely to roll over and make them more crashworthy when they do.' 
To simulate the impact of an S.U.V., the insurers' side-impact test will use a moving barrier that is a full foot higher and 250 pounds heavier than in a similar test performed by the government.
"We've been talking to manufacturers about this program and sharing our developmental test results for close to two years," said Brian O'Neill, the president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
"It's fair to say virtually all manufacturers have run tests that are similar to our side-impact tests," Mr. O'Neill said, though he added that engineers at two manufacturers told him they could not get the money to make changes until the insurers forced the issue with testing.
But Mr. O'Neill added that insurers' tests could not be as comprehensive a solution as the government could offer. Taken alone, he said, they could have some negative impact because they examine only how individual vehicles stand up to collisions with bigger vehicles. Manufacturers could make their vehicles perform better on the insurers' tests by building them heavier. But heavier vehicles, in turn, could be more harmful to smaller, lighter ones.
"We're looking at it in a different context" from the government, Mr. O'Neill said. "Any time you start pushing self-protection improvements, there is a question whether it makes it worse for people in other vehicles. If you add 500 pounds in one vehicle, what does it do to another?"
THAT gap in the insurers' test is a crucial area for government action, Ms. Claybrook says. She wants the government to force automakers to design their S.U.V.'s less like tanks and to make them absorb more energy in collisions.
"The S.U.V.'s on the road today," she said, "are needlessly heavy and very aggressive."
What happened to Sarah Longstreet was a textbook case of the S.U.V.'s danger to cars. Ms. Longstreet was a petite redhead who organized Bible clubs and baby-sat. She often teasingly fined her friends for not wearing seat belts, though she was too nice to collect.
On the morning of April 12, 2001, Ms. Longstreet was driving a 1996 Mazda 626 to East Mecklenburg High School, traveling west on a four-lane road. According to the initial report from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, an eastbound Ford Explorer, swerving to avoid another car, clipped a school bus and veered into the car driven by Ms. Longstreet, who was traveling to school with three friends. 
"This was a clear case of override, where the S.U.V. rode over the hood of the car and killed her instantly," said Dr. Runge, who did not have a chance to treat Ms. Longstreet but does remember her three friends in the hospital asking: "Where is she? Where is she?"
"This case," he added, "crystallized why I was here."
No charges were filed, and Ms. Longstreet's parents decided not to press a civil case. "We felt like the Lord allowed this accident to occur," Marjorie Longstreet, Sarah's mother, said. "We felt that those people involved in the accident were not breaking the law. They were not drunk or on drugs. From what I can understand it was pure carelessness. We all make mistakes on the road."
Dr. Runge, though, said he felt that at least one important part of the accident was preventable, and that he could do something to make such accidents less likely in the future. 
"This was an angel who got plucked off the face of the earth," he said. "But to me, this is not an act of God; this is a preventable incident. If the geometry of the S.U.V. had been different, she with her belt and her air bag could have walked away from it."
"If it's not preventable," he added, "why have a NHTSA?"

HEADLINE: Wanted: Angels for New York's Neediest 

 BODY:
What opens a person's heart? For an actress of note it was a critically ill child, whose family will benefit from her donation of $10,000 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. For the members of the board of the New York-based Starr Foundation, which gave the fund a gift of $1 million, it was the legacy of a founder who grew up poor and a desire to help those who want to make a better life, as he did.
 But it was a $2 check that arrived from a Long Island woman that may offer the keenest glimpse of how, even amid economic uncertainty, people of average means are making room for charity in their squeezed budgets. Doing so, they help families they may never meet, but who they know lack food, shelter, medical care and other basic needs. The contribution total is up nearly 5 percent halfway through this year's Neediest Cases Fund campaign, but the number of donors has gone up 9 percent. Some of them are like the woman who could give just $2 to help someone less fortunate, and she did. 
 Since charities find themselves pressed and many nonprofit organizations have less to offer than in recent years, it falls to individuals to step in. 
"When people consider the glut of possessions they already have, they see it's psychically better to give a gift to help others," said Cristine Cronin, director of CharityWave.com, which accepts online donations to the fund. She said that so far, 30 percent of such donations have been gifts given in someone else's name, "in honor of" gifts. A graduate student at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., gave $25 in honor of her immigrant grandparents and "all immigrants to America." A Lexington, Ky., couple gave $500 in honor of their nieces and nephews.
With a few keystrokes, a gift can be made, a notification sent to the person honored and a receipt delivered. Every cent contributed to the fund goes to help the needy through seven social services agencies. The New York Times Foundation pays all administrative costs.
You may contribute online with a credit card at www.nytimes.com/neediest or at CharityWave.com. Checks may be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. You also may donate by telephone at (212) 556-5851 (ext. 7).

HEADLINE: Two Countries, One Anxiety 

BYLINE:  By Dave Kang; Dave Kang, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College, is author of "Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines."

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H. 

 BODY:
There has long been anti-Americanism on the Korean Peninsula, and the extent of it has long been exaggerated. Roh Moo Hyun, who favors greater autonomy from the United States, was elected president of South Korea last week amid news of North Korea's continued defiance of its nuclear accord with the United States. Events on both sides of the demilitarized zone, however, have been misunderstood.
 North Korea's behavior is not unpredictable, and the election of Mr. Roh was not simply an outbreak of emotional anti-Americanism. Both countries have deep concerns about United States policy toward the peninsula. It would be a mistake to dismiss South Korea's increasingly tense relations with the United States as ephemeral, or the North's recent belligerence as irrational. Koreans in both the North and South are concerned about an erratic United States policy that veers between neglect and overattention -- and that for the last two years has lacked an overarching vision. 
 The unraveling of the 1994 accord between North Korea and the United States over the North's nuclear weapons was unsurprising. Both countries mistrust each other and are always seeking to confirm their prejudices. Yet the past eight years have seen many positive developments in North Korean behavior: increasing economic ties to other Asian countries, for example, and cooperation with the South to clear part of the demilitarized zone of land mines for a railroad.
But the North has clearly and consistently maintained that it will proceed with reform cautiously and at its own pace -- and just as important, it has stressed that it will meet pressure with pressure. When the United States expects it to simply accede to demands that it stop developing its nuclear weapons, the Korean leaders do not back down.
So the United States, having chosen to pursue a hard-line policy with the North, has much the same choice as it did in 1994: it can continue to escalate the pressure and hope that a weaker economy will break the North, or it can find some way to negotiate. Complaints about North Korea's "irrationality" entirely miss the point.
The Bush administration has done well to avoid overreaction to the North's renewed nuclear threat. But after two years the administration has yet to articulate a coherent policy toward the peninsula -- North or South. This has led to a situation in which both North and South Korea worry about American policy.
Viewed in this context, the outcome of the South Korean election is understandable. South Korea has historically been one of the strongest allies of the United States. It is naive to dismiss its concerns as emotional. Certainly American troops stationed in South Korea can cause tension, and there was a strain of anti-Americanism in the recent protest of some 300,000 South Koreans over the acquittal (in an American court martial) of two soldiers accused of accidentally crushing two Korean girls to death while on an armored patrol.
But South Korea's concerns are rooted in a much deeper apprehensions. In large part, the South Korean election came down to a referendum on South Korea's stance toward North Korea and the United States. Voters resoundingly chose the moderate Mr. Roh, who favors continued engagement with the North, over Lee Hoi Chang, whose stance toward North Korea -- suspending assistance until it cooperates on issues like arms control -- more closely reflected America's. In electing Mr. Roh, voters voiced their displeasure with the Bush administration's inflexible stance.
Their shared frustration with America may have the effect of driving North and South Korea closer. These concerns are likely to grow, especially as democratic politics in South Korea matures. As voters increasingly demand more openness with the North, South Korea's elected officials are likely to show relatively less deference to American policy.
For America the implications of these changes in Korean attitudes are clear. Washington must create a comprehensive strategy for resolving the nuclear issue with the North in such a way that responds to North Korea's desire for security guarantees and full normalization with the United States. The United States cannot just hope that North Korea goes away -- nor should it risk escalating tensions and creating a geopolitical crisis, like the recent controversy over North Korea's missile shipments to Yemen.
To have any hope of resolving the tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the United States must pay more attention to the needs and goals of both countries. In recent years South Korea has made major strides in economic and diplomatic relations with the North, only to see those gains jeopardized in the last year by clumsy American diplomacy toward North Korea.
United States troops have been in Korea for more than 50 years, and most Koreans have complicated feelings about America. Some of them are anti-American, to be sure, but many are grateful. Right now, however, the prevailing mood is anxiety -- not about North Korea starting a war, but about American policies eroding the slow gains both Koreas have made in the last decade in their relations with each other. A more carefully engaged America would help alleviate tensions in Northeast Asia rather than contribute to them.

Bigger Portions Of Pie in the Sky

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
TO do business in a capitalist system is to subscribe to the maxim of no pain, no gain. The profitability of companies can suffer in the short run as they undercut each other for a slice of the economic pie.
 But the ailing airline industry says: enough for now. 
 It is asking itself whether the pie is now being divvied up among too many large network carriers for any real profits to be made, and whether the shutdown or buyout of some might not return their rivals to financial health. 
The most likely losers in a wave of consolidation would be United Airlines or US Airways, both now flying under bankruptcy protection and thus vulnerable to liquidation or eventual buyout. Virtually every airline executive admits that the industry's capacity is bloated now because of overexpansion in the 1990's, and that drastically shrinking capacity is vital to recovery.
But is consolidation really what the industry needs? American industries that ride with the economic cycle often go through waves of consolidation during times of bust, sometimes whittling down to a handful of big competitors. That gives the survivors power to raise prices and reap greater profits. But consolidation has not always worked out in the long-term interests of those companies.
"It can be a mixed blessing," said Ron Chernow, author of "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.," which detailed the monolith that was Standard Oil. "In the short run, it can help stabilize an industry that has been chaotic. The problem is that over the course of time, by being insulated to the competitive forces that had originally driven the consolidation, the industry can become hidebound and non-innovative. And that can make it vulnerable to forms of competition coming from outside the industry or from outside the existing circle of dominant companies."
The Big Three of the American automobile industry -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler (now DaimlerChrysler) -- fell prey to such stagnation. The companies increased their market share through consolidations that began in the first half of the 20th century. By 1960, four companies controlled 90 percent of the domestic market; then Chrysler bought out American Motors in 1987, a move that should have made the three survivors stronger.
But the insular oligopoly stayed rooted in old ways of manufacturing and marketing. In the last 25 years, the rise of more nimble foreign companies revealed what dinosaurs the Detroit companies were. Their market share has plummeted to 63 percent.
In fact, you could argue that with roughly a half-dozen big network carriers, the airline industry was already too insular, and maybe consolidation would have left it in worse shape.
The problem was that none of the network carriers was motivated to seek ways to operate more efficiently. It took the growing popularity of maverick Southwest Airlines, and the success of new low-cost carriers like JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways, to inject fear into the doddering oligopoly.
The last big merger in the industry, the buyout of TransWorld Airlines by American last year, made American into the world's largest carrier. That should have given the big carriers more pricing power and revenue share. But other factors -- the terrorist attacks, the continuing recession -- have driven ticket prices to an all-time low, and American is struggling to dump costly planes and workers acquired in the buyout.
"Mergers in general are a pretty risky proposition," said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution and co-author of "The Evolution of the Airline Industry." "Anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of these things are considered not to be financially successful."
The railroad industry has seen a few benefits from consolidation in the last two decades. In the early 1980's, it was suffering from some problems afflicting the airline industry -- overcapacity, too much competition. A deregulated market soon pushed dozens of companies to consolidate into today's four major rail operations. As companies combined, overlapping routes were cut and greater efficiency was achieved. 
But the railroad industry is not exactly a paragon of financial robustness, and it would be difficult to hold it up as an example of consolidation's curative powers.
There are also aviation experts who argue that consolidation is not necessary because the revenue pie is big enough to support a half-dozen large network carriers. What those airlines need to do, they say, is drastically cut their costs so they can offer lower fares to woo passengers. 
"If you add up those piles of revenue, in my judgment you get a pile of revenue that ought to be able to pay for the operation of those networks," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who is a professor at Yale Law School.
Some industry experts say the troubles at United and US Airways indicate that the airlines are poised for a second major round of consolidation resulting from deregulation in 1978. They note that deregulated industries often see huge short-term consolidation, and that this round could be part of that, since deregulation has no fixed schedule. 
But an engineer of airline deregulation, Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of political economy at Cornell University, disagrees. He said he never expected the industry to consolidate so widely, and still does not believe it will, because pure competition in an industry with high fixed costs would be too brutal for the players. "Those oligopolies would probably not fight to the death," he said.
But how large an oligopoly can the airline industry sustain? Six companies? Three? Even now, a quarter-century after deregulation, the answer still hovers somewhere above the clouds.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: STATEN ISLAND UP CLOSE; 
A Rise in Hunger Pangs in an Unexpected Place

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
Armed against the snow with bright winter jackets, young women with baby carriages and old men with carts stood on line and waited for food. Except for the snow, it was an average Thursday in front of Wendy De Shong-Neuhalfen's house on Post Avenue in Staten Island.
 Ms. Neuhalfen, executive director of New Direction Services, a food pantry, has been handing out food from her basement in Port Richmond since 1995. On this December day, 104 families trudged through nearly impassable streets to get 260 bags full of apples, rice, canned chili and other foodstuffs. Last month, Ms. Neuhalfen ran out of food and had to close for three weeks. 
Unsurprisingly, hunger in the city has risen with the terrorist attacks and the poor economy. According to the Food Bank for New York City, demand at soup kitchens and food pantries rose after Sept. 11 and has remained robust, with 69 percent of the kitchens and 77 percent of the pantries citywide reporting significantly increased demand last spring. But few people may know that hunger, although at a lower level, is a growing problem even on relatively affluent Staten Island. 
 "Hunger is a hidden problem," said the Rev. Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality, which runs a soup kitchen, food pantry and emergency overnight shelter. "We are a small bedroom community, and it would surprise people to know what is or isn't in their neighbor's kitchen." 
 Last month, the Rev. John Carlo, who runs the Christian Pentecostal Food Pantry in Concord, had to turn away 420 people. 
 "We have never in the last year seen the back wall of the pantry," he said. "Now we are seeing it all the time." 
 Job losses and high real estate prices have proven a toxic combination in the borough. 
 A lot of people on the North Shore had jobs related to the World Trade Center, Ms. Troia said. One-third of the families receiving Thanksgiving baskets from Project Hospitality, which is based in Port Richmond, lost someone in the terrorist attacks. 
 "There has been an incredible rise in rents on Staten Island," she added. "People are in the position of choosing between eating and having a roof over their heads."
 Growing urban hunger is a nationwide problem. Demand for food aid has risen 19 percent this year, according to a survey of 25 cities released last Wednesday by the United States Conference of Mayors. At the same time, nearly two-thirds of the surveyed cities reported that they had to reduce the amount of food they supplied to the poor.
 In New York, too, there have been budget cuts but many food organizations do not have the staff to seek to replace that money with private financing. Ms. Neuhalfen receives gets corporate money, but puts her staff of 15 volunteers to work packing bags of food rather than soliciting individual donations.
 Staten Island is home to five soup kitchens and no more than two dozen food pantries, while New York City as a whole has more than 1,000 such organizations. But, paradoxically, the relatively small hunger problem on Staten Island makes it harder to solve. 
 "We are not as well equipped to handle the increase because it hasn't been as much of a need as in other parts of the city," said Councilman Michael E. McMahon, who represents the North Shore. "It's a problem that has become acute over a short period of time." ERIKA KINETZ

The Aroma of Capitalism, Surprisingly Sweet

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Few South Bronx businesses receive compliments for sweet-smelling trash. But the Delbia Do Company, in a brown stucco building at Park Avenue and 138th Street, receives just such praise from its sanitation crews. 
 Delbia Do is a perfume factory, and it is the only one in the Bronx, according to Rafael Salaberrios, president of the Bronx Overall Development Corporation, and Darryl Do, whose parents, Dennis and Delbia, founded it in the 1960's. The aromas inside as well, from office to production line. About 20 workers mix, bottle and package the creations for customers like Caswell-Massey, the perfume and toiletries company. 
 Business is good, said Darryl Do. "It's said that in a poor economy fragrances and cosmetics will flourish," he said. "When people can't afford to buy a car or a fur coat they will spend a lesser amount on perfumes."
 The heart of the plant is its laboratory, where scents are made using ordinary tools like scales and measurement devices called micrometers. The lab has the look of a factory and the smell of a garden. It is filled with hundreds of bottles of aromatic chemicals and essential oils, from lemon to grapefruit to rose. 
 Mr. Do, slightly stooped and with a gentle voice, is officially retired but still helps with business matters and fragrance formulas. His wife, who is more effusive, handles the company's contracts and is a native Spanish speaker, a handy fact, given that the plant has many Latino workers. 
 Sometimes, the factory makes perfumes based on a formula furnished by the corporate client. But often clients want something original, in which case the company then brews up customized aromas or fragrances used as ingredients for other products, like shampoo. Using essential oils of lavender, geranium and chamomile, for instance, the company made the fragrance for a product called Ahava Dead Sea Bath Salt's Stress Melt. (The factory guards the identity of many corporate clients; they are sensitive about revealing that they contract out the development of scents.)
 Although the company is a wholesale venture, production is small compared with major perfume makers. Perhaps that was why people used to knock on the door and request single bottles of scent, something that stopped when the family removed the large sign from their storefront more than a decade ago. 
 Sometimes, corporate customers have trouble describing in technical terms what they want. Asking for something that smells "good" is common, Darryl Do said, but he needs s specifics, like "a floral top note and a subtle drydown" -- the scent that lingers after the alcohol in a perfume has evaporated.
 Often, customers request something that "smells like" a well-known perfume they used in high school. The elder Mr. Do has taught his son to replicate such scents, which can contain hundreds of ingredients that the perfumer must measure down to the gram.
 Modern technology can decipher the basic ingredients of a fragrance with a machine called a gas chromatograph. "But the other percentage," Dennis Do said, "you have to use your nose."
 "It's just like chefs," Darryl Do added. "You've still got Mario Batali coming up with a new red sauce." SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: The Nation: Q&A/Felix G. Rohatyn; 
New York's Cry for Help: Echoes of 1975, but a Different Tone

 BODY:
 A generation ago, New York City teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Now, the city government is facing huge deficits again. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who was an architect of the recovery last time, was asked by Sam Roberts of The New York Times to compare then and now.

Q. Are the principles that saved the city 25 years ago still applicable?

A. The principles are no different. They are to bring the budget into balance by some kind of an equitable combination of taxes and cuts. And the cuts, to maintain services ideally, should be accomplished in cooperation with the unions, and probably with some combination of attrition and productivity and freezing of wage increases for some period of time. And on the revenue side, a combination of taxes that is the least damaging to the economy of the city, beginning with the commuter tax. And when you're done with that, you're going to have to try to get the state government and the federal government to do some additional things.

Q. But the state government is in much worse shape this time.

A. That doesn't take away from the principle that the state ought to help you. It just means that in this particular case, the only thing the state can do is let you impose the commuter tax.

Q. What about the feds?

A. Even though that's politically difficult, it was also politically difficult in '75 to get federal assistance from Jerry Ford. And we finally got it. We got it when other states and local governments began to have trouble financing themselves because the credit markets were spooked by what was happening here. And I think you've got 46 states that are in terrible trouble this year. And that there ought to be some combination of mayors and governors and business and labor that ought to convince the Congress and the administration that having a three-year special assistance program for state and local governments is better for the country than letting these state and local governments eviscerate themselves and the national economy by raising taxes and cutting spending across the board.

Q. Are things worse now than then?

A. The facts make it more difficult. But that doesn't mean for instance that you shouldn't get the banks involved in some financing program for the city just because they're more interested in Argentina than they are in New York.

Q. Two other things seem to be missing: leadership and a sense of sacrifice.

A. Well, that is perfectly true. And that also goes to the issue of who the people are that you could put around the table to come up with a solution. Today you don't have that situation.

Q. Why not?

A. Partly because bankruptcy was such a prod.

Q. Are we a victim of our own success?

A. To some extent, because we've balanced the budget now for 20 years. Today there is no urgency because both the city and the state were very late in telling us the real problems here, which were clear several months ago that this thing was going to get very difficult. But because of the election everybody kind of shoved it under the rug.

Q. Is the city more or less vulnerable now after Sept. 11, given the mobility of business?

A. Oh, I think the city is more vulnerable. I think that if there is one huge difference between now and then it is the spirit of the city. Today you have the shadow of terrorism and the shadow of the war with Iraq.

Q. This isn't just Cassandra Rohatyn?

A. No, this is investment banker Rohatyn. Don't forget, even though I'm a pessimist and I always plan for the worst, it worked out. But if there's anything I learned, it's you have to get ahead of the crisis.
There's another thing that we deliberately never claimed credit for when we balanced the budget in the '70's, is that one of the things that truly helped us was inflation.

Q. Are there things the city simply can't afford to do anymore?

A. It may not be able to afford to do them, but if you stop doing them you may lose more than you gain.

HEADLINE: A Change in Flight Plans For Troubled Airlines 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Days of Coasting Are Gone" (Dec. 8), which described how the nation's big airlines may need to find a whole new way of doing business in order to survive: 
 Consider a recent scene from the new world of travel. Having braved a long line in security at the Fort Lauderdale airport a few weeks ago, a passenger finally arrived at the barrier, only to be sent back to check a bag that did not fit the new, stricter rules for carry-on luggage. The question for the airlines is this: Will that passenger fly again, unless he absolutely has to? 
In a climate of indiscriminate cost-cutting produced by the recession and 9/11, airlines seem not to distinguish between two very different types of cost savings: the efficiency-related (for example, decreasing the amount of time a jetliner spends on the ground) and the service-related, which effectively lower the quality of the product they sell and are equivalent to price increases. 
Since Sept. 11, the airlines have been saddled with a quality-of-service reduction, namely, a tightening in airport security that increases the time and the hassle factor associated with flights. Amazingly, instead of improving service on board to compensate for that, they have taken measures to further decrease the quality of their product. In addition to the cramped seating, there is now no food served on most flights. Carry-on regulations have been tightened, and rules on nonrefundable tickets are more strictly enforced.
I believe airlines also underestimate the elasticity of demand -- in this case the availability of substitutes for cramped, stressful flights. At the upper end of the market, business travelers are turning to corporate jets and videoconferencing. 
At the lower end, there are even more substitutes. In a study I published with a colleague at Cornell in the mid-80's, we found that when gasoline prices increased, people did not cancel vacations, but rather substituted holidays close to home for faraway vacations. The same seems to be happening now, as people substitute road travel for flying.

All the Shopping, All the Packages, All the Dog Bites

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
This is the busiest time of year for letter carriers, but some of them have more to worry about than aching backs from lugging heavy packages. 
The number of carriers who were bitten by dogs has risen recently, to the highest level in more than a decade.
 The Van Nuys postal district in Southern California, which encompasses Burbank and North Hollywood, reported more dog bites than anywhere else in the country. 
 Terri Bouffiou, a spokewoman for the postal service in Southern California, speculated that the rarity of screen doors in the area contributed to the problem. When the door opens, she said, "the dog bounds out of the house." DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Legacy of Power Cost Manipulation 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash., Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Two years ago this month, a record was set at the height of the West Coast energy crunch: an hour of electric power was sold for $3,250 -- more than a hundred times what the same small block had cost a year earlier.
 Now, power supplies are abundant and wholesale prices have plummeted. But the fallout from what state officials say was the largest manipulation of the energy market in modern times has continued to hit West Coast communities hard. 
 Here in Snohomish County, which has the highest energy rates in the state, more than 14,000 customers have had their electricity shut off for lack of payment this year -- a 44 percent increase over 2001. They have seen electric rate increases of 50 percent, as the Snohomish County Public Utility District struggles to pay for long-term power contracts it signed with companies like Enron at the height of the price run-up. 
Aided by charities, most customers have had their power returned within a day of being shut off, but others are forced to make choices about which necessities they can live without.
"It's a pretty tough thing trying to explain to your 5-year-old kid why the lights won't come on anymore," said Crystal Faye of Everett. "I didn't pay much attention to all that stuff about California and Enron, but it's certainly come home to hurt us now." 
Ms. Faye and her husband, Rick, who are unemployed, have had their power shut off twice this year.
Brianne Dorsey, a single mother, said she removed the baseboard heater in her home here and has had to rely on a small wood stove for heat, because she is $1,000 behind in paying her electric bills.
Faced with such tales tied to rate increases along the West Coast, states are trying to get back some of what they lost during 18 months when energy prices seemed to have no ceiling.
The decision this month by a federal regulatory judge that California utilities had been overcharged by $1.8 billion bolstered the case of Northwest utilities seeking refunds, officials of those utilities said. It also angered California officials, who say they will continue to press for a total of nearly $9 billion in refunds. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to decide on Northwest refunds in the spring.
No matter what the federal government decides, officials say their best hope for compensation is from a number of criminal investigations being pursued by Nevada and the three West Coast states -- Washington, Oregon and California. They liken their cause to state lawsuits against tobacco companies, which started as long shots but resulted in enormous settlements.
Aided by a guilty plea in October from a former trader for Enron, and by newly discovered internal documents describing how companies manipulated the energy market in 2000 and 2001, the West Coast states are hoping to get settlement money from more than a dozen energy trading companies.
The companies say they acted legally in taking advantage of a unique market condition, but state officials say the companies created a fake energy crisis.
At the height of the rise in energy costs in early 2001, the Bush administration said the West Coast's troubles were a precursor of what would happen if the nation did not build 1,900 power plants over the next 20 years.
But state officials in the hardest-hit areas say the crisis was never about energy shortages so much as it was about an epic transfer of wealth. They want payback -- in some cases for immediate relief to consumers who cannot pay their bills this winter.
Last month, the Williams Company, in Tulsa, Okla., agreed to a $417 million settlement with Washington, Oregon and California. While admitting no wrongdoing, Williams agreed to pay refunds and other restitution to the three states; in return, the states dropped an antitrust investigation.
Among large energy companies, the states are seeking refunds from the Mirant Corporation, Reliant Resources Inc., Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Enron.
"All of us on the West Coast have been hard hit by these rate increases, but the poor in this county have just been hammered," said Bill Beuscher, who runs the energy assistance program in Snohomish County. Mr. Beuscher said that in the first two weeks the winter energy assistance program was open this year, requests for financial aid were up 55 percent from same period last year.
The power trading companies named in criminal investigations and refund cases did not want to comment publicly while the cases were pending. But several of the companies that are fighting refunds have said in their public filings that the utilities, particularly in the Northwest, are trying to renege on legitimate long-term contracts. They said they did not act in collusion and explained that the highest prices were a result of severe market shifts brought in part by the Northwest drought.
In some cases, the power trading companies said, the utilities resisted buying shorter contracts, which would have cost them less. They also said that some Northwest utilities took advantage of the price spikes and sold power into the market themselves, only to come up short later. The companies said they expected to be vindicated when the government finishes its refund cases next spring.
Mr. Beuscher said he would like to see money from the Williams settlement be used to help people who cannot afford the rate increases. Consumers in Oregon and California have made similar pleas. But officials in all three states say that until there are larger settlements with the energy companies, consumers are unlikely to see relief.
"We hope that the Williams case serves as a template," said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the California attorney general's office, "because California was monumentally ripped off by these energy traders."
About seven million consumers in California, who were initially shielded from having to pay for runaway energy costs during the worst part of the state's deregulation debacle, are paying rate increases averaging 30 percent more than the pre-deregulation prices of 1996. The state has the highest energy rates in the nation, consumer advocates say, although the structure of the rate increase allows poor people and low energy users to escape the recent increases.
"I don't hold out a lot of hope that we will ever get significant refunds," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles. The group calculates that California power customers overpaid a total of $70 billion.
At the height of the energy troubles, the trading companies boasted of record profits in their quarterly reports. But many of those companies are now near bankruptcy as they cope with a downturn that has caused the energy trading sector to lose 80 percent of its value, according to Wall Street analysts.
"It's like the highwayman robbed us and then spent all the money on booze," Mr. Heller said.
The companies themselves blame the states. In one case that was heard this month, William A. Wise, chief executive of the El Paso Corporation, which is based in Houston, denied manipulating the market and blamed the officials who set up California's deregulated energy market for causing the price run-ups with "one bad policy after another."
Under a New Deal-era law, power companies can be forced to pay refunds if they have charged an "unreasonable and unjust" amount for electricity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which West Coast governors say did very little to restrain power traders during the height of the run-ups, will determine the exact refund amount, if any.
In the meantime, electric rates throughout the Pacific Northwest, once among the cheapest in the nation, have climbed as much as 50 percent.
California's problems stem from its chaotic attempt at energy deregulation, approved in 1996 and put in effect in 1998. The Northwest, with its tradition of publicly owned utilities, was drawn into the California crisis by a convergence of dry weather and freewheeling trading of its own.
Usually, the Northwest avoids price fluctuations by providing a steady stream of hydroelectric power, aided by abundant winter rainfall. But in late 2000, a drought in the Northwest forced utilities to buy power on the open market. Some utilities had also tried to sell power into the California market but were pinched by the drought.
At the same time, major energy traders were withholding blocks of power to create the appearance of further shortages, according to Enron memorandums discovered this year.
Refunds were once thought to be unlikely. But then came the memorandums -- many of them detailing schemes to manipulate the market under names like Death Star -- and the agreement in October by Timothy N. Belden, a former senior trader for Enron, to plead guilty to conspiring with others to manipulate the West Coast energy market.
Prosecutors say Mr. Belden is cooperating with investigations of the power trading companies.
"What really started the ball rolling were the smoking-gun memos, and then the guilty plea has helped as well," said Kevin Neely, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Justice. 
There is also continued bitterness among West Coast officials toward the Bush administration for waiting until June 2001 before putting price controls on the market, which immediately ended the large price spikes and rolling blackouts and brought stability.
Since then, power use has fallen and prices on the short-term market are about where they were before the energy run-up of 2000 and 2001.
"It was a fallacy to blame this crisis on a lack of new power plants," said Steven Klein, superintendent of Tacoma, Wash.'s public utility, Tacoma Power. "But it's a shame what came of this. It put a dent in a lot of family budgets, and forced some businesses to close."

HEADLINE: Peru's Former President Plots His Return to Power 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
In a secluded house in Kojimachi, a power neighborhood bounded by the British Embassy, a stone moat of the Imperial Palace and the ziggurat dome of the Parliament building, a man in a business suit known throughout Japan as Fujimori-san was methodically plotting his political comeback.
 Focus groups, fund-raising and a multicolor Web site to rally the faithful are in motion, Alberto K. Fujimori, the former president of Peru, said in an interview this week. Last week, a specially commissioned 100-page biography landed on desks in Washington, including a few at the White House. 
 "Why run for Congress?" Mr. Fujimori, 64, retorted dismissively in English, when told he could easily win a parliamentary seat in Japan, his land of self-exile. Switching to the Spanish of his native land, he said, "I want to be the ejecutivo." 
Or as Satomi Kataoka, his elegant, 30-something girlfriend, addressed him soothingly after a small sushi lunch here: "President." 
Just over two years ago, Mr. Fujimori interrupted a flight home to check into a Tokyo hotel and fax his resignation to Lima, ending 11 years as Peru's leader. He feared removal by Peru's Congress, which was responding to popular anger over what was widely viewed as a fraudulent presidential election and a televised videotape of Mr. Fujimori's right-hand man, Vladimiro Montesinos, handing cash to an opposition congressman. Ever since, the Peruvian authorities have tried to win his return for trial on charges ranging from corruption to murder. 
But now, in tacit recognition of Mr. Fujimori's gradual political resurrection, the beleaguered government of President Alejandro Toledo is not rushing to secure his return to Lima, even for a trial. Two weeks ago, Peruvian diplomats marched into Japan's Foreign Ministry with a new demand: that Japan shut down his Web site, www.fujimorialberto.com. 
While Japanese officials refuse to interfere with the Web site, the Toledo government drags its feet on extradition. Mr. Toledo's cabinet approved the extradition request last May, but work has not started on translating the 700-page document into Japanese. The translator said it would not be ready until next fall. 
The official Japanese position is that the request is a waste of time and money. The son of a Japanese-born couple, Mr. Fujimori was given a Japanese passport days after arriving here in November 2000. Also, there is no extradition treaty between Japan and Peru. Last summer, a Lima court dropped embezzlement charges against Mr. Fujimori's brother-in-law, Victor Aritomi, who stayed on here after serving as Peru's ambassador to Japan. 
"The Toledo government is losing interest," said Hidetaka Ogura, a former Japanese diplomat who is advising Peru on the extradition case. "There is more interest in economic cooperation." 
During the Fujimori decade, Japan funneled $3 billion in foreign aid to Peru. The Japanese public was captivated by the ethnic Japanese success story, forcing a succession of governments to make Peru one of Japan's largest aid recipients. With Mr. Fujimori's departure from Peru, and angry demonstrators outside the Japanese Embassy demanding his extradition, Japanese officials allowed aid contracts to expire. The Toledo government is far more interested in having aid restored than in having Mr. Fujimori returned. 
Speaking at the house of Hideaki Kase, a leading conservative intellectual, Mr. Fujimori said he never bothered to hire defense lawyers -- partly because he could not afford them, partly because he saw the charges brought against him in Peru as politically motivated. 
"There is no illegal enrichment," he said, ridiculing the prospects of Kroll Associates, the American investigative company, which started a search last month for any ill-gotten assets that Mr. Fujimori may have hidden. "In two years, no foreign bank accounts have been found," he said. "I don't have any accounts in Panama or anywhere else." 
In Tokyo, Mr. Fujimori lives alone in a 850-square-foot apartment, shopping and cooking for himself. Using office space in a hotel owned by Ms. Kataoka, he takes daily Japanese-language lessons and writes articles for his Web site. 
In the interview, Mr. Fujimori avoided talking about Mr. Montesinos, his disgraced intelligence aide who was convicted last summer of embezzling nearly $3 million in public funds. But, earlier this month, he addressed the charges in statements made for the biography. 
"No one knew that Montesinos was taking money for himself -- they found $77 million of his in Swiss bank accounts," Mr. Fujimori said in the biography, which was written to argue his case in Washington. 
Talking for more than an hour, Mr. Fujimori recalled visiting former President George Bush in Kennebunkport, Me., in 1997. As Peru's president, he said, he got along well with "Bush father." Now, with Republicans back in power, he said he believed that Washington would gain a new appreciation of his pro-business economic policies and his counterterrorism tactics. 
He said the criticism would shrink in the hard light of the post-Sept. 11 world. In a 1997 case that drew prosecutors' attention, but no charges, Mr. Fujimori directed a commando attack on the Japanese Embassy residence in Lima, where left-wing guerrillas had held 72 hostages for four months. Fourteen guerrillas, two soldiers and a hostage were killed. Two months ago in Moscow, he noted, Russian soldiers trying to rescue hostages held in a theater by Chechen guerrillas left 41 guerrillas and at least 129 hostages dead. 
In response to the Peruvian murder charges, Mr. Fujimori repeated rebuttals that he had no direct command over a Lima death squad unit that carried out two attacks in the early 1990's, killing a total of 25 people. Support came two weeks ago from a former Peruvian Army officer charged with heading the squad, Maj. Santiago Martin Rivas, who told congressional investigators, "Due to my military rank, I could never have reported to the president." 
With the United States planning military trials of terrorism suspects, Mr. Fujimori said Americans today might now understand why he resorted to military judges a decade ago. "Who dared to punish a terrorist leader?" he said. "Either they were freed or punished very lightly. Faceless judges and military courts -- this allowed punishment." 
For Americans, this authoritarian system of justice was symbolized by a military court's conviction in 1996 of Lori Berenson, a New York native, on charges of collaborating with Marxist rebels. At the time, the conviction focused intense American criticism on Mr. Fujimori and the military court system. But in the last 18 months, a civilian court retried and reconvicted Ms. Berenson, Peru's Supreme Court upheld the conviction and Mr. Toledo ruled out a presidential pardon. 
Today, in light of America's campaign against Al Qaeda, counterterrorism experts are taking a second look at Mr. Fujimori's success in breaking up the Maoist Shining Path group by tracking and capturing its shadowy leader, Abimael Guzman. 
Rebutting all charges against him as "political," Mr. Fujimori said worse massacres took place under his predecessor, Alan Garcia. Last month, followers of Mr. Garcia won 25 percent of the vote in regional elections, and some political pundits started talking in earnest about a Fujimori-Garcia contest shaping up for Peru's 2006 presidential election. 
Without saying so directly, Mr. Fujimori evidently hopes to follow Mr. Garcia's political strategy, staying out of Peru for several years until all charges are dropped, then returning on the shoulders of popular acclaim.
Indeed, instead of hiring lawyers, Mr. Fujimori has installed in Lima two architects of an embryonic political machine: Carlos Raffo, his former press aide, and Keiko Fujimori, his oldest daughter who served as first lady after his 1996 divorce. 
Meanwhile, he continues his methodical life, declining to show too many of his cards at one time. Offering a cryptic clue to a return date, Mr. Fujimori, an advanced Japanese speaker, said: "I am learning 30 new Japanese words a day, putting them in my notebook. When I leave, I will be speaking Japanese fluently."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Tough Times Translate Into Layoffs, Fewer Hours and Deprivation

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
Carlos Guevara sat hunched over a sewing machine in a Brooklyn garment factory, 10 hours a day, six days a week. Every 15 to 30 seconds, he would push a white cotton neck lining off to the side of his table.
 Six cents. 
 That is how much he earned for each one of those linings -- a nickel and a penny, for his pocket, for his family.
Each minute brought him and his family a bit closer to a meal. Each brought him a fraction of the way closer to paying the rent on the family's one-bedroom apartment in Richmond Hill, Queens -- one story below the elevated track of the J and Z subway and one story above the perpetually gloomy street below. 
As tough as the work was on his fingers, Mr. Guevara longs for those days to return. So does his wife, Blanca. She worked at the factory, too, earning about $400 a week in the summer of 2001. While Mr. Guevara earned about $600 a week at the factory, she always worked fewer hours than he did so she could spend time caring for their children: Reina, 5; Maroni, 4; and Oliver, 2.
But now neither Mr. Guevara nor his wife works at the factory. Mr. Guevara's hours were cut in August 2001 and, facing slackening sales, the factory closed the following October. Because his old job has vanished, he has spent much of the last year looking for a similar one.
"They used to have three columns of job openings," he said recently, sitting on a worn living room couch and holding up the classified listings in El Diario. "Now, maybe one."
At the charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, tales like the Guevaras' are common. "It's all too familiar at this point," said Robert Siebel, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, which has helped the Guevaras pay their utility bills. "I think we're dealing largely in most of our centers with people you'd consider the working poor. They have income, but their income is inadequate for some of their primary needs, particularly housing."

Help Here and There
 Like many other poor families in a slowing economy, the Guevaras are trying to avoid welfare by seeking employment -- whatever they can find.
"We have children," said Mr. Guevara, 47. "At this point, we're looking for anything."
Recently, he sewed eight dresses for a sweet 16 party for a friend's daughter. But the dazzling sequined gowns were more a favor for the friend than a way to sustain his own family. He naturally gave his friend a discounted rate, $640 for a month's effort. But he was grateful for that money, the equivalent of 10,667 white cotton neck linings.
Like many other poor families, the Guevaras have been helped by the Neediest Cases Fund, which provides money to seven of the oldest and most respected charities in New York.
In August, KeySpan Energy cut the family's gas because they were several months behind on paying their bill, which grew to $1,404.16 for cooking gas and an additional $720.81 for heating. Mrs. Guevara began to prepare food for her children on an electric hot plate.
In September, she went to the office of Rosa Orihuela, a caseworker for Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens. To help the family meet long-term needs, Mrs. Orihuela helped Mrs. Guevara set up a monthly schedule for paying bills. For immediate relief, Mrs. Orihuela gave Mrs. Guevara tuna fish, peanut butter and other foods that could be eaten without cooking and, with money that had been donated to the Neediest Cases Fund, she wrote a check for $410.93 to KeySpan to have the family's cooking gas restored.
"I felt really bad because she has these small children," Mrs. Orihuela said. "They had, at this point, no steady income, only whatever they make here and there."
Weeks later, as the weather turned colder, Mrs. Orihuela wrote another check, so the family would have heat again. But in October the heating gas was not yet restored; the Guevaras depended on the faint orange glow of a small space heater. It sat on the floor of the living room, a few feet from the large picture windows where Mr. Guevara displays examples of his handiwork in hopes that people will knock on his door and buy them.
The space heater purred around the clock for weeks until it was given a break after KeySpan received Mrs. Orihuela's second check -- $720.81 from the Neediest Cases Fund.
At the Catholic Charities administrative office in downtown Brooklyn, Mr. Siebel said the Guevara's case is a typical example of the modest and temporary nature of help for the working poor from the Neediest Cases Fund.
"They're asking for something very specific because they are concerned about making it to the next month," he said. "They're not looking for more than they need, and when they get back on their feet they're not back to us."
The Guevaras -- and countless others struggling to provide for their families but facing a loss of income -- have found that Neediest Cases has helped them survive particularly difficult times.
"It has a stabilizing influence," Mr. Siebel said. "With it, we're able to keep a person in housing as they pursue other income and career and training opportunities. Oftentimes it staves off something radical, like an eviction or a utility turnoff."
In some cases, charities use the money from the fund to provide a temporary cushion for people with little or no savings who have lost subsistence-level employment. In other instances, the fund helps provide job training for those lacking the skills that potential employers seek.
"We provide career counseling and job training for almost 5,000 people each week," said John Ruskay, the executive director of UJA-Federation of New York, an umbrella agency that is supported by the fund. "We provide 3,000 adults with E.S.L. -- English as a second language -- each week. We provide child care for 13,000 children a year."
Mr. Ruskay said charity plays a particularly important role for what he called an underserved population -- those who exist somewhere between the self-sufficient and the people who have to rely on government aid. "Those that are at the poverty level get a range of government services," he said. "Those that are working don't qualify for those. Hence, we need to provide them with things like additional food supplements, medical supplements, scholarships for preschool."

Juggling Jobs and Family
 For 13 years, Marie Fong-Sam, a single mother, worked two jobs to provide for her three children, Wendy, who is now 21, Johnny, now 18, and Tracy, 6.
For the last eight years, since she has lived in her own house in South Ozone Park, Queens, her day has begun at 6 a.m., when she wakes to prepare herself for work and Tracy for school. Ms. Fong-Sam has to be at her first job at 9:30, so by 7:30, she walks to the bus stop and catches the Q40 local for a 15-minute ride to the Sutphin Boulevard station, where she catches the E train for a ride to 42nd Street. There she transfers to the 2 train uptown to 149th Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx. A five-minute ride on the Bx4 bus takes her to her job as a school lunch helper at South Bronx High School, where she earns $11.25 an hour.
Two buses. Two trains. Two hours.
"I used to live in the Bronx," she said, explaining why she works at a job so far from home. She said she was happy with the job and loath to ask for a transfer.
At the high school, she helps prepare the equipment to serve thousands of children, and later, she sanitizes food trays. Her shift ends at 2 p.m.
Before she leaves, she calls her boss at the Parker Meridien Hotel on West 57th Street in Manhattan, where she works as a housekeeper.
"This is Marie," she says. "Do you need me today?"
Sometimes, her boss says he is unsure. "Don't worry," she replies. "I'll call back again."
At $18.57 an hour, the job at the hotel pays much more than the one at the school, but it is less steady.
"I need to show them that I want my job," she said. "I'll come in for three hours, four hours, anything they have."
For 15 years, Ms. Fong-Sam worked a late-afternoon and evening shift at the hotel, starting an hour after she left the school and finishing at 10:30 p.m. With another ride on the E train and the Q40 bus, she was able to get home before midnight.
The two jobs allowed her to pay her monthly mortgage of $944, her utility bills and even the $240 monthly tuition for Tracy, who is in first grade at a parochial school.
"But then Sept. 11 happened," she said.
A week later, she was laid off by the hotel as the city faced a sudden decline in tourism.
With her expenses mounting, Ms. Fong-Sam sought help from the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, another of the seven agencies supported by Neediest Cases. 
"When she first came in she was overwhelmed and just really tired from the struggle," said Hilary Kleine, her social worker from the Brooklyn Bureau. On top of it all, Ms. Fong-Sam's refrigerator would frequently break, and her food would sometimes spoil.
The bureau gave her $950 for a new refrigerator, $317.20 for her oil bill and $300 for food. Ms. Kleine recalled that Ms. Fong-Sam called her shortly after the new refrigerator was delivered. "They were so excited to have ice cream," she said.
In the spring, she was offered a full-time job at the hotel on a morning shift, but she did not want to risk giving up her school lunch job, which has health benefits.
Now, she works at the hotel from 9 to 4 on Saturdays and Sundays, though she earns only a fraction of her former income. She is one of the most senior employees to have been laid off, and could be working full time again if the hotel needs two more people for her old shift. "But if they decide to take only one, I'm going to be left behind," she said.

Ripples From Trade Center
While many New York jobs like Mrs. Fong-Sam's have been cut or lost as an indirect result of the attack on the World Trade Center, many of those who worked in the twin towers have themselves asked for charity for the first time in their lives.
Last year, The Times ran a special campaign to raise money for a fund that helped needy victims of the trade center tragedy.
When the money in that fund had been spent or allocated to ongoing projects, some of those who lost work in connection with the trade center attack received help from Neediest Cases.
One of those was Nery Veras, 43, who was a bus boy at the Marriott Financial Center hotel across West Street from the twin towers. He and his wife, Paulina Ventura, 44, tried for months to survive without asking for help. But with a rent of $656.04 a month and two children, Nery Jr., 9, and Fredeliza, 15, living at home in the West 140's in Upper Manhattan, it was not easy. In June, they had to turn to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies.
Judith Milone, assistant director of member services for the federation, another Neediest Cases beneficiary, said that by the time Mr. Veras applied for help, the federation had spent the money from the 9/11 fund. She noted that there were more stringent guidelines for helping people with money from the Neediest Cases Fund than with the money earmarked for victims of 9/11, because this year the Neediest Cases Fund had to do the double duty of helping trade center victims and those in poverty. As it does every year, the federation requires that people helped by Neediest Cases prove that after receiving the grant they will be self-sufficient -- a stipulation that was waived for terror victims.
The hotel reopened in January, and Mr. Veras got his old job back. Because he was able to show future income, he was eligible for help from Neediest Cases, Ms. Milone said. "He's one of the fortunate ones," she said.
After Mr. Veras described the amount of money he owed his landlord, the federation authorized a grant of $1,312.08 for two months' rent, so the family could avoid being evicted from their one-bedroom walk-up apartment.

Finding a New Start
Another man who lost time at work because of the destruction of the trade center was Nainsingh Bist of Valley Stream, N.Y. He was a shift captain and sommelier at Windows on the World.
"I don't feel comfortable asking for money," he said.
Mr. Bist was born in Nepal and grew up in Bombay. He moved to New York in 1982, and started working in the restaurant business right away. He worked at two restaurants, first as a waiter and then as a captain and sommelier, before joining Windows on the World in June 1996.
It was the peak of his career, but he thought it would be a little more long-lived. "After that, nothing seems right," he said. "I never thought I would look for another job."
But on Sept. 11, he watched the collapse of the towers from 20 blocks away. He lost his job and many co-workers.
Gripping his temples with thumb and forefinger, he recalled the sleepless nights that followed the terrorist attack and the horrific images it created. He found a part-time job at the Garden City Hotel, where he began working on Sept. 17, 2001. But the memories of his old job and deceased co-workers kept returning, and he found he was unable to concentrate on work. "I couldn't think," he recalled. "I was blanked out."
That was before the eight funerals he attended.

Grief, Fear and Counseling
 Compounding the emotional turmoil was the loss of income he faced. He worked at the part-time job for four months while collecting unemployment insurance benefits for his days off. He found that between the job and the unemployment benefits he was earning about $405 a week. "It was not enough to support the house," he said.
As a way to cope with mounting grief and worries about meeting his expenses, Mr. Bist attended group counseling sessions in Syosset, N.Y., offered by FEGS, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation and formerly known as the Federation Employment and Guidance Service.
Gina Tudisco, a counselor at the agency, helped him and other survivors work through their apprehensions.
"In order for them to cope on a job they had to have that emotional strength," she said. "Although they all wanted to get back to work, psychologically they weren't able to do it.
"You get a lot out of talking about your emotions and listening to each other in a group," she said.
For Mr. Bist, the sessions proved to be a big help. "They gave us hope," he said. "They lifted us up."
Mr. Bist told Ms. Tudisco that he was worried about the health insurance for his wife and three children. She applied for a grant of $1,400 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy two months of health insurance for the family when their benefits expired, which was last month. They were not eligible for Medicaid because Mr. Bist owns his home, he said.
Not having to worry about the insurance for two months enabled Mr. Bist to concentrate his efforts on starting a new business, the Tandoor Grill, an Indian restaurant in Rockville Centre, N.Y. "It's a new business and the roots are still weak," he said. "I can't even think about insurance right now."
If the restaurant succeeds, he said, he will not have to worry about his family's health insurance again.
That is the future that Mr. Bist is hoping for. "I never had to apply for charity before," he said. "This is the first time, and I hope it is the last."

HEADLINE: On West Side, Rail Plan Is Up And Walking 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A once-quixotic proposal to turn an abandoned rail line on the far West Side of Manhattan into an elevated public promenade has been formally embraced by the Bloomberg administration, almost exactly a year after the Giuliani administration moved to demolish the hulking structure.
 Now, rather than seeking to tear down the 1.45-mile railroad viaduct, known as the High Line, New York City has asked the federal Surface Transportation Board to grant a certificate of interim trail use, which would preserve the route as a distinctly urban stretch in the national rails-to-trails network. 
 "We think the High Line, ultimately converted into a park, will enhance the character of the entire far West Side," Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said in an interview on Friday.
"The High Line will remain up," he said, "and in conjunction with this we would seek to rezone portions of the areas surrounding the High Line in order to accommodate residential development. We think the High Line can be an important amenity." 
The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, said, "It's a huge step in the right direction." 
That is not easy to envision while standing in the dark shadow of the viaduct, which has all the charm of an el. But it becomes clearer on the deck, where trees, weeds and wildflowers among rusting tracks and switches create a verdant swath through Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea and the Gansevoort Meat Market.
As a practical matter, the CSX Corporation, which manages the High Line, is still under an order from the Surface Transportation Board to pursue demolition, an outcome sought by Chelsea Property Owners, which objects to the structure as a dismal, dangerous blight that cannot be rehabilitated feasibly, attractively or economically -- especially at a time of budget deficits.
Douglas Sarini, president of the group, which represents commercial owners along the High Line route, did not reply to requests for comment.
Earlier this year, however, the group said in one of its fliers: "Money doesn't grow on trees. And the last time we checked, it wasn't growing in the weeds of the High Line, either."
In fact, there is no money now to create a public space, nor even a plan to follow, although a private group called Friends of the High Line intends to sponsor a competition for ideas early next year.
What last week's filing does do is ally the city firmly with efforts to rehabilitate the 69-year old High Line, which runs about 30 feet above sidewalk level from Gansevoort to 34th Streets on a path that primarily parallels Tenth Avenue. The line, which in some places runs through or has spurs into buildings, linked the warehousing and industrial district along the Hudson River to the rest of the nation until 1980, and has been deteriorating since then.
"I understand that for property owners and many in the community that if you have to choose between the High Line as it currently is and no High Line, bringing it down makes sense," Mr. Miller, the Council speaker, said. "But I believe -- and I think the administration has also seen -- that when you consider the possibilities for a preserved and reused High Line as a public space and a signature moment in the New York landscape, that the positives are almost limitless."
Robert Hammond, co-founder of the Friends of the High Line, said the city's action was "at the top of my Christmas list." Two years ago, his well-connected but fledgling group faced considerable skepticism when it suggested that the High Line might one day rank with the Promenade Plantee in Paris, an old railroad viaduct that has been turned into a landscaped walkway.
A year ago, the group was in court, along with the City Council and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, challenging the tentative demolition agreement reached on Dec. 20, 2001, in the last days of the Giuliani administration. The High Line's backers argued that because the agreement involved property easements along the route of the viaduct, it should have been subject to the city's uniform land-use review procedure, known as Ulurp.
In March, they won a ruling from Justice Diane S. Lebedeff of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who wrote that the administration's "determination to forego Ulurp review was undertaken without 'lawful procedure' and was an 'error of law.' " The ruling is being appealed. What is also holding up demolition is that a final, signed agreement has yet to be reached. And in its filing with the Surface Transportation Board, the city expressed "serious doubt" that such an agreement could ever be attained.
Instead, Mr. Doctoroff said, the city now hopes to reach a new agreement with CSX in the next few months, permitting "interim trail use," although he cautioned that this is a legal term; it does not mean that the viaduct would be open to strollers, skaters and bicyclists any time soon.
"A significant investment will have to be made," Mr. Doctoroff said.
In its filing, the city said that to establish an interim trail use, it would be willing to assume full responsibility for management of the right-of-way and any legal liability. 
Without taking a position, Laurie Izes, a consultant to CSX, who is overseeing the High Line, said the company was "interested in a responsible and expeditious solution" and would review the filing if the board granted the city's request for interim trail use.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Old Tracks, New Use"The Bloomberg administration is backing plans to turn a rusting, abandoned elevated rail line on the far West Side of Manhattan into a promenade, rather than tearing it down, as has been proposed. The 1.45-mile railroad, known as the High Line, served industries along the lower Hudson River waterfront from the 1930's until 1980, giving them a direct rail link to the rest of the nation.

It would be hard to dispute the proposition that New Yorkers are nocturnal creatures. After all, the city comes alive after dark and -- at least, as Frank Sinatra used to say -- it never sleeps.
 Last night was the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, a good opportunity to explore what New York City residents would do with an extended period of darkness -- 886 minutes, to be precise -- from 4:32 p.m. yesterday, when the sun set, until 7:18 a.m. this morning, when it rose again, according to Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. 
 The solstice itself occurred last night at 8:14 p.m., Mr. Morrin said. In the northern hemisphere, it marked that bleak and lightless instant when the sun was furthest to the south in relation to the equator. 
John Donne described just such a moment in his poem "A Nocturnal Upon St. Lucy's Day," which was published in 1633. 
"The sun is spent, and now his flasks/Send forth light squibs, no constant rays," Mr. Donne wrote. "The world's whole sap is sunk."
Sunken sap and squibs of light aside, many New Yorkers planned to celebrate the solstice as a joyous occasion. There was, for example, an afternoon of choral music and pagan rituals yesterday at the Musical Theater Works on Lafayette Street.
The event was sponsored by the Coven Kyklos Ton Asterion, a Wiccan group, and the Four Winds Earth Chorus, which describes itself on its Web site as an volunteer organization created to perform and promote "the sacred music of Pagan, Native American and Earth-Honoring peoples."
Before the advent of the light bulb, said one of its founding members, Heather Griffith, watching the darkness of night encroach on the daylight was a harrowing experience. Back then, there was a mistaken impression that the sun might vanish altogether.
"So what we're celebrating," Ms. Griffith explained, "is the sun is coming back. We'll have our ritual concert, which is open to the public, but I know various people who will stay up all night with their friends and covens, singing to the sun."
For those with a more ecumenical bent, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine held its 23rd annual winter solstice concert last night. It featured Paul Winter on the saxophone, Barry Olsen on the marimbas, Eugene Friesen on the cello, and the Forces of Nature Dance Theater Ensemble.
As sunset approached yesterday, inquiries were made to a handful of businesses that, presumably, would flourish under the cover of darkness.
At Rosetta Lighting, a lamp and light bulb store on West 45th Street, the manager, Ray Ramirez, was asked if he had noticed a sudden spike in sales.
"No," he said glumly. "This has been one of those fateful years. Business is very bad."
A similar question was posed to the bartender at the Holland Bar, a cozy grotto on Ninth Avenue behind the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
"The longest day of the year has nothing to do it," said the bartender, who gave his name as Savoy George. "We have hard-core alcoholics here. This is where people go to die of liver cirrhosis. If we're open, the customers will come."
On a hunch, an electronic message was sent to the New Jersey Real Vampire Association. It seemed like a sure bet that vampires would appreciate a long, dark night, although representatives of the group did not respond to efforts to reach them.
So it was left to Isaac Bowman, an unemployed man who was milling about on Seventh Avenue as dusk approached, to offer his own plans for the coming night.
"I'm going to a hotel," Mr. Bowman said. "Looks like I've got a little more time to sleep tonight."

HEADLINE: A Lean Season for Charity on the City Sidewalks 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Apparently, New York is not in the giving vein this holiday season.
 Charitable donations from pedestrians have declined this year, according to nonprofit organizations, sidewalk Santas and the other solicitors who collect tens of thousands of dollars every year for the needy on the streets of Midtown Manhattan. 
 Volunteers of America, a nonprofit organization that assigns 10 bell-ringing Santas to Midtown every Christmas season, reports that donations are down 25 percent from last year, itself a lean giving year because of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
The Salvation Army, which has roughly 1,000 bell-ringers soliciting contributions at 300 sites in the New York area this season, says kettle donations are down at least 20 percent from last year. 
"People don't realize, a lot of people depend on those little red kettles," said Craig Evans, a spokesman for the Salvation Army.
The group uses the kettle donations to provide presents and meals to needy families on Christmas, as does Volunteers of America. Both groups report an increase in needy families requesting assistance this year.
"We really depend on the small street donations," said Linda McNeil, a spokeswoman for the Volunteers of America. "We normally raise $50,000 from kettle donations, but it doesn't look like we'll make that this year."
James Grant, a Salvation Army volunteer who stood at Madison Avenue and 58th Street yesterday, said: "There's not as much generosity this year because the spirit is dying. Last year, people had 9/11 as a reason. Now they're using it as as an excuse." 
Mr. Grant and his wife, Ann, stood next to a hot-dog vendor outside the rear entrance to the F. A. O. Schwarz toy store. The couple exhorted passers-by to pitch money in their traditional red plastic pot.
Depending upon whom you ask, this season is yielding less in donations because of the sagging economy, fewer tourists or the weather, which has not exactly resembled a winter wonderland.
Still, holiday spirit was prevalent on Fifth Avenue yesterday. Outside F. A. O. Schwarz, young volunteers with Santa hats and cardboard cups asked passers-by for change. The James Brown song "Super Bad" blared from the radio of a sidewalk vendor selling designer knockoff handbags. He also sold photographs of the Manhattan skyline, with or without the World Trade Center. 
The aroma of roasting chestnuts mingled with a smorgasbord of foreign accents and the honking of gridlocked taxis. People filed past wearing sandwich-board signs advertising sales on gentlemen's suits, cameras or bikini waxing.
But still, "it's nothing like the big years of the 80's and 90's," said Frank Henderson, 70, of Harlem, who has sold pencils on the crowded sidewalk in front of the Cartier jewelry store at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street every December for the past 35 years.
Mr. Henderson, who was holding an actual tin cup with pencils in it, wore a sign around his neck announcing that he was blind. His 13-year-old guide dog, Max, lay at his feet.
"I used to be able to make $90 in three hours," he said.
Things did not seem so bad yesterday either, as dollar bills flowed into his cup. He promptly transferred them to his pocket.
Jaymes Everett, 65, a retired electrician from the Bronx who has played Santa in front of Saks Fifth Avenue for three years, said shoppers have been long on excuses and short on money this year.
"I'm hearing, 'I'll be back,' or 'I don't have the money right now,' " he said. "People say, 'I gave at the other block,' or 'I mailed it in.' Suddenly everyone's in a rush, or they don't speak English."
Though things seemed tough on the sidewalks, there are areas in Manhattan where charity never seems to go out of style. 
For 63 years, the Salvation Army has sent a brass band to play Christmas carols for the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant 21 on West 52nd Street. Yesterday, the band played for diners who looked up from their cigars, Scotch and steak tartare and dropped cash or checks into the tambourines passed around by band members.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING; 
Conner Is Out of the America's Cup Competition but Not Down

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The wind was gusting to 35 knots, the waters on the Hauraki Gulf roiling fiercely. The America's Cup yachts had been docked all day, so no one ashore could believe that a 60-year-old skipper ventured out in his 24-foot sailboat.
 "I got permission," the skipper, Dennis Conner, yelled to the harbor patrolman standing in the tower. "Go ahead, check." 
 Conner pulled into the open water recently with a five-person crew, sailing toward the starting line of a rum race. 
"Yeah, a bunch of kids and yahoos from the yacht club get out here and try to run each other over," Conner said. "Then they meet back at the bar and get drunk."
Conner, the old man at sea, is still a shot-and-a-beer guy trapped in a Moet & Chandon world.
His yacht was knocked out of the America's Cup competition last month, more than two months before the Auld Mug will be presented. Now, Mr. America's Cup is tending tomatoes and feeding chickens at his base here. He will stay until the final in February, pay for this Stars & Stripes challenge by speaking to sponsors and taking potential sponsors sailing aboard a spectator yacht.
"I wasn't good enough; I take responsibility," he said of the New York Yacht Club's campaign. Conner knows he picked the wrong mix. He decided to train in Long Beach, Calif., instead of New Zealand. The backers committed late. He signed his contract with the yacht club late, started fund-raising late, arrived in Auckland late and was finished by the quarterfinals. In the total-commitment world Conner created for the sport, that is not how the game is played anymore. 
"When I started in '74, we only spent $1.1 million for the whole campaign," said Conner, who has mounted nine Cup campaigns. "We didn't launch our boat until May and the Cup was in September, and there were only 12 in the crew. I think we spent $3 million in 1980."
Conner's budget for the 2003 Cup was $45 million, half the $90 million spent by the Swiss pharmaceutical magnate Ernesto Bertarelli and by the software entrepreneur Larry Ellison. The boats backed by those billionaires, Alinghi and Oracle, are still racing.
The prestart for the rum race was still 10 minutes away when Conner tacked the boat toward the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, a nondescript split-level ivory building along the rocky Auckland shore.
"See that," he said, pointing from maybe 100 yards away. "That's where they keep the Cup. Right there. The trophy is in that building." 
Conner, the only man to lose and recapture the world's oldest sporting trophy, is further from the grail than he has been in 30 years -- maybe too far to clutch it again.
"I think there's a good chance this could be it," said Conner, who won the Cup in 1974, 1980, 1987 and 1988.
If the Swiss boat Alinghi wins, the Cup is going to Europe.
For now, Conner waddles around his base, barbecuing red snapper and steak for his remaining crew, looking for the next draft choice and a Friday night victory on the water.
Conner's competing in an Auckland rum race is like Michael Jordan's showing up at the downtown Y for an afternoon pickup game.
His crew was international, with fairly wide-ranging experience. Vince Brun, a transplanted Brazilian considered one of the greatest yachtsmen in the world, trimmed the mainsail, as he had on Stars & Stripes. Two of Conner's other sailors were also aboard: the trimmer Morgan Trubovich, a native New Zealander now living in Southern California, and Brian Terhaar, a hulking grinder from San Diego whom they call Bowwow.
Eventually, the winds calmed to about 25 knots, and a gaggle of boats appeared for the prestart. Next to the sleek 40-and 50-footers on the water, Conner's boat was the tiniest, a Ross-780 Trailer Sailer, the Kiwi Menace II.
He nailed the start in a tight jam of sails and sterns. Some of the larger boats eventually caught and passed Conner's. Trying to make up ground after rounding the second buoy, he was on a collision course with a mammoth rusted freighter. Conner navigated to his right, with maybe 10 yards to spare.
"Good on ya', Dennis," a man from another boat said. Well done.
The Kiwis hated Conner less than 10 years ago. He called one of their own a loser after a race and once labeled a Kiwi designer a cheater. A popular bumper sticker in this nation of 3.5 million people used to read, "Dirty Dennis." 
But Conner wore them down with his candor, his nasal drone, his everyman longevity and the fact that he is one of a few syndicate bosses left whose crew members' nationality actually resembles that of the boat. Being a sailing legend does not hurt here, either. When he went to a Luciano Pavarotti concert three years ago, 5,000 New Zealanders began chanting Conner's name.
"The people on the streets, the working class, they pull for me," he said, heading for the third mark. "The richies? They go for whatever billionaire they happen to like at that moment."
Part of Conner still needs to tell everyone that his father was a fisherman, that he did not come from money or privilege.
"Has Larry Ellison been on the cover of Time?" he said.
He tells you how he sold all 31 of his America's Cup boat models to help pay for his last campaign and owes about $2 million this time. "But I have a plan," he began. "I'm going to sell one of my boats."
He may be cash poor, but Conner is worth $4.1 million, and he admits that he has a good life. He lives in San Diego with his second wife, Daintry, a 32-year-old from Greenwich, Conn., who believed in his relative bare-bones quest as much as he did.
"It was like a fairy tale to her, a ticker-tape parade up Fifth Avenue, turn right up 44th Street," he said, alluding to the New York Yacht Club. "She envisioned it."
What's wrong with American sailing?
"If you had kids, you wouldn't want them to be sailors," Conner said. "You want them to go to the best schools you could afford. Our best and brightest aren't encouraged to stick with this sport.
"Here, because the sailing pays so well relative to the rest of the economy, it's a great way to increase your station in life and your happiness quotient. If you're a great sailor here, it's better from a financial standpoint than being a doctor, lawyer or a businessman. I think the best-paid person in all of New Zealand is in pro sports. You know who it is? Tiger Woods's caddie."
The double takes outnumbered the waves in the Hauraki Gulf, with everyone wondering how they got to race against Conner. Not that Conner was above anyone. When a boatful of young, aggressive Kiwi sailors jibed left and seemed to have passing rights, Conner went right and came within inches of planting the side of his boat into their stern. They began raising their voices.
"Don't look at them," he said. "Don't look at them."
Like cutting someone off during a rush-hour commute, when you don't look, it means you are just oblivious, not malicious. The Kiwis wanted him to take his penalty turn, a 270-degree turn that essentially kills your position, but Dirty Dennis kept tacking along. He finished strong.
To the surprise of Brun and the crew, Conner cut across the entire fleet of another class beginning a race, waving to each skipper as his boat came within a few feet of them, like an overseas jaywalker pleading ignorance with the locals: "Thank you, thank you."
"I can't believe we made it," said Brun, who has been in his share of scrapes. 
The race over, Conner walked into his food supply shack when he got off the boat. He brought American mayonnaise, his own pork and beans, as if it were a long camping trip. "The richies have their own personal chefs, but I cook for my guys," he said. 
He poured himself a coffee cup full of Mount Gay Rum. "My sponsor," Conner said, hoisting the bottle. He added maybe two tablespoons of Diet Coke to top it off. Then Conner drove down to the yacht club bar to find out the results.
"It's Din-nis," the crowd whispered. His boat finished 5th out of 12, but because of its size he won the competition by 10 minutes on handicap. The prize was a bottle of Mount Gay Rum. Conner took the microphone from the host.
"These guys wanted me to take my penalty out there, but I'm giving them something more precious," he said, handing the bottle to the crew he cut off. "They deserve it."
The crowd raised glasses and clapped for the rotund American they once hated. Glenn Cunningham, wearing Birkenstocks and jeans, was among them. 
"He was public enemy No. 1," Cunningham said. "But over the years, you realize he's such a competitor. He's a warrior. He sheds a tear, you know? How many other America's Cup people come in here and drink with us?" 
In the bar, how many people Conner cut off does not seem to matter much anymore. How many people he has made feel small to make himself feel big is not the issue, either. At his age, the grievances ebb like the tide. Left is an old sailor, 60 in his gait but 20 in his mind, walking out of the yacht club that keeps the Cup that he used to own. 
"Forget the four wins, it's only been lost three times and I've lost it twice," Conner said with a rueful smile. He kept walking. A salty breeze caked his face and the sun receded behind the harbor bridge.
What will he do now that he is out of this competition?
"I'm here," Conner said. "I'm still in it. I'm part of it. There's another rum race next week."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Verizon Workers Laid Off In Westchester and Putnam

BYLINE:  By Nancy Haggerty

 BODY:
About 250 Verizon employees based in Westchester and Putnam found themselves out of work Thursday as part of the company's layoff of 2,400 workers statewide.
 Verizon, which operates in 29 states, Washington and Puerto Rico, attributed the cutback to the slumping economy, consumers' use of alternate technology and losses associated with the mandated sale and lease of its telecom network. 
 The company had employed 2,500 people in Westchester and more than 100 in Putnam, said a Verizon spokesman, John Bonomo. He said its dozens of offices in those counties would remain open.
Mr. Bonomo declined to say how many jobs were lost locally, but the Communication Workers of America, the union representing the majority of those affected, said casualties included 238 field technicians, as well as drivers, clerical workers and others.
Other companies in the area have also laid off workers recently. Last month, the Bank of New York laid off 51 of 71 workers in Westchester involved in employee investment, according to Robert Lillpopp, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor.
Clyde Jones, an account executive with the federally financed One-Stop Employment Center in White Plains, said that Michael Anthony Jewelers of Mount Vernon had also announced the layoff of about 100 workers. 
Mr. Lillpopp said his office had not received notice of any other pending cutbacks in the area.
"We're still holding our own in Westchester County in regard to what's occurring throughout the U.S.," said Sal Carrera, the county's director of economic development. Nancy Haggerty

HEADLINE: A Silver Lining to Scandals: More Are Drawn to Accounting 

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH 

 BODY:
JACOB M. KOLLAKUZHIYIL had been thinking for some time of moving on from his midsize accounting firm in Manhattan, where he had worked five years, to one of the big players. Mr. Kollakuzhiyil, a certified public accountant, wanted to crunch numbers for national and multinational companies instead of the smaller accounts he had been handling.
 So this summer, when he received a number of phone calls from headhunters, he readily agreed to the interviews. Five weeks later, he had a new employer. 
 "I was a little surprised," said Mr. Kollakuzhiyil, who began work at Ernst & Young in late October. "I thought it was going to be a little more difficult to find a job than it was."
Mr. Kollakuzhiyil's experience, it appears, is not all that unusual. Despite -- and maybe even partly because of -- the drubbing that the reputation of accountants has taken lately, they seem to be faring pretty well in the job market, both nationally and in New York.
The large accounting companies, and especially the big four -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young and KPMG -- have absorbed accountants (and their clients) from their imploded former competitor Arthur Andersen and are still hiring others. Not only that, accounting is gaining, not declining, in popularity as a major in colleges.
As with most businesses, companies looking to hire accountants had a tough time finding people during the recent boom years, as many C.P.A.'s joined dot-coms and other start-ups. The accounting industry experienced the hangover once the party ended, but it now seems to have revived better than most.
For one thing, accounting is not cyclical; just as people must eat even in bad times, companies must do their books even when those books look bleak. And just as companies turn to their sales forces to make them rich when the economy is booming, they look to accountants to make them frugal when the economy sours.
"Part of the reason I picked accounting is that no matter what the economy is going through, you're always going to need an accountant," said Melanie R. Cobb, a student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who spent last summer as an intern at Deloitte & Touche and just accepted a job with its Parsippany, N.J., office.
The pay isn't bad, either. A survey released in November by Robert Half International, a recruiting firm for the financial industry, showed that in New York, where salaries are the highest in the country, a beginning accountant in audit, tax and management services at a large public accounting firm can expect to earn $54,000 to $63,000, a 1.6 percent increase over last year. A senior accountant in such a firm can expect to make $72,800 to $91,900 in 2003, an increase of 2.8 percent over the current year.
Paradoxically, the accounting scandals that have roiled corporate America over the last year may actually have made accounting more attractive to young people. In a recent survey in the CPA Personnel Report newsletter, accounting professors agreed that the scandals have raised accounting's visibility among students and increased its desirability as a possible career option. The article was headlined: "It's Hot! It's Sexy! It's ... Accounting?"
"I think the green eyeshade has been discarded and it's cool to be an accountant," said Lisa P. Young, director of recruiting for Ernst & Young.
T. Edward Hollander, director of the M.B.A. program in professional accounting at Rutgers, said the increased popularity of his program this year -- it had 115 applications rather than the typical 50 -- "may have a lot to do with the publicity" over accounting scandals.
"When students read that accountants are so important to the economy, they wonder whether they should go into it," Mr. Hollander said. "The effect has been positive."
The scandals may be helping in another way. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires more stringent procedures for top executives to sign off on financial statements. Those executives, in turn, are making underlings do likewise. And all those senior managers need expert advice.
"Sarbanes-Oxley has created enormous job opportunities for people," said Jeffrey R. Hoops, partner with Ernst & Young and president-elect of the New York State Society of C.P.A.'s.
The stumbling economy has also probably increased the lure of a profession that offers job security and good money. Whatever the reason, the number of students who majored in accounting rose by 2 percent in the 2000-01 academic year, after declining in the boom years of the late 1990's, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. And Beatrice Sanders, the institute's director of academic and career development, says numbers for 2001-02 appear to show even more interest in the field.
On the demand side, a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers on the degrees projected to be most desired by companies this academic year showed that accounting jumped to No. 1 from No. 3 last year across the nation, and remained at No. 1, where it was last year, in the Northeast.
The public accounting firms are just now finishing up the bulk of their college hiring and preparing for the busy tax season. But they are expected to continue adding people next year at a strong clip.
Blane Ruschak, national director of campus recruiting for KPMG, for example, said that while campus hiring for 2001 and 2002 remained "pretty flat," at about 200 people in the New York metropolitan area, the firm expects the number to be "slightly up" for 2003.
And Cindy Beeman, KPMG's national director of recruiting, who handles the hiring of experienced accountants, said that in the 2002 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, KPMG hired 800 such professionals in New York and that the company will probably do the same this year.
"The level of business hasn't gone away, it's increasing," Ms. Beeman said.
It is unclear exactly what effect the demise of Arthur Andersen will have on the job market. While the large firms did buy many practices from Andersen, both in New York and across the country, those accountants also had many clients to keep them busy.
The Andersen people by now have "filtered out of the system," said Al Tretola, a C.P.A. and principal with the Gotham Search Group, accounting recruiters in Manhattan.
But others say many new and experienced professionals who had offers from Andersen are still out there looking.
Michael A. Godlewski, a senior at Rutgers, said he began his job search in October, interviewing with five firms in Manhattan and New Jersey, including PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte & Touche. Although he has yet to nail down a job (he has one offer pending), he remains optimistic. 
"I feel the market is definitely there, especially with the collapse of Andersen," Mr. Godlewski said. "It brings a lot of opportunity. There's so much more work because of the focus on audits."

Q: President Bush took office two years ago. Give him a midterm grade.
A minus/B plus. He rallied the country after 9/11. He has been clear-cut 
in his vision on the war on terrorism. 
He gets an A minus for the economy? 
On the economy I would give him a lower grade, probably a C.
Did you support the president's firing of his economic team? And was it handled well?
As far as Mr. O'Neill is concerned, it was handled in very rough fashion. This is a tough town. I appreciated Mr. O'Neill's candor. It's all too lacking around this town -- and in this administration. I did not know Mr. Lindsey at all, and perhaps that's a commentary on his effectiveness. Given the challenges we face with this economy, I think it's probably a good idea to bring in a new team.
You write in your memoir, "Worth the Fighting For," that to achieve your goals in politics, "you need a swift, hard punch to break through the public's skepticism." What has been the hardest punch landed by either opponent in the campaign-finance fight?
An effort to disparage my reputation. You see, if you can destroy McCain's integrity, then he has no credibility on the issue. That's been their strategy.
Do you believe that there is an organized effort to silence you?
I don't believe it's organized in that there's a cabal that spends its time in a conspiracy to destroy John McCain. But I know that they work together. I saw that in the court challenge to campaign finance reform.
Define "they."
It's interesting. From the A.C.L.U. to the Christian Coalition. From the Republican National Committee to the Democratic Committee of California. And the N.R.A. 
It's generally both extremes on both right and left. 
There's a lot of concern that a war in Iraq will bring higher oil prices and cripple the economy. Why do you think that weaning ourselves off Middle Eastern oil and developing alternative energy sources has not become more of a pressing national security issue?
It's an issue of leadership. I think the American people need to be informed by our president that if we are really ever going to have the degree of independence that we should have, it requires a reduction of our dependence on imported oil. That means certain sacrifices must be made by the American people.
Is the president calling on Americans to sacrifice enough?
If I had advice for the president, I would ask a lot more of the people who are ready to give. I would demand as my top priority legislation increasing national service programs. Also, recognize that climate change is real and start developing concrete policies to address it. The Glacier National Park with no more glaciers. Remarkable.
Do you think President Bush's tax policy embodies compassionate conservatism?
No, I don't, because I believe that low-income Americans in totality bear a much higher tax burden than wealthy Americans do, therefore there is a growing gap between the wealthiest and poorest Americans. At least the tax burden should be equitable.
Any ideas on how to jump-start the economy?
We probably need to have tax cuts directed at lower-income Americans, such as payroll-tax reductions, but I also think that as long as there continues to be corporate corruption, investor confidence will not be restored and the economy will not be restored. I think we need to put some people in jail.
Including Ken Lay?
 I would let the courts decide and then hang him. David Wallis

Man With a Mission: Get the Film Made

BYLINE:  By ANNE THOMPSON; Anne Thompson is based in Los-Angeles and writes the Hollywood column for New York magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
FOR four years, George Clooney waited to play Jim Byrd, the Zen-cool agent who recruits a fast-living television producer for the C.I.A. in the film version of Chuck Barris's bizarre 1984 memoir, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: An Unauthorized Biography."
 With its claim that his high-profile career as the instigator of television tripe like "The Gong Show" and "The Dating Game" had masked an undercover job as a government assassin, Mr. Barris's wacky, James-Bond-in-Hollywood account of sex, murder and intrigue seemed ripe for the movies. Mr. Clooney had fallen in love with a script written by Charlie Kaufman ("Being John Malkovich," "Adaptation"), and he clung to the role of Byrd as the project passed from hand to hand. 
 "It was as good an acting part as I'd had," he said recently. "The drag was, I watched the script change with different actors and directors attached." 
Bryan Singer, Sam Mendes and Curtis Hanson were among the would-be directors; Sean Penn, Mike Myers and Johnny Depp were among the possible Chucks. "Five times it had the green light, five times it fell apart," Mr. Barris said.
He had been awaiting a movie version of his story even longer than Mr. Clooney had -- since the 1980's, when Columbia Pictures was ready to film the book with Jim McBride ("The Big Easy") as director. But the project never got off the ground, Mr. McBride said, because he couldn't find a star willing to play Barris. "His reputation on TV was outrageous and vulgar," Mr. McBride said. The very idea of playing him "so offended Richard Dreyfuss that he wouldn't even read the script." 
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," the film version of Mr. Barris's book, finally opens on Dec. 31 in New York and Los Angeles. And it isn't because a big star was persuaded to play the leading role. It isn't because the current popularity of "reality" television has burnished Mr. Barris's reputation. It's because Mr. Clooney decided to direct it, and to stock it with enough other big names to make its quirky story viable in the marketplace. Julia Roberts, as a bad-to-the-bone Mata Hari, and Drew Barrymore, as a marijuana-smoking hippie, play the two women sparring for Barris's affection, and Matt Damon and Brad Pitt appear in cameos as "Dating Game" contestants.
Even with such stars, and with the admired but little-known Sam Rockwell playing Barris, the movie's box-office appeal is far from assured. A mixture of noir thriller, dark comedy and raucous satire, "Confessions" would be a risky undertaking for any director. Mr. Clooney was a first-timer. But he dived into the enterprise with characteristic brio, creating an exuberant tour through the frenzied mind of Chuck Barris and through three decades of American show business.
Recounting the history of his involvement in an interview at his Laurel Canyon home, a low-slung mock-Tudor tucked into a hillside, Mr. Clooney explained how he had ended up directing: "I didn't wake up and say I wanted to be a director. I wanted to be involved in getting the movie made, because I thought the script was that good. And it was starting to look as though it wasn't going to happen. I also felt, if I was ever going to direct, it had better be with the best screenplay I'd ever read."
Like a kid with a new train set, Mr. Clooney was bursting with enthusiasm as he described his work on the movie. "I knew I could create shots, steal from my favorite directors and work with actors," he said. He bounded upstairs to fetch evidence: a fat loose-leaf binder of black-and-white cartoon storyboards for every shot in the movie, which is jammed with complex cinematic feats. "The knock on me will be that it's over-directed," he said.
Ms. Barrymore and Mr. Rockwell had no such knocks. Ms. Barrymore was interested in being in the film even before Mr. Clooney became the director, she said in a telephone interview last week. "When George got involved, I knew it would get made the way it was supposed to get made, and I wanted to be a part of it more than ever. George is an amazing actors' director."
Mr. Rockwell compared Mr. Clooney on the set to the captain of a ship. "You jump off the bridge for George," he said. An actor's actor whose supporting performances in "Charlie's Angels," "The Heist" and "The Green Mile" won him a fair amount of attention, Mr. Rockwell said he was still recovering from the emotional and physical toll of playing Barris. "You have to do comedy and drama and mimic the person," he said. "There was a lot of pressure on me and George." 
The first shot on the first day, Mr. Clooney said, was one in which Mr. Rockwell had to stand naked in front of a television set in a hotel room. "It would be my worst nightmare," Mr. Clooney said, to spend his first day of work standing naked in front of strangers. But Mr. Rockwell was fine; it was Mr. Clooney who felt awkward. "I was really self-conscious," he said. "I was nervous about just saying things like 'Action!' and 'Cut!' But also, I was overly prepared. This movie required leadership, standing up in the trenches and saying, 'We can do this thing!' and not ever allowing a word of doubt to come in." 
Doubts, of course, are what Mr. Barris, 70, had to contend with from the moment his book was published. Now writing a sequel, "Bad Grass Never Dies," he deflected the inevitable questions about the accuracy of his memoirs by saying, "There are areas of the C.I.A. that I just won't talk about." Mr. McBride's take on the material he had hoped to direct in the 80's is that "the book never made his spying so outrageous that it wasn't half-plausible."
He added, "You kept asking yourself, 'Could this possibly have happened?' "
In acting the role, Mr. Rockwell said, "I had to do it as if it were real." But he has his doubts: "I think the main thing about Chuck is, he wants respect. Being an assassin, having an alter ego, is about him finding a way to respect himself."
For his part, Mr. Clooney said he didn't care whether Mr. Barris's book is true. "Chuck is a gentle soul who is exorcising demons," he said. "I don't want to know the facts, I just want to tell the story."
It was Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, who allowed him to do so. At the 11th hour, Mr. Weinstein agreed to back the producer Andrew Lazar, who had optioned the film rights in 1997. Mr. Weinstein flew to Las Vegas for a four-hour meeting with Mr. Clooney at the Bellagio Hotel. "He talked about his vision for the movie," Mr. Weinstein said. "He's untested, but he knows how to surround himself. We went on gut instinct." Gut instinct and shrewd bargaining. "What distinguishes George," said Mr. Weinstein, "is that he understands the economics of moviemaking. He's the first guy to cut his salary."
In fact, Mr. Clooney has made salary reform something of a mission: as he did on "Ocean's Eleven," he persuaded co-stars like Ms. Roberts to lower their asking price as well. It's about being able to gamble on riskier productions by casting several stars rather than one. With his producing partner, Steven Soderbergh, Mr. Clooney made "Ocean's Eleven" and "Solaris"; their company, Section Eight, also helped make "Insomnia," "Far From Heaven" and "Welcome to Collinwood." The theory is that it's smarter to finance and market a $30 million movie with three stars than a $40 million movie with only one. "If you do that," Mr. Clooney said, "you're free to try and pick the best films possible. When you're a star who green-lights a picture, you start having responsibility for what kind of pictures get made. I want to be in movies I'm proud of."
Mr. Lazar, the producer, said that Mr. Clooney had to do more than drop his salary before the final deal was struck, particularly since Mr. Weinstein was holding out for a big star to play Barris and Mr. Clooney's choice was Mr. Rockwell, with whom he had acted in "Welcome to Collinwood." "George jumped through a lot of hoops for Harvey," Mr. Lazar said. To get to cast Mr. Rockwell, Mr. Clooney had to promise to make another movie for Mr. Weinstein and do a cameo in the next "Spy Kids" sequel -- until he landed Ms. Roberts and Ms. Barrymore.
Two days after he wrapped "Confessions," in April, he started shooting "Solaris." He worked with the editor of "Confessions" during his breaks and into the night (he gets by on four or five hours of sleep). The day after "Solaris" wrapped, he began his second film for the Coen brothers, the black comedy "Intolerable Cruelty." "You just get through it and focus on the one day ahead," he said. "If you think about a week, it'll kill you."
So will he direct again? "I'm hooked," he said. "I'm having the time of my life."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Hard Truths Are Avoided On Social Security

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DON'T believe what was said about Social Security during this year's election campaign.
 Not the claim by Republicans that they could reform Social Security so that workers could divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts with no risk that benefits would ever be reduced. 
 Nor the Democrats' assertion that the program, the government's largest, needs no more than small, painless adjustments.
And don't believe the polls from the major political parties, each of which asked questions designed to prove that the public was solidly on its side. 
Or the sentiment in the mean-spirited animated cartoon distributed by the Democratic National Committee that showed President Bush pushing a woman in a wheelchair down a slope representing a falling stock market -- supposedly a metaphor for what Mr. Bush's Social Security plan would mean for retirees.
Or the contention that many Republicans were elected to Congress in November after vigorously advocating private investment accounts under Social Security.
Politicians do not tell the truth about Social Security for one reason: the truth is too hard to bear.
Democrats cannot face the fact that this crown jewel of the New Deal -- the most popular program ever devised by the federal government, the central plank of every Democratic platform for more than 65 years -- will begin running out of money during the lifetime of most of today's workers and that, without changes, those promised retirement benefits cannot be paid. 
The reason is demographics, which no one can alter. Social Security works on the principle that each generation of workers pays taxes that cover its parents' retirement benefits. There are now 3.4 people employed for each retiree. At the end of this decade, when baby boomers begin to retire, the ratio will be 3.1, and by 2030, there will be only 2.1 workers paying taxes for each retiree.
Republicans have long resented the political mileage Democrats get from Social Security and have dreamed of making the system more like a private pension plan and less like a government welfare program. They cannot cope with the reality that instituting private investment accounts under Social Security would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 years alone. Or that if markets went down and not up, lower-income retirees might become destitute in their old age.
The huge additional cost would result from the government's need to keep writing checks to retirees at the same time a portion of workers' taxes that would otherwise be used for benefits would be going into private accounts.
President Bush and his allies were cheered this year when a number of Republican candidates who did not abandon the principle of private Social Security accounts won tough races for the House and Senate. This proved, some Republicans said, that Social Security was no longer the third rail of American politics: instant political death for anyone who tampers with it.
But close scrutiny of their campaigns shows that few if any of these Republicans dealt with the matter squarely. 
Senator-elect John Cornyn of Texas, for example, asserted on the campaign trail, "We will never, ever, as long as I serve in the United States Senate, cut the benefits of retirees." (In one debate, his Democratic opponent, Ron Kirk, said: "John, you're a smart guy. You can't promise that money to our parents and promise it to us.")
THE ugly truth is that sooner or later, under every reasonable proposal to shore up the retirement program, taxes would be raised or benefits would be reduced or money would be shifted to Social Security from other government programs. Most likely, there would be a combination of the three.
But before any resolution is reached, the politicians need to bridge the philosophical gulf that divides those who are comfortable with a huge, government-run social program that involves almost every American from those who believe that, by and large, people should be responsible for preparing for their own retirement.
Logically, President Bush would offer his Social Security proposal early next year, and Congress would begin work on the matter at once. The sooner changes are made, the less disruptive they will be. 
But the president may be wary about spending the political capital needed for a big push on Social Security the year before he seeks re-election. And no one has ever accused Congress of being logical. 
The best bet is that action will be postponed until the crisis is on the doorstep, not just on the horizon.

HEADLINE: How Wall Street Was Tamed 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
A DOZEN securities firms, each with its own agenda.
 The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, struggling, and ultimately failing, to keep his job. 
 Fifty state regulators, anxious to prove their relevance.
A politically ambitious state attorney general, demanding a billion dollars in fines.
Billions of dollars more at risk from class-action lawsuits. 
That volatile mix complicated the negotiations that ended on Friday with the announcement of a sweeping general settlement to reform Wall Street's research practices and change the way new stock offerings are distributed. 
But, in the end, the urge to reach an agreement was overwhelming.
The $7 trillion in losses that investors have suffered since 2000 along with revelations that some research analysts had recommended stocks while privately warning their big clients against them have made small shareholders deeply suspicious that the markets are rigged against them. That has not only made it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to expand but has also become a huge drag on the American economy.
"Problems in the stock market are having a very serious economic impact," said David L. Roberts, senior international economist at Banc of America Securities.
So last week, when the settlement talks -- which had begun in earnest in October and had seemed to be moving slowly but steadily -- looked as if they might stall, regulators decided that they needed to make Wall Street firms understand that they would not allow further delays.
The outlines of a broad agreement were already in place, agreed to earlier last fall. The firms, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, would collectively pay about $1 billion in fines to end the inquiries into their research practices, and an additional $500 million to finance independent stock research that would be given along with their own reports to clients.
But the two sides were having a hard time locking down the details of which firm would pay how much and exactly which practices would be banned and allowed.
Then, at the beginning of last week, the four major regulatory agencies involved in the case -- the S.E.C.; the NASD, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers; the New York Stock Exchange; and the New York State attorney general's office -- sent a message to the firms: We want an industrywide settlement, but we are no longer going to wait for one. We will settle with the firms that want to do so. We will sue those that refuse to settle now.
"The regulators started putting enormous pressure on," said Mary L. Schapiro, vice chairwoman of the NASD, in an account echoed by several other people involved in the negotiations. "We had really been through these issues many, many times. We felt this wasn't going to get better as it got older."
After two months of intense negotiations, after hundreds of meetings and conference calls between the regulators and the firms, each side understood what the other wanted. "We had been very fair in the process of looking at all of the concerns raised by the firms," Ms. Schapiro said. "We were very much down in the weeds, and it was time to bring it to the end."
After building steadily last Monday and Tuesday, the pressure came to a head at a meeting on Wednesday at the office of Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general. Early that morning, Mr. Spitzer's secretary summoned representatives from the five largest securities firms -- the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup; Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley; Merrill Lynch; and Credit Suisse First Boston -- to Mr. Spitzer's office at noon.
AT the appointed hour, about a dozen senior lawyers from the firms, along with the chairman of one of them -- Philip J. Purcell of Morgan Stanley -- shuffled into Mr. Spitzer's cramped office, on the 25th floor of 120 Broadway, just a few blocks from the Big Board, the symbolic heart of Wall Street.
The lawyers sat down. Without preamble, Mr. Spitzer launched into a lecture. According to people present, he said negotiators were tired of the waffling, the nitpicking. "Today's the day," he said. "Sign up or we're going into law-enforcement mode."
In less than 20 minutes, the meeting was over. Demonstrating his intent, Mr. Spitzer stalked out of his own office before his guests.
Two days later, around 1 p.m. on Friday, Mr. Spitzer and the other regulators stood in the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange to announce that the 10 most important securities firms, which together underwrite the vast majority of all the new stocks and bonds sold each year, had agreed to radically restructure their research operations and pay a $1 billion fine.
The settlement represented the culmination of a year of investigation by regulators into the firms' research practices, and three months of intense negotiations among more than a dozen players with sharply varying agendas.
For much of the year, Mr. Spitzer had struggled with Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., for control of the investigation, leaving the firms concerned that the attorney general's office and the commission might try to impose ever-harsher penalties on them as a way to prove their toughness to the public. In a worst-case possibility, regulators could have destroyed Wall Street in order to save it -- insisting on trials that could have ruined its credibility permanently.
Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, was determined to prevent that from happening.
On Oct. 1, Mr. Grasso mediated. He invited top officials from the S.E.C., the NASD, the Big Board and the New York attorney general's office to a dinner at his club, Tiro a Segno.
The dinner had an awkward start when Mr. Spitzer said the club, the oldest Italian club in New York City, looked like a scene from "The Sopranos." But Mr. Grasso deflected the tension by joking that the club, whose name translates as "Fire at the Target," was actually closer in spirit to "The Godfather."
Over dinner, the regulators reached a broad understanding about their responsibilities and the goals of the inquiry. Mr. Pitt agreed that the S.E.C. would not try to take over Mr. Spitzer's investigation. In turn, Mr. Spitzer acknowledged that the S.E.C. had the ultimate duty to oversee the structure of the securities industry and that he would not try to usurp that role. And all the regulators agreed that their goal should be reform of the industry, not penalties so punitive that they would permanently damage Wall Street.
Over the next month, two more dinners followed, which the regulators joked were "the meetings of the four families." But given the complexity of the investigations and the negotiations, having regular top-level contact was very important, said Ms. Schapiro of the NASD.
"Those dinners were important to make sure that we were all moving in the same direction and at the same pace," Ms. Schapiro said.
With their roles sorted out and their investigations continuing to turn up evidence that analysts had shaded their recommendations to win investment banking business, the regulators stepped up talks with the firms.
The most crucial meeting came in mid-October at S.E.C. headquarters in Washington, when officials from the S.E.C. and Mr. Spitzer's office first presented the outlines of an overall settlement to the banks. "It was clear that they would listen," one regulator who was present at the meeting said. "It was also important that we had all of them at once."
Before that, negotiations had not been coordinated; each regulator had presented each bank with individual settlement terms. But Mr. Grasso felt that because almost every firm had engaged in at least some of the practices under investigation, an overall settlement would be the only way to clean the stain attached to Wall Street. Though the Big Board was one of the regulatory agencies doing the investigating, Mr. Grasso had the respect and confidence of both sides, and he helped broker the deal.
"Grasso really represented a catalyst, to keep on emphasizing how important it was as an industry to put this behind us," one person close to the negotiations said.
The negotiations were exhausting, said Barry R. Goldsmith, executive vice president for enforcement at the NASD. Since October, the firms held almost two dozen industrywide meetings with regulators to discuss how to make research independent of investment banking. Individual firms, meanwhile, held hundreds of one-on-one meetings with regulators to negotiate the penalties they would face for misleading reports they had released.
"I can recall doing two conference calls at the same time -- I couldn't avoid it," Mr. Goldsmith said. In general, the talks were civil, he and others said.
But in early November, tension surfaced between Mr. Spitzer, whom the industry resented for instigating the investigation, and the banks. At a meeting between Mr. Spitzer and the banks' general counsels, Theodore A. Levine, the top lawyer for UBS, accused the regulators of leaking details of the talks. According to people present, Mr. Spitzer lashed out at Mr. Levine, screaming: "I don't know where the leaks are coming from. We're sick of it." 
He blamed the banks for the leaks and threatened to stop correcting detrimental rumors in the press.
Still, the talks moved ahead. The broad outlines of a deal, the fines and the fund for independent research, were clear in late October. The firms also agreed to completely separate their investment banking and research divisions, to prevent analysts from helping bankers win underwriting business, and to prohibit bankers from helping to determine what analysts were paid.
Regulators also wanted new restrictions on "spinning," the practice of allocating shares of hot public offerings to corporate executives at companies from which the banks hoped to win business. Regulators viewed spinning as little more than legalized bribery.
Although the firms were hardly anxious to agree to the terms, which represented the biggest restructuring of their business since at least 1975, when the New York Stock Exchange deregulated commissions for stock trading, they understood that they needed to make major changes to win investors' confidence.
The issue of what fines the individual banks would pay, however, was far more contentious.
"When you're talking about individual firm culpability, that is much more difficult, because the firms are standing alone on the facts that are found," Mr. Goldsmith said. "On the structural relief and the independent research, that was probably a little easier in some respect."
Regulators said that Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston had behaved more egregiously than other firms, and the two agreed to pay fines well in excess of $100 million. (Citigroup, Salomon's parent, eventually agreed to pay $325 million; Credit Suisse paid $150 million. Merrill Lynch had agreed months earlier to pay $100 million.)
But each of the other firms believed that its behavior had been relatively benign and that it should not pay more than any other. In particular, both Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley said they would not pay more than the other's fine. Smaller firms, including Lehman Brothers and Bear, Stearns, had similar objections.
The fight over how much each firm should pay threatened to derail the talks. Finally, in the last two weeks, the outlines of a deal became clear: Paying $50 million fines would be Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley; Lehman Brothers; Bear, Stearns; J. P. Morgan Chase; UBS; and Deutsche Bank. But some firms would also contribute to an "investor education fund," which technically would not be a fine.
That agreement removed the last major stumbling block to a deal. 
Early last week, several smaller firms seemed reluctant to sign off on the settlement, one person close to the talks said. But by Wednesday, Mr. Grasso and regulators had applied so much pressure to the second-tier firms that they gave in. 
Then Mr. Spitzer gave his speech, and on Thursday a frantic round of faxes and negotiations ended with an agreement in principle.
"Ultimatums were delivered -- bottom-line numbers," Mr. Goldsmith said. "It got to a point where time was running out here -- either you're on board or off board."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 22 detailed negotiations that led to the $1.4 billion settlement two days earlier to revamp Wall Street research. The article described an Oct. 1 meeting of securities regulators, including Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, to discuss progress. It said the dinner started awkwardly when Mr. Spitzer described the meeting's site, an Italian-American social and sporting club in Manhattan, as looking like something from "The Sopranos."
That account came from three people at the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Spitzer, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed for the article. He was not asked about the meeting.
After publication, a spokesman said Mr. Spitzer denied having made the comment, and the three people who had recounted it said they could no longer remember exactly what was said. Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who attended the meeting and is a member of the club, declined to comment for the article or after its publication.
An article last Sunday about influential Long Islanders who died in 2002 misstated the age of Francis S. Gabreski, an ace fighter pilot and former president of the Long Island Rail Road. He was 83, not 73.

LOAD-DATE: December 22, 2002 T"He was always there for young people of color running for office," Mr. Moore said. "He was writing out checks. He was never one to really make or draw value judgments of people as long as they were intending to move in a position that would help enhance our community." He died during heart surgery on Jan. 17. He was 79. A Force on Her OwnAlice Marie Brazier, known as Sweetie to her closest friends and family, was the woman behind William Brazier. "She was the kind of wife that made her man great," said Michele Mohammed, remembering her mother as a proud homemaker and mother of two children who cooked dinner every night until she was 65. "She stood by him in everything he did."Married 57 years, they belonged to the Long Island Couples Club, a group of 10 couples that got together each month, promoting marriage and togetherness.She was a founding member of the Mid-Island chapter of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs in 1958, which raises money for scholarships and helps needy women.As a social worker, Mrs. Brazier launched the first child abuse unit at Suffolk County's Department of Social Services. She started as a caseworker there in 1959, then became an assistant director of the children and family services. She returned to school to earn a master's degree in social work from Adelphi University in Garden City in 1968.She died from respiratory problems at age 77 on Jan. 25. In the Wild Blue YonderFrancis S. Gabreski, after whom the Suffolk County airport in Westhampton Beach was renamed a decade ago, was a national hero, the top American air ace in the European theater during World War II. Colonel Gabreski destroyed 31 enemy fighters in aerial combat and 3 more on the ground. He was credited in the downing of 6 1/2 planes in Korea and flew more combat missions than any other American. At the World's Fair in Flushing in 1965, there was even a day in his honor.Mr. Gabreski, who dedicated the American Airpower Museum in Farmingdale on Memorial Day weekend in 2000, settled in Dix Hills after he spent his last three years in the Air Force as the commander of the 52nd Fighter Wing at the Suffolk County base from 1964 to 1967.Mr. Gabreski spent the next 20 years with Grumman Aerospace in Bethpage, with a three-years hiatus as president of the Long Island Rail Road. But Mr. Gabreski was more at home in a P-47 Thunderbolt single-engine fighter than at the helm of a commuter railroad."He never looked at his time at the railroad as a defeat," said his son, Donald Gabreski, noting that his father was able to implement a maintenance program for the rail beds, passenger cars and engines. It wasn't enough. He was dismissed partly because of the railroad's dismal performance during the winter of 1977-78, plagued first by a cold wave, then a heat wave.As an executive at Grumman, Mr. Gabreski had better luck, bringing in Air Force contacts to the aerospace firm that had historically worked with the Navy. Mr. Gabreski died Jan. 31. He was 73. A Living ExampleWhen Molloy College was established in 1955, it had no convent. Sister Helen Therese Nyberg used to recall that she and the rest of the pioneer sisters at the Rockville Centre school lived in primitive quarters in back of the temporary stage in Quealy Hall, the school's gymnasium.It was at the annual open house of the convent, built in 1963-64, that Sister Helen regaled visitors with tales of the college's early days. She was one of the 11 sisters who opened Molloy and the only sister to serve at Molloy without interruption since its inception. Forty-four female students enrolled that first year in a program that included nursing and education. An all-women's college until 1973, Molloy now offers 50 undergraduate and graduate programs. Sister Helen retired in 1997.Had she had her druthers, Sister Helen would have pursued a master's degree in English, recalled Sister Janet Fitzgerald, former president of the college. Sister Helen taught at St. Nicholas School in Brooklyn from 1934 to 1940; then at Dominican Commercial High School in Queens. She was well versed in literature, knew German and some French and Latin. But when word came from Bishop Thomas E. Molloy that plans for the college were under way, the congregation of Sisters of St. Dominic of Amityville was told they would need teachers with doctorates. Sister Helen was asked to study chemistry. "She was a little flabbergasted," Sister Janet said. But her life was devoted to service to God. She pursued her Ph.D. at Fordham, then founded and was chairwoman of Molloy's math and science division. As a chemistry professor, she was a popular, hands-on teacher. "We didn't have any lab assistants," Sister Janet said. "In the beginning, she would wash all the test tubes and whatever else was involved in cleaning up lab. She wasn't reluctant to roll up her shirtsleeves. She would show the example." Sister Helen died Sept. 8. She was 87. Lover of Open SpacesIn designing Blydenburgh County Park in Smithtown, Carolee Swick had to consider both the horseback riders who wanted to use the 588-acre park's bridle paths and the environmentalists who wanted to preserve the natural ecology of the land at the headwaters of the Nissequogue River. But Ms. Swick, a landscape architect at the Long Island Regional Planning Board, was not easily ruffled. She met with both parties and kept the heavily trafficked areas away from the lake. Ms. Swick went on to redesign town parks throughout Suffolk County. "She really cared about people and the environment in which they lived," said Sy Robbins, who worked with Ms. Swick at the planning board and is now the groundwater specialist for the Suffolk County Health Department. "Her planning approach was how people would perceive their surrounding environment and be affected by it."In Brookhaven town, Ms. Swick was the first woman hired as commissioner of planning, environment and development. In that job, she oversaw all the building in Brookhaven, including site plans, change of zone applications, and subdivisions and the preservation of historic districts. "She believed in open space," said Linda Petersen, the town's deputy commissioner of planning. "She believed in clustering. She worked to help us preserve Brookhaven."Ms. Swick advocated "smart growth" before the term was coined. She was instrumental in doing the preliminary work on the 1993 state law that created the 100,000-acre Long Island Pine Barrens state preserve and prohibited development on more than 50,000 acres, including land in the towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead and Southampton.Ms. Swick died of cancer on March 5. She was 63. A Builder of NoteBefore there was a Levittown, Kalman Klein helped shape Long Island's suburbs. Mr. Klein built 4,000 to 5,000 homes and numerous shopping centers, mostly in New Hyde Park, Plainview, East Meadow and Roslyn. In 1941, he helped found the Long Island Builders Institute, a trade group, and in 1947 became its second president."One of his major concerns was a wide variety of housing opportunities," said Robert Wieboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute. "He wanted to provide housing at different price levels in a way that made an entire community possible. He was into 'smart growth' and greenbelt long before it was called that."In 1953, the Long Island Expressway didn't extend to Exit 61. Knowing the suburbs would grow and develop, Mr. Klein and his partner of 60 years, David Teicholz, bought 1,100 acres of scrub pine land to develop Parkland, a mix of shopping, industrial and residential areas, including 1,248 single-family homes and 500 town houses. It took 17 years to get approval for the project from the Town of Islip. (Part of the property was sold in 1970 and part of the industrial area has become housing.) "He had an abiding faith in Long Island and its potential," said Peter Klein, his son. "He was proud of it." Mr. Klein initially went to work as a draftsman for the state, designing subway tunnels. He met Mr. Teicholz, a brick mason contractor, in Long Beach, where they both were living. In 1937, they built their first three cape homes in Stewart Manor. "In those days when you did the excavation, you used a horse to pull a scoop to pull out the dirt to build a foundation," Peter Klein recalled. When home building was restricted during World War II, Kalman Klein and Mr. Teicholz built an apartment complex in Hartford, Conn. After the war, they bought a string of farms and a golf course and designed and built homes in New Hyde Park, naming Stephan Marc Lane and Peter Lane for Mr. Klein's sons. The homes there sold for $5,000; payments ran $36.98 a month. Mr. Klein continued to build ranchers, split levels and colonials and shopping centers on the Island until 1958."He understood that you had to do mixed use," Peter Klein said. "It couldn't all be housing. You had to have shopping to serve the people who lived in the housing and you had to have commercial and industrial property as well. There have to be places to live, work and shop. It's not a bedroom-based economy."Kalman Klein died on Feb. 10. He was 96.December 30, 2002

A Seesawing Market Finishes a Bit Higher

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
It was an up and down week, with losses on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday sandwiched between nice gains on Monday and Friday. But there was enough in the plus column for the three main market gauges to finish the week barely higher, ending a two-week decline. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, led by SBC Communications and Citigroup, rose 77.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,511.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, lifted by Bed Bath & Beyond and Novell, climbed 6.28 points, or 0.7 percent, to 895.76. And the Nasdaq composite, paced by Sepracor and BEA Systems, inched up 0.63 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1,363.05. 
 Friday's gains came as big brokerage firms reached a settlement of nearly $1.5 billion with regulators. On the same day, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the economy was working its way through its "soft patch."
 But with only six trading days left in 2002, the market has all but locked in its third consecutive year of losses. The Dow is down 15.1 percent for the year, a decline that would make it the worst year for the index since 1977.
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.96 percent from 4.07 percent a week earlier. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

HEADLINE: The Nation: Torture for Everyone; 
In Iraq, Fear and Mumbling at the Top

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
IT was early last week when word reached the Al Rashid Hotel, where foreign visitors are lodged and closely watched by Saddam Hussein's government. The Iraqi currency, the dinar, had gone into free fall, losing 25 percent of its value against the dollar.
 Rumors in the bazaars immediately assumed some dramatic event involving President Bush or President Saddam Hussein, both of whose choices now dictate whether Iraq will go to war for the third time. 
 Had the American leader made some move to bring war closer? Had some conspirator broken through the multiple layers of defenses, including Saddam look-alikes deployed as doubles, and assassinated the Iraqi leader? 
By nightfall, the dinar stabilized (though well below its earlier value), and money traders settled on a less dramatic explanation, but one that set off a new round of whispering: somebody high in the government had dumped dinars on the market to buy tens of millions of dollars in a few hours. 
This, in turn, raised the question of what need anybody in power might have had for so many dollars -- if not to defect, then perhaps to send family members abroad, before American missiles or a coup in Baghdad sent the whole grim edifice of power crumbling. 
Something similar happened in 1995, when Mr. Hussein's son-in-law, Gen. Hussein Kamel, defected to Jordan with what was said to have been $25 million in cash. 
General Kamel betrayed the secrets of Iraq's weapons programs to the Central Intelligence Agency before committing an act of stupefying rashness or blind illusion. He accepted his father-in-law's promises of forgiveness if he came home to resume his role as father of Mr. Hussein's grandchildren. Within 72 hours, the general was dead, as were his father and numerous clansmen, victims of a death squad sent their villa in Baghdad.
For an Iraqi even to speculate that such an episode might have been unfolding again was to run the risk of arrest, torture and execution. So an outsider could gain little from probing for a definitive cause of the dinar's plunge.
Still, the episode reflected something inescapable here in recent weeks -- the febrile tension that has settled over every corner of the government as the crisis over Mr. Hussein's secret weapons, or lack of them, deepens.
Long before any destroyer in the Persian Gulf has fired the first cruise missile, President Bush, by playing Gary Cooper in "High Noon" to Mr. Hussein's desperado, has already effected striking changes in the dynamic of power in Iraq.
The paralysis that has gripped many Iraqis has shown signs of moving upward into the mirrored chambers of Mr. Hussein's palaces. The signs have been far too fleeting to gain any sure sense of what is going on. Mostly, too, they go unreported by Western news gatherers, concerned not to needlessly put at risk their chances of winning new visas by reporting on matters they have no hope of confirming by their usual standards of responsible reporting. 
Still, enough signs suggest that the United States, in weighing the options for disarming Mr. Hussein, is confronted with a wild card that would unsettle any gambler's game: a startling lack of coherence in the way power is dispensed in this rigid monolith of a state. 
To go further, and to say that power in Iraq is unraveling, would be to reach too far, since nothing yet remotely resembles a challenge to Mr. Hussein. But for a reporter who was in Baghdad exactly 12 years ago, on the eve of the gulf war, the contrasts are unavoidable, beginning with the Iraqi leader's stubborn but at least comprehensible pronouncements then, and his perplexing performances now. 
In his speeches in the 1970's and 80's, when he was consolidating power and even during the chaos of the Iran-Iraq war, Mr. Hussein, while never an orator, gave a sense of determined purpose. Many Iraqis and successive American administrations were prepared to tolerate his brutalities and focus on the extraordinary improvement in Iraq's economy and in education, health care -- and in the scientific infrastructure that was to underpin his ambitious weapons programs.
But recently he has given the impression of a man no longer sure of where he is headed. To a number of Iraqis, as well as to outsiders trying to chart his course, he has seemed almost befuddled, shifting back and forth, sometimes in the same sentence, between a seeming willingness to compromise to save himself, and the old instinct to strike out. In part, this may reflect his narrowing choices, as Mr. Bush presses forward with his ultimatum that Iraq finally abandon the imperial ambitions that his secret weapons represent, or face being toppled.
But even that cannot completely explain the convolutions in the Iraqi leader's speeches. Rarely has the difficulty been more apparent than in the baffling passages that constituted much of what he had to say early this month when he mused aloud in a gathering filmed for television on his decision to admit United Nations weapons inspectors he once called spies.
To Iraq's top leaders, he first cited the Iraqi people's historical capacity for "patience." And then this, from the official English transcript (which the faithful minders assigned to news reporters by the government admitted had lost nothing in clarity in translation):
"Thus we are entering a new field: plain evil, and plain cowardice, by the parties who are supposed to present an opinion and make a stand, not in defense of Iraq, because Iraq doesn't need any party to defend it, as it relies on God Almighty, and whoever relies on God, who is the all-powerful, unmatched by any other power, will not, as I believe, diminish his faith or his ability, to the point where he would seek help from others, except when his faith fervor overtakes him, making him go searching for a field in which he could rekindle his spirit, his mind and conscious, to reassert himself by the ability of his faith, and his intimate ties to the nation."
In modern times, other nations in the grip of totalitarian leaders -- Mao and Brezhnev, for example -- have stood by helplessly as the hierarch's abilities failed toward the end of a long period of unchallengeable power. 
Watching the endless replays of the 65-year-old Mr. Hussein meeting with his inner circle, it is hard not to wonder if Iraq, too, isn't burdened with a system that has packed the upper levels of power with aging, infirm men inured by long experience not to question and never to challenge, and thus incapable now of placing their own hands more firmly on the tiller.
The fealty -- the fear -- seems manifest in every scene: men like Izzat Ibrahim, Taha Yassin Ramadan and Tariq Aziz, all in their late 60's or early 70's, laughing nervously at every hint of a witticism from the leader. Pens raised above notepads, their expressionless faces turn toward Mr. Hussein, silent and expectant. Only the Iraqi leader is ever shown speaking, save for moments when speeches are made by others in his praise. On lighter days, Havana cigars sent as gifts by Fidel Castro appear at every leader's side, but none is lit before Mr. Hussein's, and all are extinguished the instant the president stubs his out.
How much this pattern may be shaping Iraq's response to the Security Council's demands for a full accounting of its weapons of mass destruction is a matter to be divined. In his speeches, Mr. Hussein has sounded like a man terminally vexed, oscillating between submission and defiance. 
Generals he has put forward to speak about weapons -- and to prepare the 12,000-page declaration now condemned for its omissions by Washington and by Hans Blix, leader of the inspection teams -- have reacted, at times, like men not sure whether full disclosure is the order of the day, or whether their brief is to admit only as much as the enemy is likely to find out.
The uncertainties flow down the government ranks. Officials who deal with Western reporters seem more than ever gripped by chronic indecision, quick to anger and often deeply afraid. In confessional moments, some even speak darkly of maneuverings at the highest levels.
Hovering at the edge of it all, some officials whisper, is the man who, to some Iraqis, is the most enigmatic and perhaps most threatening of all, Uday Saddam Hussein, at 38 the president's oldest son, and the rival of Mr. Hussein's other son, Qusay, 36. 
Last month, Uday's wings were clipped when the government suspended his newspaper after it published articles that seemed intended to expose incompetence and corruption in the government. One repeated, ostensibly to condemn, a report in The Times of London that Saddam Hussein had paid tens of millions of dollars to the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, to assure a safe haven for Mr. Hussein's family in the event of war. Another castigated the information ministry for threatening foreign reporters who had been too assiduous in covering a rare public protest by mothers who had lost sons to Mr. Hussein's gulag.
Among Iraqis, Uday is best known as a man who has turned his revolver on unfortunates in his family and his father's coterie who have irritated or crossed him. If anybody but Saddam Hussein himself seems like the perfect totem for all that is past, it is Uday. Yet his posture now is to present himself as the one Iraqis can turn to, should they want a more modern man to lead them out of the dead end his father has led them to.
In a land of illusions, that could be the greatest illusion of them all.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Selling Tax Breaks For the Wealthiest

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE Bush administration is torn between what some officials believe is good tax policy and others fear is bad politics. At issue are tax cuts for the rich.
 Many conservatives have long despised the progressive income tax, which taxes the wealthy at a higher rate, holding that it is unfair, unnecessarily complicated and economically inefficient. They argue that the tax burden falls so heavily on so few people that it is difficult to mobilize political support for overhauling the tax system. 
 "It not only makes it more difficult to get people to want to abolish the income tax, it also makes it more difficult to give tax relief to anyone," said former Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee until he retired from Congress last year.
In the next few weeks, President Bush will propose a package of tax cuts, convinced that lowering taxes is the right tonic for whatever ails the economy. No one in the know will say exactly what the president plans. But the best guess is that he would eliminate or sharply reduce the income taxes individuals pay on stock dividends, move to 2003 the upper-bracket rate reductions scheduled for 2004 and give companies more generous breaks for investments in equipment. Mr. Bush is also expected to propose making permanent the tax cuts enacted last year. These cuts, including abolition of the estate tax, are scheduled to expire in 2011.
Democrats are looking for every opportunity to portray the president as the patron of fat cats. And they pounced on a passage in a speech this month by R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, maintaining that "the increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter system."
The administration's strategy, declared Democratic Representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York and Robert T. Matsui of California in a letter to colleagues, is "to raise taxes on lower- and middle-class families in order to finance deeper tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
Mr. Hubbard declined last week to respond to repeated inquiries about whether he in fact supported increasing taxes on low- and moderate-income families. But Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed the notion that this was the president's position. 
A more senior White House official said, "It is preposterous to think that the president would stand up and say, 'I want to put more people on the tax rolls.' "
Yet, as soon as the president's plan is unveiled, Washington will be deluged with statistical tables, showing that the big winners would be the richest people in the country. 
Using data compiled by the Congressional tax staff and the Internal Revenue Service, Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research institute, found that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with annual incomes over $356,000 -- would receive about half the revenue the government would lose next year if dividends went untaxed and 45 percent of all the money from accelerating the rate cuts. The 80 percent of households with incomes below $73,000 a year would get less than 10 percent of the new tax breaks.
These findings are not surprising. After all, the richest 1 percent has 18 percent of all the pretax income and pays 36 percent of all personal income taxes. 
But studies like this reinforce the public perception that the Bush administration favors the rich. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in October showed that 55 percent of those surveyed held this view, while only 25 percent thought the administration treated everyone equally. It was one of few instances where the national poll found that Mr. Bush was seen in a negative light.
To make his tax-cut proposals more politically palatable, people who follow administration policy closely say the president will probably offer additional tax cuts that would make his proposal look less lopsided in the statistical analyses.
One possibility is another rebate like the one taxpayers received last year, but limited to lower-income families. Another is a temporary suspension of the Social Security payroll tax for workers. A third is an additional tax break for retirement savings by people with modest incomes.
Robert M. Teeter, a Republican pollster, said politicians in his party tended to be overly anxious about how their tax cuts benefited the wealthy. Surveys show, Mr. Teeter said, that ordinary people are not so much jealous of the rich as they are hopeful of reaching the point where they, too, can get tax relief.
But officials who have worked on tax matters inside previous Republican administrations said enormous attention was paid to the political effect of the statistics showing winners and losers from tax policy.
"The straitjacket of distributional tables," said Michael J. Graetz, who was the top tax official in the president's father's administration, "often distorts good tax policy."
In any case, no one expects Mr. Bush to offer a proposal next year for replacing the progressive income tax with another tax system. But few doubt that such a system is his ultimate goal. The challenge will be finding one that is not skewed toward the rich. 
Last week, three prominent conservatives -- Jack F. Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee; Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee; and William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard -- urged the president to support a reduction in the payroll tax. 
"If Bush goes for tax cuts that, fairly or unfairly, can be accused of being skewed to the rich and to investors, that is a fight they will lose," Mr. Kristol said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MILITARY; 
U.S. SAID TO READY KURD AREAS IN IRAQ FOR POSSIBLE WAR

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS 

DATELINE: DOHUK, Iraq, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
As the United States and Iraq publicly spar over the degree of Iraqi compliance with United Nations weapons inspections, an array of American war preparations are under way here in the independent north.
 American intelligence officials have been working alongside Kurdish officials in recent weeks, and recruiters for an American-sponsored opposition group have been selecting candidates for a program to train scouts and translators that one day may help American forces inside Iraq, according to Kurdish and Western officials. 
 American military planners have visited secluded corners of the country to examine potential basing sites for use in a war, according to a Western expert familiar with the activity.
No American military forces are based here yet, Kurdish officials say, and recent Turkish and Arabic news reports of sizable military deployments appear unfounded.
But teams from the Central Intelligence Agency have been working with the principal political parties in the Kurdish region -- the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in the east, and the Kurdistan Democratic Party in the west -- for upward of two months. The C.I.A. teams have become a familiar sight for Kurds, who see them traveling in convoys with armed local guards. 
One team appeared Thursday at the local supermarket here, arriving as a New York Times photographer stepped outside with his purchases. The Americans were accompanied by Kurdish gunmen who wore the distinctive red-and-white headdress of the Barzanis, the ruling clan in the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
Kurdish officials say the Americans have interviewed members of a Muslim militant group who have been captured by Kurdish security forces, looking for links to Al Qaeda. The group, Ansar al Islam, has been waging holy war against the secular Kurdish government, with some tactical success. 
Other duties of the Americans are less clear. But local officials say that after a long absence, the American teams have been analyzing the political and military situation in the autonomous zone and meeting important figures, deepening Washington's understanding of the region. They are also building relationships that would be valuable if the United States leads a war against President Saddam Hussein's government and later occupies this historically unstable land.
The independent northern zone is a tenuous entity, existing with scant economic and military resources in territory once controlled by Mr. Hussein. His forces have ruthlessly killed civilians here in the past.
It is also ringed by neighbors -- Iran, Turkey and Syria -- that express deep misgivings over the intensifying Western involvement with the Kurds, and with the possible spread of Kurdish democracy to their own independence-minded Kurdish minorities.
It is no surprise then that the American presence, welcomed by many Kurds, has caused palpable discomfort elsewhere.
In one testy exchange this month, the head of the Iranian intelligence office in the eastern city of Sulaimaniya visited a deputy of Jamal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union, to register a complaint. The Iranian official protested Kurdish cooperation with the C.I.A., according to a Kurdish official familiar with the exchange. "He said, 'Why have you invited them here? We should not have these Americans in the region,' " the official said. 
"He was told, 'This is a free society. We need them here, and we like them here. We are free to invite anyone's assistance as we choose.' "
Local officials say that apart from the C.I.A presence, there has been the American-sponsored effort to recruit guides, civil affairs specialists and translators to work with Western forces should they enter Iraq.
Yura Mossa, chief of the minority Assyrian Democratic Party in the northwestern city of Zakho, said senior party officials had met with an unspecified group of Americans and then had asked local party offices to select applicants. The program, underwritten by the United States Congress as part of Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, would provide training, perhaps in Hungary, for the recruits.
"We have registered some names, and we have told them we are ready to register some other names, and to send young people to help America," Mr. Mossa said. "In the case of ousting Saddam Hussein, all the people of Iraq -- Kurds, Assyrian, Arabs -- will be ready to help."
Mr. Mossa said that none of the men his office had signed up had departed for training and that they were awaiting further instructions.
A similar effort has occurred in Sulaimaniya, where a former head of the Iraqi Communist Party has been registering names and circulating a questionnaire as a sort of job application. His activities have been reported in the local media and in The Christian Science Monitor, and have angered Kurdish political parties.
"He is a clown," one Kurdish official said. "He had no local reputation and no money, and all of a sudden he has a new office and an Internet connection, and he's handing out these letters. The Americans should not work with him."
A Western expert familiar with the region said the recruiting was coordinated by the Iraq National Congress, an opposition group based in London, and was unrelated to the C.I.A. teams here. 
That led a Kurdish official to say that American government agencies often seem split in their agendas, and that sometimes it was not possible to determine the direction and shape of American policy.
Kurdish leaders are generally supportive of the American presence, and are grateful for protection provided by American and British warplanes since the United Nations northern no-flight zone was established in 1991. But Kurds also remember engagements with the United States that ended in what they consider betrayal.
The United States encouraged Kurdish uprisings in 1975 and 1991, then withheld support while local guerrillas were routed.
An American-encouraged coup attempt against Mr. Hussein in 1996 also ended badly. Iraqi security services discovered the plan and sent security agents into Kurdish neighborhoods to kill opposition members.
As planning goes forward, Kurdish officials worry that Mr. Hussein might use the American presence as grounds for a pre-emptive strike. Several Kurdish cities are within artillery range of the Iraqi Army.
"We have to be very careful," a senior official said. "If there are people who want to overthrow Saddam Hussein, we do not want to be too far from them. But we do not want to provoke Saddam Hussein in any way. We know him, and we are responsible for our people, and must be very careful about what we say and do."
The sense of uncertainty briefly deepened this week, when Turkish and Arab media reported that 50 military trucks entered Iraq at the border crossing near Zakho, ferrying American troops and equipment into village bases. Some reports said American soldiers were improving airfields in anticipation of war.
Turkish military officials and Western diplomats said the reports were false, and Kurdish officials investigated and then dismissed them as baseless. "Until now I have not seen these military trucks," said Akher Shekh Jamal, Zakho's mayor. "If American troops came to Kurdistan, we would see them. We would have witnesses."
A Western expert said military activity had been limited to surveys of airfields some weeks ago by American planners near the villages of Bamarni and Harir in northern Iraq. Tours of northern villages appeared to confirm a low level of activity.
The Turkish Army has operated inside northern Iraq since the late 1990's, under an agreement with the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The deployments are part of the army's counterinsurgency against the Kurdish Workers Party, or P.K.K., which has engaged in a long campaign for Kurdish rights in Turkey.
With their armored vehicles, including American-made M60 tanks, Turkish soldiers were visible on Thursday near the airfield in Bamarni and at the mountaintop village of Amadiya, both roughly 15 miles south of the Turkish border.
But villagers said the Turks were part of deployments that began in 1997 and that have not recently changed in size or composition. The troops seemed lazily deployed, with few guards. Most of their tanks were idled and under tarps. Fighting positions had clearly been dug long ago.
Moreover, the dirt-and-gravel airstrip at Bamarni showed no signs of improvement. It had drainage problems, was littered in places with melon-sized stones, and in sections had shin-high shrubs.
"We haven't seen American forces come here," said Nori Fatah Abdullah, of Bamarni, looking down from a hilltop at the Turkish tanks. "We would like it if they came, because they are good people, but they are not here yet."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SOUTH ASIA; 
Anti-American Feeling Rises in Pakistan as U.S. Confronts Iraq

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan 

 BODY:
With the possibility of an American attack on Iraq looming, people like Tanweer Ahmed, an amiable man in a cardigan sweater, has Western diplomats and Pakistani moderates worried.
 Mr. Ahmed, a middle-class 37-year-old Pakistani shopkeeper, says Presidents Bush and Saddam Hussein are "equally aggressive." He cannot understand why the United States feels threatened by a small country like Iraq. He says it "goes without saying" that the United States is biased toward "the Jews" and discriminates against Muslims. 
 "There are so many doubts and suspicions among the people," he said, referring to Pakistanis' views of the United States these days. "The gulf of hatred between the Pakistani and American people is widening."
More than a year after President Pervez Musharraf cast his country's lot with the United States in the campaign against terrorism and Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, suspicion of and disenchantment with the United States is spreading through all parts of Pakistani society, Pakistani and Western observers say. There is also fear that Pakistan could be Washington's next target after Iraq.
"Over the last eight or nine months it's gotten a lot worse and that's what Osama and the people on his side want to foster," one Western diplomat said. "This is a real danger. This can get out of hand on a lot of levels."
An American war against Iraq is likely to harden opinion even more, according to a range of observers from Pakistani officials and academics to Western diplomats.
It could set off large protests, they say, and present a new set of challenges to President Musharraf and his military, custodians of the Islamic world's only known nuclear arsenal. There are already signs that the changing mood here has reduced Pakistani enthusiasm for pursuing Qaeda members believed to be hiding in Pakistan.
In a recent worldwide opinion poll by the Pew Research Center, 69 percent of Pakistanis held an unfavorable view of the United States and only 10 percent expressed a favorable one. Of the 44 countries surveyed, Pakistan tied with Egypt for the most negative perception of the United States.
A recent State Department poll showed rising support for Iraq, not the United States. Fifty-two percent of Pakistanis polled said they had a "good" opinion of Mr. Hussein, an increase of 9 percentage points increase from six months ago. And 67 percent of Pakistanis polled said they would oppose an American military attack on Iraq, even if it blocked United Nations weapons inspections.
A conversation with Mr. Ahmed, who has a dozen relatives in the United States and watches CNN and HBO on cable television here, suggests why. Mr. Ahmed said that a year ago he condemned the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington. Now he voices some views that would please an Islamic hard-liner.
"Because of the mistakes of some people, Muslims all over the world are being targeted," he said.
The change appears to be driven by anger over American policy in places like Iraq and Israel, the observers said. New American immigration policies, anti-Muslim statements by conservative American religious leaders, and misleading accounts in some Pakistani newspapers have also contributed.
The deepest source of resentment, Pakistanis say, is that they are not being rewarded for their cooperation in the war on terrorism and, more important, are not trusted because their country is Muslim.
Instead, Pakistanis say, they are objects of American suspicion in a world they increasingly see divided between "us" and "them" -- us meaning Muslims and them being Christians and Jews.
New security screenings for males from Pakistan and 19 other Muslim nations have made it far more difficult to get American visas. Businessmen and college students bitterly complain of ethnic profiling.
At the same time, planeloads of Pakistanis deported from the United States under a post-Sept. 11 immigration crackdown are arriving. While American officials say that Muslims are not being singled out, that is not the perception here.
"Especially, they are cracking down on Muslims," said Wasim Abbas, a 33-year-old gas station owner recently deported from York, Pa. "Basically, we are being punished while we are helping America fight against Al Qaeda."
The recent disclosure by American intelligence officials that Pakistan shared nuclear technology with North Korea is viewed as a first step toward declaring Pakistan the next rogue state. Also, the Bush administration's diplomatic approach to North Korea and military approach to Iraq is seen as proof of an American double standard: one for Muslim countries, and one for others.
Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a political scientist at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said hard-liners were successfully blaming the United States for Pakistan's stagnant economy and other problems.
"Whenever anything bad happens to Muslims," he said, "they see an Israeli, Indian or American hand."
Misleading reports in Pakistan's Urdu-language press aid their cause. Recent stories have asserted that rebellious Afghans have killed 1,000 American soldiers in Afghanistan, that American Marines raped a secretary to Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, and that Israeli soldiers will be guarding Mr. Karzai.
Not one of these reports is true. But diplomats and others say they are shaping Pakistani public opinion in dangerous ways. Pakistanis generally express a far more negative view that Afghans of the American presence in Afghanistan, which is often described here as an American "occupation." 
There are other sources of resentment as well. Pakistanis said they felt betrayed that the United States, so eager to hold Iraq to account for defying United Nations resolutions, had never forced India to respect a resolution calling for a plebiscite in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Coverage on a new 24-hour news station and in the country's newspapers highlights Palestinian suffering and unconditional American support for Israel.
Meanwhile, the rewards that the United States has bestowed on Pakistan since last September go little remarked and little noticed.
The United States has rescheduled $3 billion in Pakistan's debt, launched a five-year $100 million aid program and provided $73 million in equipment and aid to secure Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.
The effect on Pakistani opinion has been negligible, as is that of a series of State Department advertisements saying that the United States is not biased against Muslims, according to observers here.
They said they feared that officials in Washington did not understand how America was currently perceived in Pakistan, or the potential complications for the United States-led campaign against terrorism. 
"There is a gut level sense that the U.S. is anti-Muslim," the diplomat said. "I think a lot of key decision-makers still don't necessarily realize that's how the Muslim world sees it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
In an industry where conglomerates roam, the small agency has a good shot, some say.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
IT'S not easy being small in the agency business.
 After feasting on the dot-com advertising bonanza that quickly imploded, smaller independent agencies have had to face the sluggish economy and the resulting advertising slowdown with fewer people and resources to cut than the big agencies. 
 In addition, they now face increased competition from the huge agency conglomerates, which, suffering from their own woes, have picked up their pursuit of accounts previously too small to bother with. This past year in particular, big agencies went after accounts billing as little as $5 million annually. 
"Things have been ugly," said Greg DiNoto, co-founder of DiNoto Lee in New York, whose agency bills about $35 million for clients that include Oxygen and MTV Networks.
But being the advertising business -- where optimism seems to be a genetic trait -- Mr. DiNoto and others expect better times next year. Indeed, the One Club for Art and Copy, the New York advertising club, devoted its One magazine to the small agency this month. And during the club's panel discussion earlier this month, the editor of One, Warren Berger, said that the present might just be an opportune time for smaller agencies, as they compete in an ad industry so consolidated that roughly 80 percent of all advertising is produced by just four global agency companies like the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group.
"I get the sense there's kind of a growing disenchantment with large public companies," Mr. Berger said. "There's that sense that they've got their funny accounting methods, their bureaucracy and they're focused on keeping stock prices at a certain level."
The feeling might not be wishful thinking. Agency consultants said smaller shops are already using the latest accounting irregularities at Interpublic, which has had to restate $181.3 million in earnings over a six-year period, as more ammunition in convincing prospective clients that bigger does not mean better.
"Every good small agency out there will be throwing rocks at these big guys," said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant based in Greenwich, Conn., and the former owner of a small ad agency in the 1980's. "They'll be in there talking about how they are working on hot ads, not a hot set of books. It's a good opportunity."
Stanley Beals, managing director of Jones Lundin Beals, a consultant based in Chicago, said the latest bad press for agency holding companies has made clients a bit more willing to turn to midsize agencies, as long as they are well established and have proven creative talent.
"I'm sure the agencies are trying to play a card," Mr. Beals said. "They are saying they are not beholden to shareholders; that they are worried about Main Street, not Wall Street. And it has a certain appeal."
Still, agency executives said it is unlikely that clients would bolt an agency over irregular accounting practices. But with continuing pressure on their stock prices, big shops might eventually be less willing to handle those smaller $5 million to $20 million accounts they have been heartily pursuing, Mr. DiNoto said.
"It's tough for a big agency to properly staff and service a small piece of business," he said. "Smaller accounts represent a profitability challenge for big agencies, and sooner or later those accounts will shake loose."
In the meantime, however, the small agencies will have to fight the behemoths to get any new business, said Arthur Bijur, president of Cliff Freeman & Partners, the $350 million independent known for its creative work.
"You can't just walk in with great storyboards anymore," Mr. Bijur said. "For a year, big agencies have been pitching small accounts and they are throwing every resource in the book at them."
One way to survive, he said, is to make strategic alliances so that a small shop can offer the same breadth of service as its larger counterparts. Cliff Freeman, for instance, recently paired with Zimmerman Advertising, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to handle retail clients. Zimmerman offers retail research services like store analyses that Freeman does not offer. Small shops could also team up with other independents for services like media buying, sales promotion, direct marketing and public relations, he said.
Accounting practices notwithstanding, the big global accounts will stay with big global agencies because they need their resources and infrastructure, said Lance Jensen, co-founder of Modernista, a $70 million shop in Boston. But more small and midsize accounts are starting to become available because advertisers who have held up promotions over the last year are finally realizing that they have to return to the airwaves or to print.
"Clients are like people in general: they didn't buy anything for a while, but they are realizing now they have to do some advertising," he said. "There are already more reviews. More clients are shopping."
But the small agencies may soon be battling more than the holding companies. Soon, the small-agency world can expect even more competition from its own ranks, said Linda Fidelman, president of Advice and Advisors, a New York consulting firm. She said that as the economy improves she expects more new agencies to be started by top people who were laid off this year. She said there have not been as many layoffs in the business since the late 1980's and early 1990's, a period followed by start-ups like Merkley Newman Harty, DeVito/Verdi and other shops that are now well known.
"Half of D'Arcy is out there on street right now -- Publicis can only absorb so many," she said. "Lowe had a layoff. Everyone had a layoff this year. There's good talent out there at all levels."

Questions About Payments Of Hotel Taxes by Web Sites
Travel Web sites may be underpaying millions of dollars in hotel occupancy taxes, said tax experts and government officials. The taxes relate to the sale of discounted hotel rooms through special rates. The sites charge travelers in advance for the rooms, and then pay the hotels a wholesale rate. Usually, the Web sites pay occupancy taxes only on that lower rate, rather than on the price paid by the traveler.
 Tax officials in several state and local governments are examining the arrangements and preparing to demand that the taxes be paid on the full amount paid for the rooms by the customers who book them. Executives at some sites defend the practice, saying they are following industry norms. Page C2.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
In Latest Concepts for Ground Zero, It's Reality vs. Renaissance

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
"Impossible!" "Impractical!" "Unreal!"
 Well, exactly. Don't they get it, these gleeful wet blankets, as the data comes in disproving the feasibility of new designs for ground zero? Don't they see that attempting the impossible is the whole and entire point? 
 Of course they don't. Getting the point would mean acknowledging that their sense of reality is rooted in their fear of change. Some people benefit when others are doused with cold water. Their advantage increases when the water is thrown in the name of reality. Who can argue with reality?
I can. So can you. We already have, in fact, and the argument has paid off. It's only because members of the public have taken the trouble to argue with reality that the official process of reimagining ground zero has taken a turn for the better. What we're learning, at this stage, is how to put the shoe on the other foot. 
Forget about checking designs against reality. The challenge now is to test reality against designs. If reality turns out to be wanting, we must go about learning how to change it. And the way to begin that process is by recognizing that when people start appealing to reality, what they are actually talking about is the status quo.
Think how far reality has come in such a short time. In July the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation unveiled six plans for the World Trade Center site. Essentially they were six variations on the same theme: the public-private real estate development, executed in the same retro style that for years had been advertised as the people's choice. Somebody neglected to tell the public about it, however; the plans were roundly booed when presented at the now legendary town hall meeting at the Javits Convention Center.
Last week the development corporation unveiled new designs, six of them offering as many variations on the idea of contemporary architecture. (The seventh was a reworked version of last summer's retro motif.) And public response has reached an extraordinary pitch of enthusiasm.
The phenomenon we're now experiencing far transcends issues like which design is most popular or which is best. It has nothing to do with whether the projects are technically feasible or whether tenants can be found to fill them. In the context of this phenomenon, such questions are details. The issue is how to interpret the response as a reality in itself. For some of us, what we're witnessing is nothing less than the early hours of a cultural renaissance. But will it be New York's? That is the question that counts.
In the past five days designers, builders, planners and public officials around the world have been downloading images of these six projects with an eye toward adapting them for construction in their own regions. In a few years knockoff versions of them will be transforming skylines in Asia and elsewhere. These will undoubtedly be inferior to the designs now on view at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center in Battery Park City. But they will give the lie to those who oppose these designs on "realistic" grounds.
Perhaps none of these designs will be built at ground zero. Perhaps public sentiment will call for a park. But the renaissance I'm talking about won't be confined to those 16 acres. If it occurs, this renaissance will be found in the image New York is beginning to form of itself as a progressive leader of global culture. It will be seen in the transformation of the government agencies we pay to manage the public realm: planning, economic development, parks, transportation, even landmarks preservation.
Over the years relationships among these agencies have become stale, frozen, inimical to change. Is this a reality or a status quo? What has become clear in the past week is that this state of affairs is light-years away from the aspirations of the public these agencies represent.
Six teams of architects have worked overtime and for the most part at their own expense to give these aspirations a range of potential forms in which they might be realized. Here is a set of options for reimagining the skyscraper. This is what it might be like to honor the victims of 9/11 by descending into the earth. Here are possibilities for parks and garden apartments in the sky, 24-hour vertical cities, towering infrastructures for the 21st-century informational city.
Here, in short, is creativity, applied to recasting the city's future, in response to a tragedy that has already transformed the urban prospect. The collective energy generated by these possibilities has excited the public far more, I believe, than the anticipation aroused by any one or two of these designs. The energy is no less real than the inertia that kept New York from moving forward.
Is it just wishful thinking on my part, or do I correctly sense that some public officials have caught the spirit? Up to now, it has been far easier to regard the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation as an obstacle to architecture than as a supporter of it. Perhaps this was inevitable. As one official commented at last week's news conference, we have been traveling without a road map. It's not surprising that the design process started off with the familiar formula of public-private development.
Still, when was the last time we heard any public official acknowledge openly that his agency had ventured into unknown territory where no familiar formula was likely to be useful? That acknowledgment was in itself a creative response. Perhaps this official and others have begun to grasp what the public has already perceived: these six projects are not merely star performances by famous architects. They are revelations of ourselves: who we are, what we care about, where we stand in relation to our moment in history.
We've got Olmsted parks, Art Deco towers, prewar apartment buildings of brick and stone. We don't need cheap versions of places we already know. We need to relearn that such wonders have not ceased. They are waiting to be revealed.
Obstacles remain. These may not include technical feasibility or low demand for office space, but they are no less real. They all stem from the same problem: the rigid network of social, political, economic and professional relationships from which the status quo is structured. This network has lost control of the design process.
Losing control, in New York, is an infinitely more frightening reality than a surplus of rentable square feet. It takes enormous resources of money and energy to sustain mediocrity, and those resources have not dried up.
We are shortly to be treated, for example, to an evaluation of the new designs by a committee of New York New Visions, the ad hoc local group of architects and design firms formed last year to advocate the best for Lower Manhattan. Once again we will have the opportunity to put the shoe on the other foot. Groups made up of dues-paying professionals are, by their nature, not in the best position to discriminate among their members. It is unreasonable to expect such a group to conduct a completely independent evaluation.
But I'm prepared to be surprised. Think how many surprises we've had so far this year. Hire Daniel Libeskind to design a plan for ground zero? Impossible. Motivate Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl to pool their talents in a powerful design that betrays no single signature style? Unreal. See a project by United Architects, a team of young designers working together for the first time, praised in newspapers and on television stations around the globe? That's crazy. Can't be done. It'll never happen. Until it does.

HEADLINE: The Archdiocese of Philadelphia Suspends an $18 Million Project 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The Archdiocese of Philadelphia has set aside plans for an $18 million Catholic Heritage Center, citing the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse crisis and a shaky economy.
 "It would have been insensitive and inappropriate to ask Catholics to contribute to something that is a tribute to the Catholic faith at a time when trust in the church has been shaken," said Catherine Rossi, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese. "Our priorities probably don't belong here right now." 
 The project, which would have been the largest archdiocesan museum of its kind, had been in the works for nearly two years. Private donors had pledged more than $6.4 million toward it.
The archdiocese bought a six-story office building near Independence Hall and gutted it, with plans to open the museum and church archive in June. The director and sole employee, John Rumm, left his job on Tuesday.
"This is an important project for generations to come," Cardinal Anthony J. Bevilacqua said in a statement released on Saturday. "Although this is a difficult economic time in our country right now, I am hopeful that when the economy shifts, the funds will become available to make this project a reality." 
The project will be reviewed again at the end of next year, Cardinal Bevilacqua said. The church has no immediate plans to sell the 86,000-square-foot building, although it might consider scaling down to a smaller site, Ms. Rossi said.
In addition to the sexual abuse scandal and the sluggish economy, church fund-raising may have been hurt by competition from Sept. 11 charities, officials said. Yet, unlike other dioceses, the Philadelphia archdiocese has not seen a sharp drop in giving, Ms. Rossi said.
The Catholic Charities Appeal, its major fund drive, has raised $9.3 million this year, only a small drop from the $9.5 million raised last year. Fund drives for Catholic schools and local programs have shown small gains over 2001 levels.
Plans for the heritage center included an exhibition gallery and a permanent collection of church artifacts and folk heirlooms.
The more than 800 family heirlooms collected, from prayer cards to first communion dresses, will be returned if donors want them or stored at the seminary until the project can be resumed.
"The center's message was always about the heritage of faith that sustains people through both good times and times of adversity," Mr. Rumm said. "This could have been a beacon of hope when there's not a lot of hope for the Catholic community."

HEADLINE: Exile Embraces Life of Activism After Ordeal Of False Arrest 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
His office is a tableau of serenity. A ficus sits next to a computer. Pictures of the Pennsylvania and Westchester countryside dot the walls. Papers are piled here and there.
 Victor Manuel Tafur-Dominguez offers coffee and a handshake and settles into a chair in his Pace University Law School office, dressed in corduroys, a tie and sweater. His voice is soft, his manner polite. 
 Nothing about Mr. Tafur (pronounced Ta-FOOR), 39, betrays the tumult of his odyssey over the past two years through the Colombian and United States justice systems, an ordeal that has finally ended.
"If he were a cat, he would be on like his third life now," says Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Pace Energy Project, where Mr. Tafur has worked since last year alongside other lawyers and economists working on environmentally friendly solutions to energy problems.
Consider Mr. Tafur's recent plight.
He has recovered from a near-fatal plane crash in 1999 in Colombia while working for that government's anticocaine program. After moving to the United States to recuperate at his mother's home near Philadelphia, he was jailed in 2000 on accusations by Colombia that he played a role in the largest cocaine shipment ever seized in that country. He successfully challenged Colombia's extradition request based on a treaty written two decades ago by his father, who was subsequently assassinated, a crime that was never solved.
But this year Mr. Tafur's fortunes turned brighter. Colombia dropped the charges in June, finding no evidence that Mr. Tafur participated in drug trafficking. 
And last month, having earned a master's degree in law from Pace last year, he was admitted to the New York State bar. "Because of this case," said Mr. Tafur, a native of Cali, Colombia, "my life changed completely."
He is living in self-imposed exile but his words carry no trace of bitterness, and associates say they have never heard him speak angrily about his problems, which have roots in a financial transaction in Colombia gone awry.
"It amazes me that through this whole ordeal, which was costly in both dollars and emotion, I never saw bitterness," said Ann Powers, a Pace law professor. "He always seemed controlled, even when things were bleak. Tense and concerned, but quiet. I have tried to describe it to others, but don't really know the right word. Stoic doesn't quite do it, but its something like that. " 
Mr. Tafur's troubles began in 1998, when he exchanged the equivalent of $350,000 in Colombian pesos through a money trader, who deposited the sum in a Swiss bank account for safekeeping, a common practice in Colombia. The money was from a pension his mother had received after the 1992 assassination of Mr. Tafur's father, Donald, who was a Colombian congressman.
But the checks were later re-endorsed and ended up in the bank account of a dummy company implicated in the December 1998 seizure of seven tons of cocaine.
Colombian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Tafur, who was then living in Pennsylvania with his mother, recovering from the 1999 plane crash. Mr. Tafur had been injured while on an assignment as the deputy director of a Colombian government effort to encourage coca farmers to grow other crops.
In the United States, he said, the matter probably would have been cleared up quickly, as there was no evidence that he was aware of what happened to his checks after he confirmed the money had arrived in Switzerland. But Colombia, he said, is another story.
"You can't always understand things happening there because it gets very blurry," Mr. Tafur said.
The Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Mr. Tafur in March 2000 on a Colombian extradition warrant. Mr. Tafur's law professors and classmates rallied to his cause, submitting briefs and letters of support to the federal judge hearing the case. The judge rejected Colombia's request because he said he could find no probable cause that Mr. Tafur had committed a crime. He was freed from jail and resumed his studies at Pace, where he had enrolled while recovering to pursue a master's degree in environmental law.
Mr. Tafur would have been the first person extradited from the United States to Colombia to face drug charges; since 1997, when Colombia resumed extradition after a six-year hiatus, 65 people have been extradited to the United States, according to the D.E.A.
In June, Colombia's attorney general's office closed its investigation of Mr. Tafur, issuing a statement that said he "did not commit any crime." 
But Mr. Tafur said he believed it would still be too dangerous to return to Colombia. Shortly after Mr. Tafur was freed, his sister and her family fled to Miami after receiving death threats that the family believes were related to Mr. Tafur's case.
So Mr. Tafur said he had embraced a new life in the United States, having won political asylum in the spring. He has adapted to suburban New York life for the most part, living with his wife, Maria Francisca Rocha, a magazine editor, in a house in Valhalla, but dashing out to Colombian restaurants and groceries when he gets the chance.
And he is working on his lifelong passion, environmental issues.
His eyes brighten and he grows more animated as he discusses how the United States "pioneered the environmental impact statement. The Clean Water Act is the most incredible piece of legislation in the world."
Mr. Tafur spends most of his time these days representing community groups in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, fighting a proposed natural gas plant on the East River.
"It's the right plan in the wrong neighborhood," Mr. Tafur said.
If he has any lingering resentments it is over the infringement on his freedom, particularly the time he spent wrongfully jailed.
"The most important value is liberty," he said. "Being jailed is an extreme situation even if we can cope with it. The false accusation attacked not just honesty but what I stand for. "
But he said he preferred to dwell on the future, not the past. He invokes the words of a compatriot, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the novelist and Nobel laureate, saying, " 'You should never try to go back to places where you have found happiness.' I just hope to see the land where I was born before I die and do something for it from exile."

HEADLINE: Haitian Industry Sees Hope in U.S. Trade Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
For each sewing machine that remains idle at Dietrich Siegel's factory here, life grows harder for at least five relatives who depended on the person who made a living at it. As Mr. Siegel looked at rows of dozens of silent machines on a recent day, he lamented that he and his workers were losing not only money, but also time.
 "I won't ever be able to make up for having empty rows like this," said Mr. Siegel, the vice president of Classic Apparel, which in recent years has been forced to close one factory and to sell another. "When time is gone, it's lost." 
 Much time has been lost in Haiti. Its manufacturing base has shrunk by half from its peak in the mid-1980's, down to 25,000 jobs, because of political instability.
Although Haiti's daunting social and economic problems have earned it unwanted comparisons with Africa, the manufacturers envy Africa in one important aspect: to try to reverse the decline in jobs, Haiti's manufacturers are lobbying the United States Congress to pass a trade act that would grant Haiti duty exemptions held by sub-Saharan nations since 2000.
The bill would allow Haitian clothing factories, which now receive exemptions only if they use American fabric, to use fabrics from other countries, where they might cost less. A bill has been sponsored and supported by an unlikely coalition of Democrats sympathetic to the embattled Haitian government and by Republicans just as critical of it, who see the measure as a way to jump-start the Haitian economy. 
Manufacturers here say that if Congress were to approve such an exemption in its next session, factory jobs could triple. They also say it could spur other industries to invest in Haiti, whose advantage as the hemisphere's least expensive labor market has been outweighed by an infrastructure that has deteriorated, partly because of a freeze on foreign aid.
"This is a noncontroversial issue," said Jean-Edouard Baker, a factory owner and past president of the Haitian Manufacturers' Association. "This is not aid going to the government. It is putting in place a structure that will encourage investment and create jobs. We desperately need jobs." 
More than half of Haiti's population is unemployed or barely subsisting on less than a dollar a day, and the manufacturers say the situation is desperate.
At its peak, Haitian industry produced everything from clothing and electronics to baseballs for the major leagues. Its economic free fall began after Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted in 1986 and continued through the economic embargo of the early 1990's, when Haiti was isolated after a coup drove out the democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Although Mr. Aristide returned to Haiti after the American invasion in 1994, manufacturing jobs did not. Political deadlocks and accusations that Haiti was among the countries that used child labor and sweatshop conditions drove away existing clients, including Disney, which had been a major customer. Those customers moved to more stable places like Nicaragua and Honduras while keeping other companies from even considering the island.
The manufacturers contend that the reports of abuses were blown out of proportion but that they have corrected problems and are monitored these days by companies that give them contracts.
Manufacturers said they saw a way to spur jobs when President Bill Clinton signed into law the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, which opened American markets to a portion of African-produced clothing made with non-American material.
"In every measure Haiti is similar to sub-Saharan Africa," said Jean Paul Faubert, the vice president of the manufacturers' group. "So why not have trade parity?" 
The proposal to extend trade benefits could help Haiti take advantage of trends within the industry and the region, the manufacturers say. Its closeness to the United States provides for cheaper transportation and faster turnaround at a time when stores are ordering with less lead time. 
Factory owners in the Dominican Republic have also begun to consider expanding or moving some operations into Haiti, because manufacturing has been so successful there that workers are demanding higher-paying jobs, like those assembling electronic components.
Haitian workers receive about $2 a day and transporting supplies to Haiti or finished goods from Haiti to the United States is cheaper than for Honduras or Nicaragua, which in recent years have gained 22,000 jobs from companies based in the Dominican Republic.
Dominican and Haitian politicians, civic and business leaders have already been exploring the possibility of opening factories along their mutual border, where tensions have always simmered over illegal Haitian immigration. They have also begun to develop Free Zones like those in Central America that provide concessions to manufacturers and provide streamlined access to services ranging from electricity and telecommunications to shipping and customs procedures.
"The manufacturers are leaving the Dominican Republic and looking for other places, anyway," Mr. Faubert said. "If they can think of Haiti, they cannot only create more employment, but improve security since people no longer will have to cross the border. It is in everyone's national interest to see the Haitian economy do better." 
Outside the Classic Apparel factory here, street vendors sit on dusty sidewalks selling piles of oranges or bottles of motor oil. Most of the workers inside the factory could just as easily end up on the street, Mr. Siegel said, since it was only last month that a large order came in that allowed him to rehire workers who had been idle for much of the year.
Even then, the order was not big enough to fill all the rows of sewing machines inside his cavernous factory. 
"I wish we still had three factories," he said. "We had to concentrate everything here and try to keep it alive. But we need more jobs."

HEADLINE: The States Are Hurting 

 BODY:
To save money, Kentucky is freeing prison inmates. In California, the governor is threatening to slash financing for the state's proud university system and cut subsidized syringes for diabetics. Oklahoma plans to scale back health care for children under 6. Across the country, all but a very few state governments are in desperate need of Washington's help. The National Governors Association calls the budget crisis "the most dire fiscal situation since World War II," and the impact is felt equally by the cities and communities that the states help support. If state and local governments are the laboratories of democracy, most are now unhappily experimenting with ways to inflict the least amount of pain on their neediest constituents. 
 The shortfalls are due in part to a weak economy that decreases tax revenues and increases the need for state services. But the states can only cut and tax and borrow so much. They need Congress and the White House to provide funds promised for homeland security, election and welfare reform, education and especially health care. 
 States, most of which are required by law to balance their budgets, have upgraded police and emergency services in the wake of 9/11. Washington has yet to pay them back. Almost $3 billion proposed for election reform in the states still needs to be dislodged from the federal government. Federal transportation and welfare bills that could bring fiscal relief are up for consideration next year. Most of all, the states need help with skyrocketing health costs. States and the federal government share Medicaid's costs, but Washington needs to find a way to increase its share of this growing burden.
The Republicans who run Washington often tout the sanctity of the states and pay homage to a form of federalism that shifts as much power as possible out of Washington. Now those same Republicans must heed an increasingly strong plea for help from the very state capitols they admire.

HEADLINE: Worry Abounds in Super Bowl of Shopping 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J. 

 BODY:
At 8:45 a.m., the parking lots at the giant Woodbridge Center mall in this middle-class town in central New Jersey were just beginning to fill with the Hondas and Toyotas of the day's first customers.
 But inside Sears, one of the major anchors of Woodbridge Center, which is shaped like a cross and draws millions of customers annually to a congested section of Route 9, the day was well under way. It was Dec. 10, 15 shopping days before Christmas. Laura Hannigan, the store manager, was holding the morning rally, the pep talk she gives over a loudspeaker that echoes through the building with instructions to her employees on how to achieve what she describes as "the day's little victories." 
 "Jeans, jeans, jeans!" she shouted into a microphone as her employees prepared the store. 
Terri Millan, the assistant store manager for marketing, had stayed up until 1:30 in the morning, along with her marketing team, putting up thousands of signs for a big two-day sale that everyone hoped would give droopy December sales a boost.
Mayra Martinez, a cashier, was at home in Elizabeth, N.J., on her day off, resting from a long week on her feet and wondering if she could afford to do more Christmas shopping.
Rosa Fitzsimmons, the kind of loyal Sears shopper whom everyone at Sears was depending on for a good holiday season, had read about the two-day sale in her local newspaper and had the coupons bunched up in her purse. But like a lot of shoppers, she was not sure how much she could afford to buy for her family this year.
Every year these are the pressure-cooker shopping days that amount to a retailer's version of the Super Bowl, as one Sears executive here put it. But this year, the usual window between Thanksgiving and Christmas is smaller, shifting expectations into December. And now, as retailers from Bloomingdale's to Sears and Kmart struggle with slow sales and a weak economy, there is more pressure, more uncertainty, more tension.
A week at the Sears store in Woodbridge with Mrs. Hannigan and her clerks, marketers, replenishers, cashiers and shoppers was a kind of miniature mirror of the nation's economy at a time of deep worry and careful spending for consumers, and thinly masked desperation and extraordinarily aggressive selling for retailers. Mrs. Hannigan was betting with every ounce of gung-ho energy she could muster that she could make up for a dismal November with a crucial weekend sale.
"Everybody needs another pair of jeans!" Mrs. Hannigan continued during the rally, as her assistants roamed the 195,000-square-foot shopping area, making sure the sweaters looked tempting, the sales signs were standing upright and the sock and underwear bins were full.
"Talk up the turtlenecks!"
"Replenish!"
"Don't let them go to Circuit City!"
"These are big, big days for us," she concluded, sounding bubbly but, with good reason, a little concerned.
Over all, sales at Sears stores across the country -- Woodbridge is one of the largest of the company's 870 retail stores -- dropped 11 percent in November, a stinging disappointment even at a time when expectations were low. J. C. Penney, Sears's major competitor, whose store at Woodbridge Center is just a short stroll across the mall, saw its sales drop by only a hair.
But the numbers that really torture or delight Mrs. Hannigan are those that show how much business she does daily and then rank her Sears store against the 16 others in her district, which includes parts of northern New Jersey and Staten Island. She often starts her day before 8 a.m., poring over the daily sales report that is compiled at company headquarters in Illinois.
She can beat them all in men's sportswear -- she is No. 1 in the country in men's sportswear -- but she can never beat Wayne over all, and Staten Island has pulled ahead recently to become her nemesis. Behind her desk in her office on the first floor of the store is a photograph of six of the store managers in her district, and she only half-jokingly talks about putting an X over the face of the one whose store is pulling ahead on a particular week or month.
The numbers may rule her day, but she rarely lets the bad ones show. She is generally a frantic but friendly cheerleader on the floor.
"Good morning!" she said to a sales clerk on Friday, Dec. 13, as she whizzed by on her postrally walk -- really more of a sprint -- through the store. "Good day in shoes! Thirty-five percent!"
"Good morning!" she said to another clerk, as the people accompanying Mrs. Hannigan began to feel as if roller skates would be needed.
"Another good day in fine jewelry!" she said, passing another counter.
"We tried," said the jewelry seller, sounding a little weary.
Mrs. Hannigan had pinned a lot of hopes on this particular week, two weeks before Christmas, two weeks after Thanksgiving, based on the sales figures she had from last year. The Woodbridge store, which has 400 employees, does $50 million in business annually.
Besides the midweek two-day sale, Saturday, Dec. 14, was the day of an even bigger sale, with an early bird special starting at 7 a.m. and major storewide discounts all day.
There were three sales that week, and for the assistant store manager for marketing, Ms. Millan, that meant three hectic nights of "ad set up," which involved putting up thousands of sale signs on the merchandise to advertise the discounts as fast as her team could move. On average, it takes 50 seconds to put up one sign.
On Friday evening, the night before the big Saturday sale, she huddled with 12 members of the marketing team in a back room on the second floor, which was stuffed with sale signs and idle mannequins. She reviewed sale items and which goods were getting signs for 20, 30 or 40 percent off -- in addition to the "take an additional 10 percent off" signs. 
"Let's roll," she said when the meeting was over, and the team set to work putting out 5,000 sale signs late into the night. 
It is Ms. Millan's job to make sure the store looks good, but more important, that every table is full of sweaters, every "fixture" full of gloves, every display of grills or fine jewelry eye-catching. She must decide how to position the signs so customers see them and move toward them with purpose.
"Everything we touch and everything we do, every sign we put up, we have to be thinking about getting that customer to buy something," Ms. Millan said. She leads a 17-member marketing team but also considers herself the "gift finder," breaking away from her duties sometimes to approach a befuddled customer.
One customer who was instantly drawn to several of the sale signs on Saturday was Ms. Fitzsimmons, 36, a loyal Sears shopper for years. But this year, she is also a troubling customer for Mrs. Hannigan and the company in general.
Ms. Fitzsimmons, who lives in Lawrence Harbor, arrived at the Woodbridge Sears at the tail end of the early bird sale on Saturday and said she was just not going to spend as much this year.
Her job, as a maintenance garage clerk for New Jersey Transit, is secure, and so is that of her husband, who also works for New Jersey Transit. But there is a sense, she said, that things are somehow teetering, that, as she said, "you could lose your job tomorrow."
"I watch the sales," she said. "Now, I don't spend too much."
Ms. Fitzsimmons was shopping for her husband and three children. She borrows about $1,500 for gifts each year at this time from the Transit Authority Credit Union, she said.
"They want, want, want," she said. "I can't do it this year." She explained that she and her husband are supporting the family -- and car payments and a mortgage -- on a combined income of roughly $70,000, about the average household income for Woodbridge and the surrounding areas, according to data compiled by the company that operates the mall.
"Maybe out of like five things they want, I'll do three," she said. "Last year, I would have done all five."
So Ms. Fitzsimmons dawdles at Sears, at the underwear bins and the glove displays, and scrutinizes the prices, remembering in a flash whether Penney, or Macy's, had a better deal.
Soon after Ms. Fitzsimmons left Sears, saying she would "take a peek at Macy's," Ms. Martinez began her shift as a cashier. She has worked the register at the Woodbridge Sears for seven months, landing the job after her seasonal work at H & R Block ended last spring. An immigrant from the Dominican Republic, she moved to Elizabeth last year after her husband was laid off from his job in California and neither could find work there.
She said she had been thrilled to get the job at Sears, where she had shopped for a long time. Ms. Martinez, 42, found out that the store needed cashiers when she went into the store one day to make a payment on her Sears credit card bill.
A few months ago she was able to help her 20-year-old son, James Difeaux, secure a job in the receiving department at the Woodbridge Sears, and she said she felt grateful that both of them -- and her husband, who works at the Port of Newark -- had work at a time when things felt precarious.
Ms. Martinez, who said that customers and colleagues called her "Smiley," said she had been preparing for a chaotic Christmas season.
There were some days when the lines were long and the customers grumpy, she said, but "so far, it's been good."
"People said it was going to be crazy," she said. "People were going to be mad, that they would say this and they would say that. Not really."
Mrs. Hannigan, who worked as a buyer for Bloomingdale's for five years before being recruited by Sears seven years ago, is accustomed to the retail roller coaster. Sales are always fluctuating, sometimes wildly, depending on things as global as the economy and as incidental as the weather. 
"You have to have the blood for retail," she said during a lunch break at Charlie Brown's, a restaurant in the mall next to Sears. "It's about the intensity of the sell," she said, but it is also "about customer service."
"I'm here to take care of other people. I don't want to get too emotional, but it's about making their dreams come true."
Mrs. Hannigan is in her 40's, but she declined to give her exact age. She lives with her husband and 12-year-old son in Flemington, N.J. While her average customer probably earns a lot less money than she does, she has not been untouched by the economy's decline, losing money on the stock market, and she has decided to take a more frugal approach to Christmas shopping herself this year. 
That does not stop her from doing everything in her power to make sure that no one, as she put it, "leaves the store without a bag."
Contact with customers is crucial, she said, and as she walked through the store on Friday, readying her staff for the big Saturday sale, she explained about "the greet."
Sears's policy is that customers entering a department, whether it is Brand Central (appliances and electronics) or Ready-to-Wear, must be greeted by a store employee within 20 seconds.
Sometimes that employee is Mrs. Hannigan. "The greet" is so ingrained in Mrs. Hannigan that she gave it on Friday afternoon while she was "shopping the competition," rushing through Macy's to look for display and other ideas. She welcomed a Macy's customer to the store and asked if she needed help, then quickly apologized and explained that she actually worked for Sears.
At the Friday morning rally, Mrs. Hannigan was in an especially good mood, having seen that Thursday's sales were up by around 15 percent over the same day in 2001. That was a big increase, given how the week -- and the shopping season, for that matter -- was going.
"We have our big sale on Saturday," she said over the loudspeaker. "I want to make sure that you are all ready. We need to get in really early! The store is opening at 7 a.m., and this is going to be one of those days when the customers are waiting at the door for us."
But, for whatever reason, there were not many customers lined up before the store opened on Saturday. There were seven.
About 2:30 p.m., Ms. Martinez was noticing the lack of customers at her checkout. "It's weird," she said.
Mrs. Hannigan had noticed, as well. About 10:30 that morning, as she was breezing through the store, she seemed uncharacteristically blue, saying, "It's not feeling very chaotic."
Hours later, the traffic in the store seemed similarly subdued. "I'm off my game this week," she said about 3 p.m. "But it's not over."

HEADLINE: Resigned To Quit 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. 

 BODY:
An epidemic of quittingitis is sweeping the country. Neither the vaccine of denial nor the palliative of apology works. Irate bloggers and righteous scourges call it retribution as the objects of their derision call it quits. 
 In the aftermath of this flood of lachrymose leave-taking, this tsunami of tsoris, observers of cultural phenomena are obliged to judge the art of quitting. How do the major quitters in this wave of resignation rate on the Way to Go? 
 Harvey Pitt, the S.E.C. chairman whose long-awaited thunderclap started the avalanche of departures, crept away under cover of Election Day. If the quit's timing was calculated to be overwhelmed in coverage by the election results, the strategy worked. He gets a B in quitsmanship for shrewdness in slinking out of town under a cloud of other news. 
William Webster, former head of the C.I.A. and F.B.I. who was knocked over by the swing of Pitt's pendulum, resigned from the S.E.C.'s accounting oversight board with reputation unbesmirched. Rather than blast the accounting firm that was out to get him for refusing to pay its whopping fees, Webster stepped away with quiet class. Grade: A. Can't wait for his intelligence memoirs. 
Dick Gephardt stepped up to the need to step down as permanent House bridesmaid. No hesitation; no smarmy regrets; a solid B for knowing when to move on. 
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and economic adviser Larry Lindsey were fired, but their formal resignations are worth weighing: Lindsey took the political gas pipe as a Bush loyalist, rating a gentleman's C for silence in suffering. But O'Neill, furious at being dumped, shot a curt note to the president and bolted home, making his dismissal by the White House appear not merely abrupt but brutal. Grade B plus for forthright one-upmanship. 
George Mitchell, former Senate majority leader, suddenly and mysteriously quit what was then the Kissinger Commission looking into the failures of our defenses on Sept. 11. Nobody wondered why, even after his commission chairman soon self-defenestrated. For departing without stimulating a whisper about what his conflicts were, Mitchell's tiptoe exit pre-empting any criticism rates an artful A. 
Henry Kissinger, who stood the gaff for a long generation, refused to take further flak from unforgiving editorialists as he approached octogenarianhood. I give my friend Henry a D for judgment in putting clients' privacy above the opportunity to put a historic capstone to his career with a brilliant commission report, but a B plus for quitsmanship in cutting his losses promptly and with relatively little recrimination. 
Al Gore was the Great Unpushed. He coulda and shoulda but wouldna. Rather than issue a cool Coolidge "I do not choose to run," he zigged with a hilarious appearance on a TV laff-in and zagged with a stunningly sobersided withdrawal on the highly rated "60 Minutes." This was the first one-two punch resignation, and its pioneering technique deserves an A plus.
If dovish Kerry and hawkish Lieberman wound each other in a shootout; if Daschle and Gephardt turn out to be all charisma and no cattle; if Edwards continues his lightweight dance on a charlotte russe; and if Hillary, awaiting an easier moment, rejects the liberal's desperate call -- then Gore's graceful exit while leading the pack in the polls will be remembered in a draft-Gore movement at the convention. (Lot of ifs.) 
Trent Lott, doomed from the delayed start of the firestorm, failed to see how his paean at Strom Thurmond's centennial, in Nixon's rueful post-Watergate phrase, "gave 'em a sword" -- provided Democrats with the means to besmear the current G.O.P. with the pitch of the past. 
As a serial apologizer, the hapless Lott not only failed to appeal to his detractors but turned off his supporters, in a classic example of how not to step aside. He is saved from an F first by his willingness to continue to serve in the Senate and protect the narrow Republican majority. (He'll feel better when the White House has to court his support in a squeaker vote.) 
But the Mississippian is bumped up to a passing D mainly because of the way Lott's wife looked back at TV reporters staking out the house of the leader who had finally quit. She distributed a handwritten statement from her husband that turned them into pillars of salt: "Please go home."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: CIVIL LIBERTIES; 
Cities Wary of Antiterror Tactics Pass Civil Liberties Resolutions

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Nearly two dozen cities around the country have passed resolutions urging federal authorities to respect the civil rights of local citizens when fighting terrorism. Efforts to pass similar measures are under way in more than 60 other places.
 While the resolutions are largely symbolic, many of them provide some legal justification for local authorities to resist cooperating in the federal war on terrorism when they deem civil liberties and Constitutional rights are being compromised. 
 Most of the resolutions have passed in liberal bastions like Boulder, Colo.; Santa Fe, N.M.; Cambridge, Mass.; and Berkeley, Calif., where opposition to government policy is a tradition. But less ideological places have also acted, with more localities considering it, from big cities like Chicago and Tampa, Fla., to smaller ones like Fairbanks, Alaska, and Grants Pass, Ore. 
Many communities are getting help from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, a grass-roots group in Florence, Mass.
"People are very, very willing and committed to do everything reasonably possible about terrorist threats," said Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way, a nonprofit group that works for constitutional protections. "But there is a growing concern about the executive branch is handling this, a unilateral assertion of power that, in many instances, intrudes on people's privacy and is carried out in a very secretive manner."
Art Babbott, the City Council member who sponsored the resolution in Flagstaff that passed last week after intense debate, said: "We've been singing the same song in this country for more than 200 years. It's a very good song, and I want to keep singing it. I'm very leery of changing the lyrics." 
Supporters of the resolutions say the measures have grown out of a belief that the Patriot Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act passed this year and a series of executive orders have given the federal government too much muscle in its war against terrorism at the expense of average Americans, especially Muslims. The 2001 act expands government powers in such matters as electronic surveillance, search warrants and detention.
The Homeland Security Act created a cabinet department for national defense.
In most places, the resolutions carry no legal weight, merely affirming the civil rights as federal authorities intensify antiterrorist efforts in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
But resolutions passed by some towns like Amherst, Mass., have a sharper tone, going so far as to direct city personnel not to help federal or state officials in activities that could be considered in violation of civil rights or liberties.
The Amherst measure, for example, says, "to the extent legally possible, no town employee shall officially assist or voluntarily cooperate with investigations, interrogations or arrest procedures" that may be judged to violate civil rights or liberties.
The Flagstaff measure, which passed with a City Council vote of 4 to 3, includes a part written so ambiguously that members on each side of the issue said it could give the police department and other city departments a legal basis to delay or even withhold cooperation with higher authorities investigating a terrorist threat or suspicious person. To the four council members who support the measure, that is a good thing.
The three who opposed it predicted that it could have dangerous consequences.
Nancy Talanian, co-director of the Florence group, said conflicts between local and federal authorities had not emerged. However, in Amherst, faculty members at the University of Massachusetts recently protested the Federal Bureau of Investigation's questioning of Musaddak J. Alhabeeb, an Iraqi-born associate professor of economics, over his views of the Bush administration's plans for war against Iraq.
But no conflicts over the new laws should arise, said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the Justice Department, insisting that they are constitutional.
"We are still living under the Constitution," Mr. Corallo said, asserting that protection of civil liberties is built into all antiterrorism legislation. "We would have it no other way. Everything we do, particularly in the realm of surveillance, we do with the authority and supervision of courts."
The resolutions already adopted, including another passed last week, in Oakland, Calif., are alike in many ways, reflecting a common fear of government aggression in such areas as wiretaps, search warrants and immigration policy. The resolution passed by the board of commissioners of Alachua County, Fla., among others, warns that "civil liberties are precious and may now be threatened" by the government's new powers.
The Boulder City Council resolution "affirms that any efforts to end terrorism not be waged at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties of the people of Boulder, the United States and the World."
The aldermen of Carrboro, N.C., took a slightly stronger position, with a resolution that requires any visiting federal agents to "work in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Carrboro Police Department and in cooperation with the department."
Efforts in some cities to pass resolutions with stronger language were thwarted by legal advisers who argued that requiring federal authorities to comply with municipal standards would create problems. An early version of the measure passed in Santa Cruz, Calif., sounded much the same as Amherst's but was softened at the urging of the city attorney.
"We didn't want to put our police officers in an untenable position," said Mayor Emily Reilly of Santa Cruz.
The same kind of tug of war occurred in Flagstaff, where Mr. Babbott, the resolution sponsor, argued for the kind of language in the Carrboro measure. It was eliminated from the final version after objections from Flagstaff's mayor, Joseph C. Donaldson, and a complaint from the police chief, J. T. McCann, who said the language "thrusts the department into an unenforceable partisan role that is adverse not only to our mission but our long-term partnerships" with other law enforcement agencies.
The final version omitted any reference to the police department but remained strong enough that Mr. Babbott said it would cause local police officers "to think very hard" about any federal requests for assistance that might tread upon citizens' civil liberties.
Mayor Donaldson interpreted the resolution the same way but said any hesitation could hurt the campaign to root out terrorism.
"This creates an environment for misunderstanding and procrastination," he said, adding that the resolution would ultimately have no influence on any visiting federal agents. "When the president came here before the election, his security people didn't pick up a book to read city policies and procedures," he said. "That's just not going to happen."
Meanwhile, council members on both sides of the issue said they had been barraged with criticism through e-mail messages, telephone calls and encounters on the street.
Joe Haughey, a councilman who opposed the resolution, said opponents have told him the resolution "serves as an invitation" for terrorists to come to Flagstaff. Kara Kelty, a councilwoman who voted in favor of the measure, said one telephone caller who opposed her view called her "a bimbo" for supporting it.
But, she said, she felt she voted the right way.
"I'm proud of my community," she said. "Civil liberties, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are dear to us. I didn't want to do anything to alter that."

HEADLINE: Millions Here, and There, and Soon It's a Real New York Race 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Most political professionals and the candidate himself -- say that one reason H. Carl McCall lost the race for governor this year was that he could not raise enough money in the campaign's final weeks to challenge the Republican incumbent, George E. Pataki.
 What is often lost in the postmortems on the 2002 election, however, is that Mr. McCall raised and spent more money than any other Democratic candidate for governor in state history, about $16.7 million. In years past, that would have been enough to mount a formidable campaign. 
 Yet Mr. McCall was left in the dust by Mr. Pataki, who collected and spent $48.4 million, more than twice as much as in 1998, and by Tom Golisano, a billionaire from Rochester, who spent $73.9 million of his own money in what turned out to be a quixotic pursuit of office. 
All told, about $146 million was spent over the last two years on the governor's race in New York, setting a national record for statewide races. No one spent more to run for an office that does not automatically come with Secret Service protection.
The spiraling cost of political races in New York State has spurred more calls for campaign finance reform from advocates for open government. The Assembly's Democratic majority has passed a bill that would greatly limit contributions, ban large donations -- known as soft money -- to special political party committees, and provide for public financing for some candidates.
Governor Pataki has long maintained that he favors limiting contributions and banning soft money, though not using taxes to pay for campaigns. Eighteen months ago, he submitted a bill to the Legislature, but he has done little to advance it.
The governor's bill has languished in the rules committee of the Republican-controlled Senate, where the majority does not have much appetite for changing the status quo.
But some, like Mr. McCall, worry that the skyrocketing cost of running for office is undermining democracy. "Money is becoming the thing that determines who wins and there is absolutely no appetite for reform," Mr. McCall said in an interview this week. "The people who benefit from the present system are the people who would have to reform it."
Defenders of the current system argue that the complaints of people like Mr. McCall are just sour grapes. After all, the cost of everything goes up all the time, they argue, and everyone is competing on the same playing field for donations. They deride public financing for political campaigns as "welfare for politicians."
Those who advocate reforming campaign finance, however, say the rate of inflation for statewide races is staggering. In a similar three-way race in 1994, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Golisano spent a total of $32 million. Four years later, Mr. Pataki, Mr. Golisano and the Democratic challenger, Peter F. Vallone, spent $40 million. This year, Mr. Pataki spent more than that on his own.
Raising such enormous sums of money means politicians must either be billionaires themselves, like Mr. Golisano and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, or must milk more and more wealthy people for donations and loans.
This was true of Mr. McCall, whose outgunned campaign borrowed $2.5 million from his running mate, Dennis Mehiel, a paper-packaging tycoon.
"It just means that the political elite will look more and more alike -- people with immense personal wealth or people with friends that have immense personal wealth, " said Blair Horner, a senior researcher and lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers are cut out of political life."
It is not just statewide races that have become expensive. Wherever there was a competitive race in Senate and Assembly districts, the amounts spent dwarfed the outlays in earlier years.
For instance, a Republican challenger, Martin Goldman, spent $1 million to win a primary and then defeat an incumbent Democratic senator, Vincent Gentile, in the 22nd District in southern Brooklyn. Mr. Gentile exhausted $249,000.
In the 73rd Assembly District, on the Upper East Side, Gail Hilson, a Republican, spent $768,000 in an unsuccessful bid to win the seat left open by the resignation of John Ravitz. A Democrat, Jonathan L. Bing, narrowly prevailed, spending $393,000 to win both the primary and general election.
"It's mind-boggling what the candidates spent this year," Rachel Leon, the executive director of the New York chapter of Common Cause, said. "It makes this incredible mountain you have to climb to run for office."
One reason for the rising costs is that political campaigns are now waged largely on television and radio. During the 1980's and 1990's, the cost of television ads rose each year at three to six times the rate of inflation.
That was especially true in New York City, the hottest media market in the country, making the nationwide trend of rapidly spiraling campaign costs more keenly felt there, political strategists said.
Candidates have to buy more spots to reach people, as well. There are many more channels and programs to watch on regular and cable television, so none of them get the huge ratings that programs on the three major networks received 20 years ago. These days, people use the mute buttons on their remote controls to silence messages, too, or simply flip to another channel during an advertisement. 
In rough terms, political strategists say they now figure candidates need to broadcast three times as many spots to reach the same number of people as they did a decade ago, and those spots are more expensive. An ad on prime time television that cost about $30,000 a decade ago and reached 30 percent of city residents now costs about $70,000 and reaches only 18 percent. 
In the governor's race, the airwaves were particularly cluttered and time was more expensive than usual because it was scarcer -- Mr. Golisano was spending like there was no tomorrow, strategists said. Between Oct. 22 and Nov. 1 alone, he spent $11 million on television, campaign records show.
The growing influence of money in campaigns also gives public polls more weight in determining the outcome, political strategists said. Donors do not like to give money to a losing campaign and so a poll showing a candidate trailing by a large margin can dry up donations.
That is precisely what happened in the race for governor. Mr. McCall was hurt in the two weeks after the primary by ads run extensively upstate by Governor Pataki portraying him as a tax-and-spend liberal, and by a scandal over his using official stationery to recommend his daughter for a job with a company in which he had invested state pension funds.
The ads and the controversy over the letter knocked Mr. McCall down several points in public polls, most of which showed him trailing by more than 10 points. As a result, many big donors stayed away.
Mr. McCall's filings bear this out. He raised relatively little in contributions in the filing period covering the last week of the campaign and the three weeks after the election, about $587,000. Most of his contributions in the last weeks of the campaign from individuals were small, the largest being $10,000, though he did get some late help from a few unions and other Democratic politicians, like Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who gave him $25,000.
Short on cash and facing big-spending opponents, Mr. McCall was forced to borrow heavily from Mr. Mehiel -- $2.5 million during the general election campaign. He also received a $560,000 transfusion from the Democratic National Committee, $160,000 of which arrived on Election Day. He spent about $2.2 million in the final week of the campaign. 
Mr. Pataki, by contrast, collected $2.2 million over the same period just before and after the election. He spent a total of $6.1 million. More than two dozen individuals contributed in amounts exceeding $10,000, among them some prominent Democrats.
Political strategists say there is no way to gauge precisely how important spending is to victory. Mr. Golisano far outspent Mr. Pataki and still could not climb above 14 percent of the vote. Mr. McCall paid far less per vote than either of his opponents -- about $11 -- but still lost with a third of the electorate backing him.
There is also no great hue and cry among voters over campaign spending.
Eleven states have programs that provide partial public financing to candidates for governor, most of them on the condition that the candidates agree to spending limits if they accept the public funds. 
Four other states -- Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont -- have systems that require candidates who choose to receive public funds to refuse private donations. The Massachusetts program, however, has been crippled by the Legislature's refusal to appropriate money for it.
In New York, reform is barely on the public's agenda. Most people seem resigned to the system, pollsters say. During the election, campaign finance reform took a back seat to issues like the commuter tax and education aid, despite efforts by Mr. Golisano and Mr. McCall to raise it.
And while rallies are common at the capital for causes ranging from gay rights to increasing pay for health care workers, one seldom sees anyone marching for limiting campaign contributions. 
"It's not going to happen until the public recognizes this is a perversion of the process and there is some outrage," Mr. McCall said.

Titans Take A.F.C. South

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
One moment, the Tennessee Titans made the playoffs. The next, they won the division.
 At this rate, there is no telling how far the Titans can go in a season that seems to get better by the minute. 
 Eddie George ran for two scores and Steve McNair threw for another yesterday to help the visiting Titans defeat Jacksonville, 28-10, a loss that sent Jaguars Coach Tom Coughlin one step closer to unemployment.
 With their ninth victory in 10 games, the Titans (10-5) became the first team in the jumbled American Football Conference to wrap up a playoff spot. A few minutes later, the Giants closed out a 44-27 victory over the Colts, making Tennessee the first champion of the A.F.C. South.
 There was a muted celebration in the locker room -- the sign of a team that knows it can be playing for much more than just a division title this season. "It's what we expected to do at the beginning of the season," Titans Coach Jeff Fisher said.
 The Jaguars (6-9) are guaranteed their third straight losing season, and Coughlin was booed frequently before a paltry crowd of 51,033 in the last home game of the season.
 Only a garbage touchdown with eight seconds left prevented Jacksonville's most lopsided loss at home. A plane that flew over the stadium summed up the mood of the city with a message that simply said "Coughlin?"
 George ran for 89 yards on 21 carries. Playing with sore ribs and an achy lower back, McNair ran for a season-high 58 yards, threw for 115 more and hit Derrick Mason for a 5-yard score.

HEADLINE: An End to the Southern Strategy? 

BYLINE:  By Linwood Holton; Linwood Holton, a Republican, was governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974.

DATELINE: WEEMS, Va. 

 BODY:
Trent Lott's demise as leader of the Senate Republicans is more than the story of one man being undone by a failure to understand race in America. It is also a chance for the Republican Party to decide whether it really wants to end American racial inequality or if it wants to continue its strategy of exploiting the issue for partisan gain.
 Thirty-five years ago, a debate raged within the party. Should Republicans take advantage of Southern Democrat resentment over the civil rights movement by luring white Southern racists into the fold? Or should it seek to build the party by doing just the opposite: opening its arms to African-American voters? 
 Since the 1950's I had been working to build a Republican base in Virginia, where the strong Democratic machine, led by the ultra-segregationist Harry Byrd Sr., held a stranglehold. By the mid-1960's, the Virginia Republican Party -- with broad support of African-Americans -- was positioned to score major political victories.
I was part of a group of moderates from around the country who were urging the party to welcome black voters by supporting equal voting rights and equal employment measures. We felt that a coalition of moderates, blacks and pro-business voters would be unstoppable -- even in the Democrats' old stronghold, the South, where blacks made up as much as 20 percent of the electorate in some states.
Unfortunately a more cynical vision prevailed among the party's national leaders. With Nixon strategists leading the charge, these few (but prominent) Republicans opted for the so-called Southern strategy to lure white racists into a coalition with the party's traditional business constituency. The tactic was simple: lace your speeches with coded appeals to racists in Southern states, dressing the policies up in the language of fiscal conservatism.
When challenged about the racial nature of the rhetoric, the Southern Strategist would defend himself by claiming ignorance: "I didn't mean that, of course." The intended target of the message -- the racist voter -- understood completely, while leaving the politician "plausible deniability" with non-racist voters.
And so for decades, this approach has lingered. The controversy over the Martin Luther King holiday is a perfect example. Republicans (and some Democrats) playing the Southern strategy cast the debate as a question of the economic impact of giving government workers a day off, ignoring the appeal of honoring an American hero.
The Confederate flag debate is another example. The Southern Strategist casts the debate as a matter of state pride, claiming that the Civil War was about "states' rights" not slavery -- an absurd assertion that neglects the fact that the only state right truly at issue was the right to enslave Africans.
With the South today strongly Republican, it has become conventional wisdom that the Southern strategy was a tremendous, if shameful, success. But this ignores the historic gains we made in Virginia by soundly rejecting the Southern strategy. Working with a band of allies throughout the state, I gradually put together a progressive coalition of business, labor and African-Americans. In 1965 I ran for governor and won an impressive, though losing, vote total. (Convinced that I would never win that year, many major black political organizations endorsed my opponent.)
But the next election was different: having seen that I was a real competitor, blacks in 1969 voted for me in substantial numbers (although the polls were a bit sketchy then, I probably received nearly 40 percent of the African-American vote) and I was elected the first Republican governor of Virginia since Reconstruction.
This was lost, however, on the national Republican Party, which was willing to accept the membership of Southern white supremacists as the price to pay for a hoped-for Republican Senate majority. 
As the Southern strategy unfolded in the Nixon era some of us argued that it was not only morally bankrupt but short-sighted: racism's ugliness might linger for many years, but racism was without a doubt dissolving in our pluralist society. The strategy might work for a while, we said, but in the long run it would drive black voters from our party, possibly for good, and it offered no replacements for the white racist voters as they gradually died off.
And now, Trent Lott's epic fall is a sign that the long run is upon us. That he was done in by the sort of comment he and other Southern Republicans have been able to get away with for decades -- using that old "I didn't really mean it" line when they got caught -- shows that the Southern strategy it now as ineffective as it is immoral. 
Republicans must now decide where we should take our party. We can go with President Bush, who reminded us that "every day our nation was segregated was a day that America was unfaithful to our founding ideals." Or we can hang on to the divisive politics of racism and sink gradually, but inevitably, into oblivion.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
In the next year, thefederal government will move to give the public easier online access to data and services.

BYLINE:  By Rebecca Fairley Raney 

 BODY:
THE federal government, with its tangle of agencies and regulations, has never played particularly well on the Internet, where fast-flying facts prevail.
 As things now stand, conducting a search of federal databases on topics like toxic waste or the safety of frozen pizzas can be a frustratingly complex task. Toxic waste is handled by a half-dozen different agencies, all of which run their own Web sites and adhere to different policies about posting reports. And frozen pizzas are inspected by two different agencies -- the Food and Drug Administration for cheese pizzas and the Department of Agriculture if the pies have meat toppings -- each with its own approach to record keeping. 
 Until now, separate agencies have had neither motive nor means to collaborate on making their information and services easier to use online.
In the next year, though, a new Office of Electronic Government is to start removing information barriers between federal agencies to give the public easier online access to data and services. That is the mandate of the E-Government Act, which President Bush signed last week.
The new office is charged with organizing the various services, rules and reports issued by the government in ways that make sense to the public. The law, which was written by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, allocates $45 million to an e-government fund this year. That fund will grow to $150 million in four years.
The new law's goals have broad support, even though some experts question whether breaking those barriers could undermine the independence of federal agencies and create unprecedented invasions of individuals' privacy. But few would argue that the current hodgepodge of federal Web sites does not need an overhaul.
"Most people don't know what federal agencies do," said Darrell M. West, who studies government Web sites as director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University. "We've had a real Tower of Babel in e-government in which each agency designs its own site."
But he noted that some government employees fear the implications of the new e-government push. "This is consistent with the Bush philosophy about homeland security -- not having unions, running in a more corporate style," Professor West said. "This could be a device to drive that agenda." 
One provision in the new law, for example, is for a "digital tech corps," which allows technology workers from corporations to work for government agencies in an exchange program. And while government employees are accustomed to working regular business hours, e-government services would operate around the clock.
The requirements of the new law create more work for federal agencies as well. In the past, agencies arbitrarily decided what information to post on their Web sites. Now, they must establish public comment periods and take public opinion into account when deciding what information to publish online.
The law also requires agencies to conduct a "privacy impact assessment" every time they buy new technology systems. That assessment would require an agency to go through a checklist to determine whether the technology could lead to abuses of personal information.
Even with this requirement, the push under the new law to link government databases is a concern to some government watchdogs. One provision of the bill encourages the creation of a single software protocol that for the first time would enable disparate government computer systems to communicate. That could allow the compilation of dossiers and databases not previously practical.
"At a certain level, that's good government," said James X. Dempsey, the deputy director of the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. "The flip side of it is, some of our privacy protections have been almost accidental, in that information was difficult to find."
Advocates of privacy rights have become particularly touchy about the notion of linking government databases in light of the Defense Department's proposed Total Information Awareness program, which, among other measures, would enable the government to monitor every American citizen's bank transactions, tax filings, driving records, credit card purchases, medical records, telephone calls and e-mail exchanges in the name of fighting terrorism.
And yet, if members of the public disapprove of the actions of federal agencies, the E-Government Act provides new ways to complain.
Under the law, every regulatory agency must establish a Web site to collect and post public comments on every rule it considers. For example, if the Federal Aviation Administration were considering a new rule about air travel, members of the public would be able to comment on the rule by e-mail messages and to read comments from others. 
"You can complain about government using technology for surveillance, but government can also use it to become more accountable," said Steven Clift, editor of the Democracies Online Newswire.
The requirement to collect public comments online could bring changes to the cultures of regulatory agencies, which typically receive comments only from small groups of highly specialized lawyers who represent consumer groups and regulated corporations.
"To have government be the host of this sort of deliberation is a significant step forward for e-democracy," Mr. Clift said. "It creates transparency around those attempting to politically influence rules and regulations," he said, noting that under the traditional system, "you don't know where your comments go, and you don't know how your comments compare to those of other people." 
The law also places the executive branch far ahead of Congress in terms of a uniform approach to the Internet. Members of Congress decide how to run their Internet operations office by office. Consequently, some Congressional Web sites are comprehensive, and some only spotty. Some members communicate with constituents well online, but many do not.
Despite requests from public interest groups over the last few years, members of Congress have opted not to post much information online -- which means the public does not have a searchable database of members' voting records or Web access to the independent analysis of bills from the Congressional Research Service.
"E-government for Congress is missing," Mr. Dempsey said. "They are cutting themselves off."

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SAYS IT REGAINS ACCESS TO ITS PLUTONIUM 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
North Korea said today that it had removed the equipment that international inspectors installed more than eight years ago to make sure that it would not make use of its large stockpile of plutonium to produce nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials said they feared that North Korea could use that plutonium to manufacture five or six nuclear weapons within months.
 The action, coming one day after North Korea took similar monitoring equipment off a nuclear reactor, intensifies the crisis over North Korea's nuclear capability, at a moment when President Bush has tried to focus the world's attention on the threat posed by Iraq. It also poses a challenge to the newly elected government in South Korea. Page A12. 
 Several outside experts -- and a few Bush administration officials speaking on background this evening -- said North Korea might now be able to create a small nuclear arsenal in the coming year, assuming it has the technical ability to engineer a working nuclear weapon. 
The removal of surveillance cameras and seals from a pond where spent nuclear fuel rods are stored essentially puts Mr. Bush in the same position where President Bill Clinton was in 1994, when North Korea threatened to turn its plutonium into additional weaponry. By that time, the Central Intelligence Agency already believed that North Korea had separated enough plutonium to produce two nuclear weapons.
Mr. Clinton responded to the threat by reinforcing American troops on the Korean Peninsula and considered a plan to bomb the nuclear site at Yongbyon, before the situation was defused in a negotiated settlement. That settlement is now shattered, and some administration officials are clearly worried that Mr. Bush may face a crisis in North Korea at the very moment he is sending tens of thousands of troops to the Middle East. "We still think Saddam is the bigger threat," one senior official said tonight, "but there is no question that the North Koreans, who already have superior firepower, may soon be in a position to threaten to deploy or sell its nuclear capability. Iraq is a long way from that."
North Korea's move was immediately condemned by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which acknowledged that without the surveillance equipment it could not guarantee that the plutonium "has not been diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devises."
The Bush administration's public reaction was far more muted, consistent with its effort in recent weeks to play down the North Korean threat and to say nothing that might provoke a military crisis in the region. Still, several senior officials seemed stunned that North Korea had moved so quickly to escalate its confrontation with the West, and particularly with the United States. 
"The 8,000-odd spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they could be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons," Louis Fintor, a State Department spokesman, said today, referring to the fuel rods that the Central Intelligence Agency estimates contain a total of about 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds, of plutonium. "They have no relevance for the generation of electricity."
Mr. Fintor was referring to North Korea's claims last week that it would have to restart its nuclear reactor to make up for energy lost because oil shipments from the West had been suspended. Under pressure from Washington, Japan, South Korea and the European Union decided last month to hold up those shipments because North Korea had admitted to violating the nuclear freeze agreement it signed in 1994.
North Korea's acknowledgment of its program came in October, when American officials visiting Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, confronted their hosts with evidence that the country was trying to enrich uranium. North Korea has so far refused to allow inspectors to see that program in operation, demanding that that United States first negotiate a new accord with it.
So far, Mr. Bush has refused. But the action today creates new pressure on the administration either to negotiate with North Korea or risk a military confrontation. In 1994, Mr. Clinton considered a military strike on the nuclear complex at Yongbyon if it appeared that North Korea was trying to reprocess its spent fuel rods into bomb-grade plutonium.
"There was every indication at that time that President Clinton would have used force rather than allow the North Koreans to separate more plutonium to produce nuclear weapons," Robert L. Gallucci, Mr. Clinton's chief negotiator with North Korea, said today.
"I wouldn't advocate the use of military force now," said Mr. Gallucci, dean of the school of foreign service at Georgetown University. "But the administration has put itself in a very difficult spot, because its philosophical position against negotiations, its embrace of moral clarity, denies them the option of dealing with this issue through negotiations."
Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and the departing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said "this is a greater danger immediately to U.S. interests at this very moment, in my view, than Saddam Hussein is."
He added: "If they lift the seals on these canisters, they're going to be able to build four to five additional nuclear weapons within months if they begin that reprocessing operation."
A senior administration official said today that no one was looking at tougher measures against North Korea, like a blockade or economic penalties. But he warned, despite Mr. Bush's recent assurances that he had no intention of invading North Korea, that the United States might have to consider "nondiplomatic" actions if the North moved much closer to building new weapons.
Even before the announcement today, the administration was concerned about North Korea's actions, though there is disagreement within the administration about whether Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, is seeking to force Washington to the negotiating table, or to exploit a growing disagreement between Washington and South Korea over how to handle the North.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called his counterparts in China, Russia and South Korea on Saturday to seek support for the administration's strategy. So far, that strategy has been one of insisting that North Korea give up its nuclear ambitions, and allow international inspectors full run of the country, before the United States would enter into talks about improving relations.
At the time Mr. Powell spoke, North Korea had already told the I.A.E.A. that it was removing surveillance devices from its nuclear reactor. Administration officials considered that move a carefully modulated effort to raise the stakes, because it would take a year to 18 months before the reactor was back online and able to produce enough plutonium to begin a bomb project.
This morning, administration officials were saying they doubted North Korea would take the provocative step of disabling the monitors and seals at the pond where spent fuel is stored. However, within hours, North Korea had done exactly that.
Just how quickly North Korea could turn that spent fuel into reprocessed plutonium is debated among technical experts. But Mr. Gallucci noted today that in 1994, "the top priority I was given was to get hold of that spent fuel and get it shipped out of the country, because it represented the biggest risk."
South Korean analysts noted North Korea's history of trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States. And they predicted even more provocative actions in the coming weeks, as North Korea seems emboldened by growing anti-American sentiment in South Korea.
"In the past, confrontation tactics by the North Korean government would typically drive the South Korean government into the arms of the United States," said Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute. "It hasn't been happening that way in the last few months. So why not try more?"
Until this weekend, supporters of re-engaging North Korea had been heartened by the victory of Roh Moo Hyun in South Korea's presidential election. Mr. Roh has been a strong advocate of the reconciliation policy toward North Korea and a frequent critic of American power. But the North's latest actions may have tipped the balance decisively against the engagement camp, administration officials said.
On Capitol Hill, pressure is coming from both sides of the debate.
On Sunday, Senator Richard G. Lugar, a centrist Republican from Indiana who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in January, argued that renewing talks with North Korea was the best way to defuse tensions. 
But on Friday, even before North Korea's actions were known, Arizona's Republican senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain, urged the Bush administration to avoid new negotiations until North Korea eliminates its weapons program.

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE REACTION; 
Among Blacks, Mixed Feelings On Fall of Lott

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga., Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Thad Mayfield, 47, was not happy with the remarks that led to Trent Lott's demise as Senate Republican leader. But as a native of Greenwood, Miss. -- just 20 miles from Mr. Lott's birthplace -- he says he understands where Mr. Lott was coming from. He also says he believes he understands why the Republicans forced him from his leadership post.
 "It certainly goes against what the president wants to project as the Republican image," said Mr. Mayfield, a black management consultant who now lives in Lithonia, Ga. "Like at the Republican convention, when African-Americans giving the speeches far outnumbered the black delegates. It's image control." 
 In interviews in a dozen cities and towns across the country this last-minute-shopping weekend, black Americans eagerly welcomed the chance to talk about the furor surrounding Mr. Lott's comment on Dec. 5 that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948 when Mr. Thurmond was an adamant segregationist. But their responses to Mr. Lott's removal ranged widely, from a newfound approval of President Bush to a renewed hostility toward him and all Republicans. 
In a sign that the White House's public scolding of Mr. Lott and its thinly veiled efforts to depose him may indeed help the Republican Party mollify black voters, some credited Mr. Bush with engineering Mr. Lott's resignation as Senate Republican leader, and many expressed a measure of affection for Mr. Bush.
Yet others, including Mr. Mayfield, expressed distaste for the way the White House had handled the situation, saying it smacked of disloyalty and pandering. They said that Mr. Bush's forceful denunciation and undercutting of Mr. Lott seemed directed more at white swing voters than at blacks, and said the proof of the president's sincerity would rest on whether he now begins a national conversation about race in earnest or seeks merely to put the whole subject to rest.
Mr. Mayfield, who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George Bush in 1988 but did not support George W. Bush in 2000, said he saw Mr. Lott's ouster more as an intramural Republican power play than as a gesture to African-American voters.
"The bottom line is, I didn't think he should have resigned," he said while shopping here. "Actually, I think what happened had nothing to do with whether he's racist. Anybody born in Mississippi at the time he was, if not a racist, has at least some racial biases. I'm just not sure that the Republican leadership was comfortable with Trent, and this was their opportunity."
Stone Mountain, a quaint village on Atlanta's outskirts where the Ku Klux Klan once held cross-burning rallies, has in recent years become a lure for middle-class blacks. Zettia Harris, a teacher who grew up here, said Mr. Lott's remark came as a rude reawakening. "A lot of times my friends wouldn't want to come visit me because of the K.K.K.," she said. "What he said, Lott, really hit home, because you think you're ahead of all this, and then it's like taking you back to the past."
Ms. Harris, who said she was a committed Democrat, said she nonetheless took the president at his word on the subject of race and believed he was "trying to show black Americans that he can be sensitive."
But Mr. Mayfield said he was concerned more with "substance" in politics than with words, and cited among other things Mr. Bush's recent nomination to a federal appeals court of Charles W. Pickering, a Mississippian with his own much criticized record on race. He also pointed to the president's endorsement of Georgia's governor-elect, Sonny Perdue, despite Mr. Perdue's vociferous opposition to removing the Confederate battle emblem from the Georgia state flag. "Substantively, if you look at many Republican voting records, they wouldn't be dissimilar from Trent Lott's," Mr. Mayfield said.
"I wouldn't say it's hypocritical of the president, but in my mind, nominating a Charles Pickering was much more of a statement than what Trent Lott said at a party for Strom Thurmond," Mr. Mayfield continued. "It's disingenuous for Bush to be so dramatic in his denouncement of Trent Lott. And to take it a step further, it's also interesting -- whether Sonny Perdue would acknowledge it or not -- that the president could campaign so forcefully for Sonny Perdue given the flag issue surrounding Sonny's campaign. It just seems inconsistent to me."
Along the boardwalk in the Venice section of Los Angeles, Gregory Jackson-Collins, 44, a displaced Mississippian, said he had not been so offended by Mr. Lott's remarks. "I didn't think he meant it that way," he said, while peddling his paintings to beachgoers. "I thought he got caught in the moment." Mr. Jackson-Collins said he has been a Republican for 20 years, ever since he voted for Mr. Reagan. "It's more of an American party," he said. "Certain values like pride in your country, family -- black people are down with that."
His feelings about affirmative action have led him in the same direction politically. "When I was in school, people would say, 'The only reason you're here is because of affirmative action,' " he said. "Affirmative action makes you a second-class citizen. The Republican Party says forget all that. That's why I like the Republican Party."
Mr. Jackson-Collins is impressed by the prominent roles blacks play in the Republican Party. "You've got Colin Powell as secretary of state and Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser," he said. "How many Democrats get that kind of love on the international stage?"
Still, Mr. Jackson-Collins said that though he liked Mr. Bush, he would not vote for him. "It all comes down to money," he said. "Democrats have more social programs. Republicans say you've got to get your own."
A main premise of Republican strategists appeared to be that blacks would be appreciative of Mr. Bush for deposing Mr. Lott. And in Richmond, Va., Galene Williams, a property manager, said she was. 
"I didn't expect him to take the stand he did," Ms. Williams, 30, said, minding her 2-year-old as her mother and sister shopped at Victoria's Secret. "He's probably going to get a lot more black votes." 
Yet many blacks interviewed said they disapproved of Mr. Lott's removal. "The one thing I found out about the Republicans that I think is interesting is the way they actually know this is his philosophy, but just because it became public, they have abandoned him, and that kind of disturbs me," said Elijah Pringle Jr., an analyst for Prudential Life Insurance in Philadelphia.
"It tells me the Republican Party -- or the people who are in charge of the Republican Party, not the people at large -- have no sense of loyalty," he said, after emceeing a youth dance performance in Mount Airy, a racially diverse neighborhood. "Even though Lott said things that were completely off the wall, I still think they should stand behind someone. Right or wrong, you stand behind them. Because if I make a mistake and I fix my mistake, I am a better person. But abandon me because you are afraid you'll lose some votes? Come on. That's not sincere. It is absolutely pandering."
Clearly, in some parts of the country, the Republican choreography that led Mr. Lott to step down as leader did little to mitigate the damage done by his remark.
In the Bronx, LaShanda Bell, 23, a Democrat, said the whole affair actually relieved her of a little guilt. "At times I felt I was being narrow-minded about how I felt about Republicans, but after that statement I don't regret how I feel about them," she said while sipping a white chocolate mocha drink at the Barnes & Noble in Co-op City.
"I don't think that black Americans have felt that Republicans truly stand for them and want to help them succeed." She added, apparently unmoved by the party's history, "I'm pretty sure that if they had it their way we'd all be enslaved still."
Moe Blackwell, 28, a Detroit clothier, said he believed most Republicans harbored views like Mr. Lott's. "He's just the only idiot in front of a camera that would say something like that," Mr. Blackwell said.
Marvina Johnson, 32, a health-insurance coordinator who was shopping in a Nashville mall, was even blunter. "When you think Republican," she said, "you think racist."
But those who said they viewed Mr. Bush and all Republicans as no less hostile to blacks than Mr. Lott were also more likely to cite old grudges to bolster their arguments: Mr. Bush's record as governor in Texas, where executions of blacks were commonplace, for example, and Mr. Bush's accession to the presidency only after a Supreme Court decision that several interviewees said set aside black voters' overwhelming preference for Al Gore.
"We didn't put him in office," Raymond Lewis, 33, a Richmond foundry worker, said. "So our votes don't count."
Even those who praised Mr. Bush for his handling of the Lott situation made clear that it would take much more for him to win their support in 2004 -- and they invariably said that matters like war and economics would play a bigger part in decisions. 
"If the economy doesn't change, he'll be like his dad, a one-term president," said Tommy Brittain, 53, who was walking to a computer store in Stone Mountain to get his Palm Pilot fixed. "We can't get Osama, we can't get Saddam. If we don't get either one, we go to war, and the economy's in the pits, he's out again."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
A Brahmin Filmmaker's Battle to Tell India's Story in India

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: BOMBAY 

 BODY:
When India's censor board came back with 21 cuts it wanted made before his new documentary, "War and Peace," could be shown, Anand Patwardhan girded himself for what has become a familiar battle.
 Mr. Patwardhan has been making documentaries that challenge India's establishment for 30 years, becoming one of the country's most respected documentarians. For almost as long he has been battling the state in one form or another for the right to show his films uncensored. 
 "War and Peace" is a nearly three-hour work that ranges from India to Pakistan, Japan and the United States to take a critical look at the phenomenon of "nuclear nationalism." It opens with the killing of Mohandas K. Gandhi, then examines the triumphalist reaction within India to the testing of a nuclear bomb in May 1998.
Not surprisingly, the film's antiwar, antinuclear message did not find favor with censors answerable to a government led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, for which the nuclear test was an important achievement.
Among the scenes that the Central Board of Film Certification ordered Mr. Patwardhan to cut was the killing of Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist. He was ordered to cut scenes, shot after the nuclear test, of Hindus celebrating by cutting their hands with blades and signing congratulations in blood. Delete, he was told, critical comments about the Bharatiya Janata Party and scenes with the country's leaders.
The demanded cuts almost all touched on politically sensitive spots, which is exactly why he would not cut them, Mr. Patwardhan said in an interview. For six months he has been battling the censor board through its appellate tribunal, which is asking for significantly fewer cuts. He said he would fight it out in court if the tribunal insisted on cuts.
In India the film was shown at the Mumbai International Film Festival where it won the best film/video award but has since been screened only privately, mostly in the living rooms of the elite.
The New York Film/Video Council in conjunction with the Museum of Modern Art in New York recently showed "War and Peace" at the Gramercy Theater, and the director discussed the film there the next day.
Mr. Patwardhan, 52, was born and educated in Bombay, where he still lives. His mother is a potter; his father, a retired publisher. His political philosophy was shaped partly by his upbringing in a family of Gandhians and freedom fighters.
He is a Brahmin, which he said imbued him with a sense of social obligation. That sense only became stronger after he returned from the United States, where he studied at Brandeis University in the early 1970's and joined the antiwar movement. "I went to jail with my professor and got an A in the course," he said. He worked with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers and became an unrepentant liberal.
In India his first documentary was about the student movement in the state of Bihar, which led to Indira Gandhi's imposing a national state of emergency. The film, like the movement, was driven underground. Unable to show it in India, he showed it in Canada, where he went to get a master's degree at McGill University.
It was the first but not the last time that Mr. Patwardhan would have an easier time showing his films outside his country than inside. One film, on the slum dwellers of Bombay, was shown for the first time on national television in India five years after it was made, and only after Mr. Patwardhan won successive court battles.
"You have to be a filmmaker, and then you have to be a lawyer as well," he said. But some friends say he may have become too caught up in battling the censors, at the cost of getting his films a timely airing.
Starting in the late 1980's Mr. Patwardhan trained his lens on the country's growing Hindu nationalist movement. His film "In the Name of God" examined the drive by Hindu nationalists to demolish a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya on a site that many Hindus believe is the birthplace of Lord Ram. The film was finished in 1991. The next year a mob demolished the mosque brick by brick. 
Mr. Patwardhan's 1995 film "Father, Son and Holy War" also examined religious fundamentalism, looking at how it oppresses both Hindu and Muslim women. He compared fundamentalist speeches with men selling aphrodisiacs on the street. Both, he said, create insecurity that "you're not a real man" and then offer a tonic.
For a man who was heavily influenced by his time in America, Mr. Patwardhan is no fan of America's influence on India, particularly what he sees as the "might is right" ethos. He calls "nuclear machismo" the driving force for the bomb everywhere. India, he argues, is no different. The politicians in his film do not talk about the bomb as deterring a threat to India but about the country's newfound prestige. "They're saying openly, 'Now we're on the map,' " he said.
He has also made films best categorized as "antiglobalization" on fishermen losing their livelihoods to big foreign ships, for example. 
In the 1990's India started liberalizing its economy, in fits and starts. Mr. Patwardhan criticizes the current government for moving away from Nehru's closed socialist economy although most economists agree that is exactly what India needs to do.
"They keep nationalism alive at the rhetorical level while surrendering sovereignty in real terms," he said of the government. On this point Mr. Patwardhan is in line with the Hindu right, whose attacks on privatization of state-owned companies and liberalization at large have slowed the process.
But on most other issues he is an emblem of a growing gap between India's secular, liberal elite and Hindu nationalists who say it is they who reflect popular sentiments. The recent landslide victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat, which was the site of deadly Hindu-Muslim riots this spring, would appear to support that contention. The party campaigned on themes of Hindu pride and Hindu vulnerability to Islamic terrorism and Muslim hegemony. 
Mr. Patwardhan's message sits no better with many Indians overseas than it does with his government. Last February a planned screening of two of his films at the American Museum of Natural History was moved to New York University because, museum officials said, the large space needed for the screening was being renovated.
"Indians in America want a perfect image of India," Mr. Patwardhan said. "They don't want the dark side."

HEADLINE: Debate Erupts Over Authors Of the Dead Sea Scrolls 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
Hundreds of books and thousands of articles have been written about the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered more than 50 years ago in caves near the ruins of a forlorn settlement known as Qumran. Scholars and divines have transcribed, translated and argued over the texts, searching for insights into the history of ancient Israel at a time of transition in Judaism and the origin of Christianity.
 But Qumran itself went largely unexplored for the longest time. Even the results of the few initial excavations in the 1950's have remained mostly unpublished and unavailable for independent study. 
 The situation, some scholars say, is not unlike the handling of the scrolls themselves, which were tightly held by select biblical scholars whose control over their publication was finally broken after a rancorous struggle a decade ago. 
Now it is the archaeologists who are restive. Many no longer accept without question the view of Qumran advanced after the first excavations by the Rev. Roland de Vaux, a French biblical scholar and archaeologist.
Examining building foundations, graves and possible ritual baths at the site, Father de Vaux concluded that this had been a self-contained monastic settlement of Essenes, a strict Jewish sect, and that it was their scribes who wrote the scrolls in the first centuries B.C. and A.D. Some of the ascetic practices and radical religious beliefs mentioned in the scrolls appeared to correspond with Essene doctrine, as recorded by near-contemporary historians like Josephus, Pliny and Philo Judaeus.
Challenges to this interpretation have been mounting in recent years. Qumran may instead have been a military fortress, some scholars contend, or a fortified manor house or a villa. It may have been an agricultural community or commercial entrepot. In any case, it is increasingly argued, there is no firm archaeological evidence linking the Qumran settlement to the scrolls found in the nearby caves.
The crumbling consensus was manifest at a conference of Qumran archaeologists held here in November at Brown University. Organizers said this was the first meeting to focus solely on the archaeology of the site, 12 miles south of Jericho on a rugged plateau above the western shore of the Dead Sea.
From their new research, archaeologists described pottery that seemed to refute the de Vaux hypothesis and other pottery in support. They inferred from the tableware the possible size and nature of the community. They reported on skeletons exhumed from the graveyard -- why would a couple of women be buried in an Essene cemetery? They argued over whether an aqueduct and some basins were there for ritual baths or were simply for drinking water or agriculture. Sometimes the discord grew heated.
"There is no new consensus," Dr. Katharina M. Galor, a Brown archaeologist and an organizer of the conference, said during a break in the talks. "Or the new consensus is that the old consensus is dead."
Dr. Jean-Baptiste Humbert of the French Biblical and Archaeological School of Jerusalem, successor to Father de Vaux at the school, now deceased, generally defended the traditional interpretation. But he conceded, "Today, no one can prove that Qumran is an Essene site, though the hypothesis remains the most likely one." 
Dr. James D. Tabor, a historian and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said in an interview: "Most would agree, that's the best hypothesis. But if you go beyond that and ask specific questions, then you get a different story."
Perhaps reflecting the view of many skeptics of the Essene connection, Dr. Yizhar Hirschfeld of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said, "To support the monastic nature of the settlement, scholars sometimes have overmanipulated the archaeological evidence."
Father de Vaux, for example, has been criticized as perhaps seeing Qumran through the lens of his own life as a Dominican priest living in a close religious community.
It may be understandable that he saw the outlines of large rooms in the main building and the absence of private dwellings as evidence of a communal social structure, like a monastery. The traces of water basins suggested the presence of miqva'ot, or Jewish ritual baths, which an Essene community would have had. And the individual graves in the cemetery were unlike the burials in family tombs favored by most Jews at the time, and nearly all of those dug up contained skeletons of adult men.
In Father de Vaux's defense, Dr. Galor noted that archaeologists at that time had scarcely studied the shores of the Dead Sea. "Only after you see other things at other sites, getting a regional picture, then you see that Qumran is probably not such a unique site," she said.
As they sought to re-evaluate the site, several speakers ended their reviews of new findings on a note of frustration.
"I am hampered by the fact that most of the material for Qumran is not published," said Dr. Jodi Magness of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a defender of the de Vaux thesis who is the author of the well-regarded "Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Eerdmans, 2002). "This is all subject to revision after everything is published."
Dr. Jurgen Zangenberg of the University of Wuppertal in Germany said, "The deplorable lack of relevant data affects all theories on Qumran, the mainstreamers and the rebels and iconoclasts alike."
Only one volume of Father de Vaux's excavations report has been published, with two more yet to come from Dr. Humbert's group, possibly in the next year or two. The project, based at the French school in Jerusalem but involving an international team of scholars, has been held up by a lack of money. 
As of now, many archaeologists say, there is no unequivocal evidence of who the people living at Qumran were, or what they were doing there. These are the core questions driving renewed excavations, which started in the 1990's. 
Several conference speakers, notably Dr. Hirschfeld, reported findings suggesting that this was an agricultural community. The people there may have cultivated dates and other fruit. There was some reason to think the people grew balsam for perfume or indigo to dye linen. Therefore, archaeologists said, the number of workshops on the premises could be explained, and the basins could have been soaking pools for balsam or vats for processing indigo.
As Dr. Mireille Belis of the French school in Jerusalem said, indigo plants were grown on the shores of the Dead Sea, required plenty of water and were a valuable commodity. "One pound of linen required approximately 50 pounds of dye, which in cost would be equal to 4,000 chickens," she said.
Dr. Magen Broshi of the Israel Museum and Dr. Hanan Eshel of Bar-Ilan University in Israel disagreed. They said the area's aridity and water salinity were not favorable to extensive agriculture. A nearby oasis was indeed a farm, they pointed out, but it seems to have been limited to a single crop, date palms.
Others said the existence of some farming did not necessarily preclude a religious function of the community. It could have been the way the Essenes supported themselves.
Recent excavations revealed several kilns, many pottery shards and other evidence possibly supporting an extensive ceramics industry at the site. The similarity in style of pottery found in the ruins there and the clay jars that held the scrolls was an important point in associating Qumran with the cave scrolls when the traditional hypothesis was first proposed.
But that argument may be undermined by research reported by Dr. Rachel Bar Nathan of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Examining pottery styles in the region, she found the same types of ceramics prevalent in Jericho and elsewhere. Qumran may not have been such an isolated community, she concluded, but appeared to have had many commercial ties throughout the region.
The regional approach is one of the new elements in Qumran studies, involving scientists, sociologists and scholars of ancient economics. Dr. Zangenberg said this "will teach us that even 'religious sites' -- if Qumran was anything like that -- had their economic, their social structure and natural environment that determined the range of options" that influenced the community's character and operation.
One of the earliest and most vocal critics of the Essene hypothesis has been Dr. Norman Golb, professor of Near Eastern languages and civilization at the University of Chicago. In the 1980's, he was struck by the multiplicity of Jewish religious interpretations and practices recorded in the scrolls. This did not seem to him to be the work of a single sect like the Essenes.
Instead, Dr. Golb argued that the scrolls were written by a variety of Jewish religious thinkers and were hurriedly moved from Jerusalem libraries when the city fell to the Roman army in A.D. 70. Refugees hid them in the caves near Qumran for safekeeping.
In that case, the scrolls would have had nothing to do directly with Qumran itself, which Dr. Golb contends was a military fortress.
His is no longer the voice in the wilderness it once was. Many at the conference were open to the possibility that the scrolls were not the work of the Essenes, though no one presented solid evidence that Qumran had been a military base throughout its occupation.
But Dr. Golb was not invited to the conference. "Others don't want to acknowledge that mine is the best hypothesis," he said in a telephone interview.
So contentious is the entire subject of Qumran, Dr. Galor said, that some scholars who were invited agreed to attend only if some others of opposing schools of thought were excluded.
After the conference, Dr. Galor said that this was only "the starting point of a true scholarly discussion" on Qumran, and it may take another decade before it is clear where current research and excavations are leading. Even that may be too soon, she said, to resolve the issue of whether the Essenes lived there and wrote the scrolls.
With hope but no certainty, Dr. Galor mused, "Maybe, at the next international conference devoted to the archaeology of Qumran, one will be able to detect the beginnings of a consensus."

F1) Chart/Map: "The Mystery of the Caves"One of the sensational discoveries of the last century, the Dead Sea Scrolls were hidden in caves near the ruins of an ancient settlement known as Qumran. After early excavations, archaeologists concluded that members of a strict Jewish sect, the Essenes, had lived there in a kind ofmonastery. Outlines of their supposed dining halls, kitchens, pantries, workshops and ritual baths were traced. One large room was thought to be the scriptorium where the Essenes had written the scrolls, which include parts of the Hebrew Bible and other religious texts. Now the Essene connection with the scrolls is being challenged. New research suggests that Qumran may not have been an isolated religious commune but was an agricultural community with commercial ties throughout the Dead Sea region.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
The Fabric Of Life In the Park

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
The artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude came up with a plan 23 years ago to erect gates draped in saffron-colored fabric in Central Park. Thousands of them would meander along pathways for two weeks during the winter when the trees are bare so the gates could be seen. Then they would be removed. A simple, slightly mad idea, and beautiful.
 Since then this husband-and-wife team has wrapped buildings, surrounded islands with pink floating fabric, installed giant blue and yellow umbrellas, and strung miles of curtains at locales from Florida to California to Japan to Europe, turning doubters into converts, while New York City, art's supposed capital, has dragged its heels. 
 Until now. Maybe.
Last week the Central Park Conservancy passed a resolution giving its support, basically. Christo and Jeanne-Claude said yesterday that they still had not heard from the conservancy, a private organization, which donates millions to maintain the park. 
Meanwhile it turns out that the artists have been negotiating a contract with the Parks Department. They are reluctant to talk about it. They don't want anything to spoil progress, having got so close to approval after so many years. Yesterday they told me that an announcement by the city may come very soon. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has already said he likes the idea.
Charlatans? Shamans? With their hard-sell tactics, their followers trailing them like Deadheads from one gig to the next, their feel-good populism and phenomenally expensive, grandiose ambitions, it's no wonder Christo and Jeanne-Claude have made skeptics of people who haven't seen their work, don't understand it or don't want to, and who won't take them seriously.
I remember going to the "Wrapped Reichstag" in 1995, expecting the worst. Then, like so many people, I was won over by the whole giddy event: the revelers who turned the fields around the Reichstag into Woodstock East, the art students sketching the building, the street vendors, the grumpy politicians, the store windows full of wrapped objects -- above all by the beauty of the project.
Briefly the hulking building became a kind of shimmery gift to the city, swathed in a million square feet of silvery polypropylene fabric held in place by 10 miles of bright blue rope. When the last roll of fabric was unfurled by a crew of climbers resembling Lilliputians atop Gulliver, someone cranked up a hurdy-gurdy. The crowd applauded.
Then the building was unwrapped a few weeks later, leaving nothing behind except the economic benefits of tourist dollars: Christo and Jeanne-Claude always pay for their own projects by selling his art. The Reichstag wrapping cost $13 million. 
Berlin, a German newspaper said, made about $700 million in increased tourism. The artists also bequeathed to the city the worldwide afterimage of a gentler Reichstag. The symbolism was a new Germany emerging from the chrysalis of the wrapped building.
They came up with the Reichstag idea in 1971. Resistance and negotiation are part of their work: everything that happens from concept to completion belongs to the project, they say; this is a basic tenet of Conceptual Art. They have been pondering something big in New York since the mid-60's, shortly after immigrating from Paris. First Christo proposed wrapping two downtown buildings, then wrapping the Museum of Modern Art, One Times Square and the Whitney Museum.
By the 70's they imagined the gates to celebrate the rambling, organic system of pathways through Central Park, in contrast to the grid of streets. This interaction between order and disorder encapsulated art at that moment. The rectangular shape of the gates combined with the windblown fabric made a classic Post-Minimalist statement about man-made systems and nature.
The project was turned down in 1981, when the Parks Department feared it would damage the grounds and set a dangerous precedent. Gordon J. Davis, then the parks commissioner, produced a report arguing against it.
Mr. Davis is now a conservancy board member, and he voted for it this time. In 1995 Disney showed "Pocahontas" in the park on four 80-foot-high screens to tens of thousands of people crammed onto 120,000 square feet of artificial turf under 56,000 watts of light, listening to a 400,000-watt sound system before a gigantic inflatable Mickey.
So much for dangerous precedent. If the legacy of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the park's legendary designers, could survive that, what's the problem with the gates?
Anodyne, critics say about Christo. But public art does not consist only of artists leaving black boxes with "Fear" on them in subway stations. There's a fruitful territory between yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater and erecting a statue of a forgotten hero holding a sword. Christo's work derives from 60's happenings and Earth Art, from the general move out of galleries and museums into the real world, and from the utopianism of Socialist Realism (he was born in Bulgaria in 1935), with its belief in art for everyman, agitprop and the gigantism of Soviet monuments. He has transformed all this into a transient brand of visual entertainment.
A little of that wouldn't hurt New York City now. After 9/11 the project can show the world the city's creative vitality, emotional health and sense of humor, and be a complement to the proposals for downtown.
It would require at least another year, and probably a few years, for the project to be realized even if a contract were signed today and no legal hitches occurred. (They better act while this mayor is still in office.) Besides the money to be raised (Jeanne-Claude mentioned to me $20 million as a possible amount), there are 74 tons of steel to be designed, around a million square feet of fabric to be woven, cut and sewn, and workers to be hired and trained. And more planning. Last June, with Douglas Blonsky, the Central Park administrator, Christo and Jeanne-Claude surveyed the park, recording the precise width of walkways and heights of the lowest branches.
The present plan is for about 7,400 gates, each 16 feet high (a foot higher than they originally proposed), with an average of 12 feet between gates. (There will be some gaps to avoid branches and other obstacles.) The widths of the gates will vary from 6 feet to 18 feet, to match the widths of walkways. Instead of slender steel poles, as first proposed, the gates are now to be 5 inch by 5 inch fabricated recyclable vinyl poles extruded in the saffron color of the fabric, which is no longer attached like a shower curtain but built right into the frame, like sails into masts.
Each gate will have a slender one-ton steel base. The gates will rest only on walkways, so no holes with be dug or grass disturbed. Teams hired by the artists will take about six weeks, using small forklifts, to install the bases, another week to raise the gates. The park will be open as usual. Then the fabric will be unfurled in a day, ceremoniously.
The teams will maintain and guard the gates, hand out fabric samples as gifts, act as docents to the curious, then take the gates down after two weeks. Six weeks later everything should be gone.
At Christo's and Jeanne-Claude's studio I watched a short video of models of the gates, tested in Washington State, where the artists' chief engineer, Vince Davenport, lives. A van drove through the gates to make sure emergency vehicles wouldn't be obstructed. The fabric (it doesn't hang lower than seven feet) billowed nicely in a breeze. Christo pulled out some drawings and a book about the project. The gates are shown to fill the park, drawing orange paths up and down hills and stairs, around the lake, zoo and Met Museum -- a vast, whimsical abstraction in the land.
To the city, as "Wrapped Reichstag" was to Berlin, "The Gates" could be more than a popular attraction and profitable. Art, even a temporary installation, maybe especially a temporary installation, when it is good has a way of leaving an indelible mark on a place and the people who see it. Its value is civic and psychological. As a successor to the image of the collapsing Twin Towers, the picture of a winter park filled with people streaming through gates of fabric could be priceless. At the least, it would show New York City was willing to take a gamble on art.
Here's hoping a contract is signed. Then it will be up to private donors to decide whether the project is worth the cost. Museums pay millions for some exhibitions. Knicks players are paid millions and lose. Who's to say what's too much? Considering how much money street vendors make hawking postcards and geegaws of the World Trade Center these days, it shouldn't be too hard for Christo to sell images of his project to raise cash.
Meanwhile temporary public sculptures, as part of the last Whitney Biennial, have proved that Central Park can accommodate art and survive. The park is gorgeous without gates. It might be gorgeous with them, too.
There's only one way to find out.

HEADLINE: Latin American Coca-Cola Bottlers in Giant Merger 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Two of Coca-Cola's biggest bottlers in Latin America will combine in a $2.7 billion deal, in a move aimed at increasing sales in one of Coke's most important regions.
 Coca-Cola Femsa said today that it would acquire the much larger but debt-ridden Panamerican Beverages, creating a bottling giant second in the world only to Coca-Cola Enterprises of Atlanta. 
 The merged company would be a giant in Latin America, with an estimated $4.6 billion in revenue. It would have almost 50 percent of the Mexican market, and a presence in eight other countries, including Venezuela and Brazil, the company said. Latin American accounts for 25 percent of Coca-Cola's worldwide volume. 
Coca-Cola Femsa, based in the northern Mexico city of Monterrey, is the largest bottler in Mexico, but is much smaller than Panamco, which reported $2.7 billion in 2001 revenue. Panamco, with headquarters in Miami, has labored under high debt and dismal economic conditions in some of its key markets. 
Jose Antonio Fernandez, chairman of Coca-Cola Femsa, said today that he was unruffled by the economic turmoil in the new markets his company is acquiring. "There have always been very good opportunities for doing business in South America," he said in an interview. "We see this as a very good long-term benefit for the company."
Mexicans drink more Coca-Cola products, 462 eight-ounce bottles a year for every person, than in any other country in the world, including the United States, where consumption is 419 eight-ounce bottles a year per person.
Consumption is much lower in some of the Panamco territories, offering growth potential. In Brazil, for example, where Panamco operates the Sao Paulo franchise, annual per capita consumption is 144 bottles. 
Coca-Cola bottlers handle distribution and marketing in their geographical franchise regions, buying the concentrate from the Coca-Cola Company. In the past, the Coca-Cola Company has encouraged bottlers to combine so as to wring the maxium efficiencies from the system. In Latin America, distribution is especially difficult because most consumers buy their soft drinks daily from corner grocery stores. 
In rural areas, keeping those stores regularly stocked means that some delivery trucks must travel over miles of dirt mountain roads. 
Analysts say Coca-Cola Femsa's distribution expertise will serve the combined company well in the new markets. The company's Mexico franchise covers not only Mexico City but much of the poor southeast, where its ability to put a Coke in every tiny store is put to the test. 
"Coca-Cola Femsa is not only one of the best bottlers in the Coca-Cola system but it also provides much stronger financial capability to service Panamco markets," said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a publication covering the global beverage industry. 
Panamco's weak balance sheet has made it difficult for the company to invest and grow, he said. "This will create efficiencies and economies of scale that will make the whole much stronger." 
Mr. Fernandez said the company expected to invest between $300 million and $350 million a year over the next six years. "We are convinced that we have to grow," he said. 
The deal puts Coca-Cola Femsa in a strong position to combat increasing competition from Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi Bottling Group recently acquired Pepsi-Gemex, the main Pepsi bottler in Mexico, for more than $1 billion, and will make a push to improve Pepsi's 19 percent market share. Coca-Cola has a 71 percent market share in Mexico, according to Mr. Sicher. 
Under the terms of the deal, Coca-Cola Femsa will pay $1.82 billion, or $22 a share, to holders of Panamco Class A stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola Femsa will pay $247 million in cash, or $38 a share to holders of Panamco Class B Common Stock, which are not traded and have voting rights. Coca-Cola Femsa will also assume $880 million of Panamco's debt.
The Coca-Cola Company, will receive $674 million in Coca-Cola Femsa shares in exchange for its 25 percent stake in Panamco. The deal raises Coca-Cola's stake in Coca-Cola Femsa from 30 to 40 percent.
The class A shares of Panamco more than doubled today, closing at $20.59 on New York Stock Exchange. The American depository receipts of Coca-Cola Femsa fell nearly 15 percent, to $18.50, as investors expressed concerns about the high price for Panamco and the new debt.
To help pay for the deal, Coca-Cola Femsa is borrowing $2.05 billion from JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Part of the money will go toward refinancing Panamco debt. 
Standard & Poor's confirmed Coca-Cola Femsa's credit rating, despite the new debt, which Mr. Fernandez said the company expected to pay down over the next six years. 
Mr. Fernandez said the two companies negotiated the merger first before seeking approval from Coca-Cola. "When we first talked about this six years ago, everybody said we were dreaming," he said. "The trust of The Coca-Cola Company shown to a Mexican company to let us grow to become the second-largest bottler is very important."
While Coca-Cola in the past aggressively pushed its bottlers to consolidate, over the last two or three years, it has taken a more hands-off approach, Mr. Sicher noted. 
Mexico will continue to be the most important country for the combined company, providing 63 percent of revenue. Coca-Cola Femsa also has a franchise in Buenos Aires, while Panamco's franchises cover all of Venezuela, most of Colombia, parts of Brazil and parts of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama.

HEADLINE: Latest Economic Reports Signal ImprovedOutlook 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Personal spending increased in November at the fastest pace in four months and a measure of consumer sentiment rose in December, according to two reports released today. 
 In one report, the Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.4 percent increase in October. The increase reflected a pickup in purchases of cars and other durable goods, the figures showed. 
 In the other report, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment for December rose to 86.7 from 84.2 in November. The measure has recovered since a nine-year low of 80.6 in October. 
The university's confidence report showed that the current conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to buy, rose to 96 in December from 93.1 in November.
The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, increased to 80.8 from 78.5 last month. 
Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa., said personal income, which rose 0.3 percent in November for a fourth consecutive month, had given spending a lift "and with consumer confidence improving, we should see solid gains through the next few months." Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy and has underpinned the recovery as companies hold off investing.
But growing concerns about unemployment, war fears and weaker equity and home prices have led economists to predict household spending will soon cool.
Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a consultant in New York, said that the increase in personal spending in November and October suggested that consumption grew at five-tenths of a percentage point during that period and one percentage point at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.
Buying of durable goods like cars, appliances and other big-ticket long-lasting items grew 1.9 percent in November, the biggest gain since August, after declining 1.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department report showed. 
Purchases of nondurable goods in November increased 0.4 percent, after rising 0.6 percent in October. Spending on services, accounting for half the report, gained 0.2 percent, after rising 0.3 percent in September. 
But sales may not have maintained their November momentum into this month, causing concerns about a lackluster holiday season.

Venezuela Strike and War Fear Push Oil Price to 2-Year High

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices rose to their highest level in two years yesterday, as a freeze in supplies from strikebound Venezuela and the growing threat of war with Iraq deepened fears of a winter oil supply shortage. 
 In New York, crude oil for February delivery rose $1.45 a barrel, or 4.8 percent, to $31.75. Prices rose further in after-hours trading to as much as $32 a barrel, its highest since January 2001. 
 Oil prices have risen 60 percent this year, jumping $7 in the last month, increasing concern that higher energy costs could endanger a fragile economy.
Heating oil prices also increased yesterday in New York, rising 4.3 percent, to 89.62 cents a gallon. Yesterday's surge in prices came after the United States and Britain indicated over the weekend that the prospect of a war with Iraq was increasingly probable in early 2003. Fears of an American-led military conflict rose further after a Pentagon spokesman said an unmanned Predator spy plane was presumed lost after being fired on by an Iraqi aircraft in the southern no-flight zone of Iraq. A briefing by arms inspectors to the United Nations Security Council on Jan. 27 is considered the next crucial date.
Oil supplies have already tightened for the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, as a 22-day general strike has hurt output from Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest exporter. 
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela said on Sunday that his government had turned the tide against an opposition strike and was restarting halted oil output and exports, but strikers said that was not the case.
Refinery operations in the United States have begun to feel the pinch of the lack of crude oil from Venezuela, which supplies about 14 percent of American crude and imports of refined products.
As supply worries deepened, a senior Republican representative asked the Bush administration yesterday to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The representative, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, said in a letter to the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, that two large refineries would run out of crude oil supplies by the end of the month unless some crude was released from the reserve. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about two-thirds of world exports, has sought to contain prices by pledging to fill any supply gap caused by the Venezuelan strike or a war on Iraq. 
But oil traders fear a war that disrupts Iraq exports coupled with the aftermath of a prolonged Venezuela strike would make it difficult for OPEC to make up the deficit.

Life After Welfare in the Here and Now of America's Jammed Shelters

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
The jargon of antipoverty work is as restless as the poor themselves. And here now come the "working homeless" -- a post-welfare-reform category of strivers fighting to hold onto low-wage jobs the government shepherded them to, jobs that perversely afford them too little money to pay for shelter. Ending welfare as we know it has been followed by the working homeless, if we care to know them.
 Social workers are tracking these marginal breadwinners by the scores of thousands -- most of them women with children, not the stereotypical grizzled street male. They can be found here spiraling through desperate options when they come up short for rent money and are displaced. Many serially "couch surf" with relatives and friends before patience wears thin. Some live as families in a car or a spare garage space. Chronically, they turn to the waiting lists for transient shelters that are always filled to capacity in this hard-pressed but far from atypical American city. 
 Citizens who hailed the statistical success of welfare reform in thinning down the dole need to see the hard aftermath in which the new workfare is producing a variation on some old misery for the working homeless. "They've traded one form of poverty for another," says Katrina Knight, the director of the Housing Resource Center. The center runs the hotline in St. Louis, which leads the nation's major cities in their common problem of facing the highest increase in demands for emergency shelter and food in a decade.
The darkening economy is compounding a homeless problem that, despite the 90's boom, grew steadily, near-subliminally, across the prosperity era. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which has been annually surveying homelessness and hunger in 25 major cities since 1987, warns that we're ending a bumper year for the problem. Cities registered a one-year increase of 19 percent in food and shelter requests -- with another tough year looming as tax revenues fall and political priorities shift to homeland security.
The St. Louis increase was more than double the urban average and may be due to better records in tracking the ricochet world of the homeless. But it is the nature of the increased pleas even more than the volume that is stark for workers at the Salvation Army's Community in Partnership family shelter at the edge of the city. In the last few years they have seen a doubling of homeless applicants still scrabbling to maintain jobs. In fact, four of five requests at the shelter now come from families led by a dogged wage earner, albeit a marginal one. Mothers commute long hours from the shelter to hold onto fast-food service jobs. Their problem is that, by local average, it requires a wage of $12 an hour to pay for the two-bedroom family rental they yearn for and earn for, but their actual wage is little more than the $5.15 government minimum.
At the hotline, workers can be heard taking more calls from people who begin by noting they never asked for charity in their lives but are facing mortgage foreclosure in a middle-class neighborhood amid a grueling struggle with joblessness. "I never imagined I'd be here," said Richard, a jobless stage-set designer, sitting forlornly at a holiday party of the homeless from the Peter & Paul shelter. "This is humiliating," he said, ruing his predicament as a working homeless person whose current threadbare livelihood is in a sandwich shop. "It's unbelievable how fast you can lose the good life."
More poignant are the tales of working homeless mothers who never tasted the middle-class heights. With hopes high, they spend off-hours in a bureaucratic maze in order to finally win one of the federal rent subsidy vouchers. These vouchers are widely coveted as a key opportunity upward by many of the nation's millions of working poor who are without housing assistance. Jeanette, a woman with three children, turned suicidal after she scoured the city for an apartment for three months and discovered that landlords dismissed her hard-won voucher as worthless in their tight renters' market. "She thought she had won a lottery," said Ms. Knight. "She's left much more dejected and fragile."
Worse news is on the way to the nation's mayors and their homeless. The rent voucher program, designed to have the poor pay no more than 30 percent of income for shelter, is already being targeted in Congress. A bill favored by the Appropriations Committee in the Republican-controlled House would cut more than $900 million from President Bush's plan for voucher aid, according to advocates for the poor. They estimate 125,000 families would lose vouchers in a program that serves about two million poor and dates honorably from the Nixon and Reagan eras.
Like the lives of the poor, the voucher threat is well under the political radar that has raked the Trent Lott fiasco in Congress, an affair more consumed with the Dixiecrat era of yore than the homelessness problems of modern cities. The Lott debacle might yet serve the nation well in not simply reviving that catchy campaign phrase "compassionate conservatism," but actually demonstrating it by protecting voucher cuts for the working homeless as we are coming to know them.

PERSON: Harvey B. Scribner 

HEADLINE: Harvey B. Scribner, New York Schools Chancellor in a Turbulent Era, Dies at 88 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
Harvey B. Scribner, a no-nonsense former teacher from Maine who went on to become the chancellor of New York City's school system as it underwent a turbulent shift toward local control in the early 1970's, died yesterday in Waterville, Me. He was 88.
 Dr. Scribner arrived in New York after two decades as a teacher and administrator in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey, compiling a record of innovation and gentlemanly leadership. 
 As state education commissioner in Vermont in the late 60's, Dr. Scribner advocated greater local control of schools and became known for emphasizing the basics in the classroom and continuing education for teachers. He was an early advocate of giving students academic credit for community service. As superintendent in Teaneck, N.J., he oversaw efforts to preserve integration in the township's schools. 
But he later acknowledged that nothing could have prepared him for the tumultuous political and educational environment in New York. Years of racial and economic stress in the city's growing black and Hispanic neighborhoods resulted in protests during his tenure in support of local control of the schools, a notion supported by Mayor John V. Lindsay, who later paid a political price as the schools began to slip. 
The State Legislature responded to the upheaval by decentralizing control of the school system. In 1969, it empowered 32 community school districts throughout the city to administer elementary and middle schools. High schools remained under the control of the central Board of Education. But the board, too, was reconstituted, with its five members appointed by the city's borough presidents instead of by the mayor.
A superintendent of schools, wielding broad authority over the entire system, was replaced by a chancellor who directly administered only high schools and support services, like budgeting, special education and career education.
On paper, the chancellor could suspend, supersede or remove community school board members for failing to live up to regulations. In reality, his power was limited. Dr. Scribner found himself hamstrung by the racial and political strife, as well as by the dispersion of power under decentralization, the very system he advocated. 
When Dr. Scribner took office in July 1970, he was the last hope of a school board that had searched for a chancellor for more than a year and had been turned down by at least 10 candidates, including Ramsey Clark, Cyrus R. Vance and R. Sargent Shriver. Upon taking office, Dr. Scribner expressed great enthusiasm for taking over the nation's largest school system at a critical time.
But years later, Dr. Scribner, who resigned after nearly three years, expressed great disappointment, blaming the Board of Education, which he believed was never committed to making local control work, for the school system's problems.
"I don't think decentralization ever was set up to work," he was quoted as saying in Newsday in 1988. In that interview, he said the community school boards and districts just added another layer of bureaucracy. "What I'm talking about is letting each building make its own decisions," he said.
As public schools leader in New York City, he had little control over the system that he had been asked to oversee. From the first few weeks to the last few days of his short tenure, from 1970 to 1973, Dr. Scribner's lack of power manifested itself in many ways.
During his first months in office, the central Board of Education made many personnel and budgetary decisions without Dr. Scribner's input, in meetings the board barred him from attending.
In his first year, Dr. Scribner appointed commissions to examine claims that admissions exams at the city's top high schools were biased against black and Hispanic students. But high school administrators revolted and were able to persuade the State Legislature to pass a law that blocked Dr. Scribner from making any changes.
Many in central administration and the local schools came to view him as a hard-charging outsider who was passionate about issues, but lacking in the political skills needed to navigate the tortuous bureaucracy of the school system, teachers' unions and municipal government. 
The powerful president of the United Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, said at the time that he respected Dr. Scribner, but that the chancellor's desire to hold teachers to performance standards essentially suggested that they were to blame for the system's problems. Dr. Scribner was also critical of the tenure rules that enabled teachers to hold their jobs for life, regardless of their performance. Mr. Shanker, who carried much political weight, was one of the chief opponents to renewing the chancellor's contract. 
Dr. Scribner found himself engulfed in racial politics as well. He was still dealing with problems that arose from the racial tension in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district in Brooklyn, which was turned over to residents of the predominantly black neighborhoods in 1968 as an experiment. Teachers' unions organized a citywide strike that year after the district board, its membership mostly black, tried to transfer several white teachers involuntarily. In his final report on the matter, Dr. Scribner concluded that the union was trying to get in the way of local control of the district.
"We sometimes lose sight of the fact that there are 32 local school districts in the city," Dr. Scribner said at the time, "not just the handful that make the headlines because of their troubles, and a majority of the community school boards went through the year with hardly a major problem."
He remained committed to local control, a concept that has eroded in recent years as chancellors have lobbied for more authority, and finally came to an end with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's success in winning control of the system this year. 
By the end of his tenure, Dr. Scribner had few allies. In December 1972, Dr. Scribner announced that he would leave office in a few months because of "a widening gap of confidence" between him and the Board of Education. Board members said that Dr. Scribner was upset that they would not guarantee a contract extension. 
Harvey Bertram Scribner was born on July 7, 1914, in Albion, a small town in southeastern Maine. His father was a factory worker, and Dr. Scribner once described his own childhood as more bitter than bittersweet.
After graduating from high school, Mr. Scribner went 20 miles off the Maine coast to work for a shop owner on Matinicus Island, where he recalled salting fish for Calvin Coolidge. To make ends meet, he worked nights and weekends at grocery stores and factories. He once described his time on the island as his education. He spent a year at a teacher-training academy and then dropped out to take a job as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Unity, Me.
In 1946, he received a bachelor's degree from Farmington State Teachers College in Maine and became a school administrator. In 1951, he received a master's degree in education at the University of Maine. He received his doctorate in education from Boston University in 1960. 
In 1954, Mr. Scribner became the head of the school system in Dedham, Mass., where he raised eyebrows for promoting a federally financed program intended to determine how well students could teach one another. Mr. Scribner said that a local resident once described him as standing "for all things that Communists stand for."
In 1961, he left to become the superintendent of schools in Teaneck, N.J., which became a crucible for dealing with racial issues in the suburbs. With the black population rising, whites were fleeing quickly to other suburban communities. He advocated adopting voluntary busing to keep the elementary schools integrated. Later, when that did not work, Dr. Scribner enforced mandatory busing. The plan provoked death threats and obscene telephone calls to Dr. Scribner. But the busing experiment worked. 
Dr. Scribner called his success there one of his most triumphant and emotional moments. "I remember the walkie-talkie on the desk, I remember the first report, 'The buses just came in, everything was peaceful,' " he was quoted as saying by The Record of Bergen County, N.J., in a speech in Teaneck in 1985. "I was literally crying."
In 1968, he left for Vermont, where he challenged the state's entrenched educational bureaucracy.
Dr. Scribner's first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, Alta, died before him. He is survived by three daughters, Patricia Arno of Hartland, Me., from his first marriage, Jacqueline Cheney of Simsbury, Conn., and Donna Archambault of Leesburg, Fla.; six grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; and three brothers, Morris Scribner of Benton, Me., Herbert Scribner of Fairfield, Me., and Norman Scribner of Naples, Fla.
After leaving the New York school system, Dr. Scribner became a professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where he researched educational leadership and school administration. 
At the university, he wrote an acclaimed book based on his experiences: "Make Your Schools Work: Practical, Imaginative and Cost-Free Plans to Turn Public Education Around" (Simon & Schuster, 1975). Dr. Scribner also helped develop alternative schools in Boston for underprivileged children and a master's degree program for teachers in Washington.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Offer Hybrid Power In 5 Models By 2007 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
General Motors, which has been the most reticent major carmaker when it came to the prospects for hybrid vehicles, intends to offer some form of hybrid electric power on five of its major models over the next four production years, according to people briefed on the plan. 
 G.M.'s plan, which will be announced next month at the North American International Auto Show here, is a surprising endorsement of the fledgling hybrid technology, which improves gasoline mileage by supplementing the internal combustion engine with electric power. G.M., the largest automaker, will offer several versions of the hybrid technology. The most advanced will be on the Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle, while less advanced versions will be available on the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks, a coming Chevrolet pickup called the Equinox and the Chevrolet Malibu. 
 The development is a sign that the Big Three are growing increasingly serious about the technology as a business threat from overseas. For several years, Toyota and Honda have been the only companies offering hybrid cars. The Toyota Prius, for instance, has an electric motor that takes over for the internal combustion engine at low speeds. The car never needs plugging in, a shortcoming of battery-powered cars, because the battery is recharged by the gasoline engine. Honda sells a small aluminum hybrid, called the Insight, and a hybrid version of its Civic. 
"G.M. needs an aggressive plan just to keep pace with the Japanese, who view this as a core technology over the next decade," said John Casesa, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, when told of the plan. "It's an idea that hasn't arrived yet, but whose time is coming fast. This is going from an environmental and public relations curiosity to a generally accepted commercial product."
G.M.'s plan, along with those of the rest of the industry, could also have considerable tax implications for the country. The Internal Revenue Service already allows a $2,000 deduction for vehicles that use alternative fuels or some form of electric power, and Congress has been considering further incentives. Toyota has already said it plans to sell 300,000 hybrids a year worldwide, many of them in the United States, within five years. The Ford Motor Company plans to start selling a hybrid version of its Escape sport utility vehicle a year from now. And DaimlerChrysler has said it will sell a hybrid version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck next year. 
G.M. is presenting several versions of the technology. The most advanced, and most like the Prius, will come in 2005, when the company will offer a hybrid version of the 2006 Saturn Vue with average gas mileage of nearly 40 miles a gallon, compared with average mileage as high as 25 for the nonhybrid versions, people briefed on the plan said.
In 2004, G.M. will offer a less ambitious version of hybrid technology, for the 2005 models of the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado. They will use small electric motors that allow the trucks' engines to shut off at stoplights and restart when a foot touches the accelerator. The modified pickups are to raise fuel economy about 12 percent. And in 2006, G.M. will offer similar technology on a forthcoming Chevrolet pickup truck called the Equinox and on the 2007 model Chevrolet Malibu. The addition of hybrid and other technologies is expected to increase gas mileage on these models 15 percent. 
All told, the technologies will be used on three chief manufacturing platforms, meaning that G.M. could use it in as many as one million vehicles and a dozen models by 2007 if the demand materializes.
Environmentalists expressed a mixture of encouragement and disappointment at the news, part of which was reported today by The Wall Street Journal, and said that the Vue, as described, would be a significant improvement. "G.M.'s hybrid plans are a mixed bag," said David Friedman, an engineer and analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The full hybrid Saturn Vue appears to be a move toward good hybrid technology. The other vehicles are an example of using good conventional technology."
"Labeling them as hybrids is an attempt to ride the 'green' image of hybrids," he added. 
Russell Long, executive director of the Bluewater Network in San Francisco, another environmental group, said it was "tremendously disappointing that they would take such a weak approach."
"You've got to imagine some of this comes from their anxiety about California and wanting to be prepared for potential regulations here that would essentially force the use of hybrid technologies," he said. 
Indeed, because of coming regulations expected on the federal level and from California, the nation's largest auto market, G.M.'s plan could be seen as a matter of necessity. Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a plan that would raise federal fuel economy standards 7 percent by the 2007 model year. Though environmental groups derided the plan as a baby step, it is the largest increase in more than a decade. 
And considerable pressure is coming from California. Because the state's clean-air laws predated the federal government's, it has retained the authority to set its own air standards, and other states can opt to use California's tougher standards. Mr. Long's group drafted a proposal to cut automotive greenhouse-gas emissions that has become law in California. The industry is expected to mount a vigorous legal challenge before the law is to take effect late in the decade.
Still, G.M.'s hybrid plan is a notable step toward improved fuel efficiency for a company that had previously been noncommittal on the idea of producing a full hybrid vehicle. 
"I don't think anybody's got confidence that the economics make any sense," Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in an interview in August. At a meeting in the late 90's, company officials decided to throw most of G.M.'s research-and-development dollars behind hydrogen fuel cells, which the industry has embraced as the power source that will eventually make the internal combustion engine obsolete. But there is wide disagreement on when fuel cells will be ready for mass marketing, and on the big challenges like outfitting the nation's filling stations with hydrogen instead of gasoline.
The economic equation will be addressed by relying on government incentives. G.M. plans to price the hybrids at cost, meaning that they could cost a few thousand dollars more than the conventional versions of similar vehicles at first.
Increasingly, fuel economy is becoming a business issue as well as an environmental one and attracting the attention of Wall Street. Mr. Casesa of Merrill Lynch said, "We're moving toward a future with higher fuel-economy standards, risks to energy supplies and higher environmental consciousness."
"If we decide to dramatically increase fuel economy," he added, "there is no way to do that besides making cars smaller, unless you have a new technology. And this is that technology."

Mets' New Blueprint Like Swiss Cheese

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The Mets don't have all of their promotional days set for next season, but they are expected to have one day early in the year, maybe even before the season begins, where all of their fans, not just those under 14, receive rose-colored glasses.
 Those are the glasses through which the Mets themselves seem to be looking at their team. 
 Succinctly put, what they see wearing those glasses is a collective comeback from all the hitters who didn't hit last season and a contribution from their lineup's newest member, Cliff Floyd, that will be worthy of a hybrid of Barry Bonds and Reggie Jackson. 
The Mets unveiled Floyd in one of their caps at Shea Stadium yesterday, and he was wearing a pinstripe brown suit, not a red and blue uniform with a cape and a big "S." 
"We needed to do some things to improve the offense," General Manager Steve Phillips said, "some of which will have to come from the players who were here last year picking their games up to what they were capable of in the past. Cliff adds a whole different element to our offense than we had a year ago. Even if they don't get all the way back, that improvement will help."
The failure of the Mets' hitters, new and old, made for a disastrous season not too many months ago. People talk and write now about the mess Phillips created last winter, but those same fans and professional observers were excited about the moves that brought the Mets Mo Vaughn, Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz and Roger Cedeno. It wasn't until they all went bust that those same people began criticizing and questioning the moves.
So why is everyone getting excited again this winter about the addition of Floyd, Tom Glavine and Mike Stanton? Where is the guarantee they bring with them that the outcome of next season will be any different from the outcome of last season?
One reason cited is that last season's busts can't help but be better next season. Any improvement, as Phillips said, will help, but no improvement is guaranteed. Yet the Mets seem to be basing a lot of their hopes for next season on significant improvement. 
Floyd, when healthy, is a nice, solid player, but he has never carried a team. A popular view is that Floyd, a 30-year-old left-handed hitter, will hit 30 or more home runs for the Mets, but he has hit 30 or more home runs only once in his nine major league seasons. He has driven in 100 runs only once.
He comes to New York with a lengthy medical history, which has prevented him from playing 150 games in a season more than once, and a reputation for not hustling, which he himself raised yesterday.
"I've heard some things this off-season that have bothered me about my play," Floyd said unsolicited. "I've been questioned about my play, about how I hustle, how I go about my game. It hurts me a little bit. When I go out on the field, I give 110 percent every time. Come spring training, when I go out on the field, you're going to get 110 percent from me."
Floyd said critics had accused him of not hustling when a game was not on the line. At $6.5 million a season for four seasons, the Mets don't see that as a problem.
They also played down his injury history. "He's a small medical risk," Phillips said. "It's one considering the deal we were able to get him for that is worth that small amount of risk."
But the Mets are taking a large economic risk by increasing their payroll close to the luxury-tax threshold of $117 million and very possibly falling short again with their offense.
They seem to be taking a cavalier approach to the hole they created at third base by inviting Edgardo Alfonzo to leave. Though their view can change, they have said they will settle for a good defensive third baseman, like the light-hitting Bill Mueller, rather than a third baseman who can field and hit, like Jose Hernandez, also a free agent.
Asked yesterday if they can afford to ignore offense at an offensive position, Phillips said: "It depends on what kind of offensive guy it is. I think Cliff goes a long way toward balancing that decision a little bit. I think we're somewhat protected there. We're going to balance the options at third base with what we think Cliff brings to us and the projected production we're going to get from the guys who were here last year."
Again, the Mets are placing a lot of trust, hope and faith in hitting comebacks, just as they are placing the same in an outfield of Floyd in left, Cedeno in center and Burnitz in right. 
Phillips has spent the past couple of months trying to trade Burnitz and/or Cedeno to shed their contracts. But they remain, and the Mets are trying to make the best of it, saying Gary Pettis, their new outfield coach, will turn Cedeno from a poor left fielder into a serviceable center fielder. 
That approach requires more than faith and hope. Prayer would be in order, along with those rose-colored glasses.

Excerpt From Frist's Remarks on Joining Leadership

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from a speech yesterday by Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, the next Republican leader of the Senate, as recorded by The New York Times:
 These have been trying times for America in many, many ways. In the coming days I will be working with my Republican colleagues in the United States Senate, with the entire United States Senate, independent and Democrats, so that we can address the daunting challenges that face us as peoples of the United States of America. 
 As we speak, our brave men and women in uniform are around the world standing for us, fighting for us. They, as well as our president of the United States of America, our commander in chief, deserve our continued support to win this war against terror. 
Our economy, we know it needs a boost. Every American who wants a job should have the opportunity to find that job. 
Health care, we have a great opportunity, a great opportunity that I don't think any of us really fully anticipated even several months ago, to reach out and strengthen Medicare as an entire program, to improve Medicare, to give our seniors and those individuals with disabilities the things that they really deserve today. Yes, we need to address prescription drugs for seniors and individuals with disabilities, and we will do just that.
We need to focus on the uninsured and those who suffer from health care disparities that we so inadequately addressed in the past, but which I saw every day working at a hospital for eight or nine years just several blocks from here. And we must dedicate ourself to healing those wounds of division that have been reopened so prominently during the past few weeks.
Still, just as critical as what we decide to do is exactly how we decide to do it. The unprecedented way -- and again seven days ago I had no earthly idea that I would be standing before you -- but I think that unprecedented way that all this has happened gives me personally the tremendous opportunity to join a group of recently elected, a leadership team that I just got off a conference call with just a few minutes ago, that is energetic, that is committed, that is experienced.
Senator Stevens and McConnell and Santorum and Hutchison and Kyl and Allen I told that I'm proud to be a part of that new team to lead us forward. I will, as I told them, because I'm aware, and you have to be as a heart surgeon, you don't go in and do heart surgery if you don't know the things you know and the things you don't know: your strengths and your weaknesses. And just like I'm mentioning to you, I told them that I will continue to seek their counsel, capitalizing upon each and every one of those strengths as we gather together as a team and walk together, leading our caucus to the future.
I have asked the leaders, formally just a few minutes ago, as well as other people on our conference call, for their ongoing counsel and support. An ongoing basis, reaching out to gather the information and the knowledge, what they learn from their constituents, what they learn from their advisers, on a basis that is continually improving what we see in our legislative body.
As the majority leader, I will seek the wisdom to put the strengths of each of us as individuals, both in leadership and throughout the United States Senate, to the best possible use for all Americans.
My last call was, just a few minutes ago before coming to be with you, was -- and my first call other than the Republican caucus -- was to Senator Tom Daschle. I committed to work with him, to work with members of the Democratic caucus, and I should also add independents as well, to make this Congress, which will open up in early January, to be one that is positive, that brings people together and that is productive.
What is required of all of us, this whole range of junior members who just came on board, the senior members, the so-called old bulls in the United States Senate, the elected leadership and those who don't seek election but who lead within our conference or our caucus in their own way, is to work together as a team. 
My Republican colleagues witnessed my own personal commitment to working as a team a few weeks ago or a few months ago, over the last two years as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Very simple things. First of all, caring about America.
No. 2, rallying behind common goals that we set. In that case it was for elections; in this case it will be to amplify that, reaching out to make other people's lives more fulfilling across America. And that teamwork is my challenge, to be able to transfer, using, yes, what I hope is some element of reaching forward with leadership potentials to capture the best of what each and every one of us try to do.
In closing I do want to mention my team. You know, I talk about the Republican caucus, I talk about the United States Senate, you talk about friends, but my team, like Karen and two of the three boys here, my own personal team, Karen, and here is Jonathan and Brian Frist, and Harrison is on the way home here in a few hours. But clearly the strength that I get both as a heart surgeon, and they tolerated a lot, working every day and every night for years and years. But now as majority leader of the United States Senate, it is that team, my wife, Karen, my boys and indeed our extended family, many of whom are with us here today, that I gather what strength that I both have and will continue to put forward.
Let me close by simply saying that a few moments ago something unprecedented in the history of the country happened with my election to the United States Senate under circumstances that nobody had anticipated. I pledged to my colleagues that as majority leader of the United States Senate I will do everything within my own realm of responsibility and within that realm of power that they have so generously granted to me to ensure that the United States Senate as an institution does stand united, that indeed the Republican Party in the broadest sense stands united. And indeed really what that is all about is that the United States of America indeed stays united. 
We're all about, right now, extraordinary times. We have a duty, we have a duty, a truly, truly historic duty to lead the whole of America. And together we will.
Now let's all go home, let's have a safe and a happy holiday season, focus on friends, focus on our purpose in life, what it means to each and every one of us, and have a wonderful, wonderful time, cherish those moments with our loved ones. And within a few weeks we'll all be back, we'll set out that agenda, we'll lay out that strategy and all the plans.

HEADLINE: Renewing 'Friends' 

 BODY:
On Thursday evenings much of mainstream America indulges in a remarkable suspension of disbelief when it tunes in to "Friends." The contribution that Ross, Rachel, Joey, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe make to the economic life of their fictional New York is a pittance. But the actors who play these characters are real economic powerhouses. One of the ironies of contemporary entertainment is how much pleasure Americans derive from watching multimillionaires pretending to be the barely employed thirtysomething kids next door, who are now raising kids of their own. 
 NBC clearly believes that its financial well-being depends on booking "Friends" for a 10th and almost certainly final season. That happened over the weekend. NBC signed at a per-episode price, around $10 million, that cannot be repaid by the advertising sold for each episode. But "Friends" is the cornerstone of NBC's prime-time edifice, the entertainment that keeps the network's Thursday night -- and the rest of the week as well -- at the top of the ratings. For the major networks, the essential logic of television programming is to build a blockbuster and keep it running no matter the cost. It's hard to believe that the price tag on "Friends" isn't keeping fresher shows from making it onto the air. 
 The hesitation over another season arose largely because real life was beginning to intrude. It wasn't enough for Rachel to have a baby. Jennifer Aniston wanted one too. One of the things that make a show like "Friends" matter to its audience is the sense of always being in the middle of a romantic Rubik's cube. 
"Friends" may not have broken much new ground in sitcom terms, but then the popularity of the genre usually depends on plowing the old ground all over again. America's television audience will find a new home when "Friends" departs at last. Many sitcom viewers already think of CBS's "Everybody Loves Raymond" -- whose star, Ray Romano, is himself having doubts about the future -- as a home away from home. And some are quickly growing attached to an up-and-coming new show like ABC's "Life With Bonnie." Everyone will miss "Friends" when it finally goes. But no one will miss it as much as NBC.

HEADLINE: North Korea Begins to Reopen Plant for Processing Plutonium 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
North Korea started to reopen a sealed plutonium reprocessing plant today, the most provocative and technically important step it has taken in recent days to revive a nuclear program that experts said could produce weapons within months.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency said North Korean officials had disabled surveillance cameras and broken through seals barring entry to a building housing the equipment needed to turn spent fuel rods from a nearby reactor into weapons-grade material. 
 On Sunday, North Korean officials disabled cameras and broke seals around a pool holding 8,000 of the spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, 55 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital. On Saturday, the North Koreans began dismantling monitoring equipment at the reactor itself.
"The reprocessing plant is the important one, because that's where they extract the plutonium from the spent fuel," said Mark Gwozdecky, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. "If we don't have our monitoring equipment in place, we're not in a position to assure anybody that this material is not being diverted for weapons." 
The Bush administration emphasized that it would continue to deal with the issue diplomatically. But even as he endorsed diplomacy as the right course for now, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned North Korea not to assume that the United States was incapable of confronting it militarily, even as Washington prepares for possible war with Iraq. 
"If they do, it would be a mistake," Mr. Rumsfeld said at a news conference.
The Korean developments also generated new bipartisan pressure from Congress for the White House to rethink its policy of not negotiating until North Korea drops its nuclear program. 
North Korea disclosed in October that it had continued to pursue a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. That announcement led the United States to cut off shipments of oil to North Korea. 
Since then the Pyongyang government has steadily ratcheted up the stakes in the confrontation, apparently in an effort to win economic concessions and security agreements from Washington at a time when the United States is focused on Iraq.
Faced with the new provocation today, the administration said it would stick to its demand that North Korea drop its nuclear program as a condition for negotiations.
"We think it's important to let the North Koreans know that the way to engage and integrate with the international community is to live up to treaties and agreements and obligations, not to break those agreements and then ask for more in return," a White House official said.
Asked whether the United States had set off the confrontation by labeling North Korea part of the "axis of evil," along with Iraq and Iran, thus backing Pyongyang into a corner, Mr. Rumsfeld replied that the responsibility rested with North Korea's totalitarian leadership.
"The idea that it's the rhetoric from the United States that's causing them to starve their people or to do these idiotic things," Mr. Rumsfeld said, "misses the point."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell continued the American efforts to maintain a united international front on the Korean issue.
This morning, Mr. Powell spoke with his counterparts in Russia, France and Britain to emphasize the need for "a peaceful resolution," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker. Over the weekend Mr. Powell spoke with the foreign ministers of South Korea, Japan, China and Russia.
Mr. Reeker repeated the American position that there can be no negotiations while North Korea is pursuing its nuclear program. "We will not give in to blackmail," he said.
Mr. Reeker said that as far as he knew, there was no dissent among those partners from the resolve to press North Korea. 
But the newly elected South Korean government, which takes office in late February, is pledged to engagement with the North, and is operating in an atmosphere of notably strong anti-American sentiment. Japanese diplomats have been privately concerned that isolating North Korea would backfire. Today Russia's deputy foreign minister, Georgi Mamedov, was quoted in a Moscow newspaper suggesting that the Bush administration was to blame. 
"How should a small country feel when it is told that it is all but part of forces of evil of biblical proportions and should be fought against until total annihilation?" Mr. Mamedov asked, according to Reuters.
Mr. Reeker dismissed Mr. Mamedov's comments as "totally absurd."
Members of Congress from both parties have also started to question the administration's position on negotiations. 
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the departing Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that the growing prospect of a nuclear crisis was likely to increase the pressure for international negotiations with North Korea, even if they do not directly involve the United States.
On Sunday, the incoming Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, said in an interview with Fox News that the United States would "have to talk, talk continuously to South Korea, to North Korea, to Japan, be heavily engaged."
Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he would like to travel to North Korea to establish some communication with its government. "No dialogue is a recipe for disaster," he said. "That doesn't mean we have to appease or to cave."
Two Democrats, Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Charles E. Schumer of New York, wrote to Mr. Bush last week asking for an explanation of administration's policy. "The administration has not enunciated a clear policy goal on North Korea," Mr. Schumer said today. "They say, 'Let's not talk.' But where is that leading us? You don't have to have a Ph.D. in foreign relations to understand that North Korea poses a greater danger to the United States than Iraq. But nobody quite knows what our policy is."
Although North Korea is now well down the path to completing all the steps it needs to begin processing weapons-grade plutonium at Yongbyon, officials said there was still time to avert a showdown. 
Mr. Gwozdecky said the atomic energy agency's inspectors on the scene had reported that the North Koreans had not finished breaking through all the seals -- a combination of electronic alarms and bolts -- to get into the reprocessing plant, a job he said would probably be completed on Tuesday. He said it would be weeks or months before the plant would be operational.
Faced with a similar impasse with North Korea in 1994, the Clinton administration considered a plan to bomb Yongbyon, but instead managed to reach a negotiated settlement. But even as it has laid out a formal doctrine of pre-emption to head off threats to national security, the Bush administration has stressed that it is not contemplating military action against North Korea.
Indeed, American officials played down any sense of urgency. Responding to questions about why evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction requires the threat of immediate military action, while the certainty that North Korea is on the verge of being able to produce nuclear weapons does not, administration officials said Iraq had exhausted its chances to resolve its conflict diplomatically while North Korea had not.
"The Iraqi regime has thumbed their noses at the United Nations annually for a good period of time," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "The situation in North Korea is a fairly recent one. The diplomacy that's under way there is in its early stages for the United States and the interested neighboring countries. It seems to me to be a perfectly rational way of proceeding."

Qwest Investors Agree toSwap $5.2 Billion in Bonds

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Qwest Communications International said yesterday morning that investors had agreed to exchange bonds with a face value of about $5.2 billion for $3.3 billion in notes that have higher interest rates and more security behind them.
 Later in the day, Qwest received its long-awaited approval from the Federal Communications Commission to begin selling long-distance phone service in nine of the 14 Western states in which it is the largest local phone company. 
 Qwest is the last of the regional Bell companies created by the 1984 breakup of AT&T to be allowed back into long distance in its home territory. Qwest expects to gain permission next year to sell long distance in the five states not covered by yesterday's announcement -- Minnesota, Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and South Dakota. 
Analysts said that both developments should contribute to Qwest's struggle to avoid bankruptcy as it wrestles with investigations into past accounting regularities, huge debts and tough competition in many of its businesses.
"This was a really important day for Qwest," said Scott Cleland, who follows the industry for the Precursor Group, a Washington-based company that advises institutional investors. "Qwest is turning the corner."
Qwest's shares rose 39 cents, to $5.69, yesterday. They have more than quintupled since hitting a low of $1.07 in August.
Qwest, which is based in Denver, is the dominant local phone company in a far-flung triangle of states stretching from Washington to New Mexico to Minnesota. It also owns national and foreign high-speed data networks and sells long-distance and business communication services outside of its region. 
The complex bond refinancing, which had been strongly opposed by many bondholders, fell far short of Qwest's goal of retiring bonds with a total of $12.9 billion in face value. But Qwest said that the exchange was a success because it would reduce Qwest's debt load by 8 percent, to $22.6 billion, and because much of the new debt has a later repayment date than the securities it will replace.
The reshuffling of the balance sheet will increase Qwest's interest payments next year because debt that pays interest rates from 5.875 percent to 7.9 percent is being swapped for notes that pay 13 percent to 14 percent. But analysts said that the new mix of maturity dates would improve cash flow in 2004 and that the swap increased the chances that Qwest can work its way out of its debt quagmire without a trip to bankruptcy court.
The refinancing is the latest of several steps that Qwest has taken to improve its balance sheet, including the pending sale of QwestDex, its highly profitable directory publishing unit, for more than $7 billion.
While the improvements to the balance sheet are good news for shareholders, several analysts expressed surprise at the sharp rebound in the stock price. "It is now trading at a 15 percent premium," said Patrick Comack of Guzman & Company, comparing Qwest with other regional phone companies like SBC Communications, Verizon and Bell South. "That valuation makes absolutely no sense."
Based on the experience of its rivals, Qwest stands to quickly grab as much as 20 percent of the long-distance business in its region and will be able to hang on to more existing customers by bundling long distance with other services. But that business is unlikely to have much of an impact before 2004, or even 2005, in crucial states like Minnesota and Arizona. Nor does Qwest have a strong wireless business like the other Bell companies to shield it from the trend among consumers to use cellphones for long-distance calls. 
Qwest also needs to repair relations with bondholders who were infuriated by the swap deal when it was offered last month. The plan was a private offering restricted to institutional investors because Qwest cannot conduct any kind of public offering until investigations by securities regulators and the Justice Department into its accounting are completed. 
In the view of many bondholders, the terms of the swap offer provided no financial benefit to them but placed those that refused to go along in a more precarious position if the company ends up in bankruptcy. A group of investors holding more than $4 billion in bonds tried unsuccessfully in federal court to obtain an injunction barring Qwest from completing the offer.

HEADLINE: 2004: PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS -- Joseph I. Lieberman; 
Trying Out the Perilous Leap From No. 2 to No. 1

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
For more than a year, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman diligently prepared for a campaign for president that might never begin.
 He delivered 11 policy speeches and published them in a pamphlet. He talked endlessly to friends and supporters and gave television interviews offering his views of world affairs. He played host to quiet dinners and receptions for Democratic strategists looking for a presidential campaign to ride, asking them to be ready -- just in case. 
 Just in case came in the form of a text message Mr. Lieberman received a week ago Sunday on his BlackBerry pocket pager from Al Gore saying that he would not be running for president again in 2004. Mr. Lieberman had long said he would not run if Mr. Gore did. 
Now, in an instant, what had had the potential of being a mock exercise in presidential campaign planning became the almost certain candidacy of the man looking to inherit Mr. Gore's mantle, "but without the baggage," as one adviser put it.
Already, Mr. Lieberman benefits from a celebrity that exceeds that of his potential competitors: reporters and camera crews were lined up two-deep against a wall outside his Senate office the day after Mr. Gore disclosed his decision.
This genial and generally well-regarded Democrat from Connecticut, who came within 537 votes of becoming vice president of the United States, enjoys the goodwill of many members of his party, including Gore supporters who took note of how Mr. Lieberman deferred his own candidacy to await Mr. Gore's decision -- and who now welcome the idea of Mr. Gore's No. 2 taking off on his own.
"The president came to Washington saying he was going to change the tone," Mr. Lieberman said in an interview the other day, laying out part of the foundation of his likely challenge to Mr. Bush. "But I think this place is as partisan -- more partisan -- than it was before. Though he campaigned as a moderate, seeming moderate, he really has governed much more from the right, particularly in areas like environment and public health care matters like stem cell research. These are critical differences that whomever becomes the Democratic candidate has to carry directly to the administration."
But as Mr. Lieberman prepares to try to move from No. 2 to No. 1 on the presidential ticket, some Democrats question the political plausibility of a three-term senator who does not quite fit the mold of the recent Democratic presidential candidates, and who acknowledges that he would not be where he is today were it not for Mr. Gore.
"Had I not run for vice president in 2000, I might be thinking of running for president in 2004," Mr. Lieberman said with a laugh. "But my prospects would have been much less plausible, in all honesty."
He is arguably the most conservative of the prospective Democratic candidates, particularly on defense and national security issues; his Senate office telephone system plays military marches to callers when they are put on hold. If recent history is any guide, the perception of Mr. Lieberman as a conservative Democrat could prove to be a disadvantage in a Democratic presidential contest that tends to draw voters from the left side of the scale.
Mr. Lieberman, who is an Orthodox Jew, is promising a campaign that would place more emphasis on values and spirituality than Democratic primary voters are accustomed to hearing. Democrats inside and outside the Lieberman camp suggest that could feed the perception of Mr. Lieberman as cloyingly sanctimonious, a view his allies say he needs to guard against. 
In a business that is not known for cordiality, there is reason to wonder if Mr. Lieberman, the son of a Stamford liquor store-owner, might ultimately provide proof of that old adage about nice guys and where they finish. 
"I guess I should be happy that the worst thing they can say about you is you have no enemies, but . . . " Mr. Lieberman stopped and shifted in his chair, his hands crossed as he sat in his spartan seventh floor office on Capitol Hill. "Of course I do have enemies. Perhaps it's about this: I'm not a screamer. I've been raised to treat people with respect. But the fact that I may speak softly more often than not doesn't mean that I don't carry a big stick."
Some Democrats said Mr. Lieberman was, by temperament and philosophy because of his centrist appeals, the ideal candidate to put up against a Republican president who has been aggressively trying to win defectors from the Democratic base.
"The issues that he would naturally run on are exactly the issues that the Democrats have to be able to retake in order to win the presidency," said Al From, the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council, the organization of moderate Democrats that helped elect Bill Clinton and is likely to rally around a Lieberman candidacy. "He will be strong with national security -- and we have to deal with our security gap. He has strength on values. He has growth-oriented economics."
But other influential Democrats, who want to draw sharper contrasts with the Republicans, expressed concerns about Mr. Lieberman's fortitude and his ideological positions.
"I think Joe Lieberman is a good man who has worked very hard for our country, but I don't see him having a lead on getting the nomination -- and I think it will be a tough fight," said Molly Beth Malcolm, the leader of the Texas Democratic Party. "Some may see him as not being tough enough and there will be some who don't agree with what he stands for.
"What Democrats are going to be looking for in this election is somebody who stands very firmly on Democratic principles and are able to articulate a clear message separating us from Republicans." 
Mr. Lieberman, who is 60 years old, disputed that the party nomination inevitably goes to the candidate on the left of the field, pointing to the success of Mr. Clinton in 1992. He argued that the party needed to rethink what its candidates stand for -- starting off by taking clear and firm stands on the issues of national security and foreign affairs.
"I think the party is open to a different kind of Democrat," he said. Mr. Lieberman said that while he "may be more conservative, more pro-defense, more pro-security than a lot of Democrats are," for the most part, he was "in tune with the mainstream of my party."
Mr. Lieberman sponsored the Homeland Security Act, and was at Mr. Bush's side last fall as he pushed through a Congressional resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. By noting that he had also voted in favor of the first resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, in 1991, Mr. Lieberman drew an unstated contrast with other Democrats in the race like Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Senator John Kerry, who opposed that resolution. 
Mr. Lieberman has also been one of the leading Congressional advocates against excessive violence and sex in the entertainment industry. 
Mr. Lieberman also once seemed to be receptive to allowing Americans to put some of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts, a stand that set him apart from the mainstream of his party. "There was a time when I was intrigued by it, five or six years ago," he said. "And I spent some time meeting with people about it, and I concluded that it was a bad idea."
Mr. Lieberman would be the first Jewish major-party nominee for president. It is a distinction that does not appear to worry him.
He said his experience of 2000 convinced him that it might not be the handicap that some Democrats feared. He said he had not encountered a single instance of anti-Semitism while campaigning in 2000.
"I'm not getting back into whether we won or not, but the fact is that Al and I got more votes than any ticket in the history of any party except Reagan in '84," he said. "At least from those numbers, it's clear it didn't hurt."
But even some of Mr. Lieberman's supporters said they were concerned that the notion of a Jewish president, at a time when parts of the Muslim world are showing increasing hostility to United States policy, could be unsettling to some voters. Some Democrats sympathetic to Mr. Lieberman questioned whether he was prepared for the extent to which his Judaism could become a subject of discussion.
In the interview, Mr. Lieberman paused momentarily when asked whether there would be a Christmas tree in a Lieberman White House. "I think, because the White House is a national home, it certainly would,' he said. "It's a symbol."
Other Democrats suggested that the very fact that Mr. Lieberman is devoutly religious could turn into a political plus and prove the most distinctive element of a Lieberman candidacy.
"Part of our problems as Democrats is we've allowed the Republicans to capture the values debate, because we're nervous about talking about faith as a source of values," Mr. Lieberman said. "I'm probably going to talk more, not less, of that language."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
REPUBLICANS ELECT FRIST OF TENNESSEE AS SENATE LEADER

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Bill Frist of Tennessee was unanimously elected the Republican leader of the Senate today, urged by his colleagues to remake the reputation of a party that many felt had been seriously damaged by the comments of the man he succeeds, Senator Trent Lott.
 Dr. Frist, who will become majority leader next month when the 108th Congress convenes, was selected by acclamation in a conference call among 48 Republican senators and senators-elect across the country. Last month, they chose Mr. Lott as their leader in the customary Capitol Hill meeting, but on Dec. 5 Mr. Lott made a remark about retiring Senator Strom Thurmond that appeared to express nostalgia for segregation, and he stepped down on Friday amid a gathering furor. 
 After Dr. Frist's election, in remarks laced with repeated allusions to his medical career, he said his new responsibility might even be greater than his previous career transplanting human hearts. He vowed to "heal the wounds of division" that had been so prominently reopened. 
"I honestly believe this will transform what has occurred in the last few weeks, what has occurred at this moment in history, into a catalyst," Dr. Frist said, speaking at his Congressional office in Nashville. "A catalyst for unity and a catalyst for positive change."
He said that the economy needed a lift and that every American who wanted a job should have one. He also promised to strengthen Medicare and find a way to provide prescription drugs for the elderly and people on disabilities. In addition, he said Congress should focus on those without health insurance, removing the health care disparities he saw as a cardiac surgeon.
Senators who participated in the half-hour conference call described it as a solemn event, made somewhat more difficult by the presence on the line of Mr. Lott. They said Mr. Lott thanked them for their support over the years and promised to be a team player when he returned to the Senate as a rank-and-file member. Mr. Lott expressed no recriminations or complaints, they said, and finally apologized to his colleagues for what he had put them through.
"He tried to put people at ease," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. "He knew this was difficult for us, and said he wanted to do the right thing for his colleagues."
Several senior Republicans picked up on Dr. Frist's themes of catharsis and recovery, saying Mr. Lott's fall had the potential to create a new kind of Republican Party, one more sensitive to the needs of minorities and the disadvantaged.
"I think that these several weeks have been transformative for our caucus," said Senator George Allen of Virginia, who proclaimed a Confederate History and Heritage Month when he was governor of the state. "I think there's a unity of resolve. I think we all have learned. I think there's greater understanding."
Mr. Allen and Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, talked about the need to extend unemployment benefits -- an idea endorsed by President Bush last month, before Mr. Lott stepped down -- and spoke in general terms about improving health care and prescription drug benefits. But neither they nor Dr. Frist cited any specific ways the Republican Party would demonstrate its new sensitivity to minorities, and Dr. Frist said it would take time for the conference to regroup and assemble its detailed agenda.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine, said it was vital that the party now demonstrate its inclusiveness and tolerance, but she said the conference would probably not come to an easy agreement on how to do so. Ms. Snowe said she preferred that the party endorse minority small-business programs and other forms of assistance. But even if the party does not agree on the specifics, she said, she predicted that Dr. Frist would make more of an effort to listen to Republican moderates.
"More than anything else, this is a new beginning for the Republican Party," she said. "Dr. Frist's very nature is inclusive, and I have no doubt he will try to resolve the differences within our caucus. And if it's within his power, he's certainly going to create a more positive and less partisan tone than what we've had."
Dr. Frist in his remarks did call for greater unity within the party and within Congress, and said he had called Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, immediately after his election and promised to work with him. Mr. Daschle issued a statement afterward congratulating Dr. Frist and expressing hope that the two parties could work together on economic security and protection from terrorism.
President Bush, keeping a public distance from the election that many on Capitol Hill say he helped engineer, issued a low-key statement of congratulations to Dr. Frist.
"Senator Frist has earned the trust and respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle," he said. "I look forward to working with him and all members of the Senate and House to advance our agenda for a safer, stronger and better America."
The conference call was the first time a Senate leader had been selected in a setting other than the traditional closed-door, secret-ballot meeting in the Capitol, Congressional historians said. Because of the gravity of the occasion, the senators decided to open the conference call with a prayer, delivered by Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana. In a similar spiritual vein, Dr. Frist said he and his wife, Karyn, went to their church on Sunday night to pray, and cited a passage from Proverbs that had been circling in his mind amid the rapid turn of events in his life: "In his heart, a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps."
In the days to come, Dr. Frist, who is 50, must quickly hire a staff, negotiate several administrative matters with Senate Democrats and begin an intensive education in the legislative minutiae that must be mastered by a majority leader.
More broadly, however, he will face a series of policy questions that will test the independence of his Senate conference and its willingness to broaden the party's reach. The Senate will have to decide almost immediately whether to confirm several appellate court judges whose records have been questioned by civil rights groups.
It must choose quickly whether to cut this year's budget to the extent requested by the administration, or whether to follow many Republicans on Capitol Hill and uphold higher spending limits. The breadth of Mr. Bush's planned tax cuts will also dominate the coming session. And as a cardiac surgeon, Dr. Frist has a strong interest in health care policy, but he has yet to discuss in detail his plans for prescription drug coverage or new curbs on abortion, and he took no questions at his appearance today.
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said every vote cast by Republicans would now be considered in the light of its sensitivity to African-Americans and other minorities.
"There's no question the events of the last two weeks will continue to hang over the Senate and the Republican party," Mr. Hagel said in an interview. "We will all have a new sensitivity that probably wasn't there last year."
But he said today's election was the first step toward that transformation.
"It was a relief to finally get it done," Mr. Hagel said. "I'm glad it ended with no rancor or threats -- kind of a murmur instead of a big bang."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE DEMOCRATS; 
Agile Switch by Senate Republicans Steals Democrats' Gathering Thunder

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Democrats around the country say the replacement of Trent Lott with Bill Frist as Senate Republican leader greatly complicates their task of taking advantage of the racial furor sparked by Mr. Lott as they try to reassert themselves in a town dominated by Republicans.
 Even while they have tried to highlight what they say are examples of Dr. Frist's insensitivity on some racial issues, Democrats acknowledge that he puts a friendlier, more moderate face on the Republican Party. Moreover, with President Bush's dominance over the political landscape, there is some uncertainty over how much room a Republican Party eager to appear racially sensitive will give the Democrats and how much opportunity they will really have. Beyond that, Democrats are debating among themselves how aggressive to be without overplaying their hand. 
 "Frist will defuse the negatives," said Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party. "He's basically a modern-day leader, and the Republicans will try to co-opt some of these issues by appearing compassionate and moderate even though their policies are not."
Donald L. Fowler, a South Carolinian and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, reflected the uncertainty the Democrats face. "What I hope that you get on our side is a smart approach to this, so that we can maximize the potential advantage," Mr. Fowler said. But, he added, "I'm not sure that the potential advantage is all that great."
The Republicans are determined to smooth over the volcanic political disruption caused by Mr. Lott's remark that the country would have been better off if it had elected Strom Thurmond in 1948, when he ran for president as a segregationist.
The Democrats, relatively silent while Mr. Lott fought to save his job in hopes that he would keep it and provide them with an easy target, instinctively swooped in when he quit. The party machinery also clicked into gear, churning out "opposition research" on Dr. Frist. They repeated assertions that the National Republican Senatorial Committee, under his guidance last month, had approved intimidation tactics against black voters, and they portrayed the party as historically racist.
In a statement, Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, demanded to know Dr. Frist's involvement in the "many disgraceful incidents of minority voter intimidation in the '02 elections, particularly in the Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and New Jersey Senate campaigns."
Mr. McAuliffe added: "If the Republican Party is sincere in wanting to reconcile its poor record on race, it's not enough to get rid of Trent Lott. The time has come for the Republican Party to reconcile its empty rhetoric on race with its troubling record of civil rights suppression and support for economic and social policies that are harmful to African-American families."
But some Democrats say the party should leave well enough alone.
"Do we exploit this?" asked David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist based in Chicago. "I don't know that we need to," he said, noting that race will now automatically inform every step the Republicans take.
Mr. Axelrod added that President Bush would be imperiled by "cross-pressures" in his own party as he tried to appear moderate on racial issues even as he needed to satisfy his right wing.
Donna Brazile, a get-out-the-vote expert who steered Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, to victory this month in part by spurring black voters to the polls, said the Democrats had to focus on the future, not the past.
"Our civil rights agenda can't be based on what happened 30 or 40 years ago," Ms. Brazile said. "This country is already polarized along racial lines, and dwelling on that doesn't play to our advantage. What plays in the middle is sensible, sound ideas of how to move America forward." This means focusing on issues that help all races, like educational opportunity and the economy, she said.
She said President Bush already complicated the task for Democrats when he rebuked Mr. Lott in a speech before a black audience in Philadelphia. In that speech, she said, he did more than just distance himself from Mr. Lott's views on segregation.
"The president set the tone in Philadelphia when he condemned Lott," Ms. Brazile said. "How do we match that? We have to get out there and set a high moral tone for what we stand for. Yes, the Republicans have stepped on their own honeymoon. They gloated after November, they did an overkill in Louisiana and lost, and now Lott. But the last time I checked, we lost the Senate, we don't have the House, and the White House is still out of reach." 
Others believe that now is the time for Democrats to press an agenda that had little hope of passage before Mr. Lott embarrassed his party. With Republicans nervous about being perceived as racist, they could tie themselves in knots over how to respond to Democratic calls for an increase in the minimum wage, financing for historically black colleges and tax breaks that help lower-income Americans.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, citing the problems that Mr. Lott has generated for his party, immediately asked the president to join them in supporting the University of Michigan as it defends its affirmative action policy in the Supreme Court. At the same time, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate the accusations of suppression of the black vote.
As the party tries to regroup for 2004, Democrats also see pluses and minuses from the Lott episode for Democratic presidential candidates. For example, they say, with Mr. Bush's consolidation of power, the Democrats can more easily blame him if the Republicans fail to demonstrate racial sensitivity.
Some Democrats warn that Americans are loath to see their leaders engage in race-based tactics for political gain and say that Democrats face dangers in an overly aggressive approach.
"I don't think the country wants us to beat this into the ground," Mr. Axelrod said. "I don't think there's anything that we can or should do other than push issues of social equity and force Republicans to make a choice. And if they make the right choice, by God, Trent Lott will have been a force for good."

HEADLINE: Wine Prices Drop Sharply, A Good Reason for Cheer 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER

 BODY:
WHILE it has not been the best time to travel, invest in the stock market or indulge in truffles, there has never been a better time to buy and drink wine.
 After years of price inflation sent retail price tags of little-known wines soaring and the cost of wines by the glass well into the double digits, prices of wines have begun spiraling downward. 
 "Never in my lifetime have I seen so much great wine available at such a fair price," said Joshua Wesson, the president of Best Cellars, a wine chain. "There are great deals from just about any country that wine is made."
John McClement, the wine director at Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan, explained: "There's a glut of wine on the market, allocations aren't as hard to come by and the prices keep coming down." 
This means that the Raymond Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, 1999, which Mr. McClement sold for $75 last year, is now $53. At Astor Wines and Spirits in Greenwich Village, the Laurent-Perrier Champagne, Grand Siecle, which was selling for $129.99 last year, has been slashed to $64.99. And at Chanterelle, in TriBeCa, the 1998 Chateau Fourcas-Hosten, which was $39 on the menu, is now $30. 
"I think a lot of people aren't admitting what's happening," Karen King, the wine director at Union Square Cafe in Manhattan, said, "because the minute you admit it, it's true."
Fluctuation in the market for wine, which is at base an agriculture product like carrots or rice, is typical. What is unusual about the current situation is that it is not simply a reflection of a shift in the economy or the weather. It is also the result of bad decisions. "All these people thought that there would be this arc upward of consumption," Mr. Wesson said of wine sales. "And although it's grown modestly in the United States, worldwide it's flat." 
During the economic boom of the late 1990's, when pricey cult wines were often as difficult to acquire as an Hermes Kelly bag, winemakers, particularly in California, bet on the future with great optimism and exuberance. In 1996, said Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Wine Grape Growers, there were 311,329 acres of wine vineyards. By 2001 the state's estimate was 570,000 acres. 
"Now," Mr. Wesson said, "a lot of producers are freaking out. They've planted all of these grapes and they don't know what to do with them."
California is being hit the hardest at the low end and high end of the market. Growers for the jug wine industry have largely overplanted, and are now watching the value of their grape crops tumble. 
Christian Miller, the director of research at Motto Kryla & Fisher, a consulting company that specializes in the wine industry, said the situation in the south Central Valley of California, where many of these grapes are grown, was so bad that growers are ripping out vineyards and replanting them with alternative crops like alfalfa and almonds or none at all, sometimes selling their land to developers. 
In the fine-wine market, there are simply too many players and not enough consumers willing to pay $100 for a bottle of wine. 
"The shakeout is going to be at the grower end first," Ms. Ross said. "It's been more than a decade since we saw major bankruptcies. People are anticipating that we're going to see that happening again."
Last month Sonoma Creek Winery, in Sonoma, Calif., filed for Chapter 11, seeking bankruptcy protection from creditors while it reorganized its finances.
Right now, many wineries have stocks of grapes packed to the rafters and their main goal is to unload the inventories before the new vintage comes in. So between now and the spring, when many vintages are released, may be a great time to buy. 
Even in some restaurants, where it never feels like you're getting a deal, you can enjoy wines that would not previously have been offered. At Keens Steakhouse, for instance, where wines by the glass are not priced higher than $9.75, the restaurant is now offering 1998 Markham Merlot Reserve for that price. A year ago, Mr. McClement said, he would have had to have charged $13 a glass.
Similarly at Restaurant Daniel in Midtown, there is a 1999 Marc Morey Chassagne-Montrachet, Les Virondots, for $23 a glass. Two years ago, Jean Luc Le Du, the restaurant's sommelier, said, he could not sell it by the glass because he would have had to charge $30. It has dropped in cost by as much as 35 to 40 percent a case. 
When California's cult wines got out of control a few years ago, many sommeliers began looking to Europe and Australia for reasonable prices. And they have continued to. Roger Dagorn, the wine director at Chanterelle, has found good buys in France. A few weeks ago, he was able to lower the price on the 2000 Olivier Leflaive St.-Auban on his menu to $50 from $60. 
Karen King, Union Square Cafe's wine director, has found great values in Spanish wines. "Portugal," she said, "forget it. There are going to be really good values over the next few years. It's going to be the next frontier."
In 2002, Ms. Ross of the Wine Grape Growers Association added, imported wines are expected to make up nearly 22 percent of the American wine market. Six years ago, they took up only around 17 percent.
Small wine retailers say they are not getting the best bargains because good wineries prefer to sell exclusively through restaurants, which are considered better marketing platforms for fine wines, or through large warehouse clubs, which can promise high volume. 
Earlier this year, for instance, the Bronco Wine Company, a wine conglomerate based in Ceres, Calif., began selling Charles Shaw's Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot at Trader Joe's for $1.99 a bottle. 
Jon Fredrikson, a wine industry analyst, said that the store was likely to sell a million cases in California this year. "People are going into these Trader Joe's where it's sold on an exclusive basis and buying 6 to 10 cases at a time," Mr. Fredrikson said. "That's cheaper than Pellegrino." Not quite. But close.
Jimmy Bradley, an owner of the Red Cat and the Harrison restaurants in Manhattan, is considering applying a similar tactic at the Mermaid Inn, which is opening in the East Village this February. 
He may mark up all wines just $10, he said, a radical move considering that most wines are marked up two or three times the cost. "I'm under the impression that the value in that will lead them to order more wine and come back more often," he said.
It's not that people aren't buying wine -- sales volume is up 6 percent for the first half of 2002, according to Motto Kryla & Fisher -- they are just buying differently. Chris Shipley, wine director at the "21" Club said: "I have a friend who coined the expression 'competitive spenders.' They're still out there but they've had their wings clipped a bit."
Mr. McClement added: "What might have been someone coming in and ordering a Harlan Estate at over $300 a bottle, they'll now come in and order two $90 bottles." 
Ms. King has found the same at Union Square Cafe. Wine sales are up over last year but, she pointed out, "Last Friday we put on Turley Zinfandel, Hayne Vineyard, 2000, and normally that would be selling like crazy and be gone in a week, and I just checked and we've only sold one bottle."
Many experts believe that prices on California wines will go lower. An excess of vineyards, Ms. Ross said, "starts to dampen the price for grapes, so eventually consumers will start to see more competitive pricing."
In the meantime, why not toast to a little certainty.

HEADLINE: The Shame of Norway 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As "A Nation That Exports Oil, Herring and Peace" (news article, Dec. 21) points out, Norway has become a very positive force in terms of promoting peace agreements between other countries. 
 However, Norway's identity as a good world neighbor continues to be tarnished by its selfish insistence on continuing to hunt whales. 
Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993, flouting a moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986 in response to seriously dwindling whale populations. There is simply no excuse for continuing to hunt a species that faces the real possibility of extinction. 
 There is certainly no economic need for Norway's stance when, as you point out, its per capita gross domestic product is among the highest in the world. 
Here's hoping that Norway will come to see the error of its ways regarding whale hunting.

HEADLINE: Arts Advocacy Group Ponders Its Good Fortune 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
A low-profile arts advocacy group is pondering the delightful question of what to do with a sudden windfall of $120 million.
 Americans for the Arts, which helps local arts councils lobby for money and support, received the money in November from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly. Ms. Lilly also made a comparable gift to Poetry magazine. 
 "I have to think that with these additional resources, we can make a monumental difference," said Robert L. Lynch, the arts group's president. 
In recent weeks Mr. Lynch has sent 3,000 questionnaires to members and supporters asking what they think the group should do with its new treasure. In January it will hold a series of focus groups and individual interviews with arts administrators, public officials and donors. Then in February board members will go on a retreat to discuss their suddenly brightened prospects.
Mr. Lynch said that he expected to introduce a new agenda for the group at its next annual meeting, scheduled for June in Portland, Ore.
About 800 questionnaires have already been returned, and Mr. Lynch said most ask the group to do more of what it has already done.
Ms. Lilly's donation will arrive in several streams, including lump sum payments and long-term income over the next 30 years. Mr. Lynch said that almost all of it will be placed in an endowment, from which the organization will draw interest of $6 million to $7 million each year. That will nearly double its present budget.
"Our goal is access to the arts for all Americans, the opportunity for every American to connect with the arts," he said. "The way we hope to achieve that is by putting facts and information in the hands of decision-makers."
Americans for the Arts has a lobbyist on its staff in Washington. It also trains arts advocates around the country, gives them the tools they need to press their case and prepares public relations campaigns to support their efforts. Most of its financing comes from arts councils that pay dues, from foundations and private donors and from the proceeds of conferences and book sales. 
Last year Americans for the Arts issued a report called "Arts and Economic Prosperity," which surveyed the impact that arts and cultural programs can have in dealing with challenges ranging from neighborhood decay to juvenile crime. Mr. Lynch said its member groups, most of which are local arts councils, found the report highly useful.
"They can use as much data and facts as we can give them to help them explain the value of arts and arts education," he said. "We're talking about hard numbers that relate to the economic and practical effect of cultural districts, cultural tourism and arts education. When we talk to mayors, they're interested first of all in jobs and the economy, and then in things like education, crime, health, social problems and infrastructure. Our job is to show them how spending money on the arts can help them deal with those challenges in a very practical way."
That is not an easy sell. Many public officials view cultural programs as a frill, and cut them when budgets are tight. This year, for example, the Massachusetts Cultural Council's budget was cut by 62 percent and the California Arts Council's was cut by 41 percent.
As part of its effort to promote local arts initiatives, Americans for the Arts holds an annual banquet at which it honors public officials who have used culture-related projects to help revitalize communities. Recent recipients have included Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut.
Mr. Lynch said the questionnaires he has reviewed so far express not only a desire for more information about the impact of arts programs, but also better training in lobbying techniques and more public-service advertising in support of the arts.
Ms. Lilly's donation, like the one to Poetry magazine, is designed in complex ways that have taken lawyers and other experts several weeks to decipher. Some of the money is in stocks and trusts that must be converted to cash, and it is to be disbursed according to a complicated timetable.
In a statement issued on Dec. 17, the arts group said it expected the donation to total more than $120 million. That will make it somewhat smaller than the one to Poetry, which the magazine's editor, Joseph Parisi, said could ultimately reach or exceed $150 million.
"It's the first time I can think of that a grant like this has been made to what we call an arts service organization, rather than to something like a museum or a performing arts center," said Janet Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council in White Plains, one of the many local councils that work with Americans for the Arts. "This is a signal that there are people in the country who really do care about seeing to it that there is a national arts presence and that we have the funds to advocate for it."
Ms. Lilly, who is 87 and infirm, is an heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune. Although she had made several donations to Americans for the Arts before, none were especially large. She has, however, made substantial contributions to cultural institutions in Indianapolis, her hometown, and evidently wanted to do the same on a nationwide basis.
Ms. Lilly's donation caps a period of astonishing growth in the number of local arts councils, which distribute funds to performing and visual artists and arts organizations in individual communities. Mr. Lynch said the first were founded in 1949 in three American towns -- Quincy, Ill., Winston-Salem, N. C. and Canon City, Colo. -- where people decided they wanted to bring culture to their communities instead of traveling to big cities to experience it. Now there are more than 4,000 such councils. Their members were instrumental in creating the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965 and in blocking several Congressional efforts to abolish it.
There has been a similar growth in the number of nonprofit arts groups, which range from some involved in political advocacy to others with special missions like presenting theatrical performances or arranging partnerships between museums and public schools. Mr. Lynch estimated that there were 7,000 such groups in the United States in 1965 and that there are 50,000 today.

HEADLINE: China Airlines Confirms Plane Purchases 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
China Airlines, the government-controlled carrier of Taiwan, confirmed today that it had concluded large contracts to buy jets from both Airbus and Boeing, but said the financial weakness of other airlines had allowed it to secure deep discounts.
 China Airlines agreed to buy 10 long-range Boeing 747-400's and 12 medium-range Airbus A330-300's, with options to acquire 6 more of the Airbus A330's, the company said, confirming figures that it had released in October. At list price, the Boeings would be worth $2 billion and the smaller Airbus planes would be worth $1.7 billion, or $2.5 billion if the options are exercised. 
 But Roger Han, a spokesman for China Airlines, said that his company would actually pay considerably less, having bargained aggressively at a time when many other airlines are in financial difficulty and deferring or canceling orders for new aircraft. 
"Our transaction price is much, much lower than the list price," Mr. Han said, declining to be more specific. "There were some big discounts because right now the market competition favors airlines."
Part of the discount for China Airlines, Mr. Han said, lay in promises by Airbus and Boeing to help the airline dispose of many of its current Airbus and Boeing jets as they are replaced by the new planes.
It is rare for the participants in aircraft deals to talk publicly about the terms. Indeed, Airbus and Boeing have policies against doing so and said nothing about the details of today's transaction. But the China Airlines deal comes after considerable wrangling, political as well as commercial, and China Airlines has had to fight suspicions in Taiwan in particular that it is overpaying for the Boeing jets to help preserve Taiwan's military alliance with the United States.
China Airlines came close last summer to buying exclusively Airbus jets, after Boeing quoted prices that the airline regarded as uncompetitive. That provoked strenuous lobbying by the Bush administration and by members of Congress, especially from Washington state.
Boeing still builds many of its commercial airliners in the state, but has been struggling for new orders to keep its factories full because of the combination of the global economic slowdown and the attacks of Sept. 11, which have depressed air travel in many markets and left some airlines with little need for more planes.
American officials reminded Taiwan of the island's continued dependence on military protection from the United States against any possible attack by China, and Taiwan's reliance on purchasing weapons from the United States at a time when many other countries refuse to do business with it for fear of offending Beijing.
The lobbying was controversial in Taiwan, where several years of economic stagnation have produced a focus on economic issues over traditional security concerns. Many Taiwanese now view closer economic relations with the mainland as the best way to regain prosperity on their island, and this has made them somewhat less enthusiastic about close ties to the United States.
Boeing also noted in its sales effort that the 747-400 had a slightly longer range with a full cargo than its long-haul rival, the Airbus A340. Range and cargo capacity were important because one of China Airlines' biggest markets is in carrying the flood of computer chips and other products from Taiwan's high-tech industries to American cities that are 13 to 15 hours away by air.
Boeing welcomed the sale of the 747-400's, saying today in a statement that it was the largest deal this year for the intercontinental model. Mr. Han said that three of the jets would be freighters and were scheduled for delivery next year. Six passenger versions of the huge airplane are to be delivered from 2004 to 2006, along with a fourth cargo jet.
But today's deal appeared to offer no immediate benefit for Boeing investors, as the company said that it had earlier begun counting the 747-400's in its inventory of orders. The planes for China Airlines had previously been labeled as going to an unidentified customer, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: Japan Has No Shortage of Advice on Banks' Woes 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Japanese policy makers have never been at a loss for ideas on how to clean up the nation's debt-laden banks. College professors, bank analysts and authors are forever offering opinions in newspapers and on television.
 But in recent months, several international agencies have also raised loud alarm bells. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for instance, recently said Japan's banks needed more taxpayer money to survive. 
 Add the International Monetary Fund to the list. The fund is in the middle of a yearlong inspection of Japan's banks that some hope will shed light on the problem of bad loans here. Sayuri Shirai, a former I.M.F. economist with connections to her old employer, said the report, scheduled for next summer, would prove that several banks do not meet international capital standards.
After years of frightening warnings, though, the question is what impact these findings may have. Lawmakers and, to a large degree, the public have become so hardened to predictions of the financial system's demise that they tune out much of the advice, including some helpful ideas.
Complicating matters, the suggestions are often hurled by foreigners who are suspected of having ulterior motives. American bankers are often portrayed in the local media as vultures who swoop down on embattled Japanese companies, buy assets on the cheap and put Japanese employees out of work. Politicians stumping for votes routinely accuse Westerners and their Japanese sympathizers of financial imperialism.
More often than not, then, foreign advice, however useful, ends up fueling existing prejudices. The I.M.F. report may bolster reformers like Heizo Takenaka, Japan's financial czar whose plan to clean up the banking system has been diluted. Yet conservative lawmakers eager to maintain the status quo also may use the report to scare voters into opposing any radical reforms.
"The reaction goes both ways," said Michael Petit, the chief criteria officer at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo whose own credit reports have been volleyed around for political purposes. "Takenaka may try to use the international support, but the forces inside the government are ultimately the ones who say what gets decided."
As a practical matter, the I.M.F. report will have no binding impact. Unlike Russia, Argentina or Brazil, Japan has no foreign debts or loans from the fund. The country runs a huge trade surplus and has more than $400 billion in foreign currency reserves, so it can defend itself ably from speculators. Japan is also a leading contributor to the I.M.F.
But unlike reports by other international agencies and private banks, the I.M.F. report will be done in conjunction with Japan's Financial Services Agency in one part of the report. The two sides will compile a "stress test" that will simulate various models, including the impact on the banks of a stock market crash. The participation of government regulators will make it hard for policy makers to deny all the report's findings.
"Of course, people might say it is just the I.M.F. talking," said Ms. Shirai, who now teaches at Keio University and has recently written a book, "Megabank Crises and I.M.F. Economic Policy."
"Some politicians will oppose the report, but they can't complain because it has been approved by the government," she said.

HEADLINE: India Is Regaining Contracts With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
After slowing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outsourcing by American companies to Indian concerns or to their own Indian units has begun to pick up.
 The new contracts span the technology-related spectrum, going well beyond the software code writing of the last decade to include chip design, product development, call centers, consulting and other support services. They give Indian companies the opportunity to expand their repertory with work that holds much promise for future growth. And they account for a significant chunk of business in India, especially here in Bangalore and the country's other high-technology cities. 
 In just the last few months, dozens of Indian concerns have garnered contracts from big American companies to take over pieces of their operations. A unit of the Bangalore-based Wipro, India's third-largest software and services exporter, will be handling some of the worldwide reservation services for Delta Air Lines, a move that Delta expects will save $12 million to $15 million annually. 
India's top software company, Tata Consultancy Services, or T.C.S., part of India's Tata conglomerate, has signed up Lehman Brothers -- in a $70 million-a-year deal shared with Wipro -- as well as J. P. Morgan Chase, Fidelity Investments and GE Medical Systems. The local unit of Cognizant Technology Solutions, a custom software developer and services provider in Teaneck, N.J., has contracts for projects from MetLife, to upgrade its human resources administration system and streamline some computer applications, and from the UnitedHealth Group and Sallie Mae, the student loan provider.
For the American companies, which account for more than two-thirds of the work coming to India, the country has several advantages. Though wages in India have been rising, they still tend to be much lower than in the United States. That is particularly attractive in the current global economy, cost-sensitive executives say, as they follow the outsourcing path set in the early 1990's by technology companies from Silicon Valley seeking cheaper software coding operations.
India also has a large, well-educated, English-speaking work force with one of the world's largest clusters of engineers and programmers.
Even Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is widely revered here, has given his imprimatur. "A couple of years ago, the biggest American corporations would have considered it risky to outsource mission-critical work to India, but it is now becoming a common-sense proposition," Mr. Gates said on a visit to Bangalore last month.
Microsoft is expanding its development center in the high-tech city of Hyderabad and is outsourcing some back office work to Wipro.
The software and back-office services outsourcing is one of India's fastest-growing businesses. In the year ended March 31, it accounted for nearly 3 percent of India's gross domestic product, up from 0.3 percent three years earlier, and is expected to increase to 7 percent in 2008. It has also contributed substantially to the country's healthy state of foreign exchange reserves in recent years.
According to Gartner Inc., a research firm based in Stamford, Conn., India is leading the world in offshore outsourcing services, with annual revenue of $8 billion, and outsourced projects from American companies to Indian concerns will become increasingly common.
Gartner has, however, warned that American companies that rush into outsourcing deals with Indian companies solely to cut costs are usually soon in trouble and that India's competitive edge over places like China could vanish if India does not continue to upgrade the infrastructure and stay on top of quality control.
India's three top software exporters -- Wipro, T.C.S. and Infosys Technologies -- said that with the post-Sept. 11 lull ended, they are busy fending off Irish, Philippine and other competitors. But they think they have the global edge.
"No country is able to offer the cost-to-quality advantage and scaling up opportunities that India does," said N. G. Subramaniam, T.C.S.'s vice president. Companies that start with a few dozen people in a pilot project could increase to thousands in a matter of months, he said.
Many also have been working toward becoming one-stop shops. "Early Indian services companies typically gained backdoor entry as code cutters but moved up the value chain to take on strategic parts of the client's business," said Vivek Paul, vice chairman of Wipro. For instance, he said, his company's first task for Home Depot was to maintain applications, but Wipro moved up by writing software to run computerized tasks and maintaining it in all Home Depot outlets.
As the scope of work farmed out to India has broadened, so has the spectrum of American companies doing the outsourcing. Companies in the credit card, insurance and financial services industries were among the first, in the early 1990's, but new converts include even some older, highly regulated industries like utilities.
Back-office and information technology service operations, like processing employee payrolls or fielding phone calls from customers, are now moving to India at an even brisker pace than outsourced software projects. Acknowledging the influx, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the industry trade group known as Nasscom, has raised its projections for the country's back-office services industry to $21 billion, from $17 billion, by 2008.
Software companies like Wipro and Satyam Computer Services, meanwhile, are taking on the big consulting firms for large-scale consulting deals.
The mostly back-office and services jobs have been flooding across India, beyond the high-tech hot spots and into big cities like Delhi and Bombay, even as American companies continue to announce layoffs. That has spurred some criticism in the United States. Recently, when New Jersey state senator Shirley K. Turner discovered that a welfare and food stamp contractor had moved its customer service center to Bombay from Wisconsin, she sponsored a bill to require that workers on state contracts be American citizens, or legal aliens, or have some specialty for which such workers cannot be found. The bill was approved this month and forwarded to the state Assembly.
Back in India, outsourcing companies have been busy recruiting. One, ICICI oneSource, a Bangalore-based back-office concern owned by the Indian financial services giant ICICI Group, has attracted thousands of young "customer jockey" hopefuls for its call center with ads in the local newspapers saying "The C.J. Hunt is on!"
Such jobs are changing the lives of the thousands of young, urban men and women who fill the positions, toiling largely at night, synchronizing their work schedules with Americans halfway across the globe.
Saranya Sukumaran, 21, who is just out of college and three months into her first job, takes home 10,000 rupees, or just over $200, a month from her job on the help desk at the local unit of an American Internet service provider in a country where nearly half the population survives on less than $1 a day. From 10:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. five days a week, and calling herself Sharon "no last name," she responds to calls that have been routed to Bangalore. The money enables her to help her father, a junior official with the state-owned phone company who earns 15,000 rupees a month, support the household.
It also allows her to grab a $1 coffee at the hip cafes dotting Bangalore and splurge on luxuries like Levi's jeans and a Nokia cellphone.
"As a teenager I wished for so many things," she said. "Now I'm my own Santa Claus."

Economic Report Gives Equities a Reason to Retreat

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A tepid durable-goods report put pressure on Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks modestly lower as investors perceived little hope of a strengthening economy anytime soon. 
 Volume was light the day before Christmas; the stock markets are closed today for the holiday; they will reopen tomorrow. 
 "The durable goods orders really took the cheer out of the holiday," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "It suggests the corporate earnings that people had hoped would firm up is not." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 8,448.11, for a two-day loss of 63 points. 
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.22 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,372.47. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 892.47. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders to factories for bigticket goods fell 1.4 percent in November. Economists were expecting an increase of 0.8 percent. 
Analysts say investors are concerned that holiday retail sales have been sluggish. They add that the market's traditional rally on optimism for the coming year is in question because of concerns about a war with Iraq and doubts about the economy. 
Still, some investors think that 2003 offers better market prospects, particularly if a Republican-controlled Congress passes business-friendly tax cuts. 
"Over the longer term for next year, we do think the economy can continue to expand," said Kevin Caron, a market strategist at Ryan, Beck & Company. 
Share prices should rally, Mr. Caron said, if "we get a resolution in Iraq," and the new tax package in Washington. 
Shares in the retailer Target dropped 36 cents, to $28.18, after the company reported that its sales fell below estimates. 
Ultimate Electronics fell $1.57, to $9.48, after the operator of consumer electronic stores lowered its fourth-quarter outlook, citing sluggish holiday sales. 
Gainers included Sun Microsystems, which rose 17 cents, to $3.13, after a federal judge ordered Microsoft to distribute Sun's Java programming in Microsoft's operating system, pending the outcome of Sun's private antitrust suit. Microsoft dropped 18 cents, to $53.82. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after an unexpected decline in durable goods orders indicated the economic expansion may be weakening. 
Benchmark 10-year note yields fell as the government report prompted some investors to bet that the Federal Reserve would wait until at least the second half of next year to raise interest rates. 
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32 , to 100 16/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.94 percent, from 3.97 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 107 24/32 . The note's yield fell to 4.87 percent, from 4.90 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Moves Ahead On Tightening Security Laws 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
The government here ended a public comment period today on plans for tough internal security laws, including a ban on the mere possession of "seditious" publications, brushing aside objections from businesses, human rights groups and foreign governments. 
 The government said it would introduce legislation as soon as practicable, with the goal of winning final passage by July. However, the government indicated that adjustments would be made to its plans based on the public comments that have been received. 
 Timothy Tong, Hong Kong's acting secretary of security, said tonight that while officials were aware of polls showing that up to 70 percent of the residents here had a negative view of the plans, they would still start the legislative process by February. 
"Hong Kong, being an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, has both moral and constitutional obligations to protect national security," he said at a news conference.
Yet after receiving more than 90,000 comments on the proposal, government officials are likely to revise some provisions, Mr. Tong said.
"We will consider how best we can improve on our proposals and allay as far as possible worries raised by different sectors, such as those over the possession of seditious publications, increased police powers and unauthorized access to protected information." he said. "We believe there will be some adjustments to our proposals in the light of the views received."
Britain handed over this territory to China in 1997 after receiving a promise, enshrined in the territory's Basic Law, that China would respect Hong Kong's separate legal and economic systems for at least 50 years under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
But the Basic Law also contains a provision, Article 23, that requires new internal security laws after the handover.
A wide range of critics, from the American Chamber of Commerce to Amnesty International to the European Parliament, as well as democracy advocates here, had urged the government to issue a draft text of the legislation for public comment before asking the Legislative Council to take up the issue. The critics complained of ambiguities in the so-called consultation document in which the government outlined its plans.
"The government spent four years to draft that consultation document but has only given us two months to look at it," said Bella Luk, the director of the Hong Kong section of Amnesty International, which also petitioned unsuccessfully today for an extension of the comment period.
An additional period of public comment for a draft text of the legislation would give opponents another chance to oppose provisions like one that would allow even fairly junior police commanders to order searches and seizures without a warrant in security cases, and another that lengthens prison sentences and increases fines for sedition.
Banks and other businesses have been particularly alarmed by proposals for stringent penalties for the unauthorized release of government information, fearing that, as on the mainland, such a provision could be used to inhibit free speech about economic indicators or even the financial health of Chinese state-owned enterprises. Mr. Tong said that this concern would receive attention and might prompt revisions.
The government here has repeatedly pointed out that its proposal would actually narrow the grounds on which residents and foreigners could be tried for some offenses. Hong Kong already has fairly stringent security laws on its books. 
Mr. Tong said tonight that the executive branch here would proceed with its original plan to send the new internal security laws directly to the Legislative Council in February as a so-called blue bill, which discourages filibusters and amendments.
The bill would go through numerous hearings, but under the rules, the Legislative Council would be compelled to vote on the bill before adjourning in July. The measure is expected to pass.
Some Chinese nationalists here have embraced the government's proposal, contending that the laws will help make sure that Chinese rule over Hong Kong is never threatened.
They also contend that recent American antiterrorism efforts show that Hong Kong's efforts are part of an international trend toward balancing respect for civil rights with security worries.
"You need a lock for your door to prevent a thief from breaking in," said Ma Lik, the secretary general of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing political party.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Fire Destroys More Than a Mixed-Use Project

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 18 

 BODY:
The town houses, seated on a $10 million platform atop spaces leased to restaurateurs and retailers, looked complete. Inside, the insulation was in place, but the sprinkler system was not, nor was the drywall.
 City officials have not issued a report on how the Aug. 19 fire started, though they have said that it was the costliest in San Jose's history. Flames destroyed more than 100 apartments and town houses at Santana Row, an upscale mixed-use development by the Federal Realty Investment Trust that was a month short of its formal opening. 
 Steven J. Guttman, chief executive of the REIT, said he saw smoke and called 911. "They say they were here in two minutes, but it felt like the longest two minutes of my life." 
The fire delayed the opening of Santana Row, but its effects on the development -- and its cash flow -- left Wall Street analysts who had questioned Mr. Guttman's stewardship of Federal Realty feeling vindicated.
They had repeatedly assailed the project, saying that the company concentrated far too many resources and assets in one place.
The circumstances that put Mr. Guttman in a position to build Santana Row, and the price he has paid for his ambitious decisions, demonstrate the obstacles to creating the kind of large-scale, mixed-use projects, influenced by the new urbanism philosophy, that many cities desire.
Mr. Guttman initiated Santana Row, and he moved here, across the country from corporate headquarters in Maryland, to see it through. Last March, under criticism from Wall Street for putting so much of Federated Realty's money into Santana Row, he announced plans to resign as chief executive, and Federal Realty has indicated that it will back away from projects like this one.
 Dec. 20, the company announced that Mr. Guttman's resignation would take effect on Jan. 1 and that he would also resign as chairman then. Shares of Federal Realty have rallied since the announcement, closing at $28.75 yesterday, a 52-week high. 
"My wife will tell you I'm obsessive," Mr. Guttman said in a recent interview. Among other things, he has become obsessive about fire. Touring the site in September, when it still smelled of smoke and mildew, Mr. Guttman stopped at one point, fell silent and shivered at the sight of a construction worker with a torch. Asked if he was all right, he said: "I was watching that guy with the fire."
Planned as a $500 million development, Santana Row is densely zoned and ornately decorated with imported arts, ornamental fountains and tile mosaics intended to evoke the legacy of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi. 
It was built without assistance from the City of San Jose, using equity capital from the REIT, which it had raised from shareholders.
City planners and urban economists across the country are clamoring for projects of this sort -- a series of interlocking streets where places to shop, live and work are clustered with public spaces. But paying for such ambitious projects is challenging.
Discussing Federal Realty's investment in Santana Row, Matthew L. Ostrower, an analyst at Morgan Stanley who covers retail-oriented real estate investment trusts, said, "The rents at which it will be desirable to tenants will never justify what was spent on the project."
The company, he said, allocated too much money to buy land and infrastructure for several city blocks, leaving its investors with low short-term yields. 
"The markets just don't provide patient capital, generally speaking," Mr. Ostrower said. "Steve Guttman regarded himself as something of a visionary. He essentially ignored the public shareholders. Santana Row cost Steve Guttman his job."
While equity analysts assailed the short-term yields, debt analysts objected to the concentration of assets.
"You're looking at something that could wipe out 20 percent of the balance sheet of this company," said Richard S. Talmadge, the lead analyst of the company's debt at Fitch Ratings, arguing that the fire had vividly demonstrated his point. The company has filed more than $70 million in insurance claims and has been paid about $20 million so far. 
Mr. Guttman argues for a longer view than that of his critics. "REIT analysts are going to look at this in a one- or two-year microscope," he said. "We thought long term, and I still believe long term it's going to be one of the top real-estate developments in the United States."
The conundrum for proponents of new urbanism is summed up neatly at Santana Row, said Michael D. Beyard, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington. "The question is what will be the type of developers to bring about these projects," Mr. Beyard said. "REIT's have the money, but not the time because they have to show steady profit," he said.
"Entrepreneurial investors have the time and inclination, but they may not have the money. That's why projects are so slow to be introduced."
Mr. Guttman was in an unusual position to bring about a mixed-use project on this scale: 22 acres in the first phase, including 441,000 square feet of retail space, a movie theater, 2,000 parking spaces, a 213-room hotel and 246 residential units.
Raised in Charleroi, Pa., a small town built around shopping centers and encircled by small towns built around steel mills, Mr. Guttman joined Federal Realty in 1972, just after graduating from George Washington University School of Law. The company's founders were former State Department officials in their 50's who had rolled $40 million in apartment building assets in the Washington area into a real estate investment trust.
They hired Mr. Guttman to handle acquisitions, and with limited capital, he bought dilapidated shopping centers, intending to renovate them and increase their profits. The strategy did not start to work until companies like the Gap and Barnes & Noble began renting spaces in small outdoor shopping centers. The company's greatest success has been Bethesda Row in Maryland, a 280,000-square-foot development that emphasizes restaurant tenants.
With that as a small model, the company bought 42 acres here, 3.5 miles from downtown, for $42 million. And then Mr. Guttman began executing ambitious plans.
He hired four architecture firms, intending to make each of the eight new buildings look as though they had been constructed at different times. He commissioned an artist to put ceiling panels evoking the 28 phases of the moon above the sidewalk. He bought an 18th-century chapel facade in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of the south of France for $28,000. He subsidized the rent on a 6,000-square-foot gallery space for Emmanuel Flipo, an artist from the south of France.
It added up. Federal Realty spent $205 million in equity capital and obtained a $295 million construction loan, which it has since retired with proceeds from the sale of more unsecured debt, bringing the company's total indebtedness to $660 million.
The roads and other infrastructure cost Federal Realty about $50 million. 
San Jose spent nothing.
"It would have been hard to declare that a blighted area," said Joseph A. Horwedel, deputy director of planning for the city. "There would have been strong opposition from other groups that depend on tax revenues."
Parts of Santana Row opened in November, two months late, with high-end specialty merchants like Gucci and Anthropologie anchored by larger Barnes & Noble and Crate & Barrel stores. Signed leases cover 331,000 square feet of retail space in all, with the remaining 100,000 square feet unleased. 
In part because of the fire, only 177,000 square feet of the retail space -- 41 stores including sidewalk vendors -- is open for business. Many of the companies, especially those opening a first or second store, were uninsured.
Most of the retail spaces are small, and so Santana Row is directly -- and successfully -- competing for tenants with Union Square in San Francisco, said Kazuko Morgan, a senior director of retail services for the real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Guttman said that if he had it to do over, he would not have concentrated such a high percentage of his company's assets in one project. "Federal Realty, in hindsight, would have been better not doing this project," he said.
As Mr. Guttman, who has taken up smoking again, showed a visitor around Santana Row last week, he ground his cigarette butt out on a garbage can, then crushed the visitor's discarded cigarette under his shoe for a good five seconds to ensure that it had been extinguished.

HEADLINE: A Christmas List for a Song This Year 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

 BODY:
Deflation hit true love this year -- at least the type spelled out in "The 12 Days of Christmas."
 Each year, as holiday spending reaches its seasonal frenzy, a Pennsylvania financial services firm offers its own quirky take on the economy, and this year, it calculates, the gifts spun out in the song -- from a perching partridge to drummers drumming -- would run to $14,558.06. 
 An expensive Christmas, true, and it counts on old-fashioned legwork to buy everything from the partridge's pear-tree perch to booking the milking maids and leaping lords. But the price, according to the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, which has been putting together the index for nearly two decades, is down 7.6 percent from last year. 
And for what it's worth: Only twice before, in 1988 and 1995, did the index fall.
It would probably be fruitless to look for savings on the Internet, though. If you turn to the Web, the price zooms up to $24,595.28 -- 3.6 percent higher than a year ago -- though some items are cheaper.
Still, just look at the bargains to be found in our wobbly economy. Swans, for instance. Seven "a-swimming" are required -- and they have dropped to $300 each from $500 last year. Breeders, it seems, have an oversupply of trumpeter swans, said Rebekah McCahan, who has been compiling the light-hearted information for PNC since 1986.
And there is a surfeit of pear trees this year, with one Philadelphia-area nursery selling them at 30 percent less than last year, for $87.50 versus $125.
"Over all, we've seen the price of goods drop, which reflects what is happening in retail, where there are big discounts to encourage consumer spending and increase sales," Ms. McCahan said.
Gold prices rose, though, with five simple gold bands now going for $382.50, up 2 percent from $375 last year. Buying the rings online, though, would cut the price more than half.
Pipers and drummers, from the local musicians' union, were relatively cheap -- 11 pipers for $1,641.60 -- no increase over 2001, she said. But the leaping lords (from a Philadelphia dance troupe, Philadanco) and dancing ladies (hired from the Pennsylvania Ballet) were more expensive. Ten lords-a-leaping cost $3,921, up 4 percent, and the nine female dancers rose 2.2 percent, to $4,107, up considerably from their $1,602 price tag in 1986, Ms. McCahan said.
Eight maids-a-milking cost the same as last year -- $41.60 for an hour of minimum-wage toil, or $296.32 if hired via the Internet -- although Ms. McCahan acknowledged that such a service is hard to find these days because most milking is automated.
You might want to get them while you can. Over all, the price of the gifts is likely to rise again.
"As we see hiring plans improving and wages on the rise, we expect to see a rise in our Christmas Price Index next year," said Jeff Kleintop, the chief strategist at PNC's investment advisory group.
But never fear: the lords will leap again, the ladies will dance.

HEADLINE: Indians Fight to Regain Lands Lost to Railroad 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: LEECH LAKE RESERVATION, Minn. 

 BODY:
Richard Robinson Jr. remembers how much his grandfather Martin Bobolink, a hospital janitor, looked forward to retiring and returning to his land here. "He told us there was buried treasure there because his dad had put up gangsters," said Mr. Robinson, the acting chairman of the Leech Lake band of the Ojibwe tribe.
 But Mr. Bobolink quickly learned that the land and any loot that might be on it was not his. The Bureau of Indian Affairs told him he had signed the land over to the United States in exchange for a few thousand dollars. 
 "He swore until he died that he never received a check and never signed any papers," Mr. Robinson said. "He was dead certain." 
The story is a common one in what used to be Indian country, before the the relentless westward push of white settlers and railroads. Among the most effective tools of expropriation were nine laws passed by Congress in 1887, at the behest of James J. Hill, head of the Great Northern Railroad, and other railroad owners, which ensured that huge chunks of Indian land ended up in the hands of industrialists, homesteaders or, as in Mr. Bobolink's case, the United States government.
Now a chunk of the Hill fortune has been dedicated to reassembling that land and returning it to Indian control.
The Northwest Area Foundation, a $424 million philanthropy established by Hill's heirs, has given $20 million of seed money toward the effort, which aims to restore some 90 million acres on reservations around the country to Indian ownership.
"We're not saying it's going to be easy," said Cris Stainbrook, a Lakota who leads the Indian Land Tenure Foundation, which was created to lead the effort. "It's going to be very expensive, and probably the staff here now isn't going to be alive to see the mission completed. But it is the only way Native Americans can regain the means to preserve their sovereignty, their culture, their identity."
Philanthropy often seems tailor-made to assuage guilt, and the Great Northern was "one of the most Indian-subsidized railroads in America," wrote Michael P. Malone, a historian, in a 1996 biography of Mr. Hill. To build a railroad spanning the Northwest frontier, Mr. Hill needed a right of way through Indian country, and he used his friendships with politicians from Montana to Washington to get it.
So sharp-elbowed were the machinations of Mr. Hill and the other railroad tycoons that President Grover Cleveland initially vetoed the legislation they wanted in 1886, sharply denouncing the efforts of "a class of corporations carrying with them individuals not known for any scrupulous regard for the interest of the Indians."
Mr. Hill raged that the veto was "ridiculous" and drafted his friend William Vilas, the postmaster general, and others to persuade the president, also a friend, to reconsider, which he did. 
Indians and the tribe now own less than 5 percent of the 677,099 acres on the Leech Lake Reservation, and the population is exploding as Indians return to take jobs in casinos or lose welfare benefits and seek tribal assistance. "People are living two or three families to a trailer home or, in the warm weather, in their cars," said Pauline Johnston, director of the Leech Lake land department. "We have no place to put them."
The Hill heirs say their philanthropic efforts are guided as much by a desire to improve the community as they are to make up for their ancestor's past. "I guess you could interpret it as atonement, but I don't really think of it like that," said Louis F. Hill, a great-grandson. "If you're going to be philanthropic, why not be philanthropic in the community that brought you the wealth to begin with? That's what philanthropy traditionally has done."
He noted that other railroads got much larger land grants under the laws and that his grandfather, Louis W. Hill, was adopted by the Blackfoot tribe of Montana, which called him Graybeard, because of his efforts to bring economic development to their reservations.
Land repurchase programs are under way on reservations around the country, but the process is expensive and complicated. And the organizers of the program here recognize that $20 million will not even begin to buy back all the land the Indian Land Tenure Foundation wants to see in Indian hands.
The money will jump-start programs to educate Indians about protecting the land they do own by, for instance, writing wills that specify heirs or putting the land in trust. 
Land acquisition, by far the foundation's boldest goal, will take at least $400 million more and will require innovative private financing techniques. 
Through a series of treaties, the United States set aside 138 million acres in reservations owned by tribes and then almost immediately set about finding ways to get the land into non-Indian hands. Perhaps the most effective of those efforts was the 1887 package of laws. Six of those granted land to the railroads for expansion, and one of the other three, the General Allotment Act, supplied them their customers. 
That act redistributed reservation lands to individual Indians in 40-, 80- and 160-acre parcels that the government was to hold in trust for the new owners. Later, much of the unallocated reservation land was declared "in excess" of Indian needs and opened for development by non-Indian settlers and companies. Those settlers were customers for the railroads.
"Hill benefited, Harriman benefited, the whole series of railroad tycoons benefited from this systematic displacement of Indians from their land and their replacement by European settlers," said Karl Stauber, president of the Northwest Area Foundation, referring to Edward Harriman, one of James Hill's competitors.
Recovering reservation land that has passed into private or public ownership will be a big challenge. The largest block of land on the Leech Lake Reservation is part of Chippewa National Forest, and much of the lakefront property around the reservation's three biggest lakes is in private hands.
Property owners are more and more aware of Indian efforts to regain reservation land, and their asking prices get higher when a tribe shows an interest, Indians in Leech Lake said.
The Leech Lake band's budget for land reclamation this year is $435,000, all it could spare from the $12 million it earned in casino revenues; much of the rest was eaten up by necessities like housing, health care and education. In November, it spent most of the yearly budget to buy 425 acres at $1,000 an acre from a Sioux Indian.
Discrimination also keeps land out of reach. "The land over there on that corner is ours," Ms. Johnston of the Leech Lake land department, said, pointing out plots the band has recovered. "They didn't want to sell to Indians, so we used a white guy who helped us buy it."
Even the land that is in the hands of individual Indians poses problems for the foundation. The Allotment Act, which was shepherded through Congress by Senator Henry Dawes of Massachusetts, a friend of James Hill, gave Indians ownership of parcels of land, but as the land moved into the hands of their offspring, they owned the land collectively unless otherwise spelled out in a will.
"It's like owning a share of stock in a company," said Annabell Kingbird, assistant director of the land department. "In the same way a shareholder can't walk into a company and point to a desk or a computer and say 'that's mine,' an interest holder cannot point to any land and call it his."
Because the concept of private property was traditionally alien to Indians, many of them did not write wills. Left to the discretion of the probate court, ownership of the original allotments has become highly splintered.
Lee Turney's mother, for instance, left no will when she died in 1955. Her estate, four allotments totaling 110 acres, was in probate until the spring of last year. The court divided interest in the land equally among 210 descendants.
Mr. Turney, who lives on land owned by the tribe, holds interests of a little more than a tenth of an acre in each of the four parcels. "There is absolutely nothing I can do with that land, nothing at all," he said.
Even if he wanted to try, he would have to get the approval of a majority of the other 209 owners. "I guess I probably know about 10 of them, and that's being generous," he said. "I wouldn't even want to attempt to do anything. Families have enough divisions without this one."
Della Kingbird's mother used a gift deed to give her daughter an interest representing almost seven acres of an 80 acre parcel. In 1996, Ms. Kingbird got approval from 51 percent of the other owners to build a house on the land -- only to have the largest stakeholder die, voiding the approval process. "I gave up," she said.
She now lives on land adjacent to that plot. Not only did she have to buy it, she pays taxes on it, which she would not have had to do on the land her mother left her. 
Mr. Stainbrook of the Indian Land Tenure Foundation says he believes James Hill would have appreciated the foundation's efforts to end such complexity. 
"In some ways, I don't think James J. Hill would have been against what we're trying to do with his money," Mr. Stainbrook said. "He was always for developing the land in a way that would benefit the region and the country at large, in a way that made it productive, and we're really trying to do the same thing."

HEADLINE: Advocates for Poor Criticize City's Food Stamp Program 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
A processing problem that incorrectly removed nearly 4,000 people from the city's food stamp rolls in November has added fuel to a debate between the city and hunger-relief advocates, who have for months been accusing the Human Resources Administration of discouraging eligible families from receiving food stamps. 
 The number of people receiving food stamps decreased to 825,155 last month, a drop of 10,889 people from October. 
 About 4,000 were incorrectly removed from the rolls because there was not enough staff to process routine recertification paperwork, said David Neustadt, a spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, which runs the federally financed voucher program locally. Mr. Neustadt said he could not explain the rest of the decline. 
News of the processing problem and the general decline in food stamp rolls drew criticism from hunger-relief advocates.
"It is nothing short of amazing that the city even admitted they messed up for one month," said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. He said the city should investigate the cause of the mistake and possibly reprimand the employees responsible.
Mr. Neustadt said an unusual confluence of events, including a wave of early staff buyouts and a particularly high number of people due to have their eligibility certified again, caused the administration to fall behind. He added that no one would be disciplined because of it. A recent change in federal law that forces the city to cut off benefits automatically to anyone who has not been recertified by deadline exacerbated the problem, he said.
The paperwork has now been processed and all those incorrectly removed have been reinstated, Mr. Neustadt said, although there was a gap in benefits in some cases. Those who lost benefits by mistake have been issued replacement benefits.
With the problem fixed and others entering the rolls for the first time, the Human Resources Administration said that it was expecting that the total number of food stamp recipients would rise to 836,152 in December.
The November numbers come as hunger-relief advocates have intensely criticized the city for mishandling the program. They have complained that with unemployment rates at 8 percent, the highest in four years, the number of those receiving food stamps has risen by less than 5 percent over the course of the year. Currently, 800,000 New Yorkers with incomes low enough to qualify for food stamps do not receive them, according to a report released last week by the Community Food Resources Center. 
Hunger-relief advocates and their allies argue that lack of outreach by the city is behind the shortfall. In New York State, only 50 percent of those eligible for the program receive food stamps, according to the most recent reports by the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers the program on a national level. Nationally, the level of participation is 59 percent.
"When that many people who deserve benefits are not getting them, then we have no functional outreach effort," said Bill de Blasio, chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee. He added the problems were not just with informing a larger group about their eligibility, but in making the application process less daunting.
Recently, when the City Council sent undercover investigators to Human Resources Administration offices, it reported that a third were turned away without an application even when they expressly asked for one, a clear violation of the law. "Clearly," Mr. De Blasio said, "there are still a lot of problems with how individuals are treated at H.R.A. centers."
The agency responded that there was currently a $1 million outreach campaign and that it would start two new campaigns next year -- one for immigrants. In addition, the state will give additional training to staff members who handle food stamp applications next year and is likely to cut the 16-page application to two pages.
Mr. Neustadt said the city had conducted more than 1,600 undercover investigations of the agency's offices last year and turned up only 15 cases in which workers had failed to meet legally mandated standards. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 27, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the decrease in the number of people on New York City's food stamp rolls in November misstated the reason the city began automatically cutting off benefits to anyone who had not been recertified by deadline. The federal government recently pushed the city's Human Resources Administration to enforce an existing law; the cause was not a new law.

HEADLINE: Two Cities, Two Immigrant Landings 

 BODY:
The arrival of hundreds of poor immigrants, many without education or English skills, caused great concern in Lewiston, Me., where old-line Yankee residents worried about the town's capacity to absorb the newcomers. Tension was inevitable.
 That was more than a century and a half ago, when Irish refugees from the potato famine came in search of work, quickly followed by a wave of French Canadians who were recruited by the mills to increase production. After a sometimes violent period of getting acquainted, the American model of acceptance and cohabitation -- and eventually intermarriage -- took hold. And that was good for the town, which staked its future on thriving textile mills and shoe factories. 
 Now the descendants of those immigrants are the community pillars, facing their own test of the American way. More than 1,000 black Muslim refugees from civil war, famine and disease in Somalia, many of them originally resettled in the Atlanta area, began arriving in the town of 36,000, unannounced, nearly two years ago. The women wear native dress, and the men gather at a makeshift mosque. Nonetheless, the Somalis have worked to fit into a community that is ambivalent about them. Mayor Laurier Raymond Jr. let the strain show when he used an open letter last fall to plead with his new Somali neighbors to stop the migration.
The mayor has said that he meant no ill will, that he was simply reacting to the depletion of city services. But a point was made, and whether by coincidence or in response, the flow of Somalis to Lewiston has sharply slowed in recent weeks. That may not be good for Lewiston. In the state with the fewest nonwhites and one of the oldest and sparsest populations, Lewiston has shrunk by some 6,000 residents in the last three decades. Its young people, facing newly shuttered factories, have joined a migration from the Northeast. Lewiston enjoys low unemployment, low crime, good schools and affordable housing -- all of which lured the Somalis, who did not like the poor urban neighborhoods they left behind. Half the Somali adults are employed so far. Some are starting small businesses, while others are getting job training and learning English. They are becoming contributing members of the community, just what Lewiston needs.
In New York State, another city found itself in similar straits but has taken a different approach. That city, Schenectady, has lost nearly one-quarter of its population -- going from 80,000 to 62,000 -- since 1960. Its mayor, Albert Jurczynski, the grandson of Polish immigrants, is working to reverse that trend. "We need new blood," he says. So he is recruiting Guyanese living in New York City, 150 miles to the south. On many Saturdays, a bus takes potential resettlers from Queens for a day trip and a sales pitch that touts Schenectady's livability. With his city stronger by some 3,000 Guyanese, the mayor reports that communities are being revitalized, new businesses are opening, and property values are going up for the first time in a dozen years.
The secondary migration of both these groups is not unusual. The Hmong from Laos left Pennsylvania and Minnesota to make a community in the Central Valley of California. Large numbers of Vietnamese came together in Orange County, Calif. Bosnians have gone to Utica, N.Y. These are the Little Italys and Chinatowns of today.
In this new wave, immigrants are finding opportunities away from large cities. Their impact, especially in older, smaller towns, can be enormous and positive. Schenectady sees its future with the Guyanese. And while immigrants like the Somalis need places like Lewiston, places like Lewiston can survive only with immigrants like the Somalis.

For N.Y.U.'s Coach, the Franchise Is Not the Team

BYLINE:  By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Janice Quinn, the New York University women's basketball coach, was drawing a parallel between her team and her new business venture, a Blimpie franchise three blocks from the N.Y.U. campus. The business, like the team, is a start-up enterprise, she said, that will have to be built from the ground up.
 "We have one senior and two juniors on the team," Quinn said the other day between sips of an amaretto coffee at her two-month-old restaurant. "The rest are freshmen who have never played college basketball before and sophomores who didn't get a lot of experience last year." 
 She looked around. "I'm the freshman here," she said. "I try hard not to forget that the team is learning, and it's been good and humbling for me to be in my own new enterprise at the same time, learning as I go."
The Violets were a perfect 6-0 to start the season, capturing the N.Y.U. Tip-Off Tournament last month before losing in overtime to Mount St. Mary's on Dec. 10, their most recent game. They have beaten good teams like SUNY-Brockport, the College of Staten Island and Skidmore.
But Quinn said it was too early in the season to allow herself or her young team, the youngest in her 16 years as coach at N.Y.U., to think about a bid to the N.C.A.A.'s Division III tournament in March.
Experienced or not, this year's team will be measured against her previous ones, and Quinn knows it. After N.Y.U. won a Division III title in 1997, great things were expected from a team that many believed could not compete at an elite level because of the university's academic rigor and the dearth of dormitories. In Quinn's first 15 seasons, the Violets went 326-89, won four University Athletic Association titles and made eight trips to the national Round of 16, four times reaching the quarterfinals and twice the semifinals.
As with the Blimpie business, Quinn is learning something new about the Violets every day and making adjustments as she goes along.
"We literally have to plan their routine for them: when to show up at the gym, how to get ready for a game, how to sit on the bench," she said with a shrug and a smile. "You can take for granted that this is game-day routine, but it's not routine if they haven't done it before."
Everything has to be taught to freshmen accustomed to playing at home in their high school gymnasiums: how to break a 1-3-1 or 2-2-1 press, how to get out of a trap; what to expect from opponents and fans on the road. 
By way of example, Quinn shared an anecdote: "We had a great game against the College of Staten Island and I was talking to the kids the day before and said: 'They're going to come at us hard. You know how hard it is to play at C.S.I.' The kids all had this strange look on their faces, and Allison Herman, my senior, said, 'Coach, actually no one has played there before.' Herman said she had mononucleosis when we played Staten Island her sophomore year."
So far, the Violets are winning with defense, defensive rebounding and their transition game. Quinn has a 3-point shooter in guard Lauren D'Ambrosio, a 5-foot-7 senior who sat out the last two years, and a versatile on-and-off-court leader in Herman, a 5-11 guard/forward who led the team last season in rebounding (8.9 a game) and blocked shots (56) and was third in scoring (12.0 points a game).
Quinn, a former star player at N.Y.U., has a master's degree in finance and management from the Wagner School of Public Service there. Her career path took her toward athletics, but starting a business has for years danced in her head like visions of sugarplums.
A year ago, a clothing store five blocks from the Coles Sports Center closed, and Quinn saw an opportunity realized.
"I've worked and lived in this community for 20 years," she said. "I eat here and know what it's like to look for choices in food. I thought of Blimpie's because you can't find anything more down to earth than a Blimpie's sandwich."
She turned to an old friend, her former N.Y.U. coach, Sherri Pickard, for help. Pickard was living in Wilmington, N.C., working on a project for the local firefighters' union and doing some investing on her own, when Quinn called.
"It was last September or October," Pickard recalled as she poured herself a cup of coffee at the store. "I had a nice, simple, uncomplicated Southern life. Then Janice called and said she was going to start a business and asked if I was interested. I said: 'Not really. I doubt it. Probably not.' But she recruited me."
Quinn plans to leave the daily operations to Pickard while focusing on her day job: coaching. Pickard, a former standout at the University of North Carolina with master's degrees in economics and accounting, describes herself as the bottom line person in the partnership. All "that other nice stuff" is Quinn, she said.
Having opened the Blimpie's doors in October, Quinn knows it is too soon to think about profit margins and expansion, not when three of five new business ventures in New York State fail in the first year of operation.
"Success was getting the business plan together, then getting the funding and putting the deal together," Quinn said. "Getting the doors open was a huge step. We are now deeply entrenched in the third phase, which is to survive the first year."
As former athletes and coaches, Quinn and Pickard bring realism to the business.
"A whole lot of it comes down to the fact that we refuse to lose," Pickard said. "The competitive spirit. In coaching, when you see something going on that you didn't anticipate, you can be hardheaded and stick with the game plan, or back up, reassess and make a change. We've had to do a lot of that. Janice had to do a lot of that to get to the point."
Quinn nodded in agreement, then said with a laugh: "You don't know how often we've said, 'Well, now we know.' "

HEADLINE: Nothing Under the Tree? Those Low on Cash Go to the Pawnshop 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
With only a few shopping hours left until Christmas, Michelle Kone dashed up to the bulletproof glass at Citi Pawn in the Bronx.
 Ms. Kone, 38, slid a small envelope bulging with gold bracelets, earrings and necklaces under the window. Without looking up, the pawnbroker quickly tested the gold and divided it into two piles: 12-karat and 24-karat. Then he weighed them separately, slapped the jewelry back down on the counter and yelled a number through the slide-through cutout: $265. 
 Ms. Kone smiled. "I'll take it," she said. "The last place offered me 200."
Citi Pawn on East 149th Street is one of a handful of pawnshops that thrive on the fringes of the bustling Bronx shopping area known as the Hub. This holiday season, the shops are reporting long lines of people anxious for cash to buy gifts.
Yesterday, on the busy streets of the Hub that line Third Avenue for several blocks north of 149th Street, throngs of shoppers took advantage of the mild temperatures to look for last-minute bargains in the cavernous stores with names like Mr. Discount, Save-A-Thon, Perfumania, Jimmy Jazz and Loco John.
At Conway, a discount store, customers waited at cashier lines with shopping carts full of toys. One of them, Victor Gonzalez, 33, said he had done all his shopping that day, spending $300 on gifts for his children.
"See this?" he said, holding up a doll set. "Yesterday they had it for $75. I got it today for $60."
But for some, it would take more than price cuts to make Christmas possible. They needed cash. So they lined up at local pawnshops carrying laptops, stereos, guitars and power tools. At one shop on East 149th Street, a 20-year-old student from the Bronx who gave her name only as Aisha pawned a gold chain for $30 so she could buy a gift for her 3-month-old son.
"It's an especially busy season this year," said Gerald Modell, president of the Collateral Loan Brokers Association of New York and the owner of four city pawnshops.
"The economy is down and many people have lost their jobs and need cash," he added. "People get into difficult situations and say: 'It's Christmas Eve, and I need $1,000. Where am I going to get it?' You can't go to your friends."
Mr. Modell, whose family owns the Modell's chain of sporting goods stores, called pawnshops "the poor man's bank."
Mr. Modell said there were probably fewer than 50 pawnshops left in New York City. Most charge a processing fee of $3 to $5 per transaction and a monthly interest rate of 3 percent. The pawner is typically given four or five months to reclaim the item.
Pawnshops, he added, are not just for the poor. "We service people who may not get their bonus or salary check until after Christmas," he said. "Also, you have rich people who pawn big diamonds for whatever reason. Maybe they're maxed out on their credit cards, or their taxes, or college tuitions. We don't ask why."
Blaine Messinger, who owns N.Y. Pawnbrokers on East 149th Street, said that more shoppers were pawning items for quick cash this year than in the past. "Where else can you do this?" he said. "You can't go to a bank and ask to borrow $200 for Christmas shopping."
Mr. Messinger said about 90 percent of his customers wind up redeeming their property. When jewelry is brought in for a loan, it is tested for authenticity, weighed and then appraised, according to the current daily market price. Appraisers then offer to lend the owner about 40 percent of that value.
Not everyone at the pawnshops was looking for a loan. Some, like William Marcano, 63, were looking for bargains. Yesterday afternoon, he gazed in the window of N.Y. Pawnbrokers at gyrating toy Santas. Swaying like hula dancers, the dolls flaunted shiny gold chains, bracelets and watches.
Mr. Marcano, a retired truck driver from the Bronx, looked at these items, and at the trays of gold earrings. He said he preferred buying jewelry in pawnshops because of the discounts.
He had just received his monthly Social Security check in the mail and cashed it, for $749. He planned to spend about $500 of it on jewelry for his girlfriend and gifts for his children.
"You've got to make everyone happy," he said.
But Ms. Kone's story was perhaps more typical. She had spent the morning thinking in her Bronx apartment, a block from Yankee Stadium, and decided that her four children deserved Christmas presents, even though she had no job and no money. She scooped up her gold jewelry and headed out the door.
She said that she had lost her job in April as an administrator at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Upper Manhattan and that bureaucratic problems have prevented her from getting many of her unemployment checks.
Since then, she has made four separate trips to pawn several thousand dollars' worth of gold, silver and diamonds, she said. Each time she has defaulted on the loan and lost the property to the pawnbroker.
Yesterday, she took the cash and hurried out of the shop and toward the Hub's discount stores. She stopped at Crazy Sounds, an electronics store, bought three portable CD players for $20 each.
"It's a start," she said. "You can't put a price on saving Christmas for the little ones."

TOY RETAILER TO CLOSE70 ZANY BRAINY STORES

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The troubled toy retailer FAO Inc. will close 70 underperforming stores by March as it attempts to return to profitability. 
The company said 55 of the stores to close would be Zany Brainy stores, which sell educational toys. FAO, which is based in King of Prussia, Pa., near Philadelphia, also owns F. A. O. Schwarz and the Right Stuff. The retailer operates 253 stores. It was not clear how many employees would be affected by the closures. FAO also said it has reached a "standstill agreement" with a syndicate of its lending banks that could postpone bankruptcy.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 31, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A headline in the Company News column of Business Day on Wednesday about plans by FAO Inc., the toy retailer, to close underperforming stores misstated the number of Zany Brainy outlets affected. It is 55 (70 is the total to be closed).

HEADLINE: Wine Prices Drop Sharply, A Good Reason for Cheer 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER

 BODY:
WHILE it has not been the best time to travel, invest in the stock market or indulge in truffles, there has never been a better time to buy and drink wine.
 After years of price inflation sent retail price tags of little-known wines soaring and the cost of wines by the glass well into the double digits, prices of wines have begun spiraling downward. 
 "Never in my lifetime have I seen so much great wine available at such a fair price," said Joshua Wesson, the president of Best Cellars, a wine chain. "There are great deals from just about any country that wine is made."
John McClement, the wine director at Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan, explained: "There's a glut of wine on the market, allocations aren't as hard to come by and the prices keep coming down." 
This means that the Raymond Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, 1999, which Mr. McClement sold for $75 last year, is now $53. At Astor Wines and Spirits in Greenwich Village, the Laurent-Perrier Champagne, Grand Siecle, which was selling for $129.99 last year, has been slashed to $64.99. And at Chanterelle, in TriBeCa, the 1998 Chateau Fourcas-Hosten, which was $39 on the menu, is now $30. 
"I think a lot of people aren't admitting what's happening," Karen King, the wine director at Union Square Cafe in Manhattan, said, "because the minute you admit it, it's true."
Fluctuation in the market for wine, which is at base an agriculture product like carrots or rice, is typical. What is unusual about the current situation is that it is not simply a reflection of a shift in the economy or the weather. It is also the result of bad decisions. "All these people thought that there would be this arc upward of consumption," Mr. Wesson said of wine sales. "And although it's grown modestly in the United States, worldwide it's flat." 
During the economic boom of the late 1990's, when pricey cult wines were often as difficult to acquire as an Hermes Kelly bag, winemakers, particularly in California, bet on the future with great optimism and exuberance. In 1996, said Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Wine Grape Growers, there were 311,329 acres of wine vineyards. By 2001 the state's estimate was 570,000 acres. 
"Now," Mr. Wesson said, "a lot of producers are freaking out. They've planted all of these grapes and they don't know what to do with them."
California is being hit the hardest at the low end and high end of the market. Growers for the jug wine industry have largely overplanted, and are now watching the value of their grape crops tumble. 
Christian Miller, the director of research at Motto Kryla & Fisher, a consulting company that specializes in the wine industry, said the situation in the south Central Valley of California, where many of these grapes are grown, was so bad that growers are ripping out vineyards and replanting them with alternative crops like alfalfa and almonds or none at all, sometimes selling their land to developers. 
In the fine-wine market, there are simply too many players and not enough consumers willing to pay $100 for a bottle of wine. 
"The shakeout is going to be at the grower end first," Ms. Ross said. "It's been more than a decade since we saw major bankruptcies. People are anticipating that we're going to see that happening again."
Last month Sonoma Creek Winery, in Sonoma, Calif., filed for Chapter 11, seeking bankruptcy protection from creditors while it reorganized its finances.
Right now, many wineries have stocks of grapes packed to the rafters and their main goal is to unload the inventories before the new vintage comes in. So between now and the spring, when many vintages are released, may be a great time to buy. 
Even in some restaurants, where it never feels like you're getting a deal, you can enjoy wines that would not previously have been offered. At Keens Steakhouse, for instance, where wines by the glass are not priced higher than $9.75, the restaurant is now offering 1998 Markham Merlot Reserve for that price. A year ago, Mr. McClement said, he would have had to have charged $13 a glass.
Similarly at Restaurant Daniel in Midtown, there is a 1999 Marc Morey Chassagne-Montrachet, Les Virondots, for $23 a glass. Two years ago, Jean Luc Le Du, the restaurant's sommelier, said, he could not sell it by the glass because he would have had to charge $30. It has dropped in cost by as much as 35 to 40 percent a case. 
When California's cult wines got out of control a few years ago, many sommeliers began looking to Europe and Australia for reasonable prices. And they have continued to. Roger Dagorn, the wine director at Chanterelle, has found good buys in France. A few weeks ago, he was able to lower the price on the 2000 Olivier Leflaive St.-Auban on his menu to $50 from $60. 
Karen King, Union Square Cafe's wine director, has found great values in Spanish wines. "Portugal," she said, "forget it. There are going to be really good values over the next few years. It's going to be the next frontier."
In 2002, Ms. Ross of the Wine Grape Growers Association added, imported wines are expected to make up nearly 22 percent of the American wine market. Six years ago, they took up only around 17 percent.
Small wine retailers say they are not getting the best bargains because good wineries prefer to sell exclusively through restaurants, which are considered better marketing platforms for fine wines, or through large warehouse clubs, which can promise high volume. 
Earlier this year, for instance, the Bronco Wine Company, a wine conglomerate based in Ceres, Calif., began selling Charles Shaw's Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot at Trader Joe's for $1.99 a bottle. 
Jon Fredrikson, a wine industry analyst, said that the store was likely to sell a million cases in California this year. "People are going into these Trader Joe's where it's sold on an exclusive basis and buying 6 to 10 cases at a time," Mr. Fredrikson said. "That's cheaper than Pellegrino." Not quite. But close.
Jimmy Bradley, an owner of the Red Cat and the Harrison restaurants in Manhattan, is considering applying a similar tactic at the Mermaid Inn, which is opening in the East Village this February. 
He may mark up all wines just $10, he said, a radical move considering that most wines are marked up two or three times the cost. "I'm under the impression that the value in that will lead them to order more wine and come back more often," he said.
It's not that people aren't buying wine -- sales volume is up 6 percent for the first half of 2002, according to Motto Kryla & Fisher -- they are just buying differently. Chris Shipley, wine director at the "21" Club said: "I have a friend who coined the expression 'competitive spenders.' They're still out there but they've had their wings clipped a bit."
Mr. McClement added: "What might have been someone coming in and ordering a Harlan Estate at over $300 a bottle, they'll now come in and order two $90 bottles." 
Ms. King has found the same at Union Square Cafe. Wine sales are up over last year but, she pointed out, "Last Friday we put on Turley Zinfandel, Hayne Vineyard, 2000, and normally that would be selling like crazy and be gone in a week, and I just checked and we've only sold one bottle."
Many experts believe that prices on California wines will go lower. An excess of vineyards, Ms. Ross said, "starts to dampen the price for grapes, so eventually consumers will start to see more competitive pricing."
In the meantime, why not toast to a little certainty.

HEADLINE: The Shame of Norway 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As "A Nation That Exports Oil, Herring and Peace" (news article, Dec. 21) points out, Norway has become a very positive force in terms of promoting peace agreements between other countries. 
 However, Norway's identity as a good world neighbor continues to be tarnished by its selfish insistence on continuing to hunt whales. 
Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993, flouting a moratorium established by the International Whaling Commission in 1986 in response to seriously dwindling whale populations. There is simply no excuse for continuing to hunt a species that faces the real possibility of extinction. 
 There is certainly no economic need for Norway's stance when, as you point out, its per capita gross domestic product is among the highest in the world. 
Here's hoping that Norway will come to see the error of its ways regarding whale hunting.

HEADLINE: Arts Advocacy Group Ponders Its Good Fortune 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
A low-profile arts advocacy group is pondering the delightful question of what to do with a sudden windfall of $120 million.
 Americans for the Arts, which helps local arts councils lobby for money and support, received the money in November from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly. Ms. Lilly also made a comparable gift to Poetry magazine. 
 "I have to think that with these additional resources, we can make a monumental difference," said Robert L. Lynch, the arts group's president. 
In recent weeks Mr. Lynch has sent 3,000 questionnaires to members and supporters asking what they think the group should do with its new treasure. In January it will hold a series of focus groups and individual interviews with arts administrators, public officials and donors. Then in February board members will go on a retreat to discuss their suddenly brightened prospects.
Mr. Lynch said that he expected to introduce a new agenda for the group at its next annual meeting, scheduled for June in Portland, Ore.
About 800 questionnaires have already been returned, and Mr. Lynch said most ask the group to do more of what it has already done.
Ms. Lilly's donation will arrive in several streams, including lump sum payments and long-term income over the next 30 years. Mr. Lynch said that almost all of it will be placed in an endowment, from which the organization will draw interest of $6 million to $7 million each year. That will nearly double its present budget.
"Our goal is access to the arts for all Americans, the opportunity for every American to connect with the arts," he said. "The way we hope to achieve that is by putting facts and information in the hands of decision-makers."
Americans for the Arts has a lobbyist on its staff in Washington. It also trains arts advocates around the country, gives them the tools they need to press their case and prepares public relations campaigns to support their efforts. Most of its financing comes from arts councils that pay dues, from foundations and private donors and from the proceeds of conferences and book sales. 
Last year Americans for the Arts issued a report called "Arts and Economic Prosperity," which surveyed the impact that arts and cultural programs can have in dealing with challenges ranging from neighborhood decay to juvenile crime. Mr. Lynch said its member groups, most of which are local arts councils, found the report highly useful.
"They can use as much data and facts as we can give them to help them explain the value of arts and arts education," he said. "We're talking about hard numbers that relate to the economic and practical effect of cultural districts, cultural tourism and arts education. When we talk to mayors, they're interested first of all in jobs and the economy, and then in things like education, crime, health, social problems and infrastructure. Our job is to show them how spending money on the arts can help them deal with those challenges in a very practical way."
That is not an easy sell. Many public officials view cultural programs as a frill, and cut them when budgets are tight. This year, for example, the Massachusetts Cultural Council's budget was cut by 62 percent and the California Arts Council's was cut by 41 percent.
As part of its effort to promote local arts initiatives, Americans for the Arts holds an annual banquet at which it honors public officials who have used culture-related projects to help revitalize communities. Recent recipients have included Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut.
Mr. Lynch said the questionnaires he has reviewed so far express not only a desire for more information about the impact of arts programs, but also better training in lobbying techniques and more public-service advertising in support of the arts.
Ms. Lilly's donation, like the one to Poetry magazine, is designed in complex ways that have taken lawyers and other experts several weeks to decipher. Some of the money is in stocks and trusts that must be converted to cash, and it is to be disbursed according to a complicated timetable.
In a statement issued on Dec. 17, the arts group said it expected the donation to total more than $120 million. That will make it somewhat smaller than the one to Poetry, which the magazine's editor, Joseph Parisi, said could ultimately reach or exceed $150 million.
"It's the first time I can think of that a grant like this has been made to what we call an arts service organization, rather than to something like a museum or a performing arts center," said Janet Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council in White Plains, one of the many local councils that work with Americans for the Arts. "This is a signal that there are people in the country who really do care about seeing to it that there is a national arts presence and that we have the funds to advocate for it."
Ms. Lilly, who is 87 and infirm, is an heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune. Although she had made several donations to Americans for the Arts before, none were especially large. She has, however, made substantial contributions to cultural institutions in Indianapolis, her hometown, and evidently wanted to do the same on a nationwide basis.
Ms. Lilly's donation caps a period of astonishing growth in the number of local arts councils, which distribute funds to performing and visual artists and arts organizations in individual communities. Mr. Lynch said the first were founded in 1949 in three American towns -- Quincy, Ill., Winston-Salem, N. C. and Canon City, Colo. -- where people decided they wanted to bring culture to their communities instead of traveling to big cities to experience it. Now there are more than 4,000 such councils. Their members were instrumental in creating the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965 and in blocking several Congressional efforts to abolish it.
There has been a similar growth in the number of nonprofit arts groups, which range from some involved in political advocacy to others with special missions like presenting theatrical performances or arranging partnerships between museums and public schools. Mr. Lynch estimated that there were 7,000 such groups in the United States in 1965 and that there are 50,000 today.

HEADLINE: China Airlines Confirms Plane Purchases 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
China Airlines, the government-controlled carrier of Taiwan, confirmed today that it had concluded large contracts to buy jets from both Airbus and Boeing, but said the financial weakness of other airlines had allowed it to secure deep discounts.
 China Airlines agreed to buy 10 long-range Boeing 747-400's and 12 medium-range Airbus A330-300's, with options to acquire 6 more of the Airbus A330's, the company said, confirming figures that it had released in October. At list price, the Boeings would be worth $2 billion and the smaller Airbus planes would be worth $1.7 billion, or $2.5 billion if the options are exercised. 
 But Roger Han, a spokesman for China Airlines, said that his company would actually pay considerably less, having bargained aggressively at a time when many other airlines are in financial difficulty and deferring or canceling orders for new aircraft. 
"Our transaction price is much, much lower than the list price," Mr. Han said, declining to be more specific. "There were some big discounts because right now the market competition favors airlines."
Part of the discount for China Airlines, Mr. Han said, lay in promises by Airbus and Boeing to help the airline dispose of many of its current Airbus and Boeing jets as they are replaced by the new planes.
It is rare for the participants in aircraft deals to talk publicly about the terms. Indeed, Airbus and Boeing have policies against doing so and said nothing about the details of today's transaction. But the China Airlines deal comes after considerable wrangling, political as well as commercial, and China Airlines has had to fight suspicions in Taiwan in particular that it is overpaying for the Boeing jets to help preserve Taiwan's military alliance with the United States.
China Airlines came close last summer to buying exclusively Airbus jets, after Boeing quoted prices that the airline regarded as uncompetitive. That provoked strenuous lobbying by the Bush administration and by members of Congress, especially from Washington state.
Boeing still builds many of its commercial airliners in the state, but has been struggling for new orders to keep its factories full because of the combination of the global economic slowdown and the attacks of Sept. 11, which have depressed air travel in many markets and left some airlines with little need for more planes.
American officials reminded Taiwan of the island's continued dependence on military protection from the United States against any possible attack by China, and Taiwan's reliance on purchasing weapons from the United States at a time when many other countries refuse to do business with it for fear of offending Beijing.
The lobbying was controversial in Taiwan, where several years of economic stagnation have produced a focus on economic issues over traditional security concerns. Many Taiwanese now view closer economic relations with the mainland as the best way to regain prosperity on their island, and this has made them somewhat less enthusiastic about close ties to the United States.
Boeing also noted in its sales effort that the 747-400 had a slightly longer range with a full cargo than its long-haul rival, the Airbus A340. Range and cargo capacity were important because one of China Airlines' biggest markets is in carrying the flood of computer chips and other products from Taiwan's high-tech industries to American cities that are 13 to 15 hours away by air.
Boeing welcomed the sale of the 747-400's, saying today in a statement that it was the largest deal this year for the intercontinental model. Mr. Han said that three of the jets would be freighters and were scheduled for delivery next year. Six passenger versions of the huge airplane are to be delivered from 2004 to 2006, along with a fourth cargo jet.
But today's deal appeared to offer no immediate benefit for Boeing investors, as the company said that it had earlier begun counting the 747-400's in its inventory of orders. The planes for China Airlines had previously been labeled as going to an unidentified customer, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: Japan Has No Shortage of Advice on Banks' Woes 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Japanese policy makers have never been at a loss for ideas on how to clean up the nation's debt-laden banks. College professors, bank analysts and authors are forever offering opinions in newspapers and on television.
 But in recent months, several international agencies have also raised loud alarm bells. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for instance, recently said Japan's banks needed more taxpayer money to survive. 
 Add the International Monetary Fund to the list. The fund is in the middle of a yearlong inspection of Japan's banks that some hope will shed light on the problem of bad loans here. Sayuri Shirai, a former I.M.F. economist with connections to her old employer, said the report, scheduled for next summer, would prove that several banks do not meet international capital standards.
After years of frightening warnings, though, the question is what impact these findings may have. Lawmakers and, to a large degree, the public have become so hardened to predictions of the financial system's demise that they tune out much of the advice, including some helpful ideas.
Complicating matters, the suggestions are often hurled by foreigners who are suspected of having ulterior motives. American bankers are often portrayed in the local media as vultures who swoop down on embattled Japanese companies, buy assets on the cheap and put Japanese employees out of work. Politicians stumping for votes routinely accuse Westerners and their Japanese sympathizers of financial imperialism.
More often than not, then, foreign advice, however useful, ends up fueling existing prejudices. The I.M.F. report may bolster reformers like Heizo Takenaka, Japan's financial czar whose plan to clean up the banking system has been diluted. Yet conservative lawmakers eager to maintain the status quo also may use the report to scare voters into opposing any radical reforms.
"The reaction goes both ways," said Michael Petit, the chief criteria officer at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo whose own credit reports have been volleyed around for political purposes. "Takenaka may try to use the international support, but the forces inside the government are ultimately the ones who say what gets decided."
As a practical matter, the I.M.F. report will have no binding impact. Unlike Russia, Argentina or Brazil, Japan has no foreign debts or loans from the fund. The country runs a huge trade surplus and has more than $400 billion in foreign currency reserves, so it can defend itself ably from speculators. Japan is also a leading contributor to the I.M.F.
But unlike reports by other international agencies and private banks, the I.M.F. report will be done in conjunction with Japan's Financial Services Agency in one part of the report. The two sides will compile a "stress test" that will simulate various models, including the impact on the banks of a stock market crash. The participation of government regulators will make it hard for policy makers to deny all the report's findings.
"Of course, people might say it is just the I.M.F. talking," said Ms. Shirai, who now teaches at Keio University and has recently written a book, "Megabank Crises and I.M.F. Economic Policy."
"Some politicians will oppose the report, but they can't complain because it has been approved by the government," she said.

HEADLINE: India Is Regaining Contracts With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
After slowing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outsourcing by American companies to Indian concerns or to their own Indian units has begun to pick up.
 The new contracts span the technology-related spectrum, going well beyond the software code writing of the last decade to include chip design, product development, call centers, consulting and other support services. They give Indian companies the opportunity to expand their repertory with work that holds much promise for future growth. And they account for a significant chunk of business in India, especially here in Bangalore and the country's other high-technology cities. 
 In just the last few months, dozens of Indian concerns have garnered contracts from big American companies to take over pieces of their operations. A unit of the Bangalore-based Wipro, India's third-largest software and services exporter, will be handling some of the worldwide reservation services for Delta Air Lines, a move that Delta expects will save $12 million to $15 million annually. 
India's top software company, Tata Consultancy Services, or T.C.S., part of India's Tata conglomerate, has signed up Lehman Brothers -- in a $70 million-a-year deal shared with Wipro -- as well as J. P. Morgan Chase, Fidelity Investments and GE Medical Systems. The local unit of Cognizant Technology Solutions, a custom software developer and services provider in Teaneck, N.J., has contracts for projects from MetLife, to upgrade its human resources administration system and streamline some computer applications, and from the UnitedHealth Group and Sallie Mae, the student loan provider.
For the American companies, which account for more than two-thirds of the work coming to India, the country has several advantages. Though wages in India have been rising, they still tend to be much lower than in the United States. That is particularly attractive in the current global economy, cost-sensitive executives say, as they follow the outsourcing path set in the early 1990's by technology companies from Silicon Valley seeking cheaper software coding operations.
India also has a large, well-educated, English-speaking work force with one of the world's largest clusters of engineers and programmers.
Even Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is widely revered here, has given his imprimatur. "A couple of years ago, the biggest American corporations would have considered it risky to outsource mission-critical work to India, but it is now becoming a common-sense proposition," Mr. Gates said on a visit to Bangalore last month.
Microsoft is expanding its development center in the high-tech city of Hyderabad and is outsourcing some back office work to Wipro.
The software and back-office services outsourcing is one of India's fastest-growing businesses. In the year ended March 31, it accounted for nearly 3 percent of India's gross domestic product, up from 0.3 percent three years earlier, and is expected to increase to 7 percent in 2008. It has also contributed substantially to the country's healthy state of foreign exchange reserves in recent years.
According to Gartner Inc., a research firm based in Stamford, Conn., India is leading the world in offshore outsourcing services, with annual revenue of $8 billion, and outsourced projects from American companies to Indian concerns will become increasingly common.
Gartner has, however, warned that American companies that rush into outsourcing deals with Indian companies solely to cut costs are usually soon in trouble and that India's competitive edge over places like China could vanish if India does not continue to upgrade the infrastructure and stay on top of quality control.
India's three top software exporters -- Wipro, T.C.S. and Infosys Technologies -- said that with the post-Sept. 11 lull ended, they are busy fending off Irish, Philippine and other competitors. But they think they have the global edge.
"No country is able to offer the cost-to-quality advantage and scaling up opportunities that India does," said N. G. Subramaniam, T.C.S.'s vice president. Companies that start with a few dozen people in a pilot project could increase to thousands in a matter of months, he said.
Many also have been working toward becoming one-stop shops. "Early Indian services companies typically gained backdoor entry as code cutters but moved up the value chain to take on strategic parts of the client's business," said Vivek Paul, vice chairman of Wipro. For instance, he said, his company's first task for Home Depot was to maintain applications, but Wipro moved up by writing software to run computerized tasks and maintaining it in all Home Depot outlets.
As the scope of work farmed out to India has broadened, so has the spectrum of American companies doing the outsourcing. Companies in the credit card, insurance and financial services industries were among the first, in the early 1990's, but new converts include even some older, highly regulated industries like utilities.
Back-office and information technology service operations, like processing employee payrolls or fielding phone calls from customers, are now moving to India at an even brisker pace than outsourced software projects. Acknowledging the influx, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the industry trade group known as Nasscom, has raised its projections for the country's back-office services industry to $21 billion, from $17 billion, by 2008.
Software companies like Wipro and Satyam Computer Services, meanwhile, are taking on the big consulting firms for large-scale consulting deals.
The mostly back-office and services jobs have been flooding across India, beyond the high-tech hot spots and into big cities like Delhi and Bombay, even as American companies continue to announce layoffs. That has spurred some criticism in the United States. Recently, when New Jersey state senator Shirley K. Turner discovered that a welfare and food stamp contractor had moved its customer service center to Bombay from Wisconsin, she sponsored a bill to require that workers on state contracts be American citizens, or legal aliens, or have some specialty for which such workers cannot be found. The bill was approved this month and forwarded to the state Assembly.
Back in India, outsourcing companies have been busy recruiting. One, ICICI oneSource, a Bangalore-based back-office concern owned by the Indian financial services giant ICICI Group, has attracted thousands of young "customer jockey" hopefuls for its call center with ads in the local newspapers saying "The C.J. Hunt is on!"
Such jobs are changing the lives of the thousands of young, urban men and women who fill the positions, toiling largely at night, synchronizing their work schedules with Americans halfway across the globe.
Saranya Sukumaran, 21, who is just out of college and three months into her first job, takes home 10,000 rupees, or just over $200, a month from her job on the help desk at the local unit of an American Internet service provider in a country where nearly half the population survives on less than $1 a day. From 10:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. five days a week, and calling herself Sharon "no last name," she responds to calls that have been routed to Bangalore. The money enables her to help her father, a junior official with the state-owned phone company who earns 15,000 rupees a month, support the household.
It also allows her to grab a $1 coffee at the hip cafes dotting Bangalore and splurge on luxuries like Levi's jeans and a Nokia cellphone.
"As a teenager I wished for so many things," she said. "Now I'm my own Santa Claus."

Economic Report Gives Equities a Reason to Retreat

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A tepid durable-goods report put pressure on Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks modestly lower as investors perceived little hope of a strengthening economy anytime soon. 
 Volume was light the day before Christmas; the stock markets are closed today for the holiday; they will reopen tomorrow. 
 "The durable goods orders really took the cheer out of the holiday," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "It suggests the corporate earnings that people had hoped would firm up is not." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 8,448.11, for a two-day loss of 63 points. 
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.22 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,372.47. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 892.47. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders to factories for bigticket goods fell 1.4 percent in November. Economists were expecting an increase of 0.8 percent. 
Analysts say investors are concerned that holiday retail sales have been sluggish. They add that the market's traditional rally on optimism for the coming year is in question because of concerns about a war with Iraq and doubts about the economy. 
Still, some investors think that 2003 offers better market prospects, particularly if a Republican-controlled Congress passes business-friendly tax cuts. 
"Over the longer term for next year, we do think the economy can continue to expand," said Kevin Caron, a market strategist at Ryan, Beck & Company. 
Share prices should rally, Mr. Caron said, if "we get a resolution in Iraq," and the new tax package in Washington. 
Shares in the retailer Target dropped 36 cents, to $28.18, after the company reported that its sales fell below estimates. 
Ultimate Electronics fell $1.57, to $9.48, after the operator of consumer electronic stores lowered its fourth-quarter outlook, citing sluggish holiday sales. 
Gainers included Sun Microsystems, which rose 17 cents, to $3.13, after a federal judge ordered Microsoft to distribute Sun's Java programming in Microsoft's operating system, pending the outcome of Sun's private antitrust suit. Microsoft dropped 18 cents, to $53.82. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after an unexpected decline in durable goods orders indicated the economic expansion may be weakening. 
Benchmark 10-year note yields fell as the government report prompted some investors to bet that the Federal Reserve would wait until at least the second half of next year to raise interest rates. 
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32 , to 100 16/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.94 percent, from 3.97 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 107 24/32 . The note's yield fell to 4.87 percent, from 4.90 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Moves Ahead On Tightening Security Laws 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
The government here ended a public comment period today on plans for tough internal security laws, including a ban on the mere possession of "seditious" publications, brushing aside objections from businesses, human rights groups and foreign governments. 
 The government said it would introduce legislation as soon as practicable, with the goal of winning final passage by July. However, the government indicated that adjustments would be made to its plans based on the public comments that have been received. 
 Timothy Tong, Hong Kong's acting secretary of security, said tonight that while officials were aware of polls showing that up to 70 percent of the residents here had a negative view of the plans, they would still start the legislative process by February. 
"Hong Kong, being an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, has both moral and constitutional obligations to protect national security," he said at a news conference.
Yet after receiving more than 90,000 comments on the proposal, government officials are likely to revise some provisions, Mr. Tong said.
"We will consider how best we can improve on our proposals and allay as far as possible worries raised by different sectors, such as those over the possession of seditious publications, increased police powers and unauthorized access to protected information." he said. "We believe there will be some adjustments to our proposals in the light of the views received."
Britain handed over this territory to China in 1997 after receiving a promise, enshrined in the territory's Basic Law, that China would respect Hong Kong's separate legal and economic systems for at least 50 years under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
But the Basic Law also contains a provision, Article 23, that requires new internal security laws after the handover.
A wide range of critics, from the American Chamber of Commerce to Amnesty International to the European Parliament, as well as democracy advocates here, had urged the government to issue a draft text of the legislation for public comment before asking the Legislative Council to take up the issue. The critics complained of ambiguities in the so-called consultation document in which the government outlined its plans.
"The government spent four years to draft that consultation document but has only given us two months to look at it," said Bella Luk, the director of the Hong Kong section of Amnesty International, which also petitioned unsuccessfully today for an extension of the comment period.
An additional period of public comment for a draft text of the legislation would give opponents another chance to oppose provisions like one that would allow even fairly junior police commanders to order searches and seizures without a warrant in security cases, and another that lengthens prison sentences and increases fines for sedition.
Banks and other businesses have been particularly alarmed by proposals for stringent penalties for the unauthorized release of government information, fearing that, as on the mainland, such a provision could be used to inhibit free speech about economic indicators or even the financial health of Chinese state-owned enterprises. Mr. Tong said that this concern would receive attention and might prompt revisions.
The government here has repeatedly pointed out that its proposal would actually narrow the grounds on which residents and foreigners could be tried for some offenses. Hong Kong already has fairly stringent security laws on its books. 
Mr. Tong said tonight that the executive branch here would proceed with its original plan to send the new internal security laws directly to the Legislative Council in February as a so-called blue bill, which discourages filibusters and amendments.
The bill would go through numerous hearings, but under the rules, the Legislative Council would be compelled to vote on the bill before adjourning in July. The measure is expected to pass.
Some Chinese nationalists here have embraced the government's proposal, contending that the laws will help make sure that Chinese rule over Hong Kong is never threatened.
They also contend that recent American antiterrorism efforts show that Hong Kong's efforts are part of an international trend toward balancing respect for civil rights with security worries.
"You need a lock for your door to prevent a thief from breaking in," said Ma Lik, the secretary general of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing political party.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Fire Destroys More Than a Mixed-Use Project

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 18 

 BODY:
The town houses, seated on a $10 million platform atop spaces leased to restaurateurs and retailers, looked complete. Inside, the insulation was in place, but the sprinkler system was not, nor was the drywall.
 City officials have not issued a report on how the Aug. 19 fire started, though they have said that it was the costliest in San Jose's history. Flames destroyed more than 100 apartments and town houses at Santana Row, an upscale mixed-use development by the Federal Realty Investment Trust that was a month short of its formal opening. 
 Steven J. Guttman, chief executive of the REIT, said he saw smoke and called 911. "They say they were here in two minutes, but it felt like the longest two minutes of my life." 
The fire delayed the opening of Santana Row, but its effects on the development -- and its cash flow -- left Wall Street analysts who had questioned Mr. Guttman's stewardship of Federal Realty feeling vindicated.
They had repeatedly assailed the project, saying that the company concentrated far too many resources and assets in one place.
The circumstances that put Mr. Guttman in a position to build Santana Row, and the price he has paid for his ambitious decisions, demonstrate the obstacles to creating the kind of large-scale, mixed-use projects, influenced by the new urbanism philosophy, that many cities desire.
Mr. Guttman initiated Santana Row, and he moved here, across the country from corporate headquarters in Maryland, to see it through. Last March, under criticism from Wall Street for putting so much of Federated Realty's money into Santana Row, he announced plans to resign as chief executive, and Federal Realty has indicated that it will back away from projects like this one.
 Dec. 20, the company announced that Mr. Guttman's resignation would take effect on Jan. 1 and that he would also resign as chairman then. Shares of Federal Realty have rallied since the announcement, closing at $28.75 yesterday, a 52-week high. 
"My wife will tell you I'm obsessive," Mr. Guttman said in a recent interview. Among other things, he has become obsessive about fire. Touring the site in September, when it still smelled of smoke and mildew, Mr. Guttman stopped at one point, fell silent and shivered at the sight of a construction worker with a torch. Asked if he was all right, he said: "I was watching that guy with the fire."
Planned as a $500 million development, Santana Row is densely zoned and ornately decorated with imported arts, ornamental fountains and tile mosaics intended to evoke the legacy of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi. 
It was built without assistance from the City of San Jose, using equity capital from the REIT, which it had raised from shareholders.
City planners and urban economists across the country are clamoring for projects of this sort -- a series of interlocking streets where places to shop, live and work are clustered with public spaces. But paying for such ambitious projects is challenging.
Discussing Federal Realty's investment in Santana Row, Matthew L. Ostrower, an analyst at Morgan Stanley who covers retail-oriented real estate investment trusts, said, "The rents at which it will be desirable to tenants will never justify what was spent on the project."
The company, he said, allocated too much money to buy land and infrastructure for several city blocks, leaving its investors with low short-term yields. 
"The markets just don't provide patient capital, generally speaking," Mr. Ostrower said. "Steve Guttman regarded himself as something of a visionary. He essentially ignored the public shareholders. Santana Row cost Steve Guttman his job."
While equity analysts assailed the short-term yields, debt analysts objected to the concentration of assets.
"You're looking at something that could wipe out 20 percent of the balance sheet of this company," said Richard S. Talmadge, the lead analyst of the company's debt at Fitch Ratings, arguing that the fire had vividly demonstrated his point. The company has filed more than $70 million in insurance claims and has been paid about $20 million so far. 
Mr. Guttman argues for a longer view than that of his critics. "REIT analysts are going to look at this in a one- or two-year microscope," he said. "We thought long term, and I still believe long term it's going to be one of the top real-estate developments in the United States."
The conundrum for proponents of new urbanism is summed up neatly at Santana Row, said Michael D. Beyard, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington. "The question is what will be the type of developers to bring about these projects," Mr. Beyard said. "REIT's have the money, but not the time because they have to show steady profit," he said.
"Entrepreneurial investors have the time and inclination, but they may not have the money. That's why projects are so slow to be introduced."
Mr. Guttman was in an unusual position to bring about a mixed-use project on this scale: 22 acres in the first phase, including 441,000 square feet of retail space, a movie theater, 2,000 parking spaces, a 213-room hotel and 246 residential units.
Raised in Charleroi, Pa., a small town built around shopping centers and encircled by small towns built around steel mills, Mr. Guttman joined Federal Realty in 1972, just after graduating from George Washington University School of Law. The company's founders were former State Department officials in their 50's who had rolled $40 million in apartment building assets in the Washington area into a real estate investment trust.
They hired Mr. Guttman to handle acquisitions, and with limited capital, he bought dilapidated shopping centers, intending to renovate them and increase their profits. The strategy did not start to work until companies like the Gap and Barnes & Noble began renting spaces in small outdoor shopping centers. The company's greatest success has been Bethesda Row in Maryland, a 280,000-square-foot development that emphasizes restaurant tenants.
With that as a small model, the company bought 42 acres here, 3.5 miles from downtown, for $42 million. And then Mr. Guttman began executing ambitious plans.
He hired four architecture firms, intending to make each of the eight new buildings look as though they had been constructed at different times. He commissioned an artist to put ceiling panels evoking the 28 phases of the moon above the sidewalk. He bought an 18th-century chapel facade in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of the south of France for $28,000. He subsidized the rent on a 6,000-square-foot gallery space for Emmanuel Flipo, an artist from the south of France.
It added up. Federal Realty spent $205 million in equity capital and obtained a $295 million construction loan, which it has since retired with proceeds from the sale of more unsecured debt, bringing the company's total indebtedness to $660 million.
The roads and other infrastructure cost Federal Realty about $50 million. 
San Jose spent nothing.
"It would have been hard to declare that a blighted area," said Joseph A. Horwedel, deputy director of planning for the city. "There would have been strong opposition from other groups that depend on tax revenues."
Parts of Santana Row opened in November, two months late, with high-end specialty merchants like Gucci and Anthropologie anchored by larger Barnes & Noble and Crate & Barrel stores. Signed leases cover 331,000 square feet of retail space in all, with the remaining 100,000 square feet unleased. 
In part because of the fire, only 177,000 square feet of the retail space -- 41 stores including sidewalk vendors -- is open for business. Many of the companies, especially those opening a first or second store, were uninsured.
Most of the retail spaces are small, and so Santana Row is directly -- and successfully -- competing for tenants with Union Square in San Francisco, said Kazuko Morgan, a senior director of retail services for the real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Guttman said that if he had it to do over, he would not have concentrated such a high percentage of his company's assets in one project. "Federal Realty, in hindsight, would have been better not doing this project," he said.
As Mr. Guttman, who has taken up smoking again, showed a visitor around Santana Row last week, he ground his cigarette butt out on a garbage can, then crushed the visitor's discarded cigarette under his shoe for a good five seconds to ensure that it had been extinguished.

HEADLINE: A Christmas List for a Song This Year 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Deflation hit true love this year -- at least the type spelled out in "The 12 Days of Christmas."
 Each year, as holiday spending reaches its seasonal frenzy, a Pennsylvania financial services firm offers its own quirky take on the economy, and this year, it calculates, the gifts spun out in the song -- from a perching partridge to drummers drumming -- would run to $14,558.06. 
 An expensive Christmas, true, and it counts on old-fashioned legwork to buy everything from the partridge's pear-tree perch to booking the milking maids and leaping lords. But the price, according to the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, which has been putting together the index for nearly two decades, is down 7.6 percent from last year. 
And for what it's worth: Only twice before, in 1988 and 1995, did the index fall.
It would probably be fruitless to look for savings on the Internet, though. If you turn to the Web, the price zooms up to $24,595.28 -- 3.6 percent higher than a year ago -- though some items are cheaper.
Still, just look at the bargains to be found in our wobbly economy. Swans, for instance. Seven "a-swimming" are required -- and they have dropped to $300 each from $500 last year. Breeders, it seems, have an oversupply of trumpeter swans, said Rebekah McCahan, who has been compiling the light-hearted information for PNC since 1986.
And there is a surfeit of pear trees this year, with one Philadelphia-area nursery selling them at 30 percent less than last year, for $87.50 versus $125.
"Over all, we've seen the price of goods drop, which reflects what is happening in retail, where there are big discounts to encourage consumer spending and increase sales," Ms. McCahan said.
Gold prices rose, though, with five simple gold bands now going for $382.50, up 2 percent from $375 last year. Buying the rings online, though, would cut the price more than half.
Pipers and drummers, from the local musicians' union, were relatively cheap -- 11 pipers for $1,641.60 -- no increase over 2001, she said. But the leaping lords (from a Philadelphia dance troupe, Philadanco) and dancing ladies (hired from the Pennsylvania Ballet) were more expensive. Ten lords-a-leaping cost $3,921, up 4 percent, and the nine female dancers rose 2.2 percent, to $4,107, up considerably from their $1,602 price tag in 1986, Ms. McCahan said.
Eight maids-a-milking cost the same as last year -- $41.60 for an hour of minimum-wage toil, or $296.32 if hired via the Internet -- although Ms. McCahan acknowledged that such a service is hard to find these days because most milking is automated.
You might want to get them while you can. Over all, the price of the gifts is likely to rise again.
"As we see hiring plans improving and wages on the rise, we expect to see a rise in our Christmas Price Index next year," said Jeff Kleintop, the chief strategist at PNC's investment advisory group.
But never fear: the lords will leap again, the ladies will dance.

HEADLINE: Indians Fight to Regain Lands Lost to Railroad 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: LEECH LAKE RESERVATION, Minn. 

 BODY:
Richard Robinson Jr. remembers how much his grandfather Martin Bobolink, a hospital janitor, looked forward to retiring and returning to his land here. "He told us there was buried treasure there because his dad had put up gangsters," said Mr. Robinson, the acting chairman of the Leech Lake band of the Ojibwe tribe.
 But Mr. Bobolink quickly learned that the land and any loot that might be on it was not his. The Bureau of Indian Affairs told him he had signed the land over to the United States in exchange for a few thousand dollars. 
 "He swore until he died that he never received a check and never signed any papers," Mr. Robinson said. "He was dead certain." 
The story is a common one in what used to be Indian country, before the the relentless westward push of white settlers and railroads. Among the most effective tools of expropriation were nine laws passed by Congress in 1887, at the behest of James J. Hill, head of the Great Northern Railroad, and other railroad owners, which ensured that huge chunks of Indian land ended up in the hands of industrialists, homesteaders or, as in Mr. Bobolink's case, the United States government.
Now a chunk of the Hill fortune has been dedicated to reassembling that land and returning it to Indian control.
The Northwest Area Foundation, a $424 million philanthropy established by Hill's heirs, has given $20 million of seed money toward the effort, which aims to restore some 90 million acres on reservations around the country to Indian ownership.
"We're not saying it's going to be easy," said Cris Stainbrook, a Lakota who leads the Indian Land Tenure Foundation, which was created to lead the effort. "It's going to be very expensive, and probably the staff here now isn't going to be alive to see the mission completed. But it is the only way Native Americans can regain the means to preserve their sovereignty, their culture, their identity."
Philanthropy often seems tailor-made to assuage guilt, and the Great Northern was "one of the most Indian-subsidized railroads in America," wrote Michael P. Malone, a historian, in a 1996 biography of Mr. Hill. To build a railroad spanning the Northwest frontier, Mr. Hill needed a right of way through Indian country, and he used his friendships with politicians from Montana to Washington to get it.
So sharp-elbowed were the machinations of Mr. Hill and the other railroad tycoons that President Grover Cleveland initially vetoed the legislation they wanted in 1886, sharply denouncing the efforts of "a class of corporations carrying with them individuals not known for any scrupulous regard for the interest of the Indians."
Mr. Hill raged that the veto was "ridiculous" and drafted his friend William Vilas, the postmaster general, and others to persuade the president, also a friend, to reconsider, which he did. 
Indians and the tribe now own less than 5 percent of the 677,099 acres on the Leech Lake Reservation, and the population is exploding as Indians return to take jobs in casinos or lose welfare benefits and seek tribal assistance. "People are living two or three families to a trailer home or, in the warm weather, in their cars," said Pauline Johnston, director of the Leech Lake land department. "We have no place to put them."
The Hill heirs say their philanthropic efforts are guided as much by a desire to improve the community as they are to make up for their ancestor's past. "I guess you could interpret it as atonement, but I don't really think of it like that," said Louis F. Hill, a great-grandson. "If you're going to be philanthropic, why not be philanthropic in the community that brought you the wealth to begin with? That's what philanthropy traditionally has done."
He noted that other railroads got much larger land grants under the laws and that his grandfather, Louis W. Hill, was adopted by the Blackfoot tribe of Montana, which called him Graybeard, because of his efforts to bring economic development to their reservations.
Land repurchase programs are under way on reservations around the country, but the process is expensive and complicated. And the organizers of the program here recognize that $20 million will not even begin to buy back all the land the Indian Land Tenure Foundation wants to see in Indian hands.
The money will jump-start programs to educate Indians about protecting the land they do own by, for instance, writing wills that specify heirs or putting the land in trust. 
Land acquisition, by far the foundation's boldest goal, will take at least $400 million more and will require innovative private financing techniques. 
Through a series of treaties, the United States set aside 138 million acres in reservations owned by tribes and then almost immediately set about finding ways to get the land into non-Indian hands. Perhaps the most effective of those efforts was the 1887 package of laws. Six of those granted land to the railroads for expansion, and one of the other three, the General Allotment Act, supplied them their customers. 
That act redistributed reservation lands to individual Indians in 40-, 80- and 160-acre parcels that the government was to hold in trust for the new owners. Later, much of the unallocated reservation land was declared "in excess" of Indian needs and opened for development by non-Indian settlers and companies. Those settlers were customers for the railroads.
"Hill benefited, Harriman benefited, the whole series of railroad tycoons benefited from this systematic displacement of Indians from their land and their replacement by European settlers," said Karl Stauber, president of the Northwest Area Foundation, referring to Edward Harriman, one of James Hill's competitors.
Recovering reservation land that has passed into private or public ownership will be a big challenge. The largest block of land on the Leech Lake Reservation is part of Chippewa National Forest, and much of the lakefront property around the reservation's three biggest lakes is in private hands.
Property owners are more and more aware of Indian efforts to regain reservation land, and their asking prices get higher when a tribe shows an interest, Indians in Leech Lake said.
The Leech Lake band's budget for land reclamation this year is $435,000, all it could spare from the $12 million it earned in casino revenues; much of the rest was eaten up by necessities like housing, health care and education. In November, it spent most of the yearly budget to buy 425 acres at $1,000 an acre from a Sioux Indian.
Discrimination also keeps land out of reach. "The land over there on that corner is ours," Ms. Johnston of the Leech Lake land department, said, pointing out plots the band has recovered. "They didn't want to sell to Indians, so we used a white guy who helped us buy it."
Even the land that is in the hands of individual Indians poses problems for the foundation. The Allotment Act, which was shepherded through Congress by Senator Henry Dawes of Massachusetts, a friend of James Hill, gave Indians ownership of parcels of land, but as the land moved into the hands of their offspring, they owned the land collectively unless otherwise spelled out in a will.
"It's like owning a share of stock in a company," said Annabell Kingbird, assistant director of the land department. "In the same way a shareholder can't walk into a company and point to a desk or a computer and say 'that's mine,' an interest holder cannot point to any land and call it his."
Because the concept of private property was traditionally alien to Indians, many of them did not write wills. Left to the discretion of the probate court, ownership of the original allotments has become highly splintered.
Lee Turney's mother, for instance, left no will when she died in 1955. Her estate, four allotments totaling 110 acres, was in probate until the spring of last year. The court divided interest in the land equally among 210 descendants.
Mr. Turney, who lives on land owned by the tribe, holds interests of a little more than a tenth of an acre in each of the four parcels. "There is absolutely nothing I can do with that land, nothing at all," he said.
Even if he wanted to try, he would have to get the approval of a majority of the other 209 owners. "I guess I probably know about 10 of them, and that's being generous," he said. "I wouldn't even want to attempt to do anything. Families have enough divisions without this one."
Della Kingbird's mother used a gift deed to give her daughter an interest representing almost seven acres of an 80 acre parcel. In 1996, Ms. Kingbird got approval from 51 percent of the other owners to build a house on the land -- only to have the largest stakeholder die, voiding the approval process. "I gave up," she said.
She now lives on land adjacent to that plot. Not only did she have to buy it, she pays taxes on it, which she would not have had to do on the land her mother left her. 
Mr. Stainbrook of the Indian Land Tenure Foundation says he believes James Hill would have appreciated the foundation's efforts to end such complexity. 
"In some ways, I don't think James J. Hill would have been against what we're trying to do with his money," Mr. Stainbrook said. "He was always for developing the land in a way that would benefit the region and the country at large, in a way that made it productive, and we're really trying to do the same thing."

HEADLINE: Advocates for Poor Criticize City's Food Stamp Program 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
A processing problem that incorrectly removed nearly 4,000 people from the city's food stamp rolls in November has added fuel to a debate between the city and hunger-relief advocates, who have for months been accusing the Human Resources Administration of discouraging eligible families from receiving food stamps. 
 The number of people receiving food stamps decreased to 825,155 last month, a drop of 10,889 people from October. 
 About 4,000 were incorrectly removed from the rolls because there was not enough staff to process routine recertification paperwork, said David Neustadt, a spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, which runs the federally financed voucher program locally. Mr. Neustadt said he could not explain the rest of the decline. 
News of the processing problem and the general decline in food stamp rolls drew criticism from hunger-relief advocates.
"It is nothing short of amazing that the city even admitted they messed up for one month," said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. He said the city should investigate the cause of the mistake and possibly reprimand the employees responsible.
Mr. Neustadt said an unusual confluence of events, including a wave of early staff buyouts and a particularly high number of people due to have their eligibility certified again, caused the administration to fall behind. He added that no one would be disciplined because of it. A recent change in federal law that forces the city to cut off benefits automatically to anyone who has not been recertified by deadline exacerbated the problem, he said.
The paperwork has now been processed and all those incorrectly removed have been reinstated, Mr. Neustadt said, although there was a gap in benefits in some cases. Those who lost benefits by mistake have been issued replacement benefits.
With the problem fixed and others entering the rolls for the first time, the Human Resources Administration said that it was expecting that the total number of food stamp recipients would rise to 836,152 in December.
The November numbers come as hunger-relief advocates have intensely criticized the city for mishandling the program. They have complained that with unemployment rates at 8 percent, the highest in four years, the number of those receiving food stamps has risen by less than 5 percent over the course of the year. Currently, 800,000 New Yorkers with incomes low enough to qualify for food stamps do not receive them, according to a report released last week by the Community Food Resources Center. 
Hunger-relief advocates and their allies argue that lack of outreach by the city is behind the shortfall. In New York State, only 50 percent of those eligible for the program receive food stamps, according to the most recent reports by the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers the program on a national level. Nationally, the level of participation is 59 percent.
"When that many people who deserve benefits are not getting them, then we have no functional outreach effort," said Bill de Blasio, chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee. He added the problems were not just with informing a larger group about their eligibility, but in making the application process less daunting.
Recently, when the City Council sent undercover investigators to Human Resources Administration offices, it reported that a third were turned away without an application even when they expressly asked for one, a clear violation of the law. "Clearly," Mr. De Blasio said, "there are still a lot of problems with how individuals are treated at H.R.A. centers."
The agency responded that there was currently a $1 million outreach campaign and that it would start two new campaigns next year -- one for immigrants. In addition, the state will give additional training to staff members who handle food stamp applications next year and is likely to cut the 16-page application to two pages.
Mr. Neustadt said the city had conducted more than 1,600 undercover investigations of the agency's offices last year and turned up only 15 cases in which workers had failed to meet legally mandated standards.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, U.S. Supplies Of Oil Rise 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
Supplies of crude oil in the United States rose last week, despite dwindling oil exports from Venezuela, according to data released yesterday by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group.
 While the data may seem reassuring at first glance, analysts said it was too early to discount the impact of the Venezuelan shortfall on American oil supplies. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States, accounting for 14 percent of United States oil imports. A general strike in Venezuela against the government of President Hugo Chavez has brought oil production there to a standstill, and exports have fallen to a trickle. 
 Industry analysts say that the full brunt of that stoppage is just beginning to be felt in the United States.
"I thought you would start to see the impact this week, but sometimes these things take a little while to work themselves through the system," said Thomas P. Bentz, senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. "There could be a lag time. It could be that we're not getting the full effect yet."
Crude oil stocks actually rose for the week ended Dec. 20 by 2.7 million barrels, to 286.63 million barrels. But the inventories were helped by a big jump in oil supplies on the West Coast, mainly California, analysts said, perhaps because crude oil shipments originally headed for Asia were diverted to the United States, where prices are higher. 
Supplies on the Gulf Coast, where most of the oil from Venezuela is refined, were down by 1.84 million barrels, according to the trade group. 
"If you excise the West Coast, there's an overall draw-down of oil by about 1.3 million barrels," said John P. Kilduff, senior vice president of energy risk management at Fimat USA, a unit of Societe Generale. "It's the beginning of the problems with the Venezuela situation, and it will keep getting worse."
The price of oil for February delivery rose 22 cents yesterday, to close at $31.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. During trading, the price topped $32 a barrel, its highest level in 22 months. Traders are concerned not just about Venezuela but about the increasing possibility of war with Iraq and that conflict's impact on supplies from the region. The inventory data were released after trading ended.
Some analysts expect the price of oil to decrease only slightly, given the data, when trading resumes tomorrow. The exchange is closed today. 
But Mr. Kilduff said he thought prices would remain at their current high levels.
"If the Venezuelan strike is still ongoing when we wake up Thursday, this will not be bearish for prices," Mr. Kilduff said. "When you break down the numbers and get behind the data, it will actually turn out to be bullish."
A key indicator that traders and analysts will be watching is the "run" rate at refineries, or how much of their capacity is being used to make petroleum products. At this time of year, when heating oil is in demand, refineries normally run at 93 percent or more of capacity, Mr. Kilduff said. But the data show that run rates have actually declined, to 88.7 percent, from 89.2 percent the previous week. 
"The low refinery utilization number," Mr. Kilduff said, "is reflective of what refiners see as a problem with crude supplies." 
Traders and refiners have said this week that refineries are scrambling to buy crude oil to make up for the Venezuelan exports. Two major refineries in the Caribbean that supply gasoline and other petroleum products to the United States have sharply reduced how much crude oil they process. 
One of them, the Hovensa refinery in St. Croix, V.I., said it would increase output again in January, but a spokesman for a partner in the refinery, the Amerada Hess Corporation, said he did not know whether the plant would be able to operate at its capacity of 450,000 barrels of oil a day.
Refineries on the Gulf Coast have also reduced their output. Last Friday, Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and the chairman of the House energy committee, sent a letter to the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, urging the government to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve because of the supply disruptions out of Venezuela. 
In the letter, Mr. Tauzin said two major refineries that account for "approximately 10 percent of the market for refined products will run out of crude oil by the end of the month." Mr. Tauzin declined to identify the refineries, but analysts said they thought he was talking about two large refineries in Louisiana and Texas owned by Citgo. 
Citgo is a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan state oil company, and slightly less than half its crude oil supply comes from Venezuela.
A Citgo spokesman, Jim McCarthy, declined to comment on the possibility of the company's refineries running out of oil, saying only that "our traders are out there working as hard as they can to find crude to make sure that we don't have to cut back."

HEADLINE: Two Cities, Two Immigrant Landings 

 BODY:
The arrival of hundreds of poor immigrants, many without education or English skills, caused great concern in Lewiston, Me., where old-line Yankee residents worried about the town's capacity to absorb the newcomers. Tension was inevitable.
 That was more than a century and a half ago, when Irish refugees from the potato famine came in search of work, quickly followed by a wave of French Canadians who were recruited by the mills to increase production. After a sometimes violent period of getting acquainted, the American model of acceptance and cohabitation -- and eventually intermarriage -- took hold. And that was good for the town, which staked its future on thriving textile mills and shoe factories. 
 Now the descendants of those immigrants are the community pillars, facing their own test of the American way. More than 1,000 black Muslim refugees from civil war, famine and disease in Somalia, many of them originally resettled in the Atlanta area, began arriving in the town of 36,000, unannounced, nearly two years ago. The women wear native dress, and the men gather at a makeshift mosque. Nonetheless, the Somalis have worked to fit into a community that is ambivalent about them. Mayor Laurier Raymond Jr. let the strain show when he used an open letter last fall to plead with his new Somali neighbors to stop the migration.
The mayor has said that he meant no ill will, that he was simply reacting to the depletion of city services. But a point was made, and whether by coincidence or in response, the flow of Somalis to Lewiston has sharply slowed in recent weeks. That may not be good for Lewiston. In the state with the fewest nonwhites and one of the oldest and sparsest populations, Lewiston has shrunk by some 6,000 residents in the last three decades. Its young people, facing newly shuttered factories, have joined a migration from the Northeast. Lewiston enjoys low unemployment, low crime, good schools and affordable housing -- all of which lured the Somalis, who did not like the poor urban neighborhoods they left behind. Half the Somali adults are employed so far. Some are starting small businesses, while others are getting job training and learning English. They are becoming contributing members of the community, just what Lewiston needs.
In New York State, another city found itself in similar straits but has taken a different approach. That city, Schenectady, has lost nearly one-quarter of its population -- going from 80,000 to 62,000 -- since 1960. Its mayor, Albert Jurczynski, the grandson of Polish immigrants, is working to reverse that trend. "We need new blood," he says. So he is recruiting Guyanese living in New York City, 150 miles to the south. On many Saturdays, a bus takes potential resettlers from Queens for a day trip and a sales pitch that touts Schenectady's livability. With his city stronger by some 3,000 Guyanese, the mayor reports that communities are being revitalized, new businesses are opening, and property values are going up for the first time in a dozen years.
The secondary migration of both these groups is not unusual. The Hmong from Laos left Pennsylvania and Minnesota to make a community in the Central Valley of California. Large numbers of Vietnamese came together in Orange County, Calif. Bosnians have gone to Utica, N.Y. These are the Little Italys and Chinatowns of today.
In this new wave, immigrants are finding opportunities away from large cities. Their impact, especially in older, smaller towns, can be enormous and positive. Schenectady sees its future with the Guyanese. And while immigrants like the Somalis need places like Lewiston, places like Lewiston can survive only with immigrants like the Somalis.

For N.Y.U.'s Coach, the Franchise Is Not the Team

BYLINE:  By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Janice Quinn, the New York University women's basketball coach, was drawing a parallel between her team and her new business venture, a Blimpie franchise three blocks from the N.Y.U. campus. The business, like the team, is a start-up enterprise, she said, that will have to be built from the ground up.
 "We have one senior and two juniors on the team," Quinn said the other day between sips of an amaretto coffee at her two-month-old restaurant. "The rest are freshmen who have never played college basketball before and sophomores who didn't get a lot of experience last year." 
 She looked around. "I'm the freshman here," she said. "I try hard not to forget that the team is learning, and it's been good and humbling for me to be in my own new enterprise at the same time, learning as I go."
The Violets were a perfect 6-0 to start the season, capturing the N.Y.U. Tip-Off Tournament last month before losing in overtime to Mount St. Mary's on Dec. 10, their most recent game. They have beaten good teams like SUNY-Brockport, the College of Staten Island and Skidmore.
But Quinn said it was too early in the season to allow herself or her young team, the youngest in her 16 years as coach at N.Y.U., to think about a bid to the N.C.A.A.'s Division III tournament in March.
Experienced or not, this year's team will be measured against her previous ones, and Quinn knows it. After N.Y.U. won a Division III title in 1997, great things were expected from a team that many believed could not compete at an elite level because of the university's academic rigor and the dearth of dormitories. In Quinn's first 15 seasons, the Violets went 326-89, won four University Athletic Association titles and made eight trips to the national Round of 16, four times reaching the quarterfinals and twice the semifinals.
As with the Blimpie business, Quinn is learning something new about the Violets every day and making adjustments as she goes along.
"We literally have to plan their routine for them: when to show up at the gym, how to get ready for a game, how to sit on the bench," she said with a shrug and a smile. "You can take for granted that this is game-day routine, but it's not routine if they haven't done it before."
Everything has to be taught to freshmen accustomed to playing at home in their high school gymnasiums: how to break a 1-3-1 or 2-2-1 press, how to get out of a trap; what to expect from opponents and fans on the road. 
By way of example, Quinn shared an anecdote: "We had a great game against the College of Staten Island and I was talking to the kids the day before and said: 'They're going to come at us hard. You know how hard it is to play at C.S.I.' The kids all had this strange look on their faces, and Allison Herman, my senior, said, 'Coach, actually no one has played there before.' Herman said she had mononucleosis when we played Staten Island her sophomore year."
So far, the Violets are winning with defense, defensive rebounding and their transition game. Quinn has a 3-point shooter in guard Lauren D'Ambrosio, a 5-foot-7 senior who sat out the last two years, and a versatile on-and-off-court leader in Herman, a 5-11 guard/forward who led the team last season in rebounding (8.9 a game) and blocked shots (56) and was third in scoring (12.0 points a game).
Quinn, a former star player at N.Y.U., has a master's degree in finance and management from the Wagner School of Public Service there. Her career path took her toward athletics, but starting a business has for years danced in her head like visions of sugarplums.
A year ago, a clothing store five blocks from the Coles Sports Center closed, and Quinn saw an opportunity realized.
"I've worked and lived in this community for 20 years," she said. "I eat here and know what it's like to look for choices in food. I thought of Blimpie's because you can't find anything more down to earth than a Blimpie's sandwich."
She turned to an old friend, her former N.Y.U. coach, Sherri Pickard, for help. Pickard was living in Wilmington, N.C., working on a project for the local firefighters' union and doing some investing on her own, when Quinn called.
"It was last September or October," Pickard recalled as she poured herself a cup of coffee at the store. "I had a nice, simple, uncomplicated Southern life. Then Janice called and said she was going to start a business and asked if I was interested. I said: 'Not really. I doubt it. Probably not.' But she recruited me."
Quinn plans to leave the daily operations to Pickard while focusing on her day job: coaching. Pickard, a former standout at the University of North Carolina with master's degrees in economics and accounting, describes herself as the bottom line person in the partnership. All "that other nice stuff" is Quinn, she said.
Having opened the Blimpie's doors in October, Quinn knows it is too soon to think about profit margins and expansion, not when three of five new business ventures in New York State fail in the first year of operation.
"Success was getting the business plan together, then getting the funding and putting the deal together," Quinn said. "Getting the doors open was a huge step. We are now deeply entrenched in the third phase, which is to survive the first year."
As former athletes and coaches, Quinn and Pickard bring realism to the business.
"A whole lot of it comes down to the fact that we refuse to lose," Pickard said. "The competitive spirit. In coaching, when you see something going on that you didn't anticipate, you can be hardheaded and stick with the game plan, or back up, reassess and make a change. We've had to do a lot of that. Janice had to do a lot of that to get to the point."
Quinn nodded in agreement, then said with a laugh: "You don't know how often we've said, 'Well, now we know.' "

HEADLINE: Nothing Under the Tree? Those Low on Cash Go to the Pawnshop 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
With only a few shopping hours left until Christmas, Michelle Kone dashed up to the bulletproof glass at Citi Pawn in the Bronx.
 Ms. Kone, 38, slid a small envelope bulging with gold bracelets, earrings and necklaces under the window. Without looking up, the pawnbroker quickly tested the gold and divided it into two piles: 12-karat and 24-karat. Then he weighed them separately, slapped the jewelry back down on the counter and yelled a number through the slide-through cutout: $265. 
 Ms. Kone smiled. "I'll take it," she said. "The last place offered me 200."
Citi Pawn on East 149th Street is one of a handful of pawnshops that thrive on the fringes of the bustling Bronx shopping area known as the Hub. This holiday season, the shops are reporting long lines of people anxious for cash to buy gifts.
Yesterday, on the busy streets of the Hub that line Third Avenue for several blocks north of 149th Street, throngs of shoppers took advantage of the mild temperatures to look for last-minute bargains in the cavernous stores with names like Mr. Discount, Save-A-Thon, Perfumania, Jimmy Jazz and Loco John.
At Conway, a discount store, customers waited at cashier lines with shopping carts full of toys. One of them, Victor Gonzalez, 33, said he had done all his shopping that day, spending $300 on gifts for his children.
"See this?" he said, holding up a doll set. "Yesterday they had it for $75. I got it today for $60."
But for some, it would take more than price cuts to make Christmas possible. They needed cash. So they lined up at local pawnshops carrying laptops, stereos, guitars and power tools. At one shop on East 149th Street, a 20-year-old student from the Bronx who gave her name only as Aisha pawned a gold chain for $30 so she could buy a gift for her 3-month-old son.
"It's an especially busy season this year," said Gerald Modell, president of the Collateral Loan Brokers Association of New York and the owner of four city pawnshops.
"The economy is down and many people have lost their jobs and need cash," he added. "People get into difficult situations and say: 'It's Christmas Eve, and I need $1,000. Where am I going to get it?' You can't go to your friends."
Mr. Modell, whose family owns the Modell's chain of sporting goods stores, called pawnshops "the poor man's bank."
Mr. Modell said there were probably fewer than 50 pawnshops left in New York City. Most charge a processing fee of $3 to $5 per transaction and a monthly interest rate of 3 percent. The pawner is typically given four or five months to reclaim the item.
Pawnshops, he added, are not just for the poor. "We service people who may not get their bonus or salary check until after Christmas," he said. "Also, you have rich people who pawn big diamonds for whatever reason. Maybe they're maxed out on their credit cards, or their taxes, or college tuitions. We don't ask why."
Blaine Messinger, who owns N.Y. Pawnbrokers on East 149th Street, said that more shoppers were pawning items for quick cash this year than in the past. "Where else can you do this?" he said. "You can't go to a bank and ask to borrow $200 for Christmas shopping."
Mr. Messinger said about 90 percent of his customers wind up redeeming their property. When jewelry is brought in for a loan, it is tested for authenticity, weighed and then appraised, according to the current daily market price. Appraisers then offer to lend the owner about 40 percent of that value.
Not everyone at the pawnshops was looking for a loan. Some, like William Marcano, 63, were looking for bargains. Yesterday afternoon, he gazed in the window of N.Y. Pawnbrokers at gyrating toy Santas. Swaying like hula dancers, the dolls flaunted shiny gold chains, bracelets and watches.
Mr. Marcano, a retired truck driver from the Bronx, looked at these items, and at the trays of gold earrings. He said he preferred buying jewelry in pawnshops because of the discounts.
He had just received his monthly Social Security check in the mail and cashed it, for $749. He planned to spend about $500 of it on jewelry for his girlfriend and gifts for his children.
"You've got to make everyone happy," he said.
But Ms. Kone's story was perhaps more typical. She had spent the morning thinking in her Bronx apartment, a block from Yankee Stadium, and decided that her four children deserved Christmas presents, even though she had no job and no money. She scooped up her gold jewelry and headed out the door.
She said that she had lost her job in April as an administrator at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Upper Manhattan and that bureaucratic problems have prevented her from getting many of her unemployment checks.
Since then, she has made four separate trips to pawn several thousand dollars' worth of gold, silver and diamonds, she said. Each time she has defaulted on the loan and lost the property to the pawnbroker.
Yesterday, she took the cash and hurried out of the shop and toward the Hub's discount stores. She stopped at Crazy Sounds, an electronics store, bought three portable CD players for $20 each.
"It's a start," she said. "You can't put a price on saving Christmas for the little ones."

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Increase in National Debt Limit 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
The Bush administration asked Congress today to approve another increase in the limit on national debt, saying it will run out of the authority to borrow money by late February.
 The deputy Treasury secretary, Kenneth W. Dam, in a letter to the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, cited the cost of combating terrorism and the economic slowdown for the government's growing indebtedness. 
 The federal government, which enjoyed a budget surplus as recently as two years ago, had a shortfall of $157 billion this year and is expected to have a larger one in 2003. 
Congress raised the government's debt limit in July by $450 million, to a total of $6.4 trillion, but administration officials predicted even then that they would need to raise the limit again by some time next year.
Though today's announcement was no surprise, it highlighted the sharp deterioration in the government's financial condition and provided fresh ammunition for Democratic lawmakers who want to thwart President Bush's plan to push additional tax cuts through Congress early next year.
Mr. Dam said the government's debt had been swollen by needs for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, the costs of fighting terrorism and the economic slowdown.
But he made only oblique reference to the contribution made by the tax cuts that Mr. Bush pushed through last year, referring to the cost of "restoring economic performance."
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, seized on today's request to denounce Mr. Bush's campaign to make permanent last year's tax cuts.
"By raising the debt ceiling to pay for the president's tax cuts and his other spending, the Bush administration is wanting our children and grandchildren to pay our bills," Mr. Conrad said in a statement.
Treasury officials would not say how much they want to increase the debt ceiling, which will be subject to negotiation with Congressional leaders as the deadline approaches.
The negotiations will have to take place at the same time that Mr. Bush will be campaigning for his next package of tax cuts aimed at stimulating the economy. Mr. Bush is expected to outline his package either in or before his State of the Union address in late January. Many people expect him to call for measures costing as much as $300 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: A Career as a Window to the Future 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Since the White House's recent nomination of John W. Snow, the 63-year-old chairman of the railroad company CSX, to replace the ousted Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, analysts and economists have been trying to figure out what his future stewardship will mean for the country.
 But in railroad circles, the question is more parochial: Was he good for CSX, its employees and its shareholders? 
 Certainly there were problems after Mr. Snow was promoted to chief executive of CSX in 1989. During a long rough period in the 1990's, fatal accidents on the company's rails prompted a federal audit and raised concerns over whether CSX was more focused on cost-cutting than on public safety. 
More recently -- after CSX's stock soared through the mid-1990's -- the shares have been pounded along with other railroad stocks. What has particularly riled shareholders is that, as their stake shrank since 1997, Mr. Snow's compensation continued to grow handsomely. Last year he received $10.1 million, 69 percent more than in 1997.
But Mr. Snow's performance has pluses as well. The company's safety record has improved markedly in recent years. And analysts say Mr. Snow's time at the company will be recalled as the era when an unfocused transportation conglomerate was transformed into the Eastern United States' largest rail carrier, with 23,300 miles of track. (Only Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, both operating in the West, have bigger rail networks.) 
In September, CSX lowered its third-quarter earning forecast, but most Wall Street analysts see CSX as poised for growth when the economy rebounds.
Critics recall that Mr. Snow's $8.4 billion bid to acquire Conrail in 1996 devolved into a battle with the better financed Norfolk Southern that drove the price up to $10.2 billion. The two railroads ended up dividing up the spoils, with CSX eventually paying $3.9 billion for 42 percent of Conrail's tracks, burdening it with a huge debt. The company's current debt of $5.8 billion is more than double its $2.4 billion debt in 1989, when Mr. Snow became chief executive.
CSX, through a variety of legal techniques, also managed to avoid paying federal income taxes in three of the four years from 1998 to 2001, when it earned a total of $934 million in profit, according to data in its reports to shareholders first disclosed by Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group whose figures are widely accepted. CSX received $164 million more in refunds than it paid during those years, it told shareholders.
CSX's operating profit margins have grown since 1989, even as its revenue shrank as CSX withdrew from the container-ship, logistics and barge businesses. The company made a profit of $387 million on revenue of $8.1 billion in 2001, and has earned $287 million on revenues of nearly $6.1 billion in the first three quarters of this year.
"The Conrail merger will be John's greatest legacy at CSX," said Jill K. Evans, a transportation analyst at Morgan Securities.
For many people, a big question is how much direct credit, or blame, Mr. Snow deserves for the company's record under his watch. With his nomination as Treasury secretary still pending, Mr. Snow declined to be interviewed for this article. But by many accounts, he has been more a strategist and lobbyist for CSX than an active operations executive.
"I can't say whether he brought benefits to CSX, but he sure was a visionary when it came to deregulation," said Robert E. Gallamore, director of the Transportation Center at Northwestern University and a former strategic planner at Union Pacific.
Many analysts and rail buffs say that Mr. Snow left much of the actual running of CSX to Michael Ward, the president, who was widely expected to succeed Mr. Snow as chief executive next year even before the Treasury nomination was made. "CSX won't miss a beat in the transition," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.
Mr. Snow, who has a law degree and a Ph.D. in economics, started out as a University of Maryland economics professor and then taught law at the University of Virginia. His early advocacy of deregulating transportation industries brought him to the attention of senior railroad executives and in 1977 won him a job as vice president of government affairs with the Chessie System and an invitation to put his theories into practice. When CSX was formed in 1980 from the merger of Chessie and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Mr. Snow became a senior vice president at CSX and began moving up in the company.
CSX's operations are based in Jacksonville, Fla., but Mr. Snow has worked from Richmond, Va., as chief executive, using the CSX "air force," as company people call it, to ferry himself by jet to Florida and often by helicopter to Washington, 100 miles to the north.
Although railroads have been free to set their own rates since 1980, the federal government still regulates many aspects of the rail industry, including safety. And Washington was familiar turf for Mr. Snow, who had worked as a transportation official in the Ford administration before joining Chessie. 
Both critics and admirers agree that Mr. Snow is polished at courting politicians and would almost certainly be more politically effective as the Treasury secretary than Mr. O'Neill was. Among other prominent posts, he served for two years in the mid-1990's as chairman of the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for chief executives of large corporations, and was active in the Business Council, another influential group.
At CSX, Mr. Snow led an aggressive cost-cutting campaign. That first won him applause from Wall Street, but later opened him to widespread accusations of emphasizing fiscal health over public safety. Critics say track maintenance suffered and contributed to 19 deaths and more than 100 injuries in a spate of derailments, crashes and other accidents involving trains on CSX tracks between 1991 and 1996. 
Five major accidents in 1995 alone prompted an audit by the Federal Railroad Administration that accused the company of intimidating workers who raised safety concerns.
CSX, like the other major freight railroads, carries Amtrak passenger trains on its rails. Under federal law, Amtrak is solely responsible if any of its trains have accidents, even if the fault lies with the freight railroad's tracks, switches and signals. 
Thomas M. Downs, who was president of Amtrak from 1993 to 1998, said that he repeatedly met with Mr. Snow to express his concerns about safety on CSX's line.
"My experience was pretty uniformly unsatisfactory," said Mr. Downs, who said he felt that Norfolk Southern and other railroads had kept their rails safe. "I expected a different level of commitment to safety from his railroad. It was a constant disappointment."
On Feb. 17, 1996, before the federal audit was finished, a Maryland commuter train ran through a poorly maintained CSX signal and crashed into a Chicago-bound Amtrak train killing 12 and injuring 20.
The crash helped galvanize the auditors, whose subsequent report said of CSX, "Employees were not reporting injuries due to fear of reprisals, such as formal hearings or harsh discipline for minor unsafe acts or mistakes." 
The report also said supervisors were spread too thin to do their jobs and that a fifth of tracks had not been properly inspected. The audit noted the role of top management, saying that "only through a true commitment to safety at every level in the organization" would dangerous practices end. 
CSX denies it ever took chances with public safety. "What is important is how CSX responded to that audit,"said Adam Hollingsworth, a CSX spokesman. He said that Mr. Snow adopted "every recommendation" of the audit, including a zero-tolerance policy for intimidating workers who raise safety questions.
"Safety always has been and always will be CSX's top priority," Mr. Hollingsworth said, "and John Snow and the management team of the railroad have been and always will be committed."
Two years ago, CSX added 125 new inspectors and began spending more on maintaining the rails. As a result, CSX now ranks No. 2 in the number of train accidents and reported injuries -- behind only Norfolk Southern, which has ranked as the safest railroad for more than 20 years.
In the view of some employees, the cultural changes that benefited safety also improved working conditions more generally, creating an environment where workers now have a greater say in how things are done.
"Snow's legacy is that he is the only railroad executive who tried to break the militaristic culture of railroad managements," said Frank Wilner, the spokesman for the United Transportation Union, which represents about 8,000 CSX workers.
Whether Mr. Snow's management style was hands-on or arm's-length, his biggest business bet was his decision to make a takeover run at Conrail in 1996. At the time of the Conrail deal, the common wisdom had also held that Norfolk Southern would be able to more quickly and fully absorb its piece of Conrail.
"A lot of us thought Norfolk Southern had more bucks in its back pocket and a better managerial culture," Mr. Gallamore of Northwestern University said. "But in fact CSX did every bit as well."
Shareholders are not necessarily as upbeat. Many are smarting from their losses in the company's stock, particularly in light of Mr. Snow's increasingly rich compensation. 
Last year Amalgamated Bank, which holds about 82,000 CSX shares in its LongView index funds, introduced a shareholder resolution that would limit some of the lucrative severance payments built into CSX's executive employment contracts -- particularly the "poison pill" provisions that called for top executives to be paid handsomely in the event of a change of control at the company.
Melissa Moye, Amalgamated's chief economist in charge of trust and investment services, said that 30 percent of CSX shareholders voted for the resolution. That was not enough to pass the measure, but it was a strong enough showing to indicate investors' displeasure with management, Ms. Moye suggested.
"This is just not a well-governed company, and this stock has not done well," she said.
Many financial analysts choose to take a longer view, saying that CSX and Norfolk Southern, after some early stumbles, stand to benefit nicely from the Conrail acquisition. "Both railroads have turned out to be very good operators," Ms. Evans at Morgan Securities said.
And by one key measure for a freight company, CSX has grown increasingly proficient. In 2000, only about half of CSX's trains departed and arrived on time. Now, more than 90 percent are on schedule -- a record that has enabled CSX to pick up more shipments of perishable goods, like produce.
In the final analysis, that may be the best way to assess whether Mr. Snow's method was any way to run a railroad. As noted by William D. Zollars, chairman of the Yellow Corporation, a big trucking company that often carries goods to and from CSX's rail yards: "They're getting the trains there on time, with everyone's goods on them."

Officials Said to Urge Bush To Cut Taxes on Dividends
White House officials are urging President Bush to propose cutting taxes on corporate dividends for shareholders by about half, according to administration officials and Republicans close to the White House. The proposal, likely to be a crucial part of Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plan, is intended to stimulate the economy and reduce what many economists say is an incentive for companies to avoid paying dividends and to run up debt.
 While many economists think it would do little to bolster the economy quickly, they say the proposal would give a lift to the stock market. The plan would cost the Treasury more than $100 billion over 10 years, and the tax benefits would overwhelmingly flow to the wealthiest taxpayers. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KARZAI'S PROGRESS; 
Afghans Mark Year of Slowly Growing Stability

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
It was a year ago that Hamid Karzai took over the business of governing Afghanistan, a ruin of a country he and his government inherited after the collapse of the Taliban and have tried to guide through its first year relatively free of war in two decades.
 A united Afghanistan with a functioning multiethnic army remains a desire, not a reality. Yet despite violent incidents -- a narrow escape from assassination, the killing of two of his ministers and continued clashes among rival warlords in the provinces -- Mr. Karzai is looking stronger now that under his stewardship the country has found a degree of stability. 
 That was underscored today when a former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, who last year opposed the United Nations plan to make Mr. Karzai president, voiced unreserved support for him and the central government at a ceremony marking their first year in office.
Speaking to an audience of high-level government officials at the ceremony, Mr. Karzai acknowledged some failures of his government, namely security and disarmament, and vowed to tackle those issues more energetically in the next year.
In a sign of progress made, American forces based in Afghanistan have been contemplating moving from combat operations toward development activities, deploying larger teams of civil affairs officers in 8 to 10 provincial centers to give a boost to economic development.
The battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda has been drawing to an end, and the effort to win the peace and help the government establish its control countrywide is the new target, American military officials and diplomats have said.
Rocket and grenade attacks against American forces -- and recently suicide bomber attacks -- have continued and even increased in recent weeks. Yet they remain small in scale, and any concerted organized opposition to the presence of about 9,000 United States troops has failed to materialize.
The economic situation in the country remains precarious, however. Of the population of 20 million, nearly two million are recently returned refugees struggling to find a way to survive their first winter back.
Some 1.3 million people will be relying on food aid this winter, the World Food Program says, and more than half a million displaced people are considered vulnerable and in need of shelter and relief assistance, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
Although several nations pledged more than $4.5 billion in aid this year, not all of that money has arrived. The United States gave about $588 million this year, and expects to contribute a similar amount to the roughly $2 billion pledged by various nations for 2003, the State Department says.
Regional leaders continue to flex enormous power, running their own armies, collecting their own taxes and customs and to some extent running their own foreign policy. Armed clashes have continued, as regional commanders seek to consolidate their local power or defeat rivals.
Mr. Karzai, determined to avoid further bloodshed for his exhausted and traumatized people, has chosen to win over the warlords by persuasion -- a tactic that so far has won at least their verbal support for his government.
The list Mr. Karzai gave today of his government's undeniable achievements and the cheering he received from police and military officers who filled the auditorium spoke for themselves.
Among those achievements is Mr. Karzai's success in binding together a disparate cabinet that includes veterans of the guerrilla war against the Soviets, Western-educated Afghans who returned after 20 years abroad and representatives of ethnic groups that had been fighting one another. 
In a striking gesture of support, his defense minister, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, warned regional commanders in his speech today that they must give up some of their power and bow to the authority of the central government. It was the strongest sign yet of the Marshal Fahim's readiness to move against the powerful warlords, several of whom are his own supporters and source of power. 
Marshal Fahim, probably the most powerful man in Afghanistan thanks to his control of the bulk of the country's heavy weaponry and men under arms, has been slow to dismantle the forces loyal to him and make way for the civilian authorities. 
The president signed a decree this month to create a multiethnic, regionally diverse national army, which envisions disarmament and demobilization of the various armed militias that fought the Taliban.
Trying to separate political and military powers, Mr. Karzai further ordered military commanders to relinquish political positions and regional leaders or governors to give up their military positions.
Marshal Fahim has been involved in creating the plan for the national army, but his commitment to real change remains to be tested. Without his cooperation, Mr. Karzai's decrees are worth little, since his practical power does not stretch much beyond the capital.
But in his comments today, Marshall Fahim called for sacrifices in order to create a strong central government. 
"We should have a powerful central government according to the wishes of our people, and to achieve this aim, we should make some sacrifices," he said. "We should give up some positions. It is very necessary that we come under the command of the central government, so let's put an end to local military power bases."
Mr. Karzai, as often before, promised constitutional reform and preparations in the coming year for Afghanistan's first democratic elections in more than 20 years. "You will have the right to choose whomever you want," he told the audience.
Speaking in the hall where he was inaugurated on Dec. 22 last year, Mr. Karzai noted with typical understatement that there was still fighting between different groups in some areas, "and in this point, we have not been completely successful."
Disarmament started in some provinces in the last month, but it needs to move faster, he said.
"Although the general security situation is good, sometimes theft, robbery and killing occurs," he said. "Sometimes it is carried out by people who are linked to authority figures working in the government."
In his frank look back over the last year, Mr. Karzai remembered particular low moments -- the killing of over 40 civilians in Deh Rawud, in southern Afghanistan on July 1, during a raid by American-led forces hunting for terrorists; the car bomb that killed 30 men and women in central Kabul on Sept. 5 (on the same day, there was an attempt on Mr. Karzai's life in Kandahar); the assassination of his vice president, Haji Abdul Qadir, on July 6; and the killing of two students in demonstrations in Kabul last month, for which he blamed ill-trained policemen.
But he also talked of moments of joy and optimism, when during visits to the provinces he encountered ordinary and poor people who had given him their support.

HEADLINE: White House Aides Push for 50% Cut In Dividend Taxes 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
White House officials are urging President Bush to propose cutting taxes on corporate dividends for shareholders by about half, according to administration officials and Republicans close to the White House.
 The proposal, likely to be a crucial part of the tax-cutting plan Mr. Bush will announce in January, is intended to stimulate the economy and reduce what many economists say is an incentive in the current law for companies to avoid paying dividends and to run up debt. While many economists think it would do little to bolster the economy quickly, they say the proposal would give a boost to the stock market. 
 The 50 percent cut would cost the Treasury more than $100 billion over 10 years, and the tax benefits would overwhelmingly flow to the nation's very wealthiest taxpayers. Mr. Bush is in favor of some kind of reduction in the tax on dividends, a White House official said, but has not settled on an amount.
President Bush's entire tax package is expected to provide as much as $300 billion in reductions over 10 years. It is almost certain to speed up both tax cuts that were supposed to take effect over the next several years and corporate write-offs for investment in new equipment. Officials are also considering measures that benefit middle- or lower-income families, like a more rapid increase in the child-care tax credit.
Administration officials contend that reducing dividend taxes would immediately increase the underlying value of companies and lower their cost of capital. The short-term political appeal is its potential effect on the stock market, because it would instantly make shares of any company that pays dividends more valuable than before.
The long-term benefit of a cut in the dividend tax, the officials say, would be to greatly reduce the market distortions of taxing dividends twice -- once as corporate profits and once as dividend income to shareholders -- while granting tax deductions on debt interest payments. For shareholders, dividends are now taxed as ordinary income at rates of up to 38.6 percent. By comparison, the maximum tax rate on capital gains -- the profit made from the increase in value of shares or other kinds of property -- is 20 percent.
Many economists are skeptical that a cut in dividend taxes would provide much immediate stimulus to the economy, which has been Mr. Bush's most important justification for new tax cuts. It would be at least a year before shareholders see any extra money, and the measure would not leave extra money in corporate coffers.
"One wouldn't think of this as the first or second or even third measure to stimulate consumption or investment," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the issue for years. 
While the tax on dividends has been a focus of White House discussions, there have been many proposals on how such a reduction could be structured. A White House official cautioned this week that Mr. Bush has not yet decided on exactly how much to reduce the tax on corporate dividends, but the official said advisers agreed in principle on the most logical proposal. 
As envisioned, a person would be able to exclude a substantial share of all stock dividends -- probably about half -- from taxation. There would be no upper limit on the dollar value of dividends that would be tax free, which means that most of the relief would flow to the largest investors.
The Urban-Brooking Tax Policy Center, a research center here, recently calculated that, if the government completely eliminated taxes on corporate dividends, 42 percent of the tax benefits would flow to the wealthiest 1 percent of all taxpayers.
Republicans close to the White House said there were several reasons why officials were attracted to the idea of letting taxpayers exclude about half of all dividend income from taxes.
Eliminating all taxes on corporate dividends would drain so much money from the Treasury -- about $300 billion over 10 years, according to some estimates -- that President Bush would have no room for other tax cuts.
Reducing dividend taxes by about half, to about 20 percent for people in the top tax bracket, would not only reduce the drain on revenue to the Treasury but also bring dividend taxes in line with those on capital gains. 
Tax analysts said that would eliminate one imbalance in the current tax system that favors fast-growing companies like Microsoft that pay no dividends but attract investors with the prospect of big increases in their stock prices.
Administration officials have looked at ways to reduce dividend taxes that would primarily benefit small investors, but White House advisers say those would do little to correct distortions in the current system.
One option would be to eliminate taxes on the first $1,000 or $3,000 in dividend income. But White House officials think that approach would do little to reduce the distortions in the system because it would not change incentives for the big investors who actually reap most dividends.
Many outside economists agree. "There is a fundamental tension between the distributional effects of these measures and the incentive effect you are trying to achieve," said James Poterba, a professor of economics and public finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That the tax cuts themselves would flow overwhelmingly to the nation's wealthiest taxpayers is a fact that Democrats are sure to cite as evidence that the administration wants to cut taxes only for the rich.
Democratic lawmakers are pushing for tax measures that would benefit lower- and middle-income households, like a temporary "holiday" from Social Security taxes or a temporary exemption for the first several thousand dollars in taxable income.
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research group backed by labor unions, said the entire complaint about "double taxation" was dubious because corporations make such heavy use of legal tax shelters and loopholes.
Although the top corporate tax rate is 35 percent, the average tax rate is only about 15 percent, Mr. McIntyre has estimated on the basis of analyzing corporate tax data.
"Don't worry about the double tax," Mr. McIntyre said. "Worry about the half tax."
But business groups have themselves often been lukewarm about cutting dividend taxes as well, pushing harder for more direct benefits like faster write-offs on new equipment or reductions in overall corporate tax rates.
This year, business lobbyists say they support a cut in the dividend taxes -- but not at the expense of other measures that would cut business taxes more directly.
If President Bush has his way, the dividend tax cut will be a permanent change to the tax code. The only reason Mr. Bush may settle for less is that the Senate's complex rules on filibustering make it easier to pass a tax measure that has time limits.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Oil Chief Says He Will Make Big Changes 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Venezuela's chief oil official, Ali Rodriguez, said today that he would begin sweeping changes -- including laying off workers and hiring foreign specialists -- in response to the national strike that has battered the state-owned oil company for most of the month. 
 In an interview with American reporters, Mr. Rodriguez, president of the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, acknowledged that the strike, aimed at forcing President Hugo Chavez to resign and call new elections, had brought the company close to collapse. Crude exports have plummeted, he said, from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to fewer than 2 million barrels this month, and refineries, wells and tankers are all but unmanned and inoperable. 
 The crisis here has pushed crude oil prices to more than $30 a barrel.
When asked about the lines of cars that stretch for miles outside most Venezuelan gas stations, Mr. Rodriguez, who was appointed by Mr. Chavez, acknowledged that the country had come close to chaos. He blamed strike leaders and said they would be prosecuted for conspiring to overthrow the government.
Openly beleaguered and outraged, Mr. Rodriguez offered a stark contrast to the demeanor of Mr. Chavez, who routinely plays down the effects of the strike.
Mr. Rodriguez, who once took part in guerrilla movements and later became the president of OPEC, saved his most bitter remarks for the oil executives he said were leading the strike and trying, in his eyes, to use oil to take over the country.
Speaking in his office, Mr. Rodriguez said he had suspended several striking oil executives. He also said the government was preparing to sue some strike leaders for $1.3 billion in damages and, in some cases, pursue criminal prosecutions.
"They have begun to use oil as a political weapon," he said. "In Venezuela, a group of managers, taking advantage of their positions, decided to use Venezuelan oil as a political weapon to impose their will on the state and on society."
However, Mr. Rodriguez contended, the strike organizers failed. He said that the government, which has had the support of the armed forces during the conflict, had begun to regain control of the facilities and that operations would quickly return to normal. 
He pledged that Venezuelans would have fresh gasoline supplies by next week. He also urged Venezuela's international clients to stay patient and said exports would climb to normal levels by next month.
"I would say, in the month of January, we will have completely normalized the flow," he said. "I'm talking about the exports of crude. It will take time to restart the wells and to equip the plants."
Privately, supporters of the strike said they had underestimated Mr. Chavez's ability to keep gas and oil flowing for this long, though at critically low levels. Political experts said the conflict between Mr. Chavez and his opponents had reached a kind of stalemate.
However, opposition leaders pledged to keep up the strike. Most also dismissed Mr. Rodriguez's expectations for the quick recovery of the nation's oil industry as pipe dreams.
"Starting the refineries is simply impossible in one month," said Horacio Medina, president of a leading oil workers' organization. "Supposing that in January the workers -- not some, but all -- returned to work, restarting the industry would take at least four months."
The interview with Mr. Rodriguez today provided the government's most frank assessment of the devastation at Venezuela's oil wells and refineries since the start of the strike, which was called by Mr. Chavez's opponents. Combined with several small victories by the government in recent days, Mr. Rodrguez's comments signaled that Mr. Chavez had gained momentum in the struggle to survive his latest and most dangerous political challenge.
When workers abandoned their posts at the state-owned oil company, they cut off the nation's lifeblood. Oil generates 80 percent of the government's export revenues and most of the money it needs for social programs and other obligations.
Mr. Rodriguez predicted that economic aftershocks of the strike would be felt through the first trimester of next year. He said operations were closed at the refining complex at Paraguana, considered one of the world's largest.
Shortages of gasoline, Mr. Rodriguez said, have forced Venezuela to begin buying imports for the first time since the 1940's. He added that the state-owned oil industry had defaulted on international oil commitments for the first time since the beginning of the last century.
Strike planners, Mr. Rodriguez said, had delivered a crippling blow. "The plan this group had was to paralyze the distribution of gas internally," he said. "These people know the business well, and they understood that if they paralyzed the distribution of gas it would create total chaos. It would generate a situation of anarchy that would show the government was incapable of guaranteeing the stability of the country, and provoke its overthrow."
Meanwhile, he said, the company's remaining workers face a "titanic effort" in trying to lift up a fallen giant. His strategy, he said, is to stabilize fuel supplies for domestic consumption, strengthening the government ability to ride out the strike while weakening an increasingly divided opposition.
He said he would seek the advice of foreign and national experts for a restructuring of the company that would cut costs and increase efficiency as well as make it less vulnerable to political storms. He gave few details on exactly how the company would be restructured but indicated that there would be worker layoffs and that some company-owned related businesses would be sold off. 
Mr. Chavez secured the support of the military and asked it to provide security at oil installations. On Sunday, Venezuela dispatched a ship filled with 500,000 barrels of crude to the United States, and another had begun loading 370,000 barrels headed for Chile. Replacement crews also began to recover and move tankers that had been under the control of striking workers. A few had begun delivering fuel at domestic ports.
Mr. Rodriguez said the company had begun rebuilding its labor force, with nonstriking workers, retirees and other former oil workers called back to service. Fewer than 20 percent of the management ranks had returned to work, Mr. Rodriguez said. But he said the passage of time had begun to shift attitudes among the rank and file. He also predicted that "the majority" of oil workers would be on duty by the second week of January.
