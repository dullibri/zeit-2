Cockpit Tape May Prompt F.B.I. to Take Over Inquiry
Government officials said the National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the F.B.I. to take over the case of EgyptAir Flight 990, after a review of the cockpit voice recorder. The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance, possibly a prayer. They said there were many questions about exactly what was said and what it meant, but they were concerned that the statement might be the last words of a pilot determined to destroy himself and the airplane. The crew's conversations, other than uneventful ones with air traffic controllers, were in Arabic, and senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of additional interpreters, they did not understand what was being said on the tape.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Close Little Changed Ahead of Fed Panel Meeting

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks closed little changed yesterday as investors waited for today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting that will decide the direction of interest rates.
"People were reluctant to take a stand one way or another for fear of being surprised by the Fed meeting when they just have a few hours to wait," said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company in New York, which manages $50 million. 
 The market was hindered by Microsoft, which fell after a report in Barron's said the software company could be worth almost one-third less if antitrust enforcers broke it up.
"All the stuff going on with Microsoft is giving the market pause" because the company is so large, Mr. Holland said. "It can stop the upward movement of the market."
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.57 points, to 10,760.75. The Nasdaq composite index declined 1.61 points, to 3,219.54. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.67 points, to 1,394.39. All three market measures moved between small gains and losses during the session. Eight stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 793 million shares traded on the Big Board, about average for the last three months.
The Ameritrade Holding Corporation rose 4 7/16, to 26 7/16, and TD Waterhouse Group rallied 2 3/8, to 19. The discount brokers said they would form an online investment bank with the Charles Schwab Corporation in an effort to sell more shares of initial public offerings directly to retail investors. Schwab rose 2 1/4, to 43 1/4.
Microsoft dropped 2 1/8, to 87 1/16, its eighth decline in nine days. David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco, told Barron's the value of the company's three major operations -- its Windows-related business, development and applications, and the Internet -- adds up to about $355 billion, 31 percent below its current market value.
Microsoft shares have fallen 5 percent since Nov. 5, when the judge found that Microsoft used its monopoly to squash competitors. The finding opened the way for sanctions that could include breaking up the company.
Global Crossing Ltd. rose 4 1/4, to 42 7/8, after saying it would form a $1.2 billion venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. to offer Internet-related services in Hong Kong and later in mainland China.
Oak Industries soared 19, to 68 3/4, after Corning Inc. agreed to buy the telecommunications equipment maker for $2 billion in stock and debt. Corning, the maker of fiber optic cable, will exchange $75 of its common stock for each Oak share. The offer represented a 51 percent premium to Oak's closing price of 49 3/4 on Friday. Corning fell 3 1/4 to 87 1/8.

Treasuries Are Flat
 By Dow Jones
Treasuries were little changed in quiet trading yesterday, as most market participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 4/32, to 101 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.02 percent from 6.03 percent on Friday.
Trading activity was said to be on the cautious side yesterday. Both investors and dealers are wary of building new positions in bonds because it is still unclear whether the policy-making committee will raise interest rates. The decision will be announced around 2:15 p.m.
"Very few people are willing to take any risk" by creating new positions ahead of the committee meeting, said Yasunori Sugi, a trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. REACHES AN ACCORD TO OPEN CHINA ECONOMY AS WORLDWIDE MARKET

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 15

 BODY:
American and Chinese negotiators reached a landmark agreement today that would open the economy of China, the world's most populous nation, to foreign competitors and would also make it a full partner in the world's trading system.
After six days of arduous negotiations, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, signed the papers at 3:50 p.m., shook hands and raised a Champagne toast to an agreement that capped 13 years of on-and-off negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
 Under the deal, Beijing would reduce tariffs on various industrial and agricultural products. It would also lift many of the barriers that have hamstrung American banks and insurance and telephone companies that want to expand their operations and investments in China.
In exchange, the United States agreed to support China's bid for membership in the global trade group, the 135-member organization that sets the rules for international commerce.
China still must complete agreements with the European Union, Canada and some developing countries, including Brazil, before its application can be taken up by the group's member states.
"Let me just say that this is a profound and historic moment in U.S.-China relations," said a clearly exultant Ms. Barshefsky, adding that the agreement would not only aid the economies of both countries, but also serve as an anchor in their tumultuous political relationship.
The last six days of day-and-night negotiations were conducted in a "win-win spirit," Mr. Shi said, "and finally we reached an agreement that serves the interests of both China and the United States."
For all the rejoicing, the agreement faces tough resistance in the United States, where it is opposed by labor unions and some critics of China. Congress will not vote on the deal itself, but must vote to put an end to its annual review of Chinese trade and to establish normal -- and permanent -- trade relations with Beijing.
For China, membership in the trade group would mean a long-sought acceptance into the "club" of world powers. The W.T.O.'s elaborate rules would help protect China from unfair trade policies abroad, but would also impose a body of international rules on China's own fitful progress toward a market economy.
The accord goes to the heart of China's transition to an open, market economy. It would put Beijing, for the first time, under the jurisdiction of the rules set by the World Trade Organization, which are enforced by a trade court.
Full membership would be a victory for President Jiang Zemin, who sees achieving economic modernization as his legacy even as he tries to ensure continuation of Communist rule. At the same time, membership would cheer the more liberal, reform-oriented factions led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, since it locks China onto a path that could force China's state-owned industries to become efficient.
The step is a politically risky one for China, coming at a time when those state-run companies are already shedding millions of workers.
For President Clinton, today's agreement provides a badly needed centerpiece to his fraying policy of engagement with China, offering the prospect of tangible gains to many companies and to consumers. It is also a stunning recovery from what his own top aides describe as a huge mistake: his decision to walk away from the surprisingly sweeping deal, largely identical to today's, offered in April by Mr. Zhu.
After the signing today, Ms. Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, the White House chief of economic policy -- who opposed the April deal and attended the talks as a symbol of Mr. Clinton's renewed commitment -- were driven to the secluded leadership compound for a brief meeting with Mr. Jiang, who twice in the past month conducted telephone talks with Mr. Clinton.
Speaking in Turkey today, Mr. Clinton said: "I think this is a good agreement for China, for America and for the world."
But Mr. Clinton's struggle to make this accord a central foreign policy achievement is far from over.
Congress will essentially review the accord when it prepares to vote on the biggest single American concession: granting permanent trading rights to China rather than reviewing those rights annually, a Capitol Hill ritual that has turned into an annual debate about human rights and arms proliferation.
Mr. Clinton has spoken often of "integrating China into the world economy" and gradually getting the country to embrace "the rule of law," starting with commercial law. But without closing a World Trade Organization agreement, his aides said, he would have little progress to point to.
The agreement may also help to repair the damage done to Chinese-American relations by charges of Chinese spying in the United States, the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May and China's continuing suspicion that the United States is attempting to "contain" Chinese military and economic power.
"Successful completion of W.T.O. will go a long way to smooth out some of the extreme oscillation that we have seen in Sino-American relations in recent years," said Joseph Fewsmith, a China expert at Boston University. "I think it gives us a chance to build some substance into a relationship that has been badly damaged."
Today's agreement is a huge step toward membership for China, but it very likely comes too late, experts said, for China to be admitted before Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade talks begins in Seattle.
But today's accord means that China can take a larger role in setting the agenda there. And past trade rounds have lasted for years.
From the beginning, the American goal was not just to press China for large reductions in tariffs on imported farm products and industrial goods like automobiles. In measures that may ultimately have a far more profound impact, China had to commit itself to allowing foreign companies to take majority investments in many industrial and service sectors.
The final six days, and usually nights, of negotiations went through several rough spots. Several times Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling suggested they were packing up to leave, threats Ms. Barshefsky said in an interview today were "largely tactical, to force the Chinese to make some progress."
"Clearly," she said, "they were not going to let us leave."
In an interview from Hong Kong today, Ms. Barshefsky said that the key Chinese player in the talks appeared to be Prime Minister Zhu, who twice stepped in to break an impasse and ultimately directed his negotiators to make several key concessions -- allowing American companies to take a 50 percent stake in China's booming telecommunications companies, for example. But all his decisions, analysts here said, were almost certainly cleared by the top party leadership.
The outlines of an agreement had been worked out last April, when Mr. Zhu visited Washington. But President Clinton backed away from any agreement at the time, fearing Congressional opposition. Most of today's pact follows the April understandings, and in resolving areas of continued dispute, Ms. Barshefsky asserted -- in a statement sure to be scrutinized by skeptics in Congress -- "I think we achieved an overall strengthening of this agreement."
The agreement involves a general reduction in China's import tariffs from the current average of 22.1 percent down to 17 percent, with tariffs on major American farm products cut sharply to 15 percent or less.
Tariffs on automobile imports, which now range up to 100 percent to protect China's inefficient producers, would be reduced over a six-year period to 25 percent, with the quickest reduction in the initial years. That is one year longer than China offered in April.
But equally important, American officials said, foreign auto companies and banks would for the first time be able to offer consumer loans for cars, a critical concession in a country where few can lay out the money for such a large purchase.
Thus, Chinese consumers may soon be buying General Motors cars, for example, with the "G.M.A.C." loans so familiar to Americans.
Two of the most contentious issues in recent days, Ms. Barshefsky said, involved the American demands for ways to respond to surges of imports into the United States and for use of a method to identify when the Chinese might be illegally selling products below cost, or "dumping."
China wanted such measures to phase out quickly, but in the end agreed to surge protections for a 12-year period, and the anti-dumping regime for 15 years. Without those concessions, Ms. Barshefsky told her Chinese counterparts, Congress could easily balk at the accord.
For the first time, China also agreed to allow foreign companies to distribute their own goods, rather than forcing them to distribute food or industrial components through Chinese companies. They would also be able to repair and support their products directly.
In terms of textiles, one of the most politically sensitive topics in the United States, it was the Americans calling for restrictions on free trade. The Chinese wanted to scale back the American demand to continue existing textile import quotas for another 10 years. In the end, the United States agreed to end quotas after five years, but with special anti-surge safeguards for another four years after that.
The anti-dumping and textile provisions are charged issues for Vice President Al Gore. He hopes to keep the support of organized labor in his presidential bid, but such groups oppose the trade accord.
Foreign investment in China's telecommunications sector had become a sore point inside China, where some saw it as an issue of national security. The Americans fought for 51 percent ownership rights -- which Mr. Zhu had offered in April -- but finally agreed that foreign firms could take up to 50 percent ownership of companies in this booming sector, beginning two years after China enters the trade organization.
"It became clear that this was an incredibly emotional issue for the Chinese," Mr. Sperling said in an interview.
Important provisions would open Chinese retail banking to foreign firms over several years, and also improve market access for insurance companies, and legal and accounting firms. But the American negotiators got far less in China's infant and high-risk financial securities market, where they would be limited to minority stakes in activities like underwriting stock issues.
For China -- which is still unraveling the legacy of Mao Zedong's cloistered, command economy -- entry into the World Trade Organization will carry profound implications.
Many economists here compare entry to Deng Xiaoping's landmark opening of the economy to market forces and foreign influence in the late 1970's.
"The opening of China to the outside world began with Mao Zedong's meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972," said Hu Angang, a leading economist here at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "The second major stage was marked by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States in 1979."
"Joining W.T.O. will represent a whole new stage in China's opening to the world," he said. "It will signify a shift from partial to comprehensive opening and reform," he said, "and a shift from an opening based on domestic rules to an opening based on internationally defined rules."
China's embrace of more open markets reflects the desire of President Jiang and other top leaders to push ahead with a radical overhaul of the domestic economy, opening it to global competition and bringing in more foreign capital and technology.
President Jiang and his fellow Communist Party leaders see economic transformation as vital if China is to become a great power in the century ahead. They also know that if they do not provide steadily rising incomes to their people, the party's rule is in trouble.
So the renewed opening is perhaps unavoidable, but it is a risky step for the leaders, who can expect to see some cherished state enterprises crushed even as others are energized. In the short run, at least, already impoverished farmers may be harmed by cheap imports and more urban workers might lose their jobs.
The impact of today's agreement on the power of Mr. Zhu, who is nominally number three in the party hierarchy, is unclear. Over the last six months or so, his influence appeared to slip, as the country took a more conservative and nationalistic turn, and Mr. Jiang took a stronger role in economic matters. By many accounts, Mr. Zhu lost his former control over policy on the World Trade Organization and the reform of state enterprises.
But Ms. Barshefsky said today that in a phone call between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang last month, "Jiang said that Zhu Rongji is in charge of these negotiations."
"And," she said, "it looked very much as if he had taken ownership of it."
Today's agreement put Mr. Zhu and his ideas back in the limelight, but Chinese television reports this evening featured President Jiang, and both Chinese and foreign analysts continue to speculate about power shifts in the secretive Communist hierarchy.
On paper, the changes China has promised are breathtaking in scope. But even the most optimistic American officials concede that threatened ministries and provinces are likely to find ways to delay implementation of many provisions. This suspicion is likely to feed controversy in the United States about the pact.
Still, both Democrats and Republicans say the agreement will almost certainly be approved in Congress sometime early next year, after a spirited debate.

HEADLINE: Chinese Stocks Surge 9% On the Hong Kong Market

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Shares of Chinese and China-related companies surged here today as investors concluded that a landmark trade agreement between the United States and China -- and the competition it promises -- would help Chinese companies more than it would hurt them.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's "red chip" index, which tracks the performance of Hong Kong-based, Chinese-controlled companies, soared 9.8 percent after the news broke that American and Chinese negotiators had achieved a deal in Beijing after six days of talks. The H share index, which tracks companies based in mainland China, jumped 9.69 percent. 
 Hong Kong's broader Hang Seng index rose 2.64 percent, to close at 14,564.79 -- its highest close in more than two years. Shares also rose strongly on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, though not as spectacularly as China-related stocks in the Hong Kong market.
 The Hong Kong market was stronger in morning trading on Tuesday, with the Hang Seng up seven-tenths of a percent at noon.
Analysts said that the trade agreement, which removes a major barrier to China's entry into the World Trade Organization, would strengthen Chinese companies, simply by exposing them to competition. Although few details of the agreement have been disclosed, officials said it would open China's telecommunications, banking and insurance industries to American companies.
"If China joins the trading world, its companies are going to be forced to change," said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter here.
Such optimism is far from conventional wisdom in mainland China. Indeed, a main reason this trade agreement took so long to reach was that some Chinese government officials feared that the country's state-owned corporations -- many of them bloated relics of a command economy -- would be thrashed by more nimble rivals from the United States or Europe.
Those fears have not gone away. But Mr. Xie said they were outweighed by the prospect that foreign companies could help Chinese companies as partners or investors. One of the oft-mentioned candidates for such a partnership, China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd., recorded an 8.5 percent increase in its shares.
China Telecom is a prime example of a company that could be transformed by China's entry into the World Trade Organization. As the dominant player in China's burgeoning mobile phone business, it would be an instant candidate for an alliance with a European or American cellular carrier, when outsiders are allowed to own stakes in Chinese telecommunications providers.
As if to dramatize that point, one of Hong Kong's leading telecommunications providers, Hutchinson Whampoa Ltd., announced a $1.2 billion joint venture today with Global Crossing Ltd., the operator of a worldwide fiber optic network. The new venture, to be called China Crossing, will build a high-speed fiber optic voice and data network, initially in Hong Kong but later aiming at the mainland China market.
Some analysts contend that Chinese fears of foreign competition are overblown. American companies have stumbled in China in businesses as diverse as insurance and beer, and not always because of trade barriers.
"The obstacles to making money in China are not just those that have to be removed as part of W.T.O. accession," said Richard Margolis, a regional strategist at Merrill Lynch here. He cited issues like pricing and marketing.
Not all the Chinese companies that benefited from today's announcement are on the frontier of technology or communications. Two old-style shipping companies, Cosco Pacific and China Shipping Development, recorded 12 percent and 13.69 percent increases in their shares, respectively, because of hopes that the trade pact would expand the amount of cargo flowing between the United States and China.
Mr. Xie said the agreement also raised the odds that several big Chinese state-owned companies would be able to issue shares in the Hong Kong market the next year. Beijing hopes to raise more than $20 million by offering shares in companies like China National Petroleum and the Bank of China.

HEADLINE: DEAL ON U.N. DUES BREAKS AN IMPASSE AND DRAWS CRITICS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
A fragile deal between the White House and House Republicans to end a fight over abortion and United Nations dues drew scathing criticism today from abortion rights advocates and cutting reviews from Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley.
Both sides today claimed victory after breaking an impasse that will free nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United Nations, an issue that threatened to undermine America's global reputation and a year-end budget agreement. 
 The deal still has a few crucial loose ends, like the timing of the repayment of the back dues and a dispute over debt relief to the world's most impoverished nations.
But its central element would put into law a ban on United States money going to international organizations that promote abortion rights. Until the agreement is completed, the long-term impact of the measure remains uncertain.
For now, the compromise appears to pave the way to end a long-running dispute that has threatened to strip the United States of its vote in the United Nations General Assembly unless it pays before Dec. 31. The seat and vote in the Security Council are not affected.
The criticism from Mr. Bradley and Mr. Gore underscore Mr. Gore's desire to avoid giving his Democratic rival any opening to exploit. As Mr. Gore's presidential campaign heats up, he has been more willing to take positions that diverge from President Clinton's.
Speaking to employees at Microsoft in Seattle today, Mr. Gore would not directly answer whether he supported the deal brokered by a White House House deputy chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti. "I do not favor bargaining away any critical policy aspect of a women's right to choose," Mr. Gore said.
A senior Gore adviser said the vice president had expressed "strong reservations" about the deal, and while heaping most of the blame on Republicans said Mr. Gore "opposed what the White House ended up doing."
While Mr. Gore has tried to distance himself from Mr. Clinton on the issue of the president's personal conduct, this policy is probably the one on which he has set his own position most distinctly.
Under a compromise struck late Sunday, a ban on United States financing to international organizations that promote abortion rights would be written into law, but only for one year, a triumph for House conservatives led by Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, who for three years has insisted on conditioning the payment of the United Nations dues on these terms.
Under the agreement, the bill includes $385 million that a State Department agency, the Agency for International Development, awards to women's health groups abroad. The two sides agreed that if Mr. Clinton invoked a waiver so the money would go to those groups, $12.5 million, just over 3 percent of the total, would be removed and given to a separate children's health fund, also administered by the Agency for International Development.
If the deal is completed, Mr. Clinton is expected to invoke such a waiver.
Mr. Smith and his colleagues had initially sought to restrict the full $385 million, then later tried to set the amount diverted at $100 million.
If Mr. Clinton invokes a waiver, the agreement caps at $15 million the total amount of money that the United States would give to organizations that perform abortions or lobby for changes in abortion laws overseas.. Administration officials said it was unlikely the cap would be met and health services would be only minimally affected. But abortion-rights supporters said the provision would have a chilling effect on family-planning activities overseas, from sponsoring conferences to publishing safe-sex pamphlets.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has aggressively lobbied Mr. Clinton to repay Washington's debt and has volunteered to be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion rights groups, defended the compromise.
"The agreement that I hope will come out will not interfere with family planning around the world and that it will have minimal effect," Dr. Albright told reporters traveling with Mr. Clinton in Turkey.
Abortion rights advocates denounced the deal as a sellout of principle to appease a small band of Republicans, which will endanger the lives of women in developing countries who rely on international family planning groups.
"Women's lives have once again been sacrificed for political expediency," said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which uses less than 1 percent of its funds for abortion services.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who telephoned the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, to demand a meeting on Tuesday, said, "Administration negotiators paid an unjustifiable, high-cost ransom to a small number of extreme-right, anti-choice lawmakers."
The Agency for International Development says that family planning programs, which it oversees, have helped prevent unintended pregnancies in more than 70 countries, and have increased the use of contraceptives in those countries to 40 percent from 10 percent 34 years ago.
Some Democrats expressed pessimism about reaching a final deal.
"The more I get into the details, the more difficult it is to resolve," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. "We've got too much talking on camera, including by the secretary of state."
The issue exploded on the campaign trail today as a potentially divisive issue between the two Democratic presidential candidates.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Bradley, Kristen Ludecke, said the former New Jersey senator opposed the tentative deal and cited his remarks on Sunday.
"I would not support it if I was there," Mr. Bradley said on CNN's "Late Edition." "A woman's right to choose is absolutely essential, and I think family planning for the rest of the world, if we wanted to provide it, should be permissible."
House conservatives expressed cautious optimism that they had won their biggest victory on the issue since Mr. Clinton rescinded a 1984 executive order by President Ronald Reagan that denied grants to international organizations for any purpose if they promoted abortion rights.
The United States has barred direct financing for abortions since 1973, but Mr. Reagan advanced that policy by adopting what has become known as "Mexico City" because he announced the executive order during a United Nations conference there.
"It's as close as we've been to reinstating the language of Mexico City since Bill Clinton became president," said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential front-runner, said Mr. Bush "would support reinstating the executive order banning the use of taxpayer money to promote abortions in foreign countries."
The agreement is tied to a separate bill that would authorize the State Department to repay the $926 million debt to the United Nations over three years. The first installment from that bill combined with money from a second spending bill, that covers the costs of the Commerce, State and Justice departments, would be enough to prevent Washington from losing its General Assembly vote, administration officials said.
"U.S. foreign policy is on a little firmer ground with this news," said Linda S. Jamison, executive director of the Emergency Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of the United Nations.
Two of Mr. Clinton's key Senate allies, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and Joseph R. Biden, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, also voiced support for the deal.
"Somebody has to give, and there is give here on both sides," said Mr. Daschle. "It's a pretty good deal."
In defending the deal, administration officials said they could shield international groups from financial cuts by defining which organizations are affected and how lobbying for abortions rights is defined.
Moreover, they said the deal expires after a year, when all sides agreed the fight would be joined again.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE CHINESE;
Joy, Worry and Indifference in Streets of Beijing

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Many Chinese were pinching themselves this afternoon, filled with disbelief that after more than a decade of false starts, China had actually taken the plunge into the international economy, signing a landmark trade agreement with the United States.
On a chilly gray afternoon in Beijing, many people were ebullient when they first heard the news. For most people, it raised the prospect of new opportunities to make money as well as new chances to consume. The agreement drops many current restrictions on trade and investment and reduces import taxes. 
 "It's signed?" said Li Dayong, 29, who works for an American pharmaceutical firm. "That's great! I'm thrilled! We've been wanting this for so many years."
Some took a macro view, welcoming the treaty as a sign of bigger things: China's new economic muscle, an immutable commitment to further economic reform and a renewal of relations with the United States that had been ravaged by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May.
But Beijingers also seemed keenly aware that there will be individual winners and losers along China's new path. Most are paying careful attention to the micro view, calculating what the trade agreement -- which is widely expected to lead to World Trade Organization membership -- means for them.
"This is great news: I had planned to change my Daewoo for a better car soon and now I'll buy an imported American one," said Xu Yiang, a stock investor, referring to the car he now owns.
Mr. Xu said he also plans to change his investment strategy, buying telecommunications stocks that he deems likely to attract foreign investment.
But Luan Wenqiang, a worker at the Beijing Light Truck Company, predicted that the agreement would drive him out of his already tenuous job. "Our factory is already in bad shape," he said. "Most workers are on leave and are called back only when there is work to do. This will open China to better and cheaper U.S. trucks. I don't believe we will survive."
Under the agreement, duties on imported vehicles will drop dramatically, from the current rate of 80 to 100 percent.
For the hundreds of millions of Chinese who farm the land or work as low-wage laborers in small cities and towns, today's triumphant treaty was a big bang in another universe -- although many will probably feel its effects.
Half a dozen migrant workers interviewed in Beijing said they had never heard of the trade organization, which has had only fleeting recent mention in the press despite the frantic negotiations here.
"It has nothing to do with my life," said a middle-aged man, a worker in a small machine factory, strapping a huge box of cabbage to the back of an ancient bicycle.
The new treaty will certainly bring both new investment and intense competition to China and the outcome will vary from industry to industry. But many corporate leaders seemed to relish the challenge of being able to compete in the world arena.
"I'm extremely happy to hear about this," said Duan Yongji, the Chairman of China's giant Stone Group, a technology company. "Everyone knows that entry will make the country more open and that will bring more competitive pressure.
"But we shouldn't need a greenhouse to protect us. And we also hope that entry will open more opportunities for collaboration and cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies."
Mr. Duan added that, at a personal level, he was relieved to hear the government renew its vows, so to speak, to principles like economic overhaul and engagement with the West. The Chinese government has often appeared lukewarm on such concepts.
In Beijing's business districts, many owners of small businesses likewise focused more on the opportunities of today's deal than its risks.
Many foreign companies have opened offices here in the last five years -- though their activities were extremely circumscribed by Chinese law -- gambling that this huge economy would one day open. Today people dared to imagine the payoff.
Li Dayong, an American drug company employee, said that until today his company has not been able to import many of its medicines to China. "Now I think it should become easier to bring foreign medical products in," he said.
Dai Liming, 35, well dressed in a sweater vest and suit, saw only possibilities when he heard the news. Mr. Dai, who works as a representative for a domestic trading company, predicted that "the deal will bring my company new opportunities for foreign trade."
But others offered more sober assessments, noting that many of China's service industries -- from insurance to the Internet to personal banking -- are young and ill prepared to compete on the world stage.
"We are already facing fierce competition from foreign companies in some areas and if further concessions are made in the insurance sector we'll be facing a grimmer future," said Lu Youquan, manager of Antai Life Insurance Company in Shanghai.

HEADLINE: City's Teachers Perform Poorly On State Exams

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Not only does New York City have a disproportionate number of uncertified teachers, but those who do pass the state certification exams tend to score much lower than their counterparts in the suburbs and upstate, according to state data that is to be placed into evidence today in a landmark school-financing case.
The data shows that 31 percent of teachers in the city's public schools failed the main certification exam -- the liberal arts and sciences test -- at least once, compared with only 4.7 percent of teachers elsewhere in the state. About 47 percent of city teachers who took the state certification test for math failed at least once, compared with about 21 percent of teachers elsewhere. And 26.9 percent of city teachers who took the state test that measures elementary teaching skills failed, compared with 3 percent elsewhere. 
 The plaintiffs in the case say the statistics show that prospective teachers who excel on the certification exams gravitate toward the more selective suburban systems, where they can command salaries much higher than city schools offer. The starting salary for New York City teachers is $30,807 -- roughly 25 percent less than starting salaries in affluent suburban counties like Westchester and Suffolk.
The plaintiffs cautioned yesterday that the data did not reflect the scores of all 75,000 teachers in the New York City school system, because the state has tracked the scores of city teachers only since 1989. But they said the data provided a comprehensive look at the qualifications of city teachers, and maintained that the city's failure to attract better teachers was the result of its low pay scales and poor working conditions.
"This shows what everyone has known intuitively for a long time," said Joseph Wayland, the plaintiffs' chief lawyer, "which is that New York City is simply not attracting the most qualified teachers. It shows that New York City doesn't have enough money, so it is forced to buy an inferior teacher product."
The civil lawsuit, which is being heard by Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the most serious challenge yet to the state's system of financing public schools.
The plaintiffs, a coalition of advocacy groups called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, contend that city schools need significantly more state aid to provide the "sound, basic education" required by the State Constitution.
Under the current formula, the city gets 35.5 percent of the state's education aid even though it enrolls 38 percent of the state's public school children, according to the lawsuit; increasing the city's share of aid to 38 percent would provide $318 million more annually.
In particular, the plaintiffs contend that the state does not provide New York City with enough money to meet rigorous new curriculum standards.
But lawyers for the state have said the new standards represent "exceptionally high aspirations" and students are required to receive only a "minimally adequate" education under the State Constitution. The Legislature already provides more than enough aid for city students to meet that goal, the lawyers say.
Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said he had no comment on the test score data because state lawyers had not seen it.
Prospective teachers usually take their certification tests toward the end of college, or, if they are becoming teachers later in life, in the months before they apply for a job. If they fail, they may still be hired, but they are expected to take the tests again during their first year.
If they have not passed the tests after four years, the state usually removes them from the system, although New York City has gotten waivers in recent years to allow uncertified teachers to stay in the system longer.
Board of Education officials did not dispute the data. They said they were developing recruitment strategies that they hoped would lure more talented teachers to the struggling system.
But Lewis H. Spence, the deputy schools chancellor for operations, said the city would never attract enough qualified teachers unless it significantly increased starting salaries, which are negotiated by the teachers' union and City Hall, not the Board of Education.
"The data confirms our worst fears," said Mr. Spence, who added that New York City does not require teacher applicants to submit their certification test scores. "When you are the least competitive urban school system in the country in terms of teacher salary, you suffer terribly in terms of the average level of preparation and qualification."
Officials at the United Federation of Teachers complained that the data did not provide an accurate picture because it focused on scores from only the last 10 years. But Randi Weingarten, the union president, agreed that the data showed that the city pays teachers far too little.
"Our teachers are dedicated and hard-working," Ms. Weingarten said in a statement. "But it is true that as the salary gap has grown between our system and suburban areas, more and more teachers who have joined the school system in the last 10 years have come in without full qualifications or academic preparation."
About 12 percent, or 10,000, of the city's teachers are uncertified. Because senior teachers can often choose which schools they teach in, many of the uncertified teachers work in the schools with the poorest children and the lowest student performance. The data to be submitted as testimony today shows that even many of the certified teachers in those schools just barely passed their certification exams.
The data, which was analyzed by Hamilton Lankford, an economics professor at the State University of New York in Albany, also shows that city teachers in schools with large numbers of white students generally scored much higher on the certification tests than those in schools whose student bodies were overwhelmingly black and Hispanic.
Several national studies have suggested that having certified teachers is a better guarantee of high student achievement than several other factors, including small class size.
But Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said it was not clear whether the teachers with the highest scores on certification exams were better than those with mediocre scores.
"What the research shows," he said, "is that uncertified teachers do less well in the classroom than certified teachers."
The new data comes at a time when the state is setting higher standards for teachers and education schools.
State officials say that tougher teaching standards are necessary if students are to meet challenging new educational standards, including more difficult reading and math tests and a requirement that high school students pass Regents exams in five subject areas.
Beginning in the current school year, at least 80 percent of the students who graduate from New York State teaching programs must pass the state licensing exam for teachers or that teaching school can be put on probation for three years and then shut down.
At least two dozen of New York's 113 teacher education programs are in danger of losing their accreditation, including several at the City University of New York.
According to the data compiled for the school-financing lawsuit, 45 percent of New York City teachers earned their college degrees from CUNY. The new standards are expected to have a major effect in the next five years, as about half of the city's teaching force becomes eligible for retirement.
"We are going to have to replace them with teachers hired at a time when we are at the worst competitive disadvantage of any major school system in country," Mr. Spence said.
"There is no question that we need better teacher pay if we want not just a decent, but an outstanding public education system."

HEADLINE: After Med School, the A B C's of Insurance

SERIES: LIFE, DEATH AND MANAGED CARE: 'Something Has to Give' -- Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
The investigators came late last January, on a Thursday. They were deliberately cryptic. All they would tell St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was that they were looking into a possible violation of the federal "anti-dumping" law, which prohibits hospitals from refusing to at least examine and stabilize patients who cannot pay. It was serious business. Only a handful of cases were investigated each year. Not until the investigators left did the hospital learn what it was all about.
The previous July, a French woman in her 40's had come to the emergency room with abdominal pain. Pelvic cancer was suspected, and she was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology floor, where the diagnosis was confirmed. A private doctor, along with the house staff, attended to her. The doctor concluded that she needed surgery within several weeks followed by chemotherapy. The woman had no insurance. The senior physician discharged her, and left a note on the woman's chart saying she had instructed her to obtain health insurance or go to a public hospital. 
 Investigators determined that when the woman left the hospital, on Manhattan's West Side, she had barely been able to walk. That same day, she went to Bellevue Hospital Center, a city facility, where surgeons operated immediately. Officials there felt the woman had been treated unlawfully by St. Luke's-Roosevelt and complained to the State Health Department.
The agency's investigators spent five days at St. Luke's and issued a harsh report criticizing the care of the French woman but also identifying much else they didn't like -- tardy treatment of patients in the E.R., poor record-keeping, uninsured patients being told they would have to pay at least $400 and then leaving the E.R. without being examined. The hospital was ordered to put new policies into effect or be cut off Medicare, an action that, in effect, would close it down.
Hospital administrators felt their decision on the uninsured woman had been a judgment call -- that she was not in imminent danger and had time to make arrangements to enter another hospital -- although they acknowledged that doctors should have helped her transfer. And the documentation was sloppy. The hospital believed the woman had been given more care than her chart indicated.
In March, new procedures took effect in the E.R. Dr. Edward Lathan heard about them at the weekly department meeting. The supervisors didn't dive right into the issue: First there was a presentation about assessing a patient's airway to determine the difficulty of inserting a breathing tube. Slides were shown of potential patients. Hillary Clinton's face flicked on the screen. "Easy for the anatomy, difficult because of the hype," one intern volunteered. Prince Charles ("May have receding mandible and therefore difficult"). Linus ("His head is too big for his body").
Then an administrator related the case of the French woman. He told the residents that under no circumstances was anyone to be turned away again for lack of money.
A third-year resident spoke up: "This is similar to what we do every day in the E.R. Someone comes in and needs a root canal and has no insurance. I say, 'You can go to our dental clinic, but you'll get a bill. I suggest you go to a city hospital,' and I give them some names."
"And you're not going to say that anymore," he was told. "I have been informed that our clinics will see any and all referrals from the E.R." (Actually, this might have been more than the regulators were insisting on, but the hospital wanted to do too much rather than too little.)
As Dr. Lathan began his shift that day, changes were already manifest. At the check-in counter, there had been phones and a list of managed-care companies' phone numbers so patients could call for authorization. The insurers wanted these phones, and of course the hospital did, too, for they made reimbursement easier. The Health Department, however, saw them as an impediment to care. The lists were stripped away. The phones were dismantled. No longer was there to be any discussion of money before a patient was examined. At a time when everything about medicine seemed to come down to money, the word was to be taboo on the doctors' tongues.
The investigators also were unhappy that, life-threatening emergencies aside, the hospital had no guidelines for how quickly patients were to be examined. They singled out a number of troubling cases, including that of a patient who had what he described as "the worst headache of my life" and waited eight hours to be treated for what turned out to be a brain hemorrhage.
Accordingly, new time dimensions were adopted. "Urgent" patients, less dire than emergencies, were to be seen within an hour, "nonurgent" patients within four. Emergency or urgent patients who got fed up waiting and left would be "called and requested to return." If they had no phone, the hospital was to send a telegram.
As part of its remedial plan, the hospital created a video explaining the anti-dumping law and promised to show it to the entire staff. The interns saw it during regular conferences. But no mention was made of the case of the French woman or the state investigation. Dr. Jennifer James and Dr. Bryan Holland, in the medicine and pediatrics departments, gave the video no particular attention. To them it seemed like just one more standard bit of preaching.
 
Food, Glorious Food
The Gin Mill bar on 83rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue was a hive of activity, especially in the rackety back area where the interns congregated. It was Residents' Happy Hour, courtesy of Pfizer. Pretty much every Wednesday, one of the drug houses sponsored a Happy Hour, when the interns could drink and attack a buffet table.
A young, primly dressed Pfizer representative stamped Dr. James's hand, her ticket to free drinks, and gave her a brochure on Norvasc, a hypertension drug. She deposited it in her pocket. She was here to socialize. She scooted to the bar, then dissolved into the merry assemblage of murmuring interns pouring wine and beer down their gullets. There was infinite gossip to absorb -- could you believe that resident who was hitting on two interns? There were pictures to study -- one intern had just married in Japan and had brought his album.
They lined up for food.
There was no understanding interns without understanding their obsession with food. Since they never had time to eat, they thought about it constantly. One of two things generally happened during internship: You gained weight because all you ate was junk food, or you lost weight because you skipped so many meals.
Thus it was a well-known fact that the best way to fill a room with residents was to bait the room with food. Planning a lecture on bladder catheterization? Order pizza and make sure there are plenty of seats.
One particular species willing to provide consumables was the pharmaceutical salesman. Eager to impress on the doctors the illimitable virtues of their drugs, they materialized almost daily during lunchtime. In the late morning, just when a shudder of hunger possessed the interns, the magic words would reverberate over the public address system: "Lunch for the house staff will be served in conference room B at noon." The meaning was clear. A drug rep was here. Free food!
In fact, the interns dictated the menu. Fridays, for instance, they normally insisted on Chinese.
The interns felt they were crossing no ethical lines. They had essentially no say in which drugs were put on the hospital's approved list anyway. "I come to see the other interns and to eat," Dr. James said.
The drug reps were not the only visitors. One day, John Hancock came peddling insurance and mutual funds to an audience commonly boasting negative net worths. Still, the room was full. The company had brought Indian food.
 
'A Little Gastric Upset'
At the monthly meeting for the medicine residents, it was the same nagging issues. The residents were admonished about the need to discharge patients in a timely manner. The all-important length of stay (L.O.S.) averages had been creeping up, particularly among Medicare patients. In 1992, the hospital's L.O.S. was 14 days, and it was now a little over 6, but that was still above the national average. Keep someone too long and the hospital ate the bill.
Recently, in an unsubtle way of shaming the laggards, St. Luke's had resumed sending L.O.S. report cards to the "attendings," as the senior staff doctors were known. The residents got their own promptings: "Anyone who discharges someone today gets a second free sandwich."
But it was hard to make the residents care too deeply about medicine's new economics, about managed care's "Mother, may I?" protocols. Their income remained at the same low level no matter how many patients they treated or how fast they treated them. They were still infused with medical-school idealism. To a certain extent, they felt encased in a magic membrane that shielded them from reality, being taught by doctors who were unsure how -- and often less than entirely willing -- to teach for the new medical world.
Dr. Michael Lesch, the chairman of the department of medicine, struggled in his own mind about how much he was willing to adapt. He labored hard at getting his department's L.O.S. in line. (As he put it, "This is no longer a hotel.") But when he got deep into a discussion of managed care, he would get riled and say, "I teach them medicine. Managed care is not medicine."
He would say, "I'm struggling personally to define those elements of the growth cycle of the residents that I can't compromise, so when they get out of here I'm proud of them."
On close inspection, there was something of a generation gap among the attending physicians. Some younger ones did not quite share the older doctors' virulent feelings about the new age. Even so, the interns heard almost nothing but grumbling from attendings, even young ones, about the changed ways, and often Dr. James said to herself, "Enough already." One day an attending cornered her in the hallway and began moaning about how he was making so much less money and how horrible his life had become. "What am I supposed to do," Dr. James thought, "not become a doctor?"
Still, from their own rush of experiences, the interns had begun to adopt their own biases toward managed care. In tallying up the risk factors of a new patient, Dr. James and her friends joked that if the person was covered by a certain managed-care company, they would consider that a risk factor like smoking or obesity.
All manner of mixed signals were constantly filtering down to the impressionable interns. One morning, after an intern informed her attending doctor that her patient was ready to leave, the attending said he wanted her to stay another day. He wanted to take a picture of the woman's exotic, looping toenails but had forgotten his camera. The intern was astonished that someone was being kept in the hospital for a snapshot of her toenails. To Dr. James, this one set of toenails seemed to reverberate with the growing disharmony of the times. On one rotation, Dr. James reported to a third-year resident, who repeatedly told her, "This is a teaching hospital. If you're just curious, order the test." Dr. James would roll her eyes, and think, "Whatever."
With staffing tight, the attending doctors were stretched as thin as the residents, and it was an issue trying to get them to teach enough hours. Private attendings rarely taught anymore, as they once voluntarily did. And many staff attendings would spend an hour on rounds and then be swallowed up by an increasing weight of responsibilities -- private patients, paperwork, research. They would write a progress note only when a patient was admitted. Dr. Lesch importuned them to write daily notes, as the interns did; the hospital could bill for them. Eyes lifted. Medicaid would pay $7 a note. Eyes lowered. Dr. Lesch wondered how some attendings even knew the patients. How could they teach the interns how to interact with patients when they didn't interact with them?
He recognized that what the interns saw and heard was frequently contradictory. But he did not have the answers. "They have to find their own values," he said. "They have to find how far they will go before they compromise. I hope I at least give them a little gastric upset."
 
Internship: The Bottom Line
One of his clinic patients paid in cash -- $67.50. Seeing actual money change hands, Dr. Holland felt good. "I'm bringing in money for the hospital," he quipped.
Given their low pay and handyman job description, the interns assumed they were big moneymakers for St. Luke's. And compared with attending doctors, they were a bargain, enough so that more were being graduated than society could absorb.
Nodding to concerns about a doctor glut, New York was in the midst of a federal experiment in which the government was paying the state's teaching hospitals to reduce their residents by a fourth. Yet more than half of the enlisted hospitals had withdrawn, unable to make the economics work. After scaling back its interns, St. Luke's was going to raise the number next year. Even so, the hospital was having an increasingly hard time breaking even on its residents.
The algorithm computed by the financial staff went like this: it cost about $184,165 a year to train an intern. There was the modest salary of $39,270, the proportionate expense of an attending doctor, malpractice premiums and various other expenses like the high technology and the inevitable excess of tests and longer patient stays.
Some 80 percent of the cost was covered by Medicaid and Medicare and the rest by private insurers, through a special state tax. In this stubborn new environment, though, they were reducing the level of payment.
As it was, St. Luke's calculated that it actually lost about $1,500 per intern. It tried to economize. The rule of thumb used to be that residents ordered every test known to man times two. While attendings no longer allowed as many tests, studies suggested that residents still ordered about 20 percent more than doctors at nonteaching hospitals.
With further funding cuts looming, there was not much more the interns could be asked to do other than swab the floors.
 
'Another Medical Triumph'
One afternoon, Dr. James joined the others for Intern Report, in which an intern presented one of her cases. Dr. Gregory Steinberg, associate director of medicine, moderated.
The intern recited the bare facts: a 39-year-old man whose chief complaint was he felt sick for five days and was getting worse. He had no significant medical history. He had a throbbing headache, chest pain, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. He smoked crack and marijuana and occasionally slept on the street, where he was exposed to pigeons and rats.
"What do pigeons do for you?" Dr. Steinberg said. "What do rats do?"
"Plague," someone suggested.
"There's not too much plague in New York," Dr. Steinberg pointed out.
What sort of people were exposed to rat urine?
One intern said, "Swimmers."
"Swimmers?" Dr. Steinberg said. "Where do you do your swimming?"
The correct answer was sanitation workers and those who work in sewers.
The man was administered antibiotics, though his diagnosis remained unclear. Tests were done. Day by day, he began feeling better.
"What are we treating?" Dr. Steinberg asked. "At God knows what cost per day? We're treating us. We're feeling better because he's feeling better."
Insurers were howling to get patients discharged swiftly, but the house staff wanted to learn. When oddities arose, curious tangents not always clinically relevant, the interns investigated at their leisure, sometimes forgetting about the patient, never thinking about dollars and cents.
By Day 12, this patient was feeling much better and was discharged. The assumption was that he had leptospirosis, an infection that rats can transmit.
"So we did nothing for him but gave him antibiotics, and he probably would have gotten better without them," Dr. Steinberg said. "Another medical triumph. We did nothing. The patient got better."
 
Children, Checks and Balances
He had been drinking. The police found him passed out on the subway and brought him in. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit for an adult. He was 12.
Dr. Holland visited him in his room. He was seeking precipitating events. It was a fragile moment. "Kids start with one thing and then move on to drugs and who knows what," he said. "You want to stop it right away."
The boy insisted he was just experimenting. He was getting good grades in school. Dr. Holland learned from the parents that they were having marital discord. That might be part of it. The boy squirmed and smiled weakly as Dr. Holland spoke indignantly of the evils of alcohol. Truth was, social work was part of being a doctor, too.
Outside the room, Dr. Holland was quiet. "I think he'll be O.K.," he said. "He's clearly smart and well-mannered. He said he was never doing this again. I think he'll be too scared to."
Later, after a shift in the clinic, Dr. Holland and the other doctors clattered into a small back office for a soda. With the inevitability of gravity, the conversation turned to the problems of medicine.
The attending on duty, a young woman from India, mentioned how she recently did a blood screening for a child and the insurer wouldn't pay for it.
" 'Not indicated,' they said," she complained with deep sourness. "And it was absolutely needed. It's really bad out there."
Dr. Holland gave a wry smile: "Down with the insurance companies."
The attending went on, "It's good that something came along, because we needed checks and balances. There was a lot of waste in the system. But they've gone too far."
Her own son had been hospitalized for pneumonia while visiting India and her insurer had refused to cover it. "I fought for a year and two months to be paid," she said. "I nagged them every week. Then I threatened to report them to the attorney general. I got a check in two weeks."
"I'm learning," Dr. Holland said. "Threaten, threaten."
"It's amazing what they get away with," the attending said. "Most people don't have the knowledge to fight. I'm in the business."
There was an exaggerated silence. After a while, the attending said: "The administration calls here all the time and they want numbers. They want patients every 20 minutes. They're constantly looking for numbers. Some socially deprived children need 45 minutes or an hour. I'm supposed to teach the interns, and I'm supposed to turn out numbers. They're contradictory issues. Something has to give."
She continued: "They're always pulling the interns out of the clinic to cover something on the floor. When these interns go out into practice, they almost feel like admitting everybody because all they know is in-patient care. They haven't developed clinical judgment. Someone has pneumonia. Admit him. But wait, this kid doesn't have respiratory distress. I'll send him home and follow up tomorrow. Clinical judgment."
Dr. Holland said: "I've noticed different types of attendings. Some have no clinical judgment. They order every test because they're insecure. Others know right away what to do."
"You have to develop a feel for who you listen to and who you don't," the attending said. "When you're finished here, you'll know what each attending doesn't know. Not what they know, but what they don't know."
 
Conundrums of Intensive Care
The big-bellied man would never wake up. His was a life now unsalvageably distant. His diseased heart had sent him into cardiac arrest. He had lost his pulse entirely. By the time doctors had resuscitated him, he appeared to be brain dead.
If so, the doctors could shut off the ventilator and that would be that, just another of those quotidian horrors of internship. Tests detected no brain waves. He was removed from the ventilator. Under the hospital's protocol, he had to fail to take a breath for two and a half minutes. A few seconds shy of the deadline, he took a single gasp.
That gasp was enough that now only his son, who lived in Puerto Rico, could end what pretense of life machinery continued to give his father.
When Dr. James called him, she explained that, barring unexpected divine intervention, there was no chance his father would recover. She explained that the motionless man lying in intensive care was little more than flesh attached to machines. The son said: "What does it hurt? Let's keep him alive." At a cost of $3,000 a day.
She shivered in anger: "I thought the son was being selfish and stupid. It sounded like he didn't want to think that he was turning off the ventilator and killing his father. But what about how it was inhuman to keep his father alive? How we would have to keep doing tests on him. Maybe add a feeding tube. Maybe end up cracking his ribs if he coded -- for someone who was no longer a person."
Three weeks later, the father did "code" -- his heart stopped -- and this time, the doctors could not revive him.
The intensive care unit was the grimmest destination in the hospital. Here Dr. James often saw the final stumbling gasps of someone's life, and it was never pretty. It was here that she experienced the frustration of having to do too much, to treat patients in the throes of incurable, lingering disease, whose lungs were run by respirators, whose stomachs were fed by tubes, who were more like lab experiments than human beings.
Dr. James kept hearing that time and money were so precious, and yet so much of both was expended on patients locked in an unstoppable dance with death. "Why do another X-ray, another blood culture?" she said. "It's not making them better. If anything, it's making them worse."
The unit had a hazy feel. Often the only sounds were the hum and buzz of machines and the occasional television -- talk shows, soaps. And oh so many misbegotten stories.
She looked in on a patient on a ventilator, unable to speak. She was 89, with respiratory pneumonia. Dr. James had serviced her for two weeks, without exchanging a word. "It's weird," she said.
The managed care doctor had stopped by and urged that her course of antibiotics be finished so she could return to her nursing home. "But the nursing home doesn't take 'vents,' " Dr. James said. "I don't know if I can wean her off it yet."
And for what life? The woman had dementia. She had not spoken in a long time. She had no family, only a legal guardian. Guardians are usually reluctant to halt care because of fear of repercussions. The attending looked in: "I have the feeling that if that woman were awake, she would say, 'Please stop. Don't do this to me.' "
A pulmonary fellow in the unit said: "Doctors are uncomfortable talking to people about health care proxies when they're well, and we pay the price. When I have a practice, I'll have it right on the chart as the first thing to discuss."
She was silent a moment. Then she added, "But it's not easy. Like I don't have one. It's hard to know, who do I entrust my life to?"
So many of these patients posed ethical conundrums for the interns, setting their own brains to squabbling. Do this. Don't do this. Sometimes Dr. James felt bitter. Why should she have to work so hard in here, often for no gain? There were consequences for the soul. The family of one comatose woman had festooned her room with pictures of her dog and cat, and that made Dr. James think of her as truly alive. But she would never open an eye again.
Sometimes they would joke about someone: "Oh, the guy's shot. Let's just let him die." It muted the sorrow, but it also got at what they felt.
So many cases were hopeless that the interns were taken aback when they encountered an I.C.U. patient back on the wards, nearly well again. Dr. James had a man with sickle-cell anemia who reached the brink of death only to reject it. Soon he was released. She thought of him as Lazarus.
Over the loudspeaker now came word of a drug company lunch, and the interns' spirits abruptly lifted. Escape from this sorrowful shift. By the time Dr. James wrapped up her paperwork and got there, however, the turnout was so huge that all the plates had been claimed. Disappointed, she backtracked to the cafeteria with a fellow intern and had to pay for ravioli.
In an uninflected tone, her friend told her about a dreadful case. The interns were urged always to ask about D.N.R. (do not resuscitate) orders, but everything was complicated. The friend said she had just lost a patient, a 53-year-old woman with emphysema. She was intubated and then, as she improved, extubated. She got worse again and refused another intubation. She had signed a D.N.R. order. Helpless to do anything for a woman she felt could entirely recover, the intern watched her die.
"Oh, I just got the funniest news from Ohio," Dr. James said. "Someone I know who's doing her internship in Dayton just had her first death -- this after eight months of internship."
"You're kidding," her friend said.
"I mean, I had one the first month," Dr. James said. "I'm sure glad I'm not doing my residency in Ohio. What would I learn?"
It was sunny out. Dr. James said, "I hope I get done by 4:30 so I can soak in some rays."
"Rays?" her friend said. "How about shopping?"
 
Postmortem Blues
There was a pep talk on autopsies. For years, it had been getting harder to obtain permission for them and the number of autopsies had dwindled steadily. Enhanced technology had greatly improved doctors' ability to diagnose illness and families felt there was nothing more to discover. Relatives were more loath to expose loved ones, particularly the growing ranks of the very old, to what they saw as an indignity when no medical care yet practiced could do them further good. Religious reasons entered in. Still, autopsies did turn up surprises and were important teaching aides. Federal rules were that teaching hospitals perform autopsies for at least 15 percent of deaths, but since few hospitals could meet the threshold, it was rarely enforced. St. Luke's had an 11 percent average.
Interns were understandably squeamish even broaching the issue with inconsolable next of kin. So the medicine department had devised a macabre contest of sorts, with a prize to the intern who rounded up the most autopsies. In past years, interns got medical textbooks or Barnes & Noble gift certificates for each autopsy they achieved. These were apparently inadequate stimuli, so this year the incentive was sweetened, to a grand prize of $1,500.
Many of the interns found this particularly ghoulish. Some actually felt newly disinclined to pursue autopsies. In any event, there was a catch. The prize only took effect if the department recorded at least 100 autopsies for the year, and it was woefully shy of the target.
Dr. James had zero autopsies. Personally, she felt them inappropriate, absent some mystery about the death. She had one fleetingly. But the hospital was unable to get it done before the family insisted on burial. Overnight, she went from +1 back to 0.
 
Salving Loneliness, Saving a Life
Dr. Lathan felt gloomy. "When you're counting the hours and waiting for the shift to end, you know it's not good," he said over lunch. His best friend, an intern at another hospital, told him that one of the surgery interns there had hanged himself in his room. There were money issues. Love issues. Protracted depression.
Dr. Lathan was not so much depressed as aggravated by his ascetic life. He didn't even date; he had no time for a relationship. "You're spending like 80 percent of your life in this place, working six days straight," he said. "It's like being in a prison camp. I find myself less tolerant. Now it's a case of if it's not about my education, I don't want to do it, and I resent it. I don't want to be used as a slave just because of lack of manpower.
"The excitement and thrill is not there. It's a shame, too, because medicine really is a joy. It's a shame that they have a system that actually makes you hate medicine."
Into the E.R. the patients still came. The man said he felt a weakness in his side. He said he could not walk steadily: "I walk like a zombie. I walk like a robot." He had to go to the bathroom. Dr. Lathan watched him walk. He walked like a person. What he was was depressed. Dr. Lathan discharged him and suggested a therapist. "He was wasting my time," Dr. Lathan said. "I don't like people who waste my time."
He saw an 85-year-old woman complaining of diarrhea, vomiting, chills. Her home-care aide told Dr. Lathan, "I think her biggest problem is loneliness. She says when she's home she feels sad. When she got here, she said she felt alive."
He nodded. He understood.
Dr. Lathan was summoned to another room. A woman, 41, desolate for reasons known best to her, had just swallowed 28 tablets of Doxepin, a depressant, declaring her intention to conclude her life. "She just wanted to kill herself in front of the triage nurse," a nurse said.
Dr. Lathan and several residents channeled their energy into reversing her actions. He put in a breathing tube. She was connected to an E.K.G. machine. "Hello, hello," Dr. Lathan said.
They began pumping her stomach. While Dr. Lathan worked on her, the chief resident dispassionately lectured him: How much fluid to add. Why this. Why that. The woman was a life hanging by a thread, but also a vehicle for teaching.
The contents of her stomach emptied into a pink plastic bin. "It's how you take gasoline out of a tank, water out of a swimming pool," someone said.
The floor was a mess of discarded packaging from the cavalcade of medical supplies. Soon, the woman was ready for a chest X-ray, and then she would go to intensive care. The chief resident said, "All right, we're cool."
There was nothing more to say. Dr. Lathan had a pilot with abdominal pain who was supposed to be flying to Spain. The shift had hours to go. Something special had happened. A woman would live who had tried not to.
 
Managed Care 101
Late in the internship year, in a rare attempt at formally addressing the mechanics of managed care with the house staff, the hospital arranged for a pair of seminars. They were described in leaflets sent to all the residents as "important seminars that can assist you in practicing medicine in this ever-expanding era of managed care."
The sessions were staged in a large conference room at Roosevelt and beamed by closed-circuit television to St. Luke's. They attached an accept-it-it's-not-going-away sensibility to the topic. Reprints of studies and charts were stacked up on a table for attendees to take with them. There was not much need.
Only a handful of people showed up.
 
Life, Death and Managed Care
 
In their early months at St. Luke's-Rosevelt Hospital Center, the interns struggled to find their balance in a world of diminished resources and warp speed. Dr. Bryan Holland, in pediatrics, learned the true meaning of scut work and how to tell a stomachache from a desire to skip school. In the E.R., Dr. Edward Lathan dealt with everything from a broken fingernail to heart failure and, for the first time, saw one of his patients die. Working to beyond exhaustion, Dr. Jennifer James, in medicine, worried about making mistakes and got a lesson in the meaning of responsibility. Today: an investigation at the hospital . . . the heartbreaking conundrums of intensive care . . . and the joys of free food.

HEADLINE: State Sues G.E. Over Pollution In the Hudson

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer sued General Electric today, the first time the state has ever taken the company to court over PCB contamination of the Hudson River, in an action that he says he hopes will open the door to many similar suits.
The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Albany, does not address the environmental and health effects of G.E.'s three decades of dumping PCB's into the river, issues that are the subject of an ongoing inquiry by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The agency is expected to decide next year whether to order widespread dredging of the river. 
 Instead, Mr. Spitzer's complaint takes the novel approach of pursuing monetary damages, blaming PCB's for the state's trouble in maintaining a shipping canal that links the Hudson to Lake Champlain. And he invited local governments and private interests along the nearly 200-mile length of the river to join in his suit or file their own, on similar grounds.
"The legal theory, once we establish this legal theory, will open G.E. up to damages that are vast, that will apply up and down the Hudson River, and that will be monumental in scale," he said. "All the communities up and down the river have been impaired because of the PCB's in the Hudson -- the value of property, the ability to get commerce through, jobs that have been lost."
Mr. Spitzer intentionally steered clear of sticky questions about damage to human health and ecosystems, adhering, he said, to grounds where he was confident he could win, and win quickly.
Environmentalists applauded the suit, predicting that it would put added pressure on G.E. to reach a settlement with the environmental agency for large-scale dredging of the river. The company strenuously opposes dredging, which could cost it more than $1 billion.
A company spokesman, Mark L. Behan, dismissed the suit as "politics, purely and simply politics," adding that General Electric would contest it "with vigor."
Gov. George E. Pataki's administration also took issue with the action, warning that it could interfere with other state actions against G.E. over pollution in the Hudson, which has been declared a toxic cleanup site under the federal Superfund program.
Environmentalists dismissed that concern, some saying that the governor, a Republican, simply did not like being overshadowed on environmental matters by the new attorney general, a Democrat.
John P. Cahill, Mr. Pataki's commissioner of environmental conservation, predicted that his agency and the E.P.A. would be dragged into Mr. Spitzer's suit. That, he said, would draw resources away from both the federal agency's investigation and a claim for economic damages against General Electric under the federal Superfund law that the state and federal governments have been exploring jointly.
He also argued that the suit could hinder future claims under state law, since all such claims, he said, should be filed at once.
Officials of the environmental agency declined to comment on the suit, or on Mr. Cahill's prediction that it would slow down their work.
But environmentalists were elated that after decades of struggle, the state had finally sued General Electric. "We're delighted to see an aggressive approach being taken, finally," said Cara Lee, environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a conservation group. "This suit will probably bring forward additional information that will, if anything, make for a better E.P.A. decision and better state claims in the future."
The environmental agency is scheduled to make a preliminary decision late next year whether to order dredging of PCB "hot spots" up and down the river, but a final decision is not expected until 2001.
Some environmental groups fear that by then, there could be a Republican administration in Washington that would be less likely to take such action, a prospect that they say makes the attorney general's suit all the more important.
The suit continues Mr. Spitzer's string of audacious actions against major corporations in his first year in office. He has threatened to make New York the first state to sue gun makers in an attempt to make them put safety devices on handguns and limit how and where guns are sold. And he has sued power plants in the Midwest and South over air pollution that crosses state lines; it is the first such suit by any state.
Today's suit deals with the 35-mile-long Champlain Canal, from the southern tip of Lake Champlain to the Hudson at Waterford. It intersects the Hudson just downstream from the General Electric plants, at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, that dumped PCB's into the river from the 1940's to 1970's, when the federal government banned them.
In some stretches, the canal runs alongside the river. In others, it enters the river; that is, what is called the canal is actually just the deepest part of the river. And that provides the basis for the attorney general's very narrowly drawn suit.
The State Constitution requires that the state maintain the canal for commercial traffic, and state law requires that it be at least 12 feet deep. But where the canal lies in the river, it has been allowed to silt up -- it is as shallow as 7 feet in places, Mr. Spitzer's aides said -- because of PCB's in the sediment.
If the state were to dredge the canal, it would have to abide by strict federal standards for handling and disposing of PCB's, making the work far more expensive. Mr. Spitzer said that is why the state has not dredged the channel in 15 years.
His suit seeks to force the company to pay that additional cost to dredge the shipping channel in the part of the river that doubles as the canal, a sum that he said would be at least $10 million and possibly far more. And he noted he was leaving open the possibility of seeking damages for lost economic activity along the canal, which would probably be many times the cost of dredging.
"The dollar figure is not as important as the precedent-setting nature of the action," Mr. Spitzer said. "This case will also establish a case for others faced with increased dredging and disposal costs. This includes municipalities in the region and downstream. It also includes private facilities such as marinas and waterfront businesses and others who can demonstrate economic harm. These damages will be vast."
Mr. Behan, the General Electric spokesman, said that the state had never even requested permission from the federal government to dredge the channel, proving that it was not a pressing need.
Cynthia Munk, a spokeswoman for the State Thruway Authority, which is controlled by the governor and operates the canal, said, "We believe that there is no need to do dredging for navigational purposes prior to E.P.A.'s assessment."
But she conceded that at times, getting a ship through takes special measures like removing some of its load or using dams to raise the water level temporarily.
Commercial traffic on the river has declined, from 13,615 vessels in 1980 to 2,517 last year, though some of that drop is due to the decline of manufacturing upstate.
Legal experts said Mr. Spitzer's suit appears to be a strong one. "There's a long history of the state suing under public nuisance laws when there is interference with a transportation corridor," said Karl S. Coplan, a law professor at Pace University who specializes in environmental law.
Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, were long used as insulators in electrical equipment. General Electric estimates that its two plants on the Hudson, 50 miles north of here, dumped more than a million pounds of PCB's into the river, but its critics contend it was far more. Mr. Spitzer said the true figure was more than 100 million pounds.
Though the federal environmental agency has declared that PCB's cause cancer in animals, and probably in humans as well, there is debate among scientists as to what, if any, risk there is to humans from low-level exposure.
General Electric contends that its dumping was legal, because no law explicitly prohibited it. But environmentalists argue that the extent of the dumping made it illegal because it violated state clean-water laws, a position supported by Mr. Spitzer.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 1999, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a lawsuit filed against General Electric over PCB contamination of the Hudson River included an erroneous estimate from the State Attorney General, Eliot L. Spitzer, for the amount of the chemical dumped into the river over three decades. Mr. Spitzer, who filed the suit, said yesterday that the actual figure was 1.3 million pounds -- the amount acknowledged by G.E. -- and not a quantity exceeding 100 million pounds.

HEADLINE: Message: I Care (More Than They Do)

BYLINE: By SARA MILES; Sara Miles, a California writer, is working on a book about the politics of Silicon Valley.

 BODY:
THE night is warm, with a sliver of moon rising over the California hills, and Vice President Al Gore gazes at the people gathered outside in the dark. "Kids are going hungry," Mr. Gore tells them, softly, "and we know that's not the way it's supposed to be." He pauses. "The question for America," says Mr. Gore, his voice almost cracking, "is how much do we care?"
Largely because of the proclamations of Mr. Gore's chief rival for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, "compassion" has become a buzzword on the campaign trail. Whether it is Mr. Bush's contention that he represents "compassionate conservatism," Senator John McCain's anecdote about "relying on compassion" in the Vietnam War or the insistence by former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey that "America is great because people care about each other," Republicans and Democrats are busy trying to convince voters that they speak, in the vice president's phrase, "not just from the head, but from the heart." 
 Voters who prefer a more traditional style of oratory characterized by high seriousness and patriotic masculinity may lament the vogue of sensitivity. But the use of emotion as a political tool is hardly new.
In 1913, in his first Inaugural Address, President Woodrow Wilson pleaded for attention to the "groans and moans" of the poor, saying "there has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great." President Richard M. Nixon, stern in his anti-Communist rhetoric and bellicose about America's power, could choke up evoking "the dreams of a child more important than any politician's promise." And President Clinton, even as he eschewed bleeding-heart social policies, kept demonstrating how deeply he felt America's pain, wielding hugs and moist eyes in public displays of empathy.
James A. Thurber, who directs the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, finds the current rhetoric unconvincing. "Compassion is just a brand right now," Mr. Thurber charged. "It's a slogan, not something with real meaning."
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York agrees, and says that the moral imperative to care is disappearing from politics.
"It used to be popular to be compassionate in the 60's," said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. "That does not sell politically nowadays. You should help others. Why? Because it's so terrible kids are poor? No, because it costs more to have kids be unproductive. It's all about pragmatism. You can't call on the population to help anymore just because it's the right thing to do."
BUT assume for a moment that the candidates' expressions of caring are sincere. Even so, compassion is never simply a sentiment. For the millions of Americans who support community service organizations, or who follow religious teachings, compassionate feelings are inextricably linked with an imperative to act.
Most Americans value compassion in action. Yet if you quantify compassion by the size of philanthropic donations, most are less than exemplary givers, and politicians are no exception.
Mr. Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, with a combined taxable income of $2,416,917 last year, gave just $38,041 to charity, about 1.5 percent of their earnings.
Mr. Gore, and his wife, Tipper, who earned $224,376 in 1998, gave away $15,197, approximately 7 percent of their income. The Gores, however, may have been prompted to act more generously by the disclosure that, in 1997, they gave away just $353 of an income of $197,729, less than two-tenths of 1 percent.
Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, gave away 6.5 percent of their income in 1997, when they earned $258,375. In 1998, after the sale of the Texas Rangers, their estimated taxable income jumped to $18,405,524. But they donated $334,425 to churches and charities, less than 2 percent and somewhat shy of the "outpouring of compassion" Mr. Bush urged on his fellow citizens.
As Mose Allison, that sly philosopher of blues piano, used to croon, "Everybody's crying mercy, but they don't know the meaning of the word."
It takes more than a calculator, though, to figure out the political meanings of mercy. When the presidential candidates talk about compassion, they are expressing their political and moral values, talking in code to particular voters and dropping clues about the policies they might implement.
The first clue concerns the people a candidate wants voters to care about.
For whom, exactly, does a candidate recommend compassion? All the people of the world? Or just Americans? For all the poor, or just the "deserving" poor, a slippery category that fluctuates according to each candidate's moral judgments?
Does the candidate urge compassion for the sick or for the victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters? For women, or babies, or fetuses? The elderly? And what about children? Few politicians can pass up a chance to ooze concern for photogenic kindergartners, but how many express compassion for surly 17-year-olds?
Even when the answers are similar, the language in which they are expressed reveals nuanced differences among the men who would be president. The three leading contenders all evoke the plight of poor children with feeling. But in doing so Mr. Bush, who coined the phrase "compassionate conservatism," signals loyalty to his Republican roots. In speeches about helping children, he praises religion and warns against big government. He is careful to emphasize, along with his love for "innocent victims," the values of "self-control and character and goal-setting" when helping them.
Mr. Bradley, whose calls to "eliminate child poverty as we know it" fall squarely in the liberal Democratic tradition of the New Deal and the War on Poverty, gives priority to increased government spending on health care, child care and education. His language equates federal assistance with morality: "As the most prosperous nation on earth," Mr. Bradley declares, "America must do better when it comes to protecting our children."
Mr. Gore splits the difference, echoing Mr. Bush's language of faith and charity while seconding Mr. Bradley's belief in federal intervention. Mr. Gore distinguishes himself with rhetoric that subtly appeals to union voters, calling for aid not to "poor children" alone, but to "working families."
Such careful deconstructing of compassion makes sense to political analysts. "Bush's compassionate conservatism is all about a rational plan to move toward the middle ideologically," said Mr. Thurber of American University. "He's trying to signal that he's not an uncaring right-winger, but at the same time that he's really conservative, and is going to devolve power locally. This works because most people are compassionate, but they don't like government: Bush is trying to walk that fine line."
The vice president's rhetoric, Mr. Thurber said, partly signals Mr. Gore's desire to "hold on to labor and the left," but also suggests a broader effort to humanize his image. "Primarily, Gore's concerned about the fact that he's perceived to be dull, bumbling, a policy wonk," Mr. Thurber said. "He needs to do something to change that."
Mr. Thurber sees Mr. Bradley's expressions of compassion as "less calculating" than those of his rivals, because he relies on rhetoric unpopular with voters. "He's not poll-driven," Mr. Thurber said. "Bradley's going against the trend by saying the federal government should solve problems with money."
THOUGH not known for a warm and fuzzy personal style, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, insists that caring for others is an essential part of his message. The way in which he frames his concern reinforces his appeal to voters who see him as the honest outsider. Mr. McCain's proposals for increasing federal money for public schools in poor areas, for example, rely on removing subsidies for ethanol, oil, gas and sugar "instead of taking money away from the public schools, as other candidates would do," said Dan Schnur, a McCain campaign spokesman.
Mr. McCain is straightforward about the political choices implied by his approach. "Our emphasis is always on support for working families and the disenfranchised," Mr. Schnur said, "at the expense of special interests and the well-connected."
Mr. McCain is gentler in his populism than the Reform Party firebrand Patrick J. Buchanan, whose tirades against "elites" can sound more like incitement to class warfare than appeals for compassion, a subject Mr. Buchanan barely mentions. He makes his priorities clear by emphasizing "responsibility" over caring, in a pitch aimed at angry right-wing voters.
For his part, Mr. Bush has tried to appeal to moderate voters with gestures intended to demonstrate his compassion for ethnic minorities and the disadvantaged, accusing House Republicans of trying to "balance the budget on the backs of the poor."
But he also has not hesitated to push the wall separating church from state by promoting "charitable choice," which lets states enlist faith-based organizations to provide basic welfare services, a position that signals his loyalty to a conservative Christian base.
Most of Mr. Bush's other specific ideas for engaging "armies of compassion" fall squarely within a Republican tradition: $8 billion in tax incentives to encourage individual and corporate giving; support for private and church charities; and rejection of "the failed compassion of towering, distant bureaucracies," by which he means the kinds of government programs hailed by liberals.
It is a stance made possible, Mr. Bush's supporters say, by the failures of liberal approaches to compassion. "Conservatives are getting into the business of reaching out to poor people for the first time," said Clint Bolick, who directs the Institute for Justice, a libertarian public interest law firm in Washington. "The idea is not to fight the welfare-state programs of liberals with less generous similar programs, but to return freedom to people. Bush really understands this at a core level, and it serves the objective of softening conservatives' well-earned reputation for being ungenerous."
Mr. Bradley's proposal for spending nearly $10 billion a year on government programs to fight child poverty is aimed squarely at the liberal Democratic voters who turn out for primaries. Any candidate who condemns "white skin privilege" is not playing to the right wing of his party. "I personally am delighted to hear Bradley's rhetoric," Mr. Cuomo said dryly, "because I gave that same speech for 20 years, and that's why I lost."
Mr. Bradley's decision to campaign on expanding social services to the poor through large-scale government initiatives seems a deliberate effort to overturn Mr. Clinton's centrist approach to the disadvantaged. "Thanks to triangulation, obfuscation and tiptoeing across the political morass, nobody else is talking about how poor people are working and still not getting ahead," Mr. Cuomo said. "The poor are not voters, and politics responds only to votes."
Mr. Gore, whose political fortunes have depended on the triumph of Mr. Clinton's centrism, and the phenomenal economic growth that marked Mr. Clinton's tenure in the White House, is much less capable of challenging the compassion of his boss. Instead, the vice president speaks of his plans to lift children out of poverty as "completing welfare reform." The details of his proposal combine conservative language, "promoting responsible parenthood," with classic liberal Democratic measures such as raising the minimum wage, expanding child-care opportunities and making health care more affordable.
The urge to feel and behave with compassion may be universal. The attention candidates have paid to compassion this year certainly shows that Americans place a high value on caring. But compassion in practice is as particular as any other emotion: the question of whom we care for and how, just as whom we denigrate and how we punish, is political at its heart.

HEADLINE: New Rules Lift the Lid on Nonprofit Pay

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BIG compensation packages for top executives in the business world have become commonplace in the booming economy. But now, as the Internal Revenue Service completes new rules for charities and foundations, experts say it will become increasingly profitable to work for a nonprofit institution.
The new rules will both codify old tax cases and give tax collectors more flexibility to crack down on excessive compensation. But because the I.R.S. regulations follow a line of cases that have permitted compensation based on comparable salaries, stock options and other benefits doled out by the private sector, the new rules for some of the largest nonprofit institutions can be boiled down to a four-word formula: the sky's the limit. 
 The new regulations were drafted last year under a 1996 law urged by Independent Sector, a coalition of philanthropic and nonprofit organizations that was concerned about the scandals surrounding the compensation packages of William V. Aramony of the United Way and Peter Diamandopoulos of Adelphi University. The government has said that tax-exempt institutions may now rely on the proposed regulations, which are expected to become final in 2000. But already, salaries and other benefits for executives are increasing at a higher rate at many nonprofit institutions than at profit-making businesses.
In 1998, compensation for top executives of major nonprofit institutions grew at nearly double the rate shown in 1997, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's latest survey, and slightly outpaced raises given to business executives. The survey found that the median total compensation for chief executive officers at 246 nonprofit institutions was $207,990, with more than 13 receiving annual compensation of at least $500,000 and another 89 receiving more than $200,000.
The top earners were seven heads of hospitals, four university presidents, and Joseph Volpe, the general manager at New York's Metropolitan Opera Association, and Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Among the highest paid executives were Dr. John W. Rowe, the president of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and Dr. Paul A. Marks of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, both of whom received more than $1 million.
The survey featured a wide range of top earners at nonprofit institutions, from those in the executive suites to those who render services "on the front line."
Walter H. Annenberg, the retired publishing executive, received total compensation of $500,000 last year from his foundation for overseeing the investment of its $3 billion portfolio. Leonard Slatkin received $829,000 for conducting the National Symphony Orchestra; John Robinson earned $750,000 for coaching the football team at the University of Southern California; and Dr. Wayne Isom received $1.7 million as chairman of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at Cornell University.
Executive recruiters say the large pay packages reflect the realities of the marketplace. Many executives at the top of nonprofit institutions can command huge compensation packages in industries like the Internet, Wall Street or hospitals, where multimillionaires are minted overnight.
"The biggest divider these days that separates the corporate world from the nonprofits is stock options," said James Abruzzo, the managing director of the nonprofit practice at A. T. Kearney, an executive search firm. "The nonprofits just can't compete with the dot-coms. As a result, there will be a whole generation of young business school people, who in the past were very motivated to do something meaningful, who have been lured away by the potential of big payouts and who then may retire in their 30's and can turn to doing nonprofit work."
Mr. Abruzzo said that deferred compensation and performance bonuses, once unheard of in the nonprofit sector, are now routine for many large institutions.
Surveys show that the median increase in executive compensation at nonprofit institutions was 5.7 percent in 1998, while at profit-making institutions it was 4.6 percent. But Mr. Abruzzo said that compensation packages for nonprofit institutions are actually rising at closer to 15 percent a year, and that the traditional salary cap of $200,000 for most foundations has been largely discarded to compete with the business world.
But some critics say that looking at profit-making businesses to determine salaries at nonprofit institutions is inappropriate, because they serve such different purposes.
"This is not a coherent system because it violates the core attributes that distinguish for-profits and not-for-profits," said Peter Frumkin, an assistant professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and an expert on philanthropies. "For-profits live for distributing earnings to shareholders. Nonprofits serve a different purpose altogether."
THE new regulations give considerable flexibility to the government in determining how to deal with executives and institutions where compensation is found to be excessive. Under the old rules, the I.R.S. had few tools to curb excessive compensation, and basically had to choose between doing nothing or taking the extreme step of revoking an organization's tax-exempt status.
Because only such a disproportionately Draconian remedy was available, the agency had to walk away from some cases rather than pursue them, said Marc Owens, the director of the Exempt Organizations section at the I.R.S.
The new rules, called "intermediate sanctions," give the I.R.S. more options. The agency can impose an excise tax on the taxpayer who receives excessive compensation or on the nonprofit manager who approves it. It can impose a penalty equal to 200 percent of the excess if the nonprofit institution fails to correct the problem promptly. It can also order the executive to return any excessive benefits to the nonprofit institution.
Mr. Owens said that the agency recently issued the first eight notices to nonprofit institutions, asserting that they and their executives owed $80 million to the government for excessive compensation. He said that although the rules provided for some flexibility, and allowed foundations and charities to examine ranges of compensation, there were still limits.
"Simply because you look at comparable salaries in the for-profit world doesn't mean that you can pick and choose to use the officers of Microsoft Corporation," he said. "It has to be a comparable situation and a comparable organization."
While many experts have applauded the new approach, some have also said that the federal government is ill-equipped to set any compensation rules for nonprofit institutions. The best approach, they say, is one that relies on self-control by the tax-exempt institutions themselves, combined with clear disclosures that enable donors and others to see whether executive pay is too high.
"It is quite unseemly how much some of these executives are getting," said John G. Simon, a professor at Yale Law School and an authority on regulations governing nonprofit institutions. "Having said that, this is an area that the law cannot in most circumstances do much about."
In that respect, Professor Simon said, it reminded him of one of Samuel Johnson's couplets: "How small of all that human hearts endure/that part which laws or kings can cause or cure."

HEADLINE: The Gospel According to Tony: Help First, Preach Later

BYLINE: By WINIFRED GALLAGHER; Winifred Gallagher's latest book is "Working on God" (Random House).

 BODY:
DRIVING around the slums of Camden and Philadelphia with the Rev. Tony Campolo is like traveling with a hybrid of Mr. Toad and St. Francis of Assisi.
Since Monicagate, this minister, lecturer and author, who is well known among evangelicals -- fervent, traditional, "born-again" Protestants -- is more widely recognized as one of President Clinton's spiritual advisers. But he exults in his resemblance to Homer Simpson. And he delights in antics like paying the bridge toll for a stranger in the car behind his. 
 Like a Zen master, this Baptist preacher wants people to question the status quo -- especially notions like the "permanent underclass." Five or six days a week, he's on the road, mustering support for his far-flung "congregation" of impoverished youth in the United States and Latin America.
What we have here, then, is a merry man with a serious mission -- and something of a maverick in the evangelical world. While the stereotypical evangelist insists on sermonizing as the price of a hot meal and a warm coat, Mr. Campolo's philosophy is to help first, talk later -- but only if the person is interested.
"To be a Christian is by definition to be countercultural," he says. "In an America suffering from 'affluenza,' countercultural means responding to the poor -- the only criterion for judgment that Jesus gives."
Jim Wallis, the director of Sojourners and Call for Renewal, Washington-based religious antipoverty organizations, says, "Although the idea that the Gospel is meant to be good news for the poor is so central in the Bible, it's often painfully absent in contemporary evangelism. Tony is an evangelist who truly cares about social justice."
Spending a day with Mr. Campolo highlights some distinctive features of religious charities, and of his own up-close-and-personal approach to the poor. Our first stop in Camden is a brick church that is the headquarters of UrbanPromise. This is one of the programs sponsored by Mr. Campolo's umbrella organization, the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, or EAPE, which he founded in St. David's, Pa., in 1972. UrbanPromise provides educational and developmental support to 1,000 young people daily.
In his decade as director, says the Rev. Bruce Main, "I've seen a generation of boys disappear. Of the 12 in my first group, 10 dropped out." Despite such heartaches, the ministry has grown. The church that was once abandoned during the city's "white flight" now also houses a gym, community center, teenage employment and leadership programs and two Christian schools.
Describing the ministry as "joyful," Mr. Main said, "The fun is the creativity of searching for real-life answers with the kids."
Mr. Campolo stops to hug Monique, whose problems found an answer in UrbanPromise's "home school" for teenage dropouts. A truant who found her way to this alternative school, Monique, 18, has just started college. She attributes this achievement to a combination of hard work and caring teachers -- "Here, if you don't come to school, someone misses you" -- and "getting saved."
In Camden, the religious values that UrbanPromise promotes, from self-control to faith, aren't just virtues, but survival strategies. Discussing premarital chastity, for example, Monique says: "So many girls think if they have a guy's baby, like some toy, he'll stay around. But he won't."
To Mr. Campolo, Monique and Mr. Main personify the two special advantages of religious charities. "We can communicate spiritual motivations for addressing problems, from dropping out to drug abuse to violence," he says. "That makes us more effective, because poor people are spiritual, if only in thinking in terms of lucky and unlucky."
THE other great strength of religious organizations, says Mr. Campolo, is volunteerism. Three-quarters of EAPE's staff, including Mr. Campolo, are unpaid. As EAPE's chief recruiter and fund-raiser, Mr. Campolo is on the road, addressing church, community and corporate groups. These events attract 95 percent of EAPE's financial resources, typically in individual donations of $25 a month.
"For 20 years, Tony has gotten incredible numbers of people to ask, 'What can I do?' and has challenged both religious liberals and conservatives to walk it like they talk it," said Mike Yaconelli, the director of Youth Specialties, an organization of 100,000 youth workers, based in San Diego.
On a circuitous route from Camden to Philadelphia, Mr. Campolo describes EAPE's programs for the poor in Latin America. Once, he explains, missionaries were preachers. Today, however, local people evangelize, while missionaries often address economic obstacles to human dignity. In the Dominican Republic, for example, one modest project for replanting a rain forest has grown into Floresta, a company with 300 employees.
In Haiti, which has an 85 percent illiteracy rate, EAPE's Beyond Borders project operates 85 schools for adults and children called restaviks -- indentured servants who are, in effect, slaves.
Sometimes, loving thy neighbor requires a more creative response than giving money or time. To illustrate, Mr. Campolo pulls up in front of Schimpf's Garage, just under a sign that reads: Thou Shalt Not Park Here. Lou Schimpf, the white owner, says he decided not to move his shop from Camden after hearing Mr. Campolo preach. "My wife and I prayed on it, and we decided we had to stay," he says.
But that wasn't all he did. Mr. Schimpf gave UrbanPromise an adjacent building that now houses Printworks. Begun with $10 worth of silk-screening supplies, the enterprise produces T-shirts and greeting cards. "We thought it would provide 12 steady jobs, but there's a lot of turnover," Mr. Campolo says, adding, however, that it's all for the best. "The kids learn the processes, then get higher salaries in private industry."
Soon we're rocketing through West Philadelphia to the association's Cornerstone Christian Academy. The school, which comprises kindergarten through eighth grade, is attended by 300 black children, all in uniform. As at UrbanPromise, Cornerstone's most overtly "religious" quality is an emphasis on human worth and decency.
"What's different here is that they teach that being a Christian means living the right way," says Trevor, an eighth grader.
Trevor's goal is "to get into a good high school -- one with computers and football." To Mr. Campolo, such an aspiration is the academy's greatest contribution: "We help the children visualize a future," he says. "It's hard for a kid from the housing project to imagine being a businessman or doctor -- even going to college."
Mr. Campolo has come to Cornerstone to meet with a group of volunteers. Most are white and middle-class, college-age Americans and Europeans who assist the salaried African-American head teachers, living among the poor whom they serve.
The volunteers are about to visit the students' homes. These visits exemplify Mr. Campolo's belief that America doesn't need new social programs, it needs better ways to connect people to existing ones. When a volunteer meets a student's family on its own turf "then it all comes out," he says. "Someone needs a job, has drug trouble." Through interfaith agencies, the volunteer can later put the family in touch with people who can help. What distinguishes one of his programs from a secular equivalent becomes clear when Mr. Campolo advises volunteers about discussing their students' progress. "Explain to the family that you want to do the best job you can for their child -- not just academically, but spiritually. Before leaving, pray with the family for the child."
At the end of a long day, we drive down a stretch of urban America that might be on a different planet from most of the booming nation. "Look at those drug dealers, just waiting!" Mr. Campolo says. "Isn't this block horrendous?" He offers a one-word explanation for why his program's volunteers are drawn to work in such places: fun.
"You can go to the stock market and make lots of money," he says. "In the end, is that so much fun? I don't know why it's fun to work in a slum, but it is."

HEADLINE: Marching Smartly to Their Own Drummer

BYLINE: By JULIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
IN an age of sophisticated fund-raising, when megabuck donors are giving charities sums equal to the gross domestic product of a small country, and your college is reminding you oh-so-tactfully that planned giving can reduce your estate taxes, the nation's largest charity is still collecting dimes and quarters the old-fashioned way. At least that's how most Americans perceive the Salvation Army -- as a band of quaint do-gooders in Victorian uniforms urging passers-by to drop coins in the Christmas kettles while an off-key brass band belts carols.
But every year since 1991, the Salvation Army has roosted at the top of the Philanthropy 400, The Chronicle of Philanthropy's list of the nation's biggest charities ranked in terms of private support. Last year, the Salvation Army pulled in $1.2 billion, largely from folks like you and me, up 5 percent from the year earlier and twice the amount of the second-place finisher, the Y.M.C.A. 
 How does such a quill-pen organization raise so much money in the computer age? Not just from those kettles; they produce only about $79 million of the take. Paul Schervish, a sociology professor at Boston College, explained the Army's effectiveness this way: "It is viewed as having low fund-raising costs; its people are courteous and trustworthy; there's a religious dimension that helps donors understand that people are dedicated; and the military structure suggests workers serve but don't coddle the people they help."
To be sure, the traits that make the Army a mighty host in the fund-raising world are based on its being a church-operated army of Christian soldiers. But these qualities can be imitated by nonprofit organizations with no religious orientation. What makes the Army so successful is a combination of three essentials to organizational development: It has a clearly defined and easily understood mission; it holds itself accountable for carrying out its mission and for seeing that money goes to the purposes for which it was raised; and it possesses superior marketing skills.
Most donors don't realize that the Salvation Army is an evangelical Protestant denomination with two to three million members, or Salvationists, worldwide. "It's not just a social service agency, but a church," Peter Dobkin Hall, a senior research scholar at Yale Divinity School, pointed out. "What the Army is most like is a Protestant religious order. Salvationists are intensely spiritual, but they don't lay it on others."
The spirituality is expressed in action, however, not in ritual. Sara Melendez, the president of Independent Sector, a coalition of 700 nonprofit organizations, noted: "They are unique as a charity because there is no division between faith and work. It's all of a piece."
Ed Herzberg, a social service worker at an Army drop-in center for the homeless on East 52nd Street in Manhattan, explained: "In his preface to 'Major Barbara,' George Bernard Shaw says the Army would be a great organization if it got rid of that religious aspect. But if we didn't have the faith, we couldn't do such great work. You need something a little more to deal with the people who need us."
Peter Drucker, the management guru and creator of the Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, repeatedly cites the Army for being the nation's best-managed charity, in part because its mission -- "to meet human needs in his name without discrimination" -- is so clear that it could be silk-screened on a T-shirt.
Followers are reminded of that mission constantly. It hangs on the bulletin board of the East 52nd Street center, for example, where red brick walls, linoleum floors and scuffed furniture create the look of an underfinanced high school.
"The Salvation Army wants commitment -- not to the Army or to a cause, but to the betterment of people," said Captain Allan Hausner, who runs the center, as he tended the cashier's table at the center's rummage sale.
The Army was founded in London in 1865 by William Booth, a Methodist minister and former pawnbroker who felt called to bring the good news of salvation to the slum-dwelling vagrants, prostitutes, alcoholics and thieves who were largely ignored by mainstream churches. From the start, General Booth knew his priorities: soup, soap and salvation -- in that order. He frequently warned adherents that it was futile, not to say unchristian, to preach to someone who was cold and hungry.
"Anybody who walks in the door gets helped; we don't ask if they've been saved," said Julius Stein, a retired police sergeant from New York and now a community service volunteer at the 52nd Street center.
And Sherrill Goswell, a home nursing aide who has helped serve holiday dinners at an Army shelter in Fort Worth, said: "There was no sense that they were trying to convert. They'd say a prayer before meals -- that was it."
The Army carries out its mission through a military command structure that promotes accountability. The clergy is the officer class and numbers 5,339 in the United States. There are 120,000 "soldiers," who have publicly declared their beliefs in Salvation Army principles and agree to abstain from alcohol and tobacco; about 40,000 paid employees; and 1.6 million volunteers.
Officers begin training with two years as cadets in one of four Salvation Army colleges. Cadets are commissioned -- that is, ordained -- as lieutenants and dispatched to take over local churches known as Corps, or to start new ones.
A lieutenant becomes a captain after five years of probation and, 15 years after that, a major. (Shaw would no doubt be dismayed to learn that his Major Barbara, described as a "girl," would actually be close to 40.) When officers marry, they must wed fellow officers or resign their commissions; husbands and wives minister to the same Corps. Divorce results in husband and wife losing their commissions.
Corps report to divisions usually commanded by a colonel; divisions report to one of four territories. Territorial commanders report to national headquarters, which is run by a commissioner who reports to international headquarters in London. The rank of general is reserved for the head of the international organization.
It is a tenet of the business world that you manage what you measure, so that you can figure out whether you are meeting your goals. Army services "are measurable by design, because we do hold ourselves accountable for outcomes," said Lt. Colonel William LaMarr, the commander of the Greater New York division.
Officers are expected to formulate annual goals, providing services that fill gaps in community programs, rather than competing with them. If officers project that their programs will grow annually by a given percent, they are held responsible for seeing that the programs do. Local advisory boards of prominent citizens monitor the goals and the programs.
Colonel LaMarr said the Salvation Army is perceived as trustworthy because it's easy for the public to grasp the concrete. For example, at the back of each year's annual report is a complete listing of operation centers (9,163 at last count), people assisted (32,050,573) and services provided, including meals served (25,517,776) and lodgings supplied (7,251,267). The Army is not involved in advocacy: it is too hard to measure, and be accountable for, swaying hearts and minds.
The returns are more certain from running a youth center, for example, like the one in Hempstead, N.Y., where a gangly 8-year-old first played organized basketball and grew up to be Julius Erving, basketball's famous "Dr. J."
Accountability at the Salvation Army is also financial, to ensure that money raised is used appropriately. There are annual internal audits of the corps by the divisions, divisions by the territories and territories by national headquarters. Public accounting firms audit division, territorial and national accounts. Government social service agencies that finance Army services also monitor what's happening to their money.
Though officers frequently refer to their work as a "calling," the Army thinks of itself as, well, an army, with nothing soft at the center. Witness its 1990 showdown with the Department of Labor, which had come after the Salvation Army for not paying the minimum wage to workers in its adult rehabilitation centers. The Army runs 157 of these alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers throughout the United States. Addicts serious about kicking their habits are given a place to live, meals, counseling and therapy free. Rehabilitation, however, means attending Army services and sorting and packing clothes and other donated goods bound for Army thrift shops, whose income supports the program.
The Salvation Army brought suit asking the courts to enjoin the Labor Department from enforcing the minimum wage laws on the ground that the addicts were beneficiaries of a service, not employees. The suit was dismissed, but the Labor Department did nothing further, perhaps influenced by a realization that the Army might rethink the economics of the centers if it had to pay the minimum wage.
The combination of religious mission and military accountability reinforces a public perception of the Salvation Army as a frugal charity with donations going to support the work. The Army reports that of the $1.8 billion it spent last year, 84 percent went to program services, 4 percent to fund-raising and 12 percent to overhead. According to the National Charities Information Bureau, a philanthropy watchdog organization in New York, a ratio of 70 percent or more of expenses going to the mission is a sign of a well-managed charity.
Overhead is low, indeed. Commissioner John Busby, the head of the United States organization, earns $77,754 a year, which includes the value of his Army-provided housing and two cars, in addition to his pension. Contrast that with the nation's second-biggest charity, the Y.M.C.A., which, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, pays its leader, David Mercer, $290,000 in salary and $49,686 in benefits and expense reimbursements. The Army furnishes all officers with a parsonage, a car and a small salary that includes grants for each child until the age of 18. Lt. Col. Tom Jones, the Army's national development director, joked that, "We always have a place to live, a car to drive and almost enough to live on."
FUND-RAISERS understand that people give to what they know, and most of us think we know the Salvation Army. Army trucks pick up old sofas; Army volunteers run shelters for dazed disaster victims; Army rehabilitation centers assist alcoholics and drug addicts. In January, when the Barna Research Group, a California market research firm, conducted a nationwide poll of 1,002 adults, it discovered that 99 percent of them recognized the Salvation Army name and , 91 percent of those held a favorable impression.
General Booth, who was ahead of his time in understanding the power of a brand to attract attention, put his followers in uniform. (This year, one such follower, Patryce CoRae King, attracted attention in civvies as Miss Missouri in the Miss America pageant.) Booth was also responsible for another Army icon, the brass band that announced his open-air meetings. Many of the best orchestras in the United States, including the Chicago Symphony and the New York Philharmonic, have been seeded with Army brass players.
"The training is excellent," said Philip Smith, a Salvationist soldier who is the Philharmonic's principal trumpet player. "Kids play more difficult music than they would in a high school band, and they learn to play more lyrically, because they're frequently accompanying hymn singing."
But the best-known symbol of all was an American invention, the kettle that a San Francisco Salvationist set up in 1891 to give the poor Christmas Day dinners. Though they produce less than 5 percent of the Army's income, "the value of the kettles is branding," said Patricia Foster, the New York director of development. "It's important for us to be visible and on the street corner."
The reality, however, is that the Army is less visible today than in the past. Mr. Stein noted that passers-by are hard put simply to find the 52nd Street Center. But, he added, "People in need can spot the Army by its red shield." Indeed, street people, he said, refer to the Army familiarly as "Sallie."
The Army receives 28 percent of its income, the largest amount, from direct mail solicitations and people who send in checks. (Among other sources, the thrift shops are second at 23 percent; government support and gifts-in-kind each bring in 16 percent.)
Among individual donors are people like Joan Kroc, the widow of Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, who gave $80 million to build a recreation center in San Diego, and Ross Perot, who helped victims of Hurricane Andrew and the floods in the Midwest. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, whose star running back, Emmitt Smith, learned to play football at a Salvation Army youth program in Pensacola, Fla., has dedicated the Cowboys' Thanksgiving halftime show to the kickoff of the annual kettle campaign in Dallas.
And for all its image as a low-tech fund-raiser, the Army was among the first to exploit the possibilities in planned giving tools like gift annuities and remainder trusts. That was 25 years ago. Now, many of these donations are, um, maturing, as fund-raisers delicately say. Colonel Jones estimates that the Army's Southern Territory, which includes Florida, is the biggest of the four in planned giving, having written $122 million in contracts last year. (With the holiday season starting, New Yorkers will hear Mason Adams's distinctive croak on public service radio spots promoting the advantages of the Army's charitable gift annuities.)
Still, the average donor is more likely to be an elderly widow who lived through the Depression or whose husband fought in World War II, where the Army was very visible, and who lives below her means. For many years, the New York division received most of its money from Queens, because many police and firefighters lived there and they saw the Army on the front lines of poverty. Now the money comes from Manhattan, Westchester and Nassau Counties, home to many an Army donor whose circumstances improved and hotbeds of subscribers to the Metropolitan Opera, New York magazine and The New Yorker, whose mailing lists the Army rents.
Whether by accident or design, the Army has tapped into two hazily articulated but often deeply held beliefs, said Diane Winston, who wrote "Red-Hot and Righteous: The Urban Religion of the Salvation Army" (Harvard University Press). "Americans think religion is a good thing," Ms. Winston said, "and helping people is a very good thing."

HEADLINE: New Rallying Cry on Campus: Stockholder Power!

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
LIKE a grandchild who has traced the branches of his family tree, Josh Glasstetter is intimately familiar with the history of campus activism at Cornell University, where he is a junior.
He can tell you that students with guns took over Willard Straight Hall in the late 1960's to protest racism; that others floated military contracts like paper airplanes out the windows of Carpenter Hall in the waning days of the Vietnam War, and that still others built shantytowns in the mid-80's to draw attention to apartheid in South Africa. 
 Mr. Glasstetter, 20, sees himself as an heir to that grand tradition, but the weapons of his fight are these: strategic information culled from Edgar, the Web site of the Securities and Exchange Commission; figures buried deep in the annual reports of Fortune 500 companies; and, most critical of all, the proxy questions placed before the shareholders of those companies.
Mr. Glasstetter, whose white-blond hair and 6-foot-7-inch frame make him look more like a refugee from Southern California than the blue-collar suburb of Cleveland where he grew up, is a founder of Students for Socially Responsible Investing at Cornell. The quest of his fledgling group, and dozens of others sprouting on campuses across the country only in the last two years, is nothing less than this: to press universities to examine their endowments for corporate investments that conflict ethically with their missions, and, whenever possible, to use their substantial stakes in those big companies as leverage to lobby for change.
"It's different from the 60's," Mr. Glasstetter said over dinner in a natural foods restaurant near the wooded border of the Cornell campus. "By using the massive influence universities have -- not only in their investing, but in their purchasing and contracting -- we can set standards that corporations will have to uphold if they want to take advantage of universities' money."
He added, "I have friends who want to get into investment banking, just to work from within the system to change it."
Their mission, though new and formidable, is not lonely. This month, Mr. Glasstetter and about 400 other students representing more than 100 colleges and universities descended on the Yale campus for the founding conference of the Student Alliance to Reform Corporations. The alliance is pressing the same themes as the Cornell group, but hopes to marshal the collective strength of tens of billions of dollars invested by scores of university endowments.
Among the common principles of the conference participants is that universities, when contemplating investments, consider a company's record on labor rights, product safety, animal rights, the environment and minorities.
Stephen Viederman, the president of the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on preserving the environment, among other issues, said the wide draw of the Yale conference should be seen as a loud rebuttal to anyone who believes campus activism has been smothered by the nation's prosperity. "What is most important about all this is that students are trying to teach universities something, that investments have consequences," Mr. Viederman said. "That is something universities themselves don't teach in economics classes or business schools."
The wider movement has its roots not only in civil rights protests, but also in the antiapartheid effort, which urged universities to divest themselves of holdings in companies that did business in South Africa. But where Mr. Glasstetter's ancestors had slogans like "Make Love, Not War" and "Divest Now!," his group has struggled to find a rallying cry.
The Cornell group minted buttons last year that read "What? My tuition is going where?" But soon after the buttons appeared on backpacks, the students learned that tuition was spent on operating expenses, and not invested. The buttons had to be scrapped.
Finding a chant, an essential element of any protest, has proven no easier. For now, the students have settled on, "Hey, Hey! Ho, Ho! Bad Investments Have Got to Go!" But they are eagerly seeking alternatives.
In one sense, Mr. Glasstetter and the 14 or so other die-hard members of his group at Cornell have taken a page from the antiapartheid movement and urged that Cornell sell its stock in an "incorrigible" company: the cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris, of which Cornell, by its most recent tally, held 157,000 shares, worth $5.4 million on Sept. 30. (Cornell, citing the advice of its outside portfolio managers, has so far refused.)
BUT in marked contrast to the antiapartheid movement, the students' preferred strategy is more nuanced: they have followed the lead of a handful of foundations and socially conscious mutual funds that have sought to retain high-profile investments, rather than relinquish them, in an effort to prod progress.
The victories of the broader movement have been relatively few. A nearly two-year quest to persuade Yale to divest itself of tobacco holdings was ultimately unsuccessful, with Yale saying that it believed it could do more good working from within the tobacco companies than by walking away from them. Yale, which has invested about $9 million of its $7.2 billion endowment in tobacco stocks, has, for example, written letters to tobacco companies, urging that tobacco not be sold to minors, said Lawrence Haas, a Yale spokesman.
The Cornell group has made more substantial gains in the last school year. Last spring, for example, four students won an audience with the university's chief financial officer, and, later, the chairman of the trustee investment relations committee, to make this pitch: that the university swing its 308,000 shares in Home Depot, worth $18.8 million at the time, behind a shareholder initiative urging the home improvement chain to consider a ban on products manufactured from virgin timber cut from the world's oldest forests.
The trustees agreed.
"They did an outstanding job of explaining why the company should support this and what benefits it would have to us, as a university and a stockholder," said Frederick Rogers, the senior vice president and chief financial officer of Cornell, describing the students.
Though the environmentalists and others who supported the initiative ultimately lost their proxy fight at the company's annual meeting last May, Home Depot announced in August that it would refrain from using wood harvested from "environmentally sensitive areas."
For the students at Cornell, the Home Depot experience has already paid a rich dividend: the student assembly, the university's student government, has formed a standing committee that will make regular presentations about shareholder initiatives it believes the university should endorse.
But the students face a high hurdle: Mr. Rogers said that increasing the value of Cornell's endowment was the university's first priority, and that it was content to relinquish to outside money managers the responsibility of selecting stocks. Thus, Philip Morris, on the managers' advice, has remained in the university's portfolio.
Mr. Glasstetter said he would defer to other members of his group to serve on the new committee. But he will continue to lobby the university to make its investment preferences clear. That could mean a sequel to a rally the group held last year, called "Dress Up as the Company You Hate the Most." Mr. Glasstetter transformed himself into a box of cigarettes.
For Mr. Glasstetter, whose father owned a couple of gas stations outside Cleveland in the 1970's and 80's, his transformation into an activist cements a radical change in his life. As an adolescent, he had aggressively invested several thousand dollars given him by his family in blue-chip stocks, only to become disillusioned and divest himself on the eve of going to college.
"I totally bought into this idealistic vision of American big business and the thought that it was doing only great things for the entire world," he said. "That's a very one-sided, blind vision of what's going on."

HEADLINE: Desktop Discount Shopping, The Newest Perquisite

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
First came corporate day care centers. Then it was concierge services that pick up employees' dry cleaning or deliver groceries for a fee. Now comes the virtual discount mall, offering workers everything from books to car insurance at up to 10 percent off, right on their office computer screens.
In the latest attempt to please workers without giving them big raises, some of the nation's largest companies are trying to make shopping of all kinds both cheaper and easier for their employees. It is part of an explosion of soft benefits, which, unlike the hard perquisites of health insurance and retirement plans, cost employers almost nothing. 
 With unemployment at a 29-year low and people working longer hours, executives see the programs as a way to lift workers' morale. They also assume that employees who do their shopping in cyberspace will spend less time ducking out of the office to run errands. At the least, Susan R. Froid, a senior human resource manager at Microsoft, said, employees "don't have to spend all their free time figuring out what they're going to do -- it's an easy decision to make."
That was the pull for Lisa Rose, who works on hiring and training for Sylvan Learning Systems, an education company in Baltimore. When she heard about the offers, she logged onto Sylvan's Web site and bought medical insurance for her 6-month-old Labrador, Ewing, who is named after the New York Knicks center whom her husband idolizes. The cost, $16 a month, is deducted from her paycheck.
She also bought roadside insurance that covers towing, locksmith service and travel planning for $4.16 a month, not even bothering to compare the insurer's prices with AAA's. "It was so easy for me to sign up, and I don't have to pay another bill every month," she said.
The trend has picked up in recent weeks, with such corporate giants as AlliedSignal, Hallmark Cards, Nordstrom and Northwest Airlines connecting their internal Web sites to virtual malls where merchants sell everything from Hickory Farms sausage to MCI Worldcom long-distance service. The pioneers for such plans include Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Blue Cross/ Blue Shield, Boeing and Microsoft.
"It's so difficult to attract employees, and the retention side is getting more difficult," said Joe Demarte, the vice president for human resources at Nordstrom, the department store chain, which employs 40,000 people. The discounts are the latest addition to a benefit package that includes adoption advice and discounts on legal services.
The virtual malls are an Internet-age remake of the old corporate discount card that gave employees free tickets to a nearby amusement park or a few dollars off at the local florist. The World Wide Web, however, allows workers in satellite offices to take advantage of the discounts. It also enables employers to negotiate deals for a much wider array of products, including expensive items like insurance and mortgages.
The Internet discounts are part of a wider move toward offering more soft benefits to placate time-burdened workers. In 1994, for example, only 8 percent of companies made car insurance available to workers through company-sponsored plans. Next year, the portion should rise to 35 percent, according to Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm in Illinois.
The virtual malls are typically operated by Internet start-ups, which charge employers nothing for the service and build password-protected links from the corporate intranet sites to, say, toysrus.com. In exchange for what amounts to advertising on the Web site and in company brochures describing the program, merchants then offer the 5 percent to 10 percent discounts and pay a few percentage points of each sale to the Internet companies.
The trend is even creating a new niche of e-commerce. Employeesavings.com received a $5 million investment earlier this year from Benchmark Capital, which previously financed eBay and Webvan. By early 2000, employeesavings says its plans will cover two million people. And Rewards Plus, which sells only financial products, expects its annual sales to more than double to $9 million this year, as it increases its work force by 25 percent each quarter.
The programs are not without their downsides. Not all employees have Internet access, and those who do not -- some Nordstrom sales clerks or Northwest flight attendants, for example -- are often the ones who need the discounts the most because they make less money. (Companies say, however, that some of the discounts are available over the phone or at local stores.)
Web shopping is also a potential threat to productivity, giving workers a company-approved reason to procrastinate. Already, the peak time for Web traffic and many consumer e-commerce sites is the middle of the workday, when people have access to high-speed corporate Internet connections.
But human resource managers said they were not worried. "This isn't something where you're going to go out and play for hours," Mr. Demarte said. "It probably isn't any different from what they already do" by making personal phone calls.
And it may be cheaper. Robert A. Arrison, 41, a computer systems administrator at Aramark Inc., the Philadelphia food service company, was shopping for homeowners' and auto insurance a year ago. He checked the rates of Allstate Insurance, which had sold him a previous policy, and Allmerica Financial, which participated in his company's discount plan. By going with Allmerica, he said, he saved almost $200 a year.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
For an American Holiday, Anything Goes

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the earliest accounts of the first Thanksgiving, the meal included birds, corn, peas, roast venison and beer. Beer? Apparently there was not yet a decent wine shop in all of Massachusetts.
There are probably quite a few people who still drink beer with their Thanksgiving dinner, and given some of the delicious beers on the market now, it could make for a delightful partnership. But beer is filling, and with the amount of food most of us are expected to ingest on Thanksgiving, wine is a wiser and more festive choice. 
 The traditional Thanksgiving repast is neither a delicate meal nor a sophisticated one; it does not blend subtle, fleeting tastes and aromas. So it is not a time to bring out great white Burgundies, for instance. A big Champagne, like Krug or Bollinger, will hold its own quite well with turkey. But most people are saving their Champagne for the New Year's Eve of all New Year's Eves.
Besides, Thanksgiving is an American event whose centerpiece, the turkey, goes back, oh, 40 million years or so. I guess that makes it as indigenous as an American creature can be. In my chauvinistic view, the bird -- and the rest of us -- deserve American wines.
Choosing domestic wines offers an unexpected bonus. White Burgundy may be out, but California chardonnay, which for my money is too overwhelming for most fowl, is the perfect match for turkey. There are some restrained, elegant chardonnays around, though for the most part California chardonnay is a big-bodied, robust white wine full of up-front flavor and aroma. In other words, just right for the less than subtle taste of a roast turkey filled with a pungent dressing.
For a rich, powerful chardonnay, I'd suggest Chalone Vineyards 1997, a big, buttery, complex wine from the Gavilan Mountains south of San Francisco. It will hold its own in any company, including game. Or if you are planning a venison dinner and you prefer a white wine, this could be the one for you. (About $30.)
A bit less strident, perhaps, but still assertive is Fess Parker's American Tradition Reserve Chardonnay 1997, from the Santa Ynez Valley north of Santa Barbara. The wine has plenty of extract, a nice touch of oak, and a remarkably long finish. (About $20).
For something completely different, there's Tablas Creek Blanc 1997, a muscular blend of three Rhone Valley grapes: marsanne, viognier and roussanne. Tablas Creek is a relatively new winery near Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, started in 1990 by the Perrin family of Chateau de Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape. While not a replica of a blockbuster Hermitage white, this white is both elegant and intense. (About $27.)
Most traditionalists will want a red wine with their Thanksgiving dinner, and if they are also patriots, they will probably call for zinfandel, the grape America has adopted as its own. Ridge Vineyards in Santa Clara makes a variety of zinfandels from grapes purchased all over California, the unifying factor being what one wine guide calls the "classic restraint" of the winemaker, Paul Draper. I take that to mean that the wines are rich and intense but less rough and rustic than so many other zinfandels. Ridge's 1996 Sonoma Station Zinfandel has zinfandel fruitiness and classic Ridge structure. (About $20.)
Amador County, far to the east of the Napa Valley, produces some of the best zinfandel grapes. Ravenswood, in Sonoma County, another winery that made its name with zinfandel, uses Amador grapes for one of its most enticing bottlings, Ravenswood Amador County. The scent of blackberries fills the room once the bottle is opened; on the palate, the flavors linger on and on. (About $15.)
For most families, the best choice is a wine priced low enough so that opening another bottle or three or four is not going to precipitate a post-dinner economic crisis. ("That uncle of yours can sure put it away!") For many savvy wine drinkers, the choice is Marietta Cellars Old Vine Red, a blend that lets the winemaker, Chris Bilbro in Sonoma County, use whatever he thinks will produce the kind of wine he wants to make. Zinfandel, carignane, syrah and cabernet may find their way into this delicious, full-bodied wine. Different vintages may be used, which is why the wine is identified only by lot number. Currently for sale, if you can find this very popular wine, is Lot No. 23. (About $12.)
By this point, there are probably quite a few people muttering, "Where's the merlot?" For me, most merlot is too soft and unstructured, without enough tannin, for a main course like turkey -- unless it is bolstered with 30 percent cabernet sauvignon. Here is one that sort of breaks the rules: Canoe Ridge from Washington State has merlot's softer taste, but it has good body. (About $19.)
Not too many years ago, it would have been difficult to create a completely American wine selection for an important meal. No longer. A Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs as an aperitif will match any French Champagne in its price range. (About $25.)
Then, end the day not with Cognac or grappa but with a great American drink, Laird's 12-year-old apple brandy. (About $50). Thanksgiving became an official holiday in 1863; the Lairds began making apple brandy in 1780. Did somebody say something about tradition?

HEADLINE: Georgia Trying Anxiously to Stay Out of Chechen War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Capped in snow, the Shatili Mountains are fabled for their rugged beauty. These days they are also one of the Caucasus' more anxious borders.
To the north is Chechnya, a brutal battleground for the Russian military. On the southern side of the mountain divide is Georgia, a former Soviet republic. 
 The Georgians would like nothing better than to stay out of the fighting in the rebellious Russian province to the north. But they have had to contend with a hard-nosed Russian military, which recently sought permission to open a new front against Chechnya from Georgian territory.
"It is very important for us to have good-neighborly relations with Russia, but good relations do not mean saying no to our principles," the Georgian president, Eduard Shevardnadze, said in an interview. "I am categorically opposed to having Russian and Georgian border troops jointly defend the border with Chechnya. And I am even more opposed to the idea of the Russian side using Russian bases in Georgia against Chechnya in a military campaign."
When world leaders meet this week in Istanbul to discuss security issues, the increasingly tense situation in the Caucasus will be among their top concerns. Diplomats have been working behind the scenes on conventional arms limits, energy pipelines and the burning conflict in Chechnya to make the summit meeting a success -- or, at least, not a disappointing embarrassment.
Like Baltic nations during Soviet times, the Caucasus is shaping up as an arena for East-West competition, and possibly even a bit of Russian intrigue. The tone may have been set last week when Marshal Igor Sergeyev, Russia's defense minister, declared that Russia and the United States were locked in a bitter struggle for dominance of the Caucasus, Caspian and Central Asian regions.
Certainly, Georgia's leaders are worried that Russia is determined not only to subdue Chechnya but also to try to reverse Russia's waning influence in the neighboring region.
It is not surprising that Georgia would be particularly sensitive to the political winds blowing from Moscow. Mr. Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, has repeatedly insisted that the future of his country lies with the West. He has even said Georgia intends to apply for NATO membership in 2005, which would be the last year of Mr. Shevardnadze's next term as president, assuming he is re-elected next spring.
But Georgia is also a poor nation, burdened with secessionist movements of its own and a long legacy of economic and military dependence on its Russian neighbor.
Russia still maintains four military bases here, including the Vaziani air base just 30 minutes from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. Mr. Shevardnadze's policy has been to develop Georgia's links with the West while gradually easing the Russian troops out.
Russia recently removed the last of its 15,000 border troops. Georgian officials have sought to use the coming Istanbul meeting to negotiate the closing of key Russian bases as well as to bring about a sharp reduction in the number of Russian forces here. The understandings are part of an updated accord limiting conventional arms, which diplomats hope to sign in Istanbul.
At the same time, Georgia's relations with Russia have worsened as a result of the Chechen war. And Georgia's officials have become concerned that the Russians are in no hurry to leave.
Last month, for instance, Russia sought to send several hundred border troops back to Georgia to help the Georgians patrol their 50-mile-long border with Chechnya, the only stretch of the Chechen border that is not under Russia's jurisdiction. It is currently guarded by 160 lightly armed Georgian border troops.
As many as 4,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have crossed into Georgia in the last two months to flee the fighting in Chechnya. That is a trickle compared with the 200,000 refugees who have fled to Ingushetia, another Russian republic bordering on Chechnya.
But Russia believes that the mountain passes to Georgia may become an exit route for Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord sought by the Russians, or some of his fighters if Russian troops continue their march into Chechnya and seize Grozny, the capital. Russian officials have also charged that arms have been smuggled across the border, an allegation Georgians deny.
Russia has also broached the idea of using some of its bases in Georgia in the military campaign against Chechnya, the Georgians say. Marshal Sergeyev planned to come to Tbilisi to discuss the plan, but his trip was canceled after Georgia rejected the idea, Georgian officials here said.
The Georgian government fears that the Russian aim was to use its border troops and bases to encircle Chechnya and open up a new front in the war.
"Had we gone along with those options, we could have been drawn into a big conflict in the Caucasus," Mr. Shevardnadze said.
Georgia's rebuff, however, did not go down well in Moscow. Soon afterward, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, declared that citizens from Georgia and the neighboring former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan would have to obtain visas to travel to Russia, ostensibly to guard against arms trafficking and infiltration by terrorists.
Then Russian military officials unleashed a barrage of allegations suggesting that the Georgians were in league with the Chechen fighters. In fact, there is no love lost between the Christian Orthodox Georgian authorities and the militantly Islamic Mr. Basayev, who fought on the side of Muslim secessionists in Georgia.
Despite the angry words, experts here doubt that Russia has a grand strategy to reassert itself in the Caucasus. But as President Boris N. Yeltsin's physical and political health has declined, rival agendas have emerged in Moscow, with the Russian military taking a particularly hard line.
An immediate test of Russian intentions will come this week at the Istanbul meeting, held by the Organization for Economic and Security Cooperation in Europe, where world leaders hope to sign an updated version of the 1990 agreement limiting conventional forces in Europe.
As part of that accord, the Georgians want the Russians to accept the principle that their forces in Georgia should not exceed those of the modest Georgian military. That would force the Russians to cut their armored combat vehicles in Georgia, for instance, by more than half.
Georgian officials want the Russians to agree to quit the Vaziani air base, near their capital, and the Gudauta base, in the Georgian Abkhazian region.
The Vaziani base is a visible reminder of Moscow's once-dominant role here. Gudauta is situated in the breakaway Abkhazian sector, where Georgia has long suspected the Russians of aiding the separatists.
At least some Georgian officials, however, are dubious that Russia is prepared to meet their demands and to reduce, quickly, its military presence in Georgia.
"Russia's broad strategy is to keep their numbers in the Caucasus and even increase these numbers," said Archil M. Gegeshidze, the national security adviser to Mr. Shevardnadze. "Agreeing with our proposals and starting a process of reduction is something that is against their long-term strategy."

Growth in Japan Is Expected To Lift World Rate in 2000

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The world economy is growing at an unexpectedly fast pace because of surprisingly strong expansion in Japan and South Korea, a more modest upturn in Europe and economic resilience in the United States, an organization of the world's richest nations said here today in a semiannual appraisal.
The group, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which helps coordinate policy among the affluent nations, said it expected the global growth rate to reach 3.5 percent next year. Its assessment in May had forecast growth in 2000 of 2.9 percent. 
 "The outlook for world and O.E.C.D.-wide output growth has improved substantially over the past few months," the organization said.
Its report suggested that Japan's economic recovery in particular had been more vigorous than anticipated. The organization's earlier assessment projected that Japan would continue to struggle next year against recession, its worst since the end of World War II.
"These changes reflect mainly unexpected near-term momentum in the United States economy, a stronger and more rapid resumption of growth in Japan and, particularly, South Korea, as well as a slightly better outlook for the European Union," the report said.
Europe, it said, is showing signs of expansion and in 2000 and 2001 is expected to grow 2.8 percent in the 11-nation euro currency zone. In its last report, the O.E.C.D. predicted euro zone growth next year of 2.6 percent.
The report also suggested that European countries would make progress against high unemployment.
It forecast 3.1 percent growth for the United States next year, after predicting last spring that the American economy faced a natural slowdown and 2 percent growth after eight years of expansion.
And it said that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, had emerged from recession faster than expected, but that in the long term it faced risks from the continued appreciation of the yen.
The Japanese currency's strength this year has already hurt profit at many big-name corporations that derive much of their business from exports, like Sony, Toyota and Hitachi. The yen's rise partly reflects the increased prospect of higher interest rates in Japan because of the heavy borrowing that the government must undertake to stimulate growth through spending.
Last week, the Japanese government announced a new package of economic stimulants worth about $171 billion, almost twice the amount that had been expected a few weeks earlier.
The 29-member O.E.C.D., founded in 1960, was originally made up of nations in Europe and North America. It expanded to include Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Finland. More recently, Mexico, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and South Korea have joined.

HEADLINE: Lean Budget, Bloated Government

BYLINE: By Jonathan Rauch; Jonathan Rauch is author of the forthcoming "Government's End: Why Washington Stopped Working."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The closing convulsions of the budget negotiations have marked the return of a condition rarely seen in Washington these days: calm. No partisan train wreck. No government shutdown. In a sort of tacit exchange, conservatives demanded no major reductions in the scope or size of government, and liberals did not demand costly new expansions.
Instead, the White House and Congressional Republicans have haggled behind closed doors over a few contested priorities. President Clinton wanted more new teachers; Congress wanted to curtail abortions abroad. 
 Symbolically, such things matter, but in the context of a $1.8 trillion federal budget, they are flyspecks. Mr. Clinton and the Republicans now act like a husband and wife who loathe each other but have become too tired to fight.
But there is news in the budget compromise. This year seals the failure of a 20-year effort by several Presidents and Republican Congresses to assert control over government programs.
Ever since Barry Goldwater rose to prominence in the late 1950's, conservatives have wanted to make government smaller -- not just to reduce its overall spending, but to eliminate what they regarded as wasteful or illegitimate programs.
David Stockman, President Ronald Reagan's first budget director, tried and failed. In eight years, Mr. Reagan eliminated only four major programs: general revenue sharing with local governments, urban-development action grants, the synthetic-fuels program and the Clinch River breeder reactor in Tennessee.
In 1995, Newt Gingrich tried again. As speaker of the House, he managed to chop out a couple of hundred items, almost all of them too small to notice.
For his trouble, Mr. Gingrich, like Mr. Stockman, earned the enmity of the thousands of groups that make their living by preserving programs that benefit them. Those groups and the Democrats portrayed Mr. Gingrich and his party as mad slashers. This image, plus the government shutdown, cost the Republicans dearly in the next two elections.
Since then, conservatives have subsided into a torpor. In 1997, they ended about two dozen small programs, like the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Railroad Retirement Board's management improvement fund.
In 1998, they killed about 10 programs. The sums involved were trivial: a total of $134 million in 1997, even less the year after.
Stephen Moore, the director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, notes that the 70 or so biggest programs that Republican revolutionaries once swore to eliminate -- like the Appalachian Regional Commission and the National Writing Project -- are not only still there, but they have had their average spending grow by 3 percent since the Republicans took over Congress.
If domestic programs were not cut, how did Congress balance the budget? By cutting defense (a well that is now nearly empty), raising taxes and riding the economic boom.
In this year's budget fight, the conservatives gave up altogether on eliminating programs. To achieve a spending reduction of less than $4 billion, or just a fifth of 1 percent of the total budget, they went with an across-the-board spending reduction. In effect, they couldn't find any significant programs that they could do without.
The conservatives' failure gives liberals no cause for celebration. In effect, the attempted reforms of the 1980's and 1990's have ended in a conundrum: the government should balance the budget, but it must do so while preserving more or less every program it has ever adopted. That means conservatives cannot get rid of old programs, but it also means that liberals can only rarely create innovative new ones.
Two decades ago, the country began wrestling with both high deficits and an intractable array of government programs. Now, finally, fiscal reform has triumphed, at the precise moment that governmental reform has collapsed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Rose Sharply In October

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Industrial production climbed at its fastest rate in seven months during October as utilities and factories rebounded from a dip in September, the Federal Reserve said today.
Production by the nation's mines, factories and utilities rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, much stronger than expected, after falling a revised one-tenth of 1 percent in September, when Hurricane Floyd wreaked havoc on the East Coast. 
 The report of rising manufacturing vigor came before Federal Reserve policy makers met today to consider whether to raise interest rates for a third time this year. They decided to do so, raising short-term rates a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
"This is another healthy sign that productivity is rising," Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis, said of the report. "We're seeing manufacturing humming with employment gains slowing -- that is productivity."
The October increase in industrial production was the biggest since a matching rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in March, more than twice the gain of three-tenths of 1 percent forecast by analysts.
"In the recovery after the storm, output rebounded at electrical utilities and in a number of manufacturing industries," the Fed said.
Automakers raised their production rate to 13.2 million new cars and trucks a year from 12.9 million in September, signaling their expectations of brisk consumer demand ahead.
Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, said that the October production gain was more than simply a bounceback from Hurricane Floyd. He pointed to export demand and possible stockpiling by businesses against Year 2000 problems.
Asian economies have been reviving after a lengthy slump throughout 1998, providing a stronger market for United States-made products.
Businesses ran at 80.7 percent of capacity in October, up from 80.4 percent in September, for the strongest operating rate since last December when they were also at 80.7 percent of capacity.
But Ken Mayland, an economist with KeyCorp in Cleveland, said there was no cause for concern since capacity utilization rates are now lower than they were two years ago and there was industrial slack in overseas economies.
"This means that U.S. industrial production can sustain a rapid pace of growth for more than a year before there would be any possibility of bottlenecks and price pressures," Mr. Mayland said.
The Fed said that manufacturers increased their production in October by six-tenths of 1 percent after a slim rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in September. It was the most vigorous increase in manufacturing activity in a year, since a rise in October 1998 of seven-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Newcomer Gets Attention In Newark

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
JUST a few years ago, Cory Booker seemed to face a stark choice: he could aim to own the world or save it.
An all-American high school football player from Bergen County, Stanford graduate and Rhodes scholar, Mr. Booker was not wanting for lucrative opportunities when he left Yale Law School. Instead he moved to a lousy building here on Martin Luther King Boulevard, which, if you believe Chris Rock, makes it the worst street in the city. 
 He had arrived with a suburban liberal vision of creating one more nonprofit do-gooder group on downtrodden Newark. But then his neighbors saw him take on a slum lord on the block.
"Boy, are you here to be a lawyer or to help the community?" an activist named Virginia Jones asked him. "If you're here to help the community, then you're going to be our candidate for councilman."
It's been 18 months since Mr. Booker, 30, unseated the veteran Central Ward councilman, George Branch, and, in the estimation of many, lodged the sturdiest wrench in this city's machine politics in a long time. He's high on the handicappers' short list of mayoral contenders in 2002.
This weekend, he will help lead a two-day march to draw attention to the plight of the children, who have among the highest rates of infant mortality, teenage pregnancy and failure to finish high school in the nation. This is not exactly the message promoted by the political establishment, which is celebrating Newark's first period of sustained momentum since the 1967 riots.
Officials first denied the march a permit, citing the difficulty of providing security, and Mayor Sharpe James complained to reporters that the march "seems to be a protest against existing service." A new permit application is pending.
"In many ways, Booker's returning to a more elemental issue in black politics, which is the poor who were not able to ride the crest of urban revitalization," said Clement Price, an expert on Newark at Rutgers University.
Despite a privileged childhood, Mr. Booker knew exclusion. He grew up in the comfortable town of Harrington Park, the son of two I.B.M. employees, but his parents had such trouble buying a house that they sued for discrimination. Mr. Booker and his brother were the only blacks in their public school for much of their childhood, and Mr. Booker still remembers the parents of his white prom date refusing to let her out of the house.
He was drawn to cities, volunteering in impoverished East Palo Alto, Calif., while at Stanford and in New Haven while at Yale. Why, he asked, did a black child born in New Haven in the 1990's have less chance of success than Mr. Booker's father, who grew up poor in a segregated town in the hills of North Carolina two generations ago?
Mr. Booker does not overlook the accomplishments in downtown Newark: a new, grand performing arts center; a new minor league baseball stadium; the anticipated arrival of the Nets; a hot real estate market; and a drop in crime. Mr. James calls Newark Renaissance City.
"How do you measure a renaissance?" Mr. Booker asked. "If you measure it in health indices, it's not a renaissance. If you measure it by unemployment, there's been no appreciable difference. If you measure it by median income, there's been no real change."
NOR has the renaissance hit local government. The much-derided school system is under state control, and 1990's municipal corruption scandals resulted in convictions of three City Council members, a former police director and Mayor James's former chief of staff.
Mr. Booker said he came here from Yale because "I had New Jersey in my blood," but clearly some of the old guard sniff ambition. "The guy is paranoid about Cory," one local party official said of Mr. James, who did not return telephone calls.
But Mr. Booker has their attention. Last summer, he organized a vigil at a large housing development in his ward to draw attention to the feverish drug trade. For 10 days, he and his supporters fasted and slept in tents on the grounds of the development, holding health and employment workshops by day. The event succeeded in replacing the drug dealers with a 24-hour police van and a security fence.
The mayor was absent from the newsconference at the start of the vigil, but he was there at the end, with praise and a hug for Mr. Booker, and a hint he could hear his footsteps. "Just as there was a Ken Gibson and a Sharpe James," the mayor said then, referring to the mayor he defeated in 1986, "there will be a Cory Booker and others."

SOME of the improvements have been in place almost a week, but tomorrow the Delta Shuttle will formally open its newly renovated Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York -- a terminal used almost exclusively by business travelers flying between New York and Boston and Washington. (The U S Airways Shuttle departs from that airline's main terminal at La Guardia.)
Among the improvements resulting from Delta's yearlong, $7.5 million overhaul are an upgraded business center with free fax and photocopy services, and several computer stations. A new Bloomberg News station in the waiting area has two computers and a larger screen with a continuous display of financial results, as well as the latest stock prices. 
 In the gate area, automated ticketing kiosks with touch-screen technology allow passengers to receive boarding passes in less than a minute. The redesigned passenger waiting area now has more electrical outlets and telephones with data ports for computers. Baggage carts with cover flaps -- and weather screens on the outside baggage conveyor belt -- will provide better protection for passengers' checked luggage.
Promising "many enhancements" in the near future, William Crumbley, the managing director of the Delta Shuttle, said that the overwhelming majority of its passengers traveled to or from New York. Since its acquisition from Pan Am in 1991, the Delta Shuttle has carried more than 15 million passengers.
 
Pan Am Expands Service
The current incarnation of Pan American Airways is only a shadow of its former self, but today it is scheduled to begin round-trip service six days a week between its headquarters in Portsmouth, N.H., and Gary/Chicago Airport in northern Indiana, and similar service between Gary/Chicago and Sanford/Orlando Airport in central Florida.
Acquired after bankruptcy proceedings in June 1998 by four New England investors, Pan Am operated as a charter airline until last month when it began Portsmouth-Orlando flights six days a week.
 
More Leg Room on Delta
Beginning Dec. 2, Delta Air Lines will begin flying the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft between Kennedy International Airport in New York and Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. Delta said its business-class seats had more than double the space of first-class seats of other carriers flying nonstop between New York and Phoenix.
 
LanChile-Alaska Air Accord
LanChile said yesterday that it had entered into a code-sharing agreement with Alaska Airlines. Passengers on both airlines are eligible to participate in the other's frequent-flier programs. Also, through Jan. 31, 2000, LanChile frequent-flier members can earn 1,865 miles when they stay at participating Hyatt Hotels and Resorts in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile. After January, each stay at a Hyatt will earn 385 miles. And when LanChile joins the One World alliance, a move tentatively scheduled for next March, its frequent-flier miles can be redeemed on other alliance airlines, including AMR's American Airlines, British Airways and Air Canada.
 
Ever-Bigger Ships
Bigness may not be everything, as the economist E. F. Schumacher argued in his 1973 book "Small Is Beautiful," but you couldn't prove that from the cruise industry's ever-bigger ships. On Nov. 8, Carnival's Cunard Lines announced that it had completed plans for what will be the longest passenger ship ever built (1,100 feet), to be introduced in 2003.
Two days later, on Nov. 10, the Port of Miami-Dade officially opened what it described as the world's biggest cruise passenger terminal (250,000 square feet). And a day after that, this season's biggest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's 142,000-ton Voyager of the Seas, capable of carrying 3,100 passengers, arrived in Miami in preparation for its year-round seven-night cruises to the Caribbean beginning on Nov. 21.
There are, of course, a number of cruise lines with small ships sailing interesting itineraries. But the reason for the huge ships is that they are intended not just to take passengers on a cruise but on a floating vacation, the better to compete with land-based resorts.

Rates May Rise, but This Bull Is Hanging On

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
INTEREST rates may rise, the Federal Reserve may fret, but there's just no keeping a good bull market down.
Voicing concerns that the economy is too darn hot and employment is way too tight, the Fed yesterday raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Stock investors generally dislike interest rate increases because, in the broadest sense, they raise the cost of operating a business. Rising rates also make bonds more attractive than stocks as investments. 
 So it was not too surprising that the Fed's rate increase rattled stocks after it was announced. A quick blip upward could not be sustained, and the Dow Jones industrials fell about 140 points on the news.
Minutes later, stock traders got their bearings and roared with approval over the move. The white-hot Nasdaq composite index gained 73.51 points on the day, a 2.28 percent increase. The Dow Jones industrial average raced ahead 171.58 points, or 1.59 percent. At the end of the trading day, the Dow stood at 10,932.33, just 3.8 percent below its high reached last August.
The investor euphoria after the Fed's action seemed to be based on two assumptions. Most compelling was the view that the Fed's move was the last rate increase for the foreseeable future. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee takes place on Dec. 21, an unlikely occasion for anyone except Ebenezer Scrooge to raise rates. The meeting after that, in early February, is expected to feature economic statistics distorted by Year 2000 anomalies. As a result, many economists have concluded that the Fed will not move again on rates until next spring regardless of what the economic numbers show.
Stock investors also liked yesterday's decision by the Fed to shift into neutral on any future moves. Before the meeting, the Fed had assumed a stance that favored tightening.
The increase yesterday in the federal funds rate, the Fed's third increase since June, raises the overnight rate charged by banks when they lend excess funds to one another.
The Fed also raised the rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank, called the discount rate, to 5 percent, a quarter-point move. Some banks responded by raising the prime rate, a benchmark for what they charge some of their best customers, with others likely to follow.
But even as stock investors celebrated, bond investors took up their worry beads. Bond prices fell, pushing up the yield on the 30-year United States Treasury bond to 6.06 percent yesterday, from 6.024 percent on Monday. Bond investors chose to read the Fed's statement that accompanied the rate rises as a warning that further rate increases will follow if the economy does not start to cool.
"We have to see growth slow down to ensure that this is in fact going to be the last tightening move," said Stephen D. Slifer, chief United Sates economist at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Slifer pointed out that recent hints of a slowdown, flattening retail sales and a decline in the housing sector had to be echoed in other data for the Fed to relax on rates. "If this turns out to be another fakeout and growth continues to be 4 to 5 percent," Mr. Slifer said, "the Fed will be back."
In its comments, the Fed gave clues to what economic data it will be watching most closely in coming weeks to help it decide where to go on interest rates. A prime cause for alarm is the low unemployment rate, the central bank said. With unemployment falling to a 29-year low of 4.1 percent last month, many fear that the United States is running out of employable workers. Such low unemployment cannot continue indefinitely without leading to higher labor costs and rising inflation.
What is more, overall economic growth is running well ahead of the rate the Fed would prefer to see. The initial estimate on gross domestic product growth in the third quarter is an increase of 4.8 percent; economists say this figure may be revised up to 5.5 percent. Either number is far above the Fed's target growth rate of 3 percent or even 3.5 percent.
Although the Fed's statement made no mention of elevated stock prices and the ensuing wealth effect from investors who feel more free to spend, Alan Greenspan, the Fed Chairman, has telegraphed to investors that rising stock prices have become a factor in his decisions on rates. In a speech before the Business Council on Oct. 28, Mr. Greenspan alluded to the wealth effect when he remarked upon the "expanding net worth of households relative to income." If the nation's households are seeing their net worths rising faster than their incomes, much of this is driven by stocks.
As a result, the strong rally seen in stocks yesterday may have the unintended consequence of increasing the likelihood of future moves to raise rates. This is also a risk because a rising stock market translates very closely to increased retail sales and other signs of economic strength.
According to International Strategy and Investment, an investment advisory firm, the stock market and Christmas sales are inextricably linked. Last year, for example, the market was up 17 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, and retail sales grew at a strong 11 percent rate from the previous quarter. Conversely, in 1997, the stock market rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter, and retail sales moved up at exactly the same rate.
Mr. Slifer agreed that the stock market acts as a great force on the economy. "If the stock boys keep revving it up here and stock prices go up again," he said, "then budding signs of a slowdown will disappear and G.D.P. growth will continue." Another rate increase would probably follow.
The Fed's focus on the domestic economy in its statement, and the absence of any mention of the international economic situation, are also revealing. The message, said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, is that the Fed is far from finished with raising rates. "I think it's telling you that they're going to keep tightening as long as the economy is too strong," Mr. Dudley said. "If the economy keeps going along at this pace, the Fed is going to have to do more."
Mr. Dudley added that the Fed said its action yesterday "should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward." But investors who see a sign of no further rate increases should recall that the same statement was made the last time the Fed raised rates, in August.
Even though the stock market seemed to welcome yesterday's action by the Fed as its final move for a while, numbers still to come could quickly change the picture. Today's announcement of the Consumer Price Index for October is expected to show an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent from October 1998. If the number checks in much higher than that, all bets are off, traders say.

Shares Rally on Fed's Action; Dow Jumps 171.58 Points

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks jumped yesterday in a rally fueled by relief as investors bet that the Federal Reserve, after increasing short-term rates for the third time this year, would be done with raising rates in the near future.
The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 171.58 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,932.33. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index continued to climb, soaring 73.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,293.05, setting its 11th closing high in 13 trading sessions. The Nasdaq market shut down for about 20 minutes, because of system problems, crippling trading before the close.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a closing high, its first in four months. It rose 25.64 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,420.03, surpassing the high of 1,418.78 set July 16.
The Fed raised two short-term interest rates to ensure that inflation remained dormant; the central bank also signaled that the increase might be the last for a while.
The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks was raised to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent, which returned it to the level it was before the Fed started a series of three rate cuts last year. The Fed also increased the discount rate on direct loans to banks to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent.
Analysts had been almost evenly divided on whether the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, would -- or should -- raise rates for the third time this year to calm inflationary pressures.
"Now we have symmetry: We had three tightenings; we had three easings," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company. "It's behind us, we can move on and start to focus on earnings-growth potential and I think that's a positive for the marketplace."
The committee's next meeting is set for Dec. 21. But Wall Street is betting that the Fed will stand pat for fear of causing more uneasiness ahead of possible widespread computer problems when the calendar flips from 1999 to 2000. The first meeting in the new year is not scheduled until Feb. 1.
Stock of financial-service companies were big gainers, with American Express up 2 1/4 a share, to 159 1/2; Merrill Lynch rising 5 1/16, to 87 3/4, and J. P. Morgan & Company, gaining 4 1/8, to 142 1/2.
The United States trade agreement with China, meanwhile, helped stimulate buying of the stocks of Asian, European and Latin American Internet access providers and media companies.
The China.com Corporation, a Hong Kong-based supplier of Internet services throughout the Asia-Pacific region, soared 27 1/4 a share, to 127 3/4, and the EuroWeb International Corporation, a Central European Internet access provider, saw its shares rise 6 7/32 at 8 9/32.
America Online gained 9 5/8, to 159 1/2, after it introduced a Brazilian online access service, its first in Latin America. A rival of America Online, StarMedia Network Inc., an Internet media network aimed at Spanish and Portuguese speakers, rose 5 1/16, to 37 1/2.

Treasury Prices Decline
 By Bloomberg News
Prices for Treasury bonds suffered their biggest decline in more than a month after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for a third time this year and warned that inflation risks remain.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 16/32, to 100 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.06 percent, from 6.02 percent on Monday.
"If Fed officials think the economy is still strong, they could continue to make policy adjustments" that might hurt bonds, said Roger Bayston, who oversees $10 billion in fixed-income investments at Franklin Templeton Group in San Mateo, Calif. He is staying away from Treasuries, instead looking to buy mortgage- backed, asset-backed and corporate debt for their higher yields.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE AMERICAN WORKER;
Union Leaders, Sensing Betrayal, Will Try to Block Agreement in Congress

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Union leaders pledged yesterday to try to block Congressional approval of the Clinton administration deal for China to join the World Trade Organization, predicting that they could stop the accord the way they had blocked other administration trade initiatives.
Several labor leaders said they felt betrayed that President Clinton, after having promised to "put a human face on the global economy," would reach a trade-liberalization pact with a country that has suppressed unions and imprisoned labor leaders. 
 The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John J. Sweeney, cited a case in which several Chinese labor leaders were jailed after having led a demonstration by workers who were demanding back wages.
The director of the international department of the federation, Barbara Shailor, said: "In China, the labor-rights situation is particularly egregious. It's not only that they can't have unions, but attempts to form unions will put them in prison and, sometimes, put them before an execution squad."
Labor leaders predicted that they could block approval by mustering a majority in the House that would include most Democrats, labor-friendly Republican moderates and conservative Republicans angry about what they called China's human rights violations.
"This will be a very serious fight for us," the chief lobbyist of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Peggy Taylor, said. "This will certainly be as serious as any trade fight we've been in. The consequences of this deal are huge."
One of the biggest concerns is that by letting China join the trade organization, the United States would give up its ability to punish China unilaterally over trade violations, because the 135-nation group would adjudicate trade disputes.
Labor leaders said the accord made it all the more important that ministers at the trade group's meeting in Seattle in two weeks agreed to allow trade penalities against countries that violated fundamental labor rights by, for example, not allowing unions or by tolerating child labor.
Several union officials said they feared that the trade group would never approve such penalties after a giant country like China with extensive labor-rights violations joined.
"We're going to fight this big time," Mark Levinson, director of policy at the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said. "It's an outrage that a country with China's record on labor rights is allowed into the W.T.O. without any attempt to improve its record. Once a country as big as China is in the W.T.O., that may forever doom the W.T.O. as a forum where progress can be made on labor rights."
In condemning the agreement, Mr. Sweeney used unusually harsh language toward an administration that he usually treats as an ally. Calling the accord "a grave mistake," he said, "It is disgustingly hypocritical of the Clinton White House to invoke the need to 'put a human face on the global economy' while prostrating itself in pursuit of a trade deal with a rogue nation that decorates itself with human rights abuses as if they were medals of honor."
Several union officials said the deal would probably soften support for Vice President Al Gore, whom the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed for presidency last month. In November 1997, the labor movement dealt Mr. Clinton one of his worst legislative blows when it persuaded the House not to pass a "fast track" bill to extend his authority to negotiate trade accords.
"I see this as a much bigger fight than fast track," Mr. Levinson said.
Several labor leaders said they thought that Mr. Sweeney would fight the agreement especially hard, because other labor leaders have criticized him for not being tough enough on trade. "If we're going to stop this, it's going to be in the House," the teamsters' political director, Michael Mathis, said.
The president's economics adviser, Gene Sperling, said Washington had won concessions on several labor demands, among them protections against a surge in imports. Mr. Sperling said that China would not agree to some labor demands and that if the administration had insisted on them, the agreement would have been scuttled.
"Pulling China into a rule-based global trading system," he said, "and getting much more involvement by the United States and other democracies in their economy will in the long run do more for labor and human rights than making demands that China wouldn't go along with and would have blown up the agreement."

HEADLINE: Text of Decision by MonetaryCommittee

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.5 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 5 percent.
Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential.
As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.
Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

HEADLINE: SHORT-TERM RATES ARE RAISED BY FED A QUARTER-POINT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, saying that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation.
It was the third time this year that the central bank had raised rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has its limits. 
 In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to become the longest in the nation's history.
The Fed said it was raising its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent; the move followed two other quarter-point increases this year, in June and August. Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago.
The central bank also removed its formal stance toward higher rates, moving to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled for Dec. 21.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose immediately after the Fed's announcement this afternoon, fell back, then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points. Page C1.
It was the highest level for the index in more than two months and suggested that investors see no more rate increases coming before the Fed's first meeting of 2000, a two-day session on Feb. 1 and 2.
The central bank also said it would increase its largely symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the Federal Reserve system to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent. It was the second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two quarter-point reductions last year.
The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly began to affect the rates paid by businesses and consumers. Banks started raising their prime lending rate by a quarter of a point, to 8.5 percent, a move that will lead to higher rates on credit card, automobile and other consumer loans. Rates set directly or indirectly in the bond market, like those for mortgage loans, also edged up.
The Fed seemed to leave open the possibility that it could raise rates further next year if the economy keeps roaring along and unemployment keeps falling. But for investors, the good news was a hint from the Fed that it did not plan to raise rates again at least for the rest of this year. The central bank said the cumulative effect of its three rate increases this year "should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward."
The American economy has been growing steadily for more than eight and a half years, driving unemployment down to 4.1 percent last month -- the lowest level in nearly three decades -- while allowing workers to enjoy higher wage gains than they have in years. Yet there has been no solid evidence that inflation is building, casting doubt on traditional economic models that predict a trade-off between falling joblessness and rising wages and prices.
Many economists have sought to explain the situation by asserting that huge investments by businesses in computers and other efficiency-enhancing technology are yielding substantial improvements in productivity, or hourly output by each worker. As productivity growth accelerates, it helps companies keep their costs under control even if wages rise, making it possible for them to maintain profit margins without increasing prices.
Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have increasingly come to accept that recent gains in productivity are more than a temporary blip, and they have become optimistic in their public statements about the economy's resilience and long-term growth prospects.
But in raising rates today -- at a time when the economy is already showing signs of slowing and price increases are well contained -- Mr. Greenspan showed that he was not ready to abandon the notion that low unemployment plus robust growth is a recipe for inflation.
"Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist," the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement released soon after 2:15 p.m.
"Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential," the statement said. "As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue."
Economists had been sharply divided before today's meeting about whether a rate increase would be justified, and the Fed's decision led some of them to assert that the central bank was failing to take account of the economy's improved capacity to grow without inflation. They said the Fed should have taken more time to let the previous two rate increases of this year slow the economy and ease pressure on labor markets.
"If this was a football game, I think I'd throw a yellow flag for piling on," said Martin Regalia, an economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
Mr. Regalia said that while the Fed officials' "rhetoric seems to have shifted to an acceptance of productivity gains, their actions are clearly more consistent with the traditional labor-market-tightness arguments."
Other analysts said that the economy was continuing to grow faster than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate that is widely viewed as a "speed limit" beyond which inflation can start to take off.
"The Fed believes, as I do, that the economy's speed limit is higher than we thought it was a few years back, but that doesn't mean in any sense that the economy does not still have a speed limit," said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
With growth exceeding that limit and showing no clear signs of moderating, Mr. Berner said, "the balance of inflation risks still lies to the side of higher rather than lower inflation."
Even before today's statement suggesting that the Fed will be on hold for the rest of the year, analysts had expected the central bank to leave rates untouched for several months because of the uncertainty about how Year 2000 computer problems will affect the economy and the financial system.
If nothing else, economists expect that it could be difficult for the Fed to draw conclusions about the economy's path during the next few months because statistics may be distorted by businesses' building extra inventory and consumers' holding more cash than they otherwise would. As a result, some analysts say the Fed may shy away from raising rates at its February meeting even if growth seems to remain strong.
The question over the longer run is whether the economy will again defy predictions that it is about to slow, leading the Fed to consider further rate increases next year.
The economy has been growing steadily since March 1991. In January, barring a collapse in the next six weeks, it will set a new milestone, breaking the record for the longest expansion in the nation's history, 8 years and 10 months, which was set during the 1960's.
During the last several years growth has proved remarkably impervious both to shocks from the rest of the world and to higher interest rates at home, and seems to have drawn sustenance in particular from the boom in the stock market.
Fed officials insist that they have not set out to push Wall Street lower, but they say they remain concerned that the market's buoyancy, even in the face of tighter monetary policy, is helping to keep consumer demand at a higher level than they are comfortable with.

HEADLINE: Congress and Treasury Agree on Minor Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The caboose on the legislative train this year is likely to be a conglomeration of minor tax breaks that, among many other items, would turn chicken droppings into a tax shelter, give Puerto Rico a rebate for the tax paid on its rum and extend a pilot program of school construction bonds.
The legislation's prospects are complicated by a regional dispute over milk prices between lawmakers from the Northeast and those from the Midwest. 
 Negotiations between Congressional tax writers and the Treasury Department were completed tonight. The chicken waste, rum and school construction measures will be added to a must-pass bill to extend popular tax breaks that have expired.
The bill could be part of the final omnibus budget package or it could be considered as separate legislation after the budget bill is completed.
The tax breaks that expired in September with the end of the fiscal year and that would be extended include these:
*A tax credit to help offset business expenses for research and experimentation.
*Authority for affluent parents who must pay the alternative minimum tax to retain the $500 per child tax cut available to other parents.
*A temporary tax cut for businesses that hire workers off welfare rolls.
*Authority for some American companies with foreign investments to delay paying taxes on the proceeds until the money is returned to the United States.
Rather than make these popular tax breaks permanent law like most other parts of the income tax code, lawmakers arrange for them to expire periodically. That forces the beneficiaries, many of whom have deep pockets and make political donations, to beseech Congress regularly to extend them. And it allows the senators and representatives to claim a measure of credit when they are reapproved.
The new tax credit for companies that convert the waste from chicken coops into electricity also has a political dimension. It was added to the bill at the insistence of Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee and who is involved in a tough race for re-election.
The tax break has long been a dream on the Delmarva Peninsula -- Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia -- where chicken farming is the largest agricultural enterprise and where producers like Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods have big plants and hire thousands of workers.
Chicken droppings are now used for fertilizer, but all three states have new laws that will eventually ban this because of the water pollution it causes.
So farmers and business have been searching for new ways to use the 800 tons of this waste produced on the peninsula every year. Burning it for electricity is a possibility, but it is probably not practical economically without a tax advantage.
The rum provision has been pushed by the New York Congressional delegation, particularly Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, who have many constituents from Puerto Rico. The measure would return to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to spend as they want, the $13.50 in excise taxes collected on each gallon of rum imported into the United States. Only $10.50 per gallon is now returned. If all of it is returned, then it amounts to $44 million to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands over five years.
The school construction bonds were first approved as a pilot program for two years in 1997. This was a part of President Clinton's education agenda, and he has persuaded Congress to extend the program for another two years.
The dairy dispute is not likely to derail the tax measure, but it could make the passage more difficult.
Lawmakers from the Northeast want to prevent the Agriculture Department from putting a new milk-price system into effect. They also want to renew a price-fixing mechanism called the Northeast Dairy Compact, which puts a floor on the price of fresh milk in the six New England states and which expired with the end of the last fiscal year. They have persuaded Congressional leaders to insert provisions to accomplish their goals into the final omnibus budget package or into the tax bill if it is considered separately.
But Midwestern lawmakers say their dairy farmers would be damaged by this measure. Led by Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, several Midwestern senators have vowed to filibuster any bill that includes the dairy legislation.
The Midwesterners apparently do not have the votes to sustain a filibuster indefinitely. But they could tie up the Senate for days, and they hope to win concessions from lawmakers who are eager to adjourn.

Fed Raises Interest Rates On Concern About Inflation
The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, saying that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy vulnerable to inflation.
It was the third time this year that the central bank has raised rates to slow the economy, and the move clearly signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to improve efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has its limits. Page A1. 

Stocks jumped as investors bet that the Fed is done with raising interest rates in the near future. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.58 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,932.33. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 73.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,293.05, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 25.64 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,420.03, a record. C17.
 
Comcast to Buy Lenfest From AT&T
Comcast agreed to buy the cable television company Lenfest Communications from AT&T and the Lenfest family for $5.21 billion in stock, adding 1.25 million subscribers in the Philadelphia area. AT&T agreed in May to sell cable systems and provided an option on others to Comcast in exchange for withdrawing from the bidding for MediaOne. Class A shares of Comcast rose $2.6875, to $44. C9.
 
Pfizer Steps Up Hostile Campaign
Pfizer stepped up its effort to acquire Warner-Lambert, beginning its attempt to oust Warner's board and outlining the advantages of the hostile takeover to Wall Street analysts. C16.
 
Kendall-Jackson Names Platt Chief
For months the speculation was that Lewis E. Platt, who retires as chairman of Hewlett-Packard at the end of the year, would join a venture capital firm, a medical instrument company, or an Internet start-up. Wrong. Mr. Platt will join Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates as chief executive on Jan. 1. C2.
 
Genentech Seen in Patent Accord
Genentech, the pioneering biotechnology company, has agreed to pay $200 million to settle its long-running patent battle with the University of California over genetically engineered human growth hormones. The university's board of regents is scheduled to consider the agreement this week. C11.
 
Shipley to Leave Chase on Jan. 1
The chairman of Chase Manhattan, Walter V. Shipley, left, will retire on Jan. 1. He will be succeeded by William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of Chase, the nation's third largest bank. Mr. Shipley is leaving 11 months before he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr. Shipley, who has worked in the banking industry for 43 years, became chairman in March 1996 after the merger between Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank. Under Mr. Shipley, Chase's stock has risen 135 percent. C16.
 
Industrial Production Rises 0.7%
Industrial production climbed a bigger-than-expected seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, its fastest rate in seven months, as utilities and factories rebounded from a dip in September, the Federal Reserve said. C17.
 
Retailers' Profits Beat Forecasts
Home Depot, Dayton Hudson and Limited reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits as a strong economy fueled sales of everything from tools to housewares to clothing. J. C. Penney said its profit fell 24 percent as it lost shoppers to low-price stores, but its results still beat revised forecasts by a penny. C12.

Next, It's E-ducation

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The two most telling stories about the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall actually ran in the business sections of The New York Times and The Washington Post.
One was a short article in the back pages of The Times that reported that the number of adults using the Internet in the U.S. had surpassed 100 million, meaning that roughly half the U.S. population is now online. 
 The other article, in The Post, noted that Amazon.com was shipping an extraordinary number of copies of Adolf Hitler's racist manifesto, "Mein Kampf," to buyers in Germany. It is illegal to sell "Mein Kampf" in bookstores in Germany or publish it there. But as we move from the world of Borders books to the world of borderless books, a k a Amazon.com, Germans can order "Mein Kampf" online and have it delivered by mail, and their government is powerless to stop it. Indeed, Amazon shipped so many copies of "Mein Kampf" to Germany that over the summer Hitler made Amazon's top 10 best-seller list among German buyers.
What these two little stories tell is that 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall a whole other set of walls is starting to fall, as we move deeper into the Internet revolution. And this is not simply an American phenomenon, nor, as the "Mein Kampf" example illustrates, will it automatically bring out the best in people.
So what comes next? With the first phase of this wall-destroying Internet revolution -- the e-mail and e-commerce phase -- now fully under way, I posed that question to John Chambers. Mr. Chambers runs Cisco Systems, which makes the routers that run the Internet. Beware: He has an obvious stake in touting the Internet. But note: His past predictions have proved extremely accurate.
Mr. Chambers argued that the second phase of the Internet revolution -- businesses absorbing the Internet and using it to relate to one another -- was now just taking off, and that this was going to be a monster market. There is barely a C.E.O. in the developed world who in the last six months hasn't said to himself: "Oh my God! This Internet thing is real. Somebody call me an Internet doctor and wire me up."
Once a C.E.O. understands that absorbing the Net into every aspect of his or her business "is the only way they are going to survive," said Mr. Chambers, "they are going to be spending big bucks on it. That's why I believe that Y2K will be short-lived, and after that we are going to see one of the best years the computer industry has ever seen."
So now that commerce has moved to the Net, and the Net is moving into business, what comes after that?
"Education," said Mr. Chambers. "The next big killer application for the Internet is going to be education. Education over the Internet is going to be so big it is going to make e-mail usage look like a rounding error" in terms of the Internet capacity it will consume.
What will drive it will be the demands on companies, in an intensely competitive global economy, to keep improving productivity. E-learning, insists Mr. Chambers, if done right, can provide faster learning, at lower costs, with more accountability, thereby enabling both companies and schools to keep up with changes in the global economy that now occur at Net speed. Schools and countries that ignore this, he says, will suffer the same fate as big department stores that thought e-commerce was overrated.
If universities move properly, they will offer the ideal combination of online and instructor-led learning, argues Mr. Chambers. But if universities don't reinvent their curriculums and how they deliver them, for an increasingly Net-driven economy, many students, particularly in information technology fields, "will go to schools online," he says. Many big firms -- Cisco, G.E., I.B.M., AT&T -- are starting online academies to train new employees and to constantly upgrade the skills of existing ones.
"Unlike in the industrial revolution when you had to be in the right country or city to participate, in this new era capital will flow to whichever countries and companies install the best Internet and educational capabilities," says Mr. Chambers. Governments and unions will be powerless to stop this capital flow, which will affect the global balance of economic power. Although the technology exists today, this revolution will take about 10 years to be fully in place. But, insists Mr. Chambers, "it's coming next."

Living la Vida Trumpa

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: ABOARD TRUMP ONE

 BODY:
Melania Knauss pulls up her black Calvin Klein sheath to show off her supermodel knees.
"I never wear skirts this long," says the girlfriend of Donald Trump with a pretty grimace, standing in the aisle of his plane, stocked with gilt fixtures, French impressionist paintings, a double bed and the creme-filled finger cookies the real estate king decrees "the greatest." 
 But politics requires sacrifices. And Monday's trip to Miami was a dress rehearsal for Mr. Trump's potential White House bid. So the amiable Miss Knauss was doing her bit, wearing conservative gray and black Calvins chosen by a publicist for the Trump modeling agency. But the Slovenian's stilettos by Manolo Blahnik gave her away as someone blissfully unfamiliar with rope lines.
Mr. Trump was making his maiden foreign policy speech to Cuban-Americans who adore his Castro-bashing. "I'd have, personally, two words for him: 'Adios, amigo!' " he told a large, cheering crowd, adding that he wanted the first hotel in free Cuba.
The flirtation of the Trumpster, as he calls himself, is the apotheosis of our Gilded Age. Our politics is warped by money, celebrity, polling and crass behavior, and our culture is defined by stock-market high-rolling, boomer narcissism, niche marketing mania, rankings and a quiz show called "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
"I love Regis," Mr. Trump says.
Why shouldn't billionaires play "Who Wants to Be a President?"
"I've already got my own airplane," he says. "We could save money on Air Force One."
You gotta love a guy whose economic platform runs all of a page and a half and is a $5.7 trillion squeeze-the-rich tax plan that would make the Donald at least $750 million poorer. And there are more provocative plans to come.
Oddly, given so many years of Trump plastering "Trump" on every available surface, the builder and casino owner actually looked a bit shy when he saw the "Trump 2000" posters, with his own pouty kisser staring back, and Cuban-American fans at the Bay of Pigs Museum yelling "Viva Donald Trump!"
He gave a tentative wave to his first rope line, but soon recovered enough to note that Steve Forbes never had so many cameras at the airport or a supermodel by his podium.
Mr. Trump does not live an examined life. He lives a quantified life. He keeps track of all numbers, the sentinels of success -- the number of magazine covers his girlfriend is on this month and the number of men who are dripping with lust for her; the number of zoning changes he has finagled; the number of stories he was able to stack on his building near the U.N.; the huge amount of money he was paid to do a clever ad for an online company, in which he looks down a girl's shirt, and the short amount of time it took him to do it; the number of favorable mentions in a Palm Beach publication about a club he has started at Mar-a-Lago; the number of working-class guys who call out to him.
"I am just very popular with the black populace," he says. "When Puff Daddy has a party, when Russell Simmons has a party, I'm the person they call."
He uses a kind of ego arithmetic. About the candidates, he demands: "Did they make billions of dollars in a short period of time? No. Could they . . .? No." And: "Hey, look, what's so good about these people? I do 'Face the Nation,' 'Meet the Press,' 'Larry King.' I think I do better than they do. They're boring as hell. They get no ratings and everybody turns off the set."
He refers to W. as the anointed "son of the president who should have finished the war" and says he looks "vacuous." He thinks Bill Bradley is "not exactly Cary Grant." Al Gore has made "dreadful mistakes," including Alpha Girl.
At the end of his first day as an exploratory guy, Mr. Trump was very tired. Almost too tired to brag. But he rallied enough at midnight, in a limo from the airport back to Trump Tower, to check out a big poster with his name on it and to muse about how much of Third Avenue he had built.
"I think the only difference between me and the other candidates," he summed up, "is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful."

HEADLINE: Mixing Wariness and Joy, Interns Become Residents

SERIES: LIFE, DEATH AND MANAGED CARE: One Year Later, Taking Stock -- Last of four articles

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Carol Lampkin was a chatty woman with a sweeping smile who needed a lot of medical attention. And she did not want it from anyone but Dr. Jennifer James.
Ms. Lampkin's principal complaint was reflex sympathetic dystrophy -- pain without underlying cause, the sort of phantom limb pain amputees sometimes suffer. She had broken her neck in a motorcycle accident when she was 23, but it did not affect her until she was 47, and since then she had had several surgeries. Now, at 53, she felt numbness along her right cheek down to her first two toes. "I feel a burning sensation and a tingling," she said. "I feel like I've been electrocuted." 
 She used a walker or a cane. Among other ailments, she suffered from hypertension. She had had a civilian desk job with the New York City Police Department, but work was now out of the question.
Dr. James saw her in the outpatient clinic during her first month of internship, and she had been back repeatedly. She always kept her appointments and Dr. James appreciated that. Inside her clinic exam room at St. Luke's Hospital, Ms. Lampkin glowed. For a while, she appeared two or three times a month; now she came every three to four weeks. Sometimes, her pain got so bad that she had to be admitted to the hospital. She would call to inform Dr. James, and Dr. James would make a point of dropping in to see her.
"What attracted me to her was she was nice and courteous," Ms. Lampkin said. "She takes the time to listen. It's not easy to get that, because when you're in the clinic they take your blood pressure, talk to you for a minute and you're gone. She wanted to know about me. And if she doesn't know something, she doesn't make it up. She goes and reads up on it."
In her fidelity, Ms. Lampkin represented what the teachers meant when they talked about "continuity of care" -- doctor and patient bonding like atoms in a molecule. Caring for Ms. Lampkin was what Dr. James had in mind way back in July, when she had said, "What a doctor is is being compassionate and just being there for people." Most of the time, especially with all the pressures brought on by managed care, the hospital moved too erratically, too fast. Here in the spring of her internship, though, it was that kind of bond that made Dr. James feel happiest about medicine.
She thought fondly of another clinic patient: The first time she saw him, she threw him out. He told her he had once worked for the C.I.A. and now sold books on the street and fought unknown demons. He drank 24 to 36 beers a day and smoked heavily. He was drunk. He got abusive. But he returned another week, behaved properly, and Dr. James accepted him as a challenge. He had suffered a stroke but refused necessary surgery. She coaxed him into it. Afterward, he told her, "You saved my life."
"I've almost gotten him to stop smoking," she said, "and we talk about stopping drinking. I think I'm getting closer. With him, I feel I really did something. I was a doctor."
She brought in her next patient. He was new, a little turned-inward, a little bellicose. He believed he had sprained his ankle on a crack in the sidewalk. He said the emergency room had told him he needed new shoes, not medical care. He walked a lot. He was homeless. He wanted an X-ray. She said that was unnecessary. His ankles were swollen. She told him that meant something might be going on with his heart; she wanted other tests done.
He said no and no and no. He was loud and brassy. "You must think I'm stupid," he said. "You don't want to spend the money on an X-ray. If you don't want to treat me right, I'll go somewhere else." She persevered. He said no. Exasperated, she brought in her supervisor. She watched as he knelt down and listened patiently to the man, gave credence to his opinion but nudged him toward Dr. James's. The man capitulated. She wondered if it was because the attending was older and happened to be a man.
She did not let that bother her. Her next two patients failed to show up. She had time. The man's shoes were too small and tattered. She asked him if he wanted to go to the volunteer department, where donated clothing awaited. She and her husband both gave clothing there. She thought his feet looked the same size as her husband's.
Together, they sifted through bins of used shoes. She dug out a pair of 11 1/2 sneakers. He slipped them on. "These feel real good," he said. A smile blossomed. "Thank you, doctor," he told her. Out in the real world, when would she ever have time to find a man a pair of shoes? She did not think of it that way, just that a connection had been made. "That was cool," she said. "It felt really cool to do that."
 
A Step Off the Treadmill
Time sped by in the final months, more of a blur. The fatigue, though, persisted. Even during vacation, Dr. Bryan Holland slept poorly. His body was used to no sleep. He had deliberately stopped watching "E.R.," the staple of doctors in training. It felt like a continuation of work. His parents had given him a keyboard for Christmas, and he unwound by playing it, mostly Mozart and some Beethoven. He had been reading Robert Frost.
He worked relentlessly. He found that he was really obsessive, always wanting everything done just so, and he knew he was probably going to drive the interns he supervised next year crazy. He had no patience for interns who complained endlessly about how taxing the work was. "I think they should suck it up and go on," he said at dinner one night. "They should feel blessed that they're in the position."
One day he had a treat -- a glimpse of life beyond residency. He spent the afternoon at the private office of Dr. Steven Wolf, director of the pediatric neurology clinic.
He saw a succession of cases of attention deficit disorder.
A young boy with a wild tassel of hair came in, compulsively talkative. He could not sit still for a moment. Dr. Holland asked him what he watched on TV.
"I watch every cartoon that has green, brown or red or gray or blue. The cartoons in black and white, I don't think they're so funny. Did you know the 'I Love Lucy Show' used to be called the 'I Can't Stand Ethel Show?' "
His mother said he had a lot of anger inside him. He fought constantly with his brother. The boy then interrupted to say that his teacher liked to punch kids and kick them and pull their hair. "He even likes electrocuting the kids," he said.
Dr. Wolf came in. He asked Dr. Holland to describe the movements he saw.
"They don't seem like tics," Dr. Holland said. "They seem voluntary."
Dr. Wolf said, "Right. Just a fidgety kid with ants in his pants."
Then he said, "So Dr. Holland, would you classify him as attention deficit disorder? Dangerous word."
Dr. Holland: "He's borderline, but I wouldn't classify him as that as yet."
Dr. Wolf: "So he has symptoms of it."
Then Dr. Wolf told the mother: "What I'd like to do is gather more information. I'm going to give you a teacher evaluation form for the school so we can get more information."
The boy said, "To gather more information about my family, please contact Dumb brother.com."
Dr. Wolf said, "This is a clever kid."
Dr. Holland liked being in a real office. It was far less chaotic than the clinic, with more involved parents with better insurance than the Medicaid patients he usually saw. To a young doctor learning the subtle arts of diagnosis, it was a welcome step off the clinic treadmill.
He admired Dr. Wolf's style. But he also saw the unmistakable pressures. With night pressing in, Dr. Wolf's staff had gone home. He continued seeing patients, never failing to ask for every $10 and $15 co-payment. Insurance cutbacks were killing him, he said. His revenues dropped year by year. Having interns do some office shifts was one way to prop up the economics. He did other things now, like expert testimony in court cases and patient studies for drug companies.
Increasingly, Dr. Holland came to understand that he was treating not just a child, but also the often incoherent effects of an environment full of perils and mysteries. "I've learned that you really have two patients -- the child and the mother," he said. "I notice now when mothers are calm when they bring in a sick child. Why isn't that mother agitated? What comes to mind is, the mother is not attentive."
He very much appreciated that it was strange times. Working the ward on his final rotation, he was stupefied by a 14-year-old girl who said that she had already had 68 sexual partners. When a week later, a 17-year-old said that she had had 13 partners, no one blinked.
And then Dr. Holland was taking a history from a mother of a 4-year-old boy. He got to the section about relatives. The mother said the boy's sister had been shot to death two days ago. Dr. Holland went numb. He looked at his sheet. The next part dealt with form of payment. He could not bring himself to ask. He left it blank. The hospital would have to figure that out.
 
A Style of One's Own
You knew the E.R. was clotted with patients from the bleating chorus of voices:
"I think my head's going to explode."
"I'm going to discharge Mr. Crazy now."
"Is there really someone in 1B with a heart rate of 24?"
Dr. Edward Lathan worked with focus. Steadily, he felt he was cultivating that sixth sense that told a doctor who was really sick and who was not. Now, he addressed an elderly man.
"Why are you in the hospital?"
"Because my people called the ambulance."
"Why did they call the ambulance?"
"Because I laid down on the floor."
"Why did you lay down on the floor?"
"I don't know."
He was refining a style. He had watched one high-strung senior doctor who, not getting the answers he wanted from a patient, would squeeze his gloved hands together until you could hear the squishing noise. Dr. Lathan vowed never to do that. "I'll touch a patient on the arm, or, if it's appropriate, brush some hair out of their face, to show I'm caring," he said. "It's my own little technique."
It seemed beyond imagination how many patients he had treated. Some still haunted him, like the 21-year-old lifeguard who, while practicing holding his breath under water, passed out, threw up and gagged. He came in without a heartbeat and could not be revived. "He was so young," Dr. Lathan said. "He was about to touch his dreams. I had been a lifeguard."
From the start, he had felt a special kinship with the destitute who gravitated to the E.R., and he still tried to look out for them. But he was less tolerant of those who took advantage of him, for there had been so many. He had a woman with leg ulcers, and when he tried to wrap her legs, she declared every action wrong. In exasperation, he left the supplies with her and told her to wrap her own legs. When she was done, she hung around for a free breakfast.
He had learned that it was all right to hate patients who were difficult or obnoxious, as long as you still took care of them. Granted, you got irritated when someone got a fever at 5 A.M. or pulled out an I.V. during your only nap, but you still went ahead and did what needed doing.
"When someone is sick, I don't have the right to be nasty to him," explained Dr. Michael Lesch, the head of the medicine department.
Dr. Lesch liked to tell a story from his own internship: A fireman brought in five children with severe burns. Their father had got angry at the mother and set the house on fire. The father sat in the next room with burns on his skin. Dr. Lesch had to go in and treat him. "We see some bad people," he told the interns. "We see people at their worst."
Dr. Lathan treated a man with multiple stab wounds. His girlfriend had sliced him up. She had some minor bruises herself. She was a vile person, cursing and spitting at everyone. "She was someone you wanted to hate," Dr. Lathan said. Nevertheless, he was prepared to treat her, but someone else had taken her.
 
'I Have Become More Detached'
What? Statues had metamorphosed into actual people and were marching across the adjacent roof? Alert the newspapers right away?
So the patient insisted. She was in her 70's, chirpy, with steel-gray hair, awaiting heart surgery. She was taking steroids for swelling in her legs. They sometimes triggered hallucinations. Dr. James was peremptory, assuring her the statues were inanimate. (It could be worse. On another floor, a man complained that a helicopter hovered in his room.)
As she neared the July 1 state of bliss known as the end of internship, Dr. James found that the surprises still came, but the bigger surprise was her palpable ease in dealing with them. As the golden light of morning poured through the hospital windows, Dr. James traversed her world with brisk assurance. Many things that were once challenges had become perfunctory. There was a momentum of familiarity in the days.
When she began her internship, Dr. James had been tentative and submissive, beset by qualms about what the year would bring. Now, she felt she could manage even the most sadistic senior doctors. "I decide they have some psychological problem themselves," she said. If someone picked on her, she could push right back. One day she was reading a chart when a nurse's note stopped her cold: "Unable to draw my labs. Paged Dr. James at 7 A.M. and got no response." Dr. James returned fire. She wrote on the chart: "In response to above comment, I was in the hospital promptly at 7 A.M. and received no pages."
She did still encounter jitters when a complex patient arrived and she was alone. Recently, when she admitted someone with multiple problems, she ordered every test she could think of -- "the works," she called it -- so she wouldn't miss anything.
But she was far less convinced that she would miss things. She saw an AIDS patient and took care of some treatment orders. "See, I'm getting more resident efficient," she said. "I saw the patient and I'm putting in the orders and I haven't called the resident."
She took much less time with new admissions. ("The first week, it would take me at least two hours. Now if I'm in a real hurry to catch the bus and it's uncomplicated, I could do it in a half-hour.") Her diagnostic abilities had sharpened. She was more confident doing procedures. She could take notes and write a prescription and listen to a patient talk about what a jerk her son-in-law was all at the same time. She could go on and on.
One of her last rotations was the harrowing "night float" -- instituted a few years ago in an effort to keep interns' hours under new limits -- when Dr. James covered for all the other interns on the wards from 10:30 P.M. to 8 A.M. One night, she had 161 patients, most of them, fortunately, asleep. She had to do a bunch of I.V.'s and blood draws. She had to sign an incident report for someone who had "eloped" -- simply walked off the ward. But she was unfazed.
With patients exiting the wards so much faster, she recognized that it was harder to get a sense of the progress of disease through the human body. She tried to compensate by mustering a composite patient from different patients at different stages of sickness. How well that worked, it was hard to tell.
Necessarily, she had hardened. "There's illness and disease in the world, and some people get them and my job is to help those people and make it the best I can for them," she said. "But I don't have this reaction of sadness for them and why they have it. I have become more detached. When I watch TV with my husband and there's someone on who is paralyzed, he says, 'That is really sad.' I don't feel that way. I think it's something that happens."
She was increasingly comfortable with herself. One day, late in her shift with nothing going on, she ventured across the street and had her nails done. "I had my beeper," she said. "If anything came up, I'd be right there."
 
'Managed Care Is an Enemy'
The final weeks, there were parties and luncheons. Groups gathered for after-hours drinks. "Liver rounds," the interns called them.
As a matter of course, there were year-end evaluations. Drs. James, Lathan and Holland all received quite positive feedback. A colleague went in for his, on the heels of several brutal days of work, and the summation was he was "average." He was crestfallen and angry. He was weary to the bone and he was just average! He told some of the others he might quit.
Around the hospital, those completing their residencies pondered the outside world, weighing dollars against geography. Over a sandwich in the staff room, a senior resident told Dr. James: "Doctors can make $50,000 to $60,000 more a year outside of New York, because there aren't enough doctors there. But doctors want to work in the city." He, too, wished to risk becoming part of the local doctor glut.
"The young doctors I know in the city are starving," he said. When he admitted a patient without a regular doctor, he always referred him to one of the young physicians. "You call them at 3 A.M., and they're actually happy to hear from you," he said. "They don't snarl."
Even the interns ruminated more and more about what they would do once their residencies ended. They felt early planning was requisite in these baffling times.
If insurers expected a teaching hospital like St. Luke's-Roosevelt to groom a generation of doctors willing to obey the managed-care mantra, that did not seem to be happening. In the course of their year, all three of the interns, while appreciating some of the waste excised from medicine, had become of a piece in their increasing resistance to cost pressures and managed care.
Dr. Holland had begun without strong feelings about managed care. Now, he was sure he never wanted to work for an H.M.O.: "I don't want to be part of a medical bureaucracy that seems to be ruining the health care system of the country."
One particular episode framed his dismay. Needing to admit a 14-year-old boy with pneumonia, Dr. Holland had called the patient's primary-care doctor. He said he didn't have privileges at St. Luke's, and told him to call the managed-care plan.
When Dr. Holland reached a doctor who did have privileges, the man said he only handled patients up to age 13 and shuttled him to still another doctor, who informed him he only covered the East Side of Manhattan.
"I'm practically screaming at the guy," Dr. Holland said. "On the fourth or fifth doctor, I got someone who was able to approve it, and he made an exception because he was actually an adult doctor."
Desiring a varied experience, Dr. Holland was mulling a mix of a standard urban pediatric practice and shifts in an emergency room. Two weeks a year would be reserved for something special: working at a small hospital in rural Brazil set up by the grandfather of a good friend from medical school.
After his residency, Dr. Lathan contemplated a one-year fellowship in disaster medicine and then a life traveling to earthquakes and war zones. This had always been part of his dream, but it had become even more enticing as a path to freedom from the vise of managed care.
He thought of the managed-care doctors he had to argue with: "One guy said, 'Why are you doing this to me? Are you going to admit every patient you see tonight?' It wasn't about the patient. It was about him. Managed care is an enemy. It's not a team player. It's going to crash. It has to."
Dr. James had started out intending to become an H.M.O. doctor on a 9-to-5 schedule. Not anymore. "I don't think they're run well," she said of H.M.O.'s. "And I want control. I never would have thought about a private practice before."
Now, her desire was to have her own women's health practice. She only wanted to see patients in the office; when they went to the hospital, let doctors there care for them. "I want to narrow myself down to what I can be really good at," she said. "I like to do procedures, and I want to do a lot of procedures. But I don't want to lose time running to the hospital."
It was her way of adapting to the new climate. "My whole life has been about dreaming up something and then going after it," she said.
Still, she and the others knew that their success as doctors would also depend on how well they juggled money and resources, on marketing savvy and an ability to compromise. They had landed in a world that demanded doctors reassemble themselves to see 40 or 50 patients a day, a world of supersonic speed and diminishing remuneration and respect. They were not blind to this, but if there was one thing they felt they had got little of this first year, it was any explicit coaching in how to master the abstruse economics of doctoring. There seemed to be no time to teach them how best to use their time.
How much had they come to understand all the new cost pressures?
"Maybe a little bit more," Dr. James said.
What was clear was that the interns were drawing definite lines between their lives and what they gave to patients.
"I'm starting to value my life outside of medicine more than I ever thought I would," Dr. James said. She felt happiest on days when she had outside activities. "I want to be a doctor," she said, "but I want to take my Rollerblade lessons. I want to have a relationship with my husband. I want to have kids."
As Dr. Lathan put it: "So much control has been taken away from us in practicing medicine. My own life seems like the only thing that's truly mine."
 
A New Year, a New Role
Here is how internship ends. With the dawning of July 1, a date of ultimate significance only inside a teaching hospital, the three interns, as if chameleons, automatically changed identities: They officially became PGY-II's (postgraduate year 2), entrusted with supervising the latest batch of interns, lording over the people they were only yesterday.
The prospect made them edgy, but they were truly tired of life at the bottom of the food chain. As PGY-II's, they would no longer write progress notes or do endless I.V.'s and blood draws. "They say the second year you have more time to think," Dr. Holland said. "One senior resident put it like this: 'The first year you do, the second year you learn, the third year you teach.' " Their pay crept up to $41,840 from $39,270, and there were small niceties. In the on-call room where the pediatric residents rested was a bunk bed. The bottom bunk was strictly for residents. The phone was not reachable from the top. Two interns had actually tumbled off the bunk in pursuit of a trilling phone. Dr. Holland could not wait to sleep on the bottom.
July 1 was thinly overcast, but the mood of the new PGY-II's was joyous. "Hey, Mr. Resident," they greeted one another. One ex-intern said he was going for coffee. Dr. James quipped, "Ah, the luxury of the resident life."
On this important day, Dr. Holland found himself at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, doing a bone marrow transplant rotation. Dr. Lathan had the day off, while Dr. James was in the St. Luke's cardiac care unit.
Morning rounds went at a speed uncompromised for the new arrivals. The supervisor offered the platitude: "It's like skating on thin ice. Speed is stability."
As she cast an eye on the quizzical faces and listened to the creaking voices of the new interns, Dr. James assured them the anxiety would dissipate in the frenetic workload and the sweet satisfaction of making people better. She doled out some logistical pointers -- where the cafeteria was and the on-call room. She told them to be sure to eat breakfast before they came on duty; on her first day, several interns had fainted. (Her own predilection for fainting notwithstanding, she had not been among them.)
She mentioned certain anomalies, like having to write a discharge summary even when a patient dies. Late in the year, she had been told that she had four delinquent charts. They were all dead patients who, she assumed, had been adequately processed by a higher authority.
There was plenty to do, malfunctioning hearts to be looked after. Lunch carts rattled past. Dr. James moved merrily about the murmuring floor, her dutiful intern clicking at her heels, and she knew she was one step closer in this complicated process of maturation and self-revelation, one step closer to a broader understanding of what sort of doctor she would become in a system under siege.
She took a drink of water, swished it between her teeth. What next? Her beeper went off. She reached for the phone. Her intern watched. A new cycle was starting.
 
Life, Death and Managed Care
 
At the midpoint of the year, exhausted but still standing, the interns found themselves whipsawed by mixed messages. They kept hearing about the need to conserve money and resources. And yet, in intensive care, Dr. Jennifer James saw so much of both expended on hopeless patient after hopeless patient. After a state investigation, Dr. Edward Lathan and the other E.R. doctors were told there was to be no thought or talk of money before a patient was examined. And Dr. Bryan Holland saw the senior doctors struggling to balance the duties of teaching and watching the bottom line. Today: As the interns are transformed into residents, they discover some bottom lines of their own.

HEADLINE: Gore Announces an Environmental Initiative

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Seeking to win the active support of environmental groups that have so far failed to muster much enthusiasm for his presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced today that President Clinton would sign an executive order to require environmental reviews in all new trade agreements.
"America can and should use its trade policy to strengthen environmental protection both at home and abroad," Mr. Gore said in front of cameras on the airport tarmac here before returning to Washington. "This is really a significant, watershed event for the relationship between trade and the environment." 
 The order will require the United States trade representative to conduct full environmental reviews as part of all major trade agreements. The reviews are to be made early in negotiations, Mr. Gore said, "so that we can use that information to shape emerging trade agreements and to better protect our own environment and the global environment."
In fact, the executive order is not binding on America's trading partners, but it encourages other nations to take the environment into account as they develop their economies. Mr. Gore said he wanted to end subsidies that promote over-fishing and eliminate trade barriers that prevent the United States from exporting cutting-edge technologies that could help other countries clean up their air and water.
The order begins to put environmental concerns on a par with business concerns in international agreements, a step that environmental groups hailed today as significant, if only a start in the enduring struggle between businesses and environmentalists.
It comes at a crucial time, as the world's trade ministers prepare to meet in Seattle at the end of the month to discuss international trade rules, and it sends a signal that the United States considers environmental standards important.
It also comes at a crucial time for Mr. Gore in his bid for the Democratic nomination. He has failed to stir the passions of the environmental community on his behalf. The administration's decision to let Mr. Gore make today's announcement was a reflection both of his need to make some headway with this important constituency and also of his push to make the administration more sensitive to environmental concerns.
Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, welcomed the action as a good first step in bringing the environmental impact of trade agreements before the public.
Mr. Gore's announcement today followed an hourlong private session with about a dozen environmental leaders here on Monday night. They have expressed concerns about the administration's commitment to an array of environmental issues, like protection of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and the permanent placement of a tugboat in waters here to try to steer oil barges clear of hazards that could result in spills.
Participants in the meeting described Mr. Gore's posture as unusually pleading. He told his listeners that he and Mr. Clinton could not have won in 1992 without their support and that while they may have been disappointed with some administration actions, he needed their active involvement now.
He also told them that environmental reviews would be a central topic at the World Trade Organization talks here later this month.
Daniel Seligman, director of the Sierra Club's trade program, said the spirit of Mr. Gore's remarks was encouraging.
"We're not trying to inject environmental standards into W.T.O.," Mr. Seligman said. "We want to prevent W.T.O. from weakening the standards we already have."

HEADLINE: A Higher Profile for the Dissidents in Cuba

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The business card of Elizardo Sanchez, a leading dissident here, has a curious caveat next to his phone number: "if it works."
It currently does, and then some. At his home, which is arrayed with pictures of him with the likes of Senator Ted Kennedy and Vaclav Havel, Mr. Sanchez has been contacted by at least nine of the delegations that came to Havana this week for a summit meeting of Latin American countries and Spain and Portugal. 
 He is not alone. At least 14 other human rights advocates and relatives of political prisoners have held meetings with visiting dignitaries, including Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain and Foreign Minister Rosario Green of Mexico.
Cuban participants said issues included multiparty democracy, open markets, freedom of expression and -- they pointedly added -- an end to the United States embargo against Cuba. They said the meetings were held at the request of the delegations, and passed without impediment.
"Never before have we seen so many dignitaries coming to our country to meet with dissidents and opponents of the government," Mr. Sanchez said. "This is a great acknowledgment of a sector of our country, whose government said for many years we did not exist."
The meetings come one week after Cuban officials criticized the dissidents for wanting to hold a parallel meeting, detained several dozen of them for hours and kept another 15 under arrest on suspicion of planning sabotage to disrupt the meeting.
The decision to allow Mr. Sanchez and others to meet with the foreigners appeared to be a calculated move by the government to avoid public conflicts that would mar their nation's moment as host to a meeting of officials from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal.
Cuban officials do not view the dissidents as a monolithic group, which may also explain whey they have not interfered with the meetings. They distinguish between those like Mr. Sanchez -- who is seen as a thoughtful if ideologically opposed figure -- and others who are viewed as puppets of the exile community, dedicated to destabilizing the regime. They insist the groups do not present a real challenge or an alternative to the government.
At the same time, President Fidel Castro said he would have preferred that the officials has spent more time talking to ordinary Cubans.
"This summit has been full of virtual realities, dissidents and personalities, he said at a news conference after the summit meeting ended tonight. "Nobody is talking about the real objective of the summit."
But in earlier closing remarks by several heads of state, several reiterated the need for greater openness.
"Sovereignty also needs democracy," said President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico. "There can be no sovereign nation without free men and women, men and women who can exercise their essential freedoms: freedom to think and give their opinions, freedom to dissent, freedom to chose."
Mr. Zedillo's remarks came just days after his foreign minister, Ms. Green, met with Mr. Sanchez. She had said her meeting did not constitute a change in Mexico's policy against intervening in the affairs of other nations. Mr. Sanchez said the Mexican government can nevertheless play a helpful role in Cuba, as it has in helping to resolve the regional conflicts in Central America.
While not explicitly condemning Cuba, several of the dignitaries expressed carefully worded support for the dissidents' concerns. Prime Minister Aznar said that he met with the dissidents because he was not a "part-time democrat" and that he always made as many contacts as possible wherever he traveled.
In his opening remarks this morning, Mr. Castro ignored the dissidents. The meeting itself was a forum to discuss agreed-upon issues relating to the effects of globalization, as well as a condemnation of the United States embargo. Mr. Castro declared that he remains committed to the path he chose decades ago.
He spoke of the first such meeting, in Mexico eight years ago, when Cuba was widely urged to shed its Communist system. "The advice rained down from everywhere," he said. "But we thought of another way and decided to struggle."
Cuban officials now say that after enduring several harsh years of a subsistence economy after the end of support from the Soviet Union, the economy is growing, and the meeting gave the government a chance to project a different image than the one offered by Washington.
For example, the visitors went to inaugural ceremonies at the new Latin American School of Medical Science, where 1,929 students from Central and South America are studying.
But the highlight has already come for Hector Palacios, who founded the Democratic Solidarity Party, an act that led to a prison term. Like Mr. Sanchez, he said his morale was improved by the visits with the foreign dignitaries. Yet he was also realistic.
"I think we won a lot in expectations and hope," he said, "hope that we will become stronger, hope that we will have other doors to knock on, hope that other eyes will look out for us. But I do not have hope that the government will change or make a gesture of flexibility soon."

HEADLINE: WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: WORLD TRADE;
EXPORT SUBSIDIES CRITICIZED

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Olson 

 BODY:
Changes in global trade of farm products are an "extremely high priority" of the United States government, said Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture. He said increasing market access and eliminating trade-distorting domestic supports and export subsidies -- which he called "a dagger in the heart of developing nations" -- were important American goals in the next round of negotiations by the World Trade Organization, set to begin in Seattle on Nov. 30. Mr. Glickman's speech at the organization's Geneva offices came as student protesters chained themselves to the building's main staircase while others unfurled banners on the building's roof that read, "The W.T.O. kills people."

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE PARADOXES;
Riding Winds of Reform, Yet Mired in Orthodoxy

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 16

 BODY:
On Monday, President Jiang Zemin warmly played host to American officials at the Chinese leadership compound to celebrate the major trade agreement committing China to far-reaching economic reforms and broad international ties.
Today, on the other side of Chang An Avenue, Mr. Jiang's security police forcibly detained more than a dozen members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement who had dared to unfurl a yellow banner and meditate in Tiananmen Square. 
 The two events, only 24 hours apart, illustrated the contradictory impulses driving China, a country that one moment seems to be hurtling toward a more open future and the next seems mired in Communist orthodoxy and intolerance.
Today, one day after the announcement of a trade deal that is likely to lead to membership in the World Trade Organization soon, China's state-controlled news media uniformly gushed over the deal's benefits for business as well as for foreign relations. The pact will "improve relations with other major powers, particularly the U.S.," said the Beijing Youth Daily, a newspaper that just four months ago was castigating the United States as an imperialist invader for the bombing in Kosovo.
"There are a lot of paradoxes in China now that are difficult to resolve," said Minxin Pei, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
Many experts in and outside China, as well as President Clinton, have predicted that the opening of the economy required for entry into the World Trade Organization would ultimately push China to liberalize in noneconomic spheres as well -- promoting, for example, more freedom of the press and a more even-handed legal system.
But for now, the contradictory facets of China remain mostly uncoupled, creating the odd juxtapositions.
"The economic dimension of China has been transformed to allow for market forces and private property," said He Qinglian, a Shenzhen author and economist. "But the other dimensions -- politics and ideology -- have changed very little. The political system has changed only as much as demanded by economic change. And in ideology, there's been very little change at all."
This is partly because China's leaders are much more unified on the need for economic reform than for political reform, said Mr. Pei. And Chinese citizens are, for the moment, far more concerned with improving living standards than with voting, he added.
But other experts point out that there is a unifying impulse behind the leaders' seemingly contradictory actions: to maintain the power of the Communist Party.
"The furthering of reform and opening characterized by the W.T.O. deal and the intensified crackdown on the sect and dissidents are both fully in line with Deng Xiaoping theory, which calls for 'both hands being aggressive,' " said a researcher at the Institute of Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Theory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.
He said the leaders hoped that the trade deal would bring foreign investment to maintain high economic growth, which would in turn promote stability. "If they can achieve these goals, it can help consolidate the rule of the Communist Party, which -- remember -- is the most important of Deng's Four Cardinal Principles."
In the past year, the Chinese government has grown increasingly at home living in this divided world, making little effort to link liberalizing economic and social policies with politics at home.
In 1997 and 98, in the months preceding the exchange of state visits by Mr. Jiang and Mr. Clinton, the Chinese routinely released dissidents as a good-will gesture, held only a few political trials and even tolerated the development of an embryonic democratic party.
But this fall, even as Mr. Jiang toured Europe and chatted on the phone with Mr. Clinton in pursuit of a trade agreement, Chinese courts were sentencing pro-democracy activists to long prison terms after brief trials without lawyers. And the Chinese police were detaining thousands of Falun Gong members for practicing a banned form of exercise and meditation.
Falun Gong is an idiosyncratic blend of traditional Chinese exercises and Buddhist and Taoist religious beliefs that was widely popular -- before it was banned in July -- among middle-aged Chinese for its supposed health benefits.
Ever since, the government has been conducting an old-style Maoist propaganda campaign to wipe out what it has labeled an "evil sect," complete with re-education for members, and detention or labor camps for those who have publicly continued its practices.
But in a China now filled with Internet cafes and Hong Kong cable television, campaigns do not work as they used to, and this one has fallen flat both among more devoted practitioners and among the many Chinese who see the group as mostly harmless.
Today, on a crisp fall morning, in Tiananmen Square, a dozen or so practitioners unfurled a banner reading "The Great Law of Falun" and held out their hands to begin their exercises, a small protest to attract the attention of the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who is visiting Beijing.
Police in uniforms and plainclothes -- on bicycles, in vans and on foot -- were out in large numbers. The protesters, some of whom were kicked, were then shoved into vans, which sped out of the square, witnesses said.
 There was another small demonstration Wednesday morning by four women, a man and a young child who performed slow meditation exercises, The Associated Press reported. The police bundled the group into a van and drove them away.
Experts say it is unclear how long China's leaders can aggressively open their economy to the outside world while pursuing a totally closed political system at home.
"I think the whole process of economic pluralism inevitably leads to pluralism in ideology and other spheres, because it leads to diversity of economic interests which in turn produces distinctive needs and values," said Ms. He, the economist.
She said that at a time when China is changing so rapidly, the country's sustaining value systems, Confucianism and Communism, are both collapsing -- leading to the rise of groups like Falun Gong.
"China still adheres to a monolithic ideology," she said. "But a specialized professional society like China is becoming requires a more innovative, pluralistic ideology."
Also, after an initial surge in response to the trade agreement, China's stock prices tapered off today, and investors and economists in China seemed uncertain that opening the economy would, by itself, lead to the economic growth that the Communist Party wants and needs.
"The kind of paradoxes we see today can last for some time," said Mr. Pei of the Carnegie Endowment. "But no society can tolerate that kind of dissonance forever."

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Trade Path Is Not Clear

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
It took three United States presidents, two Chinese leaders and dozens of negotiators 13 years of sometimes dramatic brinkmanship to clear a path for China to join the World Trade Organization. Now, to listen to proponents and critics of the measure, the hard work begins.
The trade accord announced on Monday is perhaps the most sweeping agreement of any kind between the United States and China since the two nations resumed normal diplomatic relations a generation ago. 
 But unless Congress agrees to forgo the right to review China's trade status each year, a debate that has become an annual ritual in Washington, United States companies will not enjoy any new trade advantages, and this week's agreement could become a milestone of another kind: How politics trumps diplomacy when it comes to China.
It was a long road to this week's agreement, strewn with obstacles. Page A14.
"I hope that this has been going on long enough that Congress can separate trade and all the other concerns about China, which we all have," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who has been a proponent of free trade agreements. "But if experience is any guide, the Chinese are likely to do something provocative -- like lobbing missiles off Taiwan -- and that's going to be a factor in the debate."
Potential Congressional opposition is one reason that China's accession to the trade body is not a done deal. The European Union, Canada and several major nations still face negotiating their own bilateral trade agreements with China.
European Union officials had allowed the United States to take the lead in negotiations, but Clinton administration officials have been careful to speak only for the United States.
Few expect the European Union or Canada to derail China's bid to join the global trade body, given that other countries are eager to take advantage of the broad concessions China has made to reduce tariffs and allow foreign banks, farmers and telecommunication companies more access to its huge market.
China is expected to try to complete side agreements with other nations before the end of the year.
Even if that process goes smoothly and China does become a W.T.O. member, some United States businesses say many of the headline benefits of the accord will take years, and sweat and tears, to realize.
"The reality is that its easier to negotiate and reach agreement like this than to make it work in practice," said Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at Microsoft.
The computer software giant has benefited from a string of bilateral agreements between the United States and China designed to protect copyrights on intellectual property, like software and movies. But Microsoft and other software companies have found that the police, judges, local government officials and companies do not always obey agreements signed in Beijing, at least without sustained pressure from above. Software companies have at times worked side by side with local Chinese prosecutors to monitor how courts enforce trade protections.
The accord is a milestone "in the sense that it gives us a solid foundation, but now we have to get busy doing the hard stuff," Mr. Smith said.
And all this assumes that China's leadership, which has faced domestic pressure to protect Chinese industry and jobs, will remain firmly behind the agreement. The accord on Monday was seen as giving a boost to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, a plain-spoken reformer, but Chinese politics are notoriously hard to read, and few dismiss the possibility of a backlash against trade concessions.
Proponents of the trade agreement still give it good odds of winning Congressional backing and, longer term, of being fully carried out. Bolstering their case is an outpouring of support from American businesses, which have promised the strongest lobbying campaign on a trade issue since Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers set the tone today by promising to mount a vigorous defense of the benefit of trade and globalization for average Americans. "This means more jobs for Americans," he said. "It means larger export markets for American producers to provide high-wage jobs. It means a more stable, competitive, global economy."
But labor union leaders were equally vigorous yesterday in their vows to block approval in Congress, with some predicting they could stop this deal, as they have blocked other administration trade progams. They hope to muster an unusual coaliton of Democrats, moderate Republicans who are friendly to labor and conservative Republicans who are angry at rights violations in China.
The president of the Teamsters union, James P. Hoffa, denounced the pact as a "slap in the face not only to workers in America, but to their counterparts in China."
Congress will probably take up the issue in February, shortly after the beginning of the new session. Though proponents of the measure would prefer to keep the debate focused on the merits of increasing trade with China and broadening access to its market, a battle they think they can win, critics of China will surely seek to make the debate as wide-ranging as possible. Critics say China spies on the United States, ships sensitive weapons to troubled regions, often breaks its word after sealing international treaties and suppresses all kinds of opposition at home.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, who has opposed granting China low-tariff treatment in the United States in the past, said the broad aspects of the China relationship weighed on President Clinton's decision to seal a trade deal now, and will weigh on Congress when it considers whether to give up its right to review China's trade status each year.
"It is inevitable that we will consider the full range of issues about China because it goes to China's credibility -- whether they can honor a deal," Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said.
Adding to the uncertainty in Washington is that past turning points in the bilateral relations, like state visits and the annual trade review, have prompted a slew of damaging revelations about China's international behavior, including allegations about its theft of American nuclear secrets and illegal campaign contributions to President Clinton in the 1996 election.
"That's the pattern," said Huang Yasheng, a China expert at the Harvard Business School. "As soon Congress starts deliberating, you can bet that some kind of bad news will leak out."
In fact, Mr. Huang said he suspected that China's willingness to grant broad concessions on trade was motivated, in part, by its desire to deny critics in the United States an annual forum to attack China and keep relations in a deep freeze. But to achieve that goal, China will have to endure at least one more round of intense attacks, he said.
Mr. Matsui, the House Democrat, said supporters of the China agreement will probably prevail, though previous votes on extending China's trade status suggest that the tally could be close. "Probably the most likely reason this will go through is that if we don't give China permanent trade status, all other countries will get tariff reductions and we won't," Mr. Matsui said, drawing a scenario in which China enters the trade organization but Congress does not approve the terms negotiated.
Even if the trade deal clears Congress, United States businesses could face years of hard bargaining, court fights and diplomatic lobbying before getting its advantages.
Though this is the biggest trade agreement between China and the United States, it is not the first. The two nations have reached numerous accords over the years on how much access China will grant many kinds of foreign industries, like autos and agriculture, and have fought dozens of skirmishes about issues like protection of intellectual property, export subsidies and the selling of Chinese manufactured goods at unfairly low prices. The upshot, say business executives who have watched the negotiations progress, is that the United States government and businesses need to work hand in hand to ensure the accord is carried out.
Take Kodak, the film company. When the company began a push into China in 1994, the path was clear, in theory, for it to make a major investment in film manufacturing and sales in that country. In practice, it took four years of high-level attention, including meetings with the Chinese prime minister, to win permission to take majority control over several China film production factories, which feared extinction if Kodak was allowed to do as it wished. The effort eventually paid off for Kodak, which has pumped some $1.2 billion into Chinese production sites.
Or consider prospects for the American entertainment industry. The new trade accord doubles, to 20, the number of foreign films China will permit to be shown in its tightly censored market each year. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association, hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, but also called it a first step.
"What we'd like to see in the future is 25 films or 30. We like to have more than one film distributor, and someday, we'd love to distribute them ourselves," he said, adding that those more ambitious goals are probably many years away from becoming a reality.

GAFFIGAN, MICHAEL A.

 BODY:
GAFFIGAN-Michael A., 63, of Dune Acres, IN., former President of Mercantile National Bank of Indiana, died on Friday at Saint Margaret Mercy Hospital in Hammond. He continued to be active in many community organizations up until his death. All of his life he was an eloquent and passionate champion of community service. Saint Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers recently honored Mr. Gaffigan for his outstanding support of the Healing Ministry of the Sisters of St. Francis. Mr. Gaffigan gave of his time and resources to support organizations including Hospice of the Calumet Area, Northwest Indiana Forum as well as Purdue University Calumet Chancellors Advisory Council. As past Chairman of all of these organizations, his commitment was evident in the progress made in their respective missions. In addition, in 1989 he received the Shamrock Award from the Friendly Sons of Erin for his commitment to family and faith. Mr. Gaffigan's professional career began in 1957 at Chase Manhattan Bank where he rose to Assistant Treasurer. He returned to the Midwest in 1965 to assume a position with Central National Bank of Chicago (now La Salle National Bank) and was eventually promoted to Executive Vice President. In 1976 he was appointed President and then Chief Executive Officer of Mercantile National Bank of Indiana. Under his management, Mercantile always earned more than 1% on assets and was subsequently honored by Money Magazine as one of the 100 safest banks in the United States (one of only two Indiana banks so honored). As a banker, Mr. Gaffigan was a master at balancing criticism and encouragement. "Mike was always fair in the way he treated us and I think that is what made him the respected President he was. He really did care about the employees as much as he did the bank's clients," said Jeanne Cleaveringa, a former Mercantile employee. Mr. Gaffigan was born in Springfield, Illinois and matriculated at Georgetown University earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. He earned his Masters of Business Administration from New York University. His wife Marcia preceded Michael Gaffigan in death in 1990. He is survived by his loving wife Kathleen (Nau), his six children, three step children and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE DRAMA;
At the Last Hour, Down to the Last Trick, and It Worked

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Late last Friday evening in Beijing, an angry and frustrated Charlene Barshefsky declared to the Chinese on other side of the negotiating table, "You are wasting my time." Then she pulled out the oldest pressure tactic in a negotiator's bag of tricks: She demanded to see the country's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, and declared that the next morning she would head for airport.
It worked. At 3:10 a.m. on Saturday, Ms. Barshefsky's team was awakened by a call inviting her to Zhongnanhai, the walled lakeside complex next to the Forbidden City where China's top leaders live and work. 
 A few hours later they were escorted in to see the 71-year old Mr. Zhu, the champion of Chinese economic reform who American intelligence agencies had concluded was quickly losing power after a failed meeting on trade in April with President Clinton in Washington. He volunteered that China's leaders had met until 2 a.m. to decide how high a price they were willing to pay for entree into the World Trade Organization.
"Now," said Mr. Zhu, according to Ms. Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and other American participants in the week of high-tension negotiations, "I am going to tell you what we can do, and what we can't do."
Forty-eight hours later -- after two more threats by Ms. Barshefsky to leave town and another critical intervention by Mr. Zhu -- the world's most populous nation and its most powerful nation closed a deal that leaders of both countries needed, for very different reasons.
What was at stake for Mr. Zhu and for President Jiang Zemin was the future of their own effort to complete one of the most astounding economic reform programs in history while preserving the Communist Party's absolute political control. Only by allowing in foreign competition, Mr. Zhu has long argued, will China's giant, inefficient industries be whipped into shape and prepared to compete around the world.
For Mr. Clinton, a deal would mean he could leave office claiming to have taken the biggest single step toward integrating China with the West -- admitting it to the club of capitalist economies, and winning its agreement to live under the rule of international law.
Ms. Barshefsky knew what she had to deliver. "It's the legacy thing," she told friends at a birthday party for her husband in Washington a few days before she left for Beijing. For the president, she said, "there's nothing bigger."
The winding road the two countries took to Monday's groundbreaking agreement was strewn with obstacles. There were cultural miscues, furious arguments within the White House, a divided leadership in Beijing a bombed Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and constant political calculations about how the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and dispirited Chinese steelworkers might react.
In the end, Mr. Clinton paid a price: China backed away from its April offer to allow American telecommunications companies and insurance firms to take a 51 percent stake in Chinese companies, allowing only a noncontrolling stake of 50 percent.
The give-and-take had all the ingredients of any modern trade negotiations between great powers: secret phone calls between presidents, the constant tension between global strategy and domestic politics and an endgame that turned into a weeklong game of chicken.
"It's amazing it worked," said Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's national economic adviser, who was against a deal in April, and for it once his boss made it clear that the April rejection was a huge mistake. But the hard work may be just beginning.
Once China makes it into the World Trade Organization -- months of work are still ahead -- Mr. Sperling and others expect a long, hard slog as China's domestic interests try to undo on the ground what negotiators just signed on the table.
Perhaps the strangest aspect of these talks is that China was a founding member of the very organization it just spent 13 years negotiating to re-enter.
Though a civil war was under way in China, the Nationalist government was among the first to ratify the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1948. After the Nationalists fled the mainland for Taiwan the next year, and Mao created the People's Republic of China, it was unclear which China inherited the seat. Taiwan held it for a year, then withdrew.
By the mid-1980's, as Deng Xiaoping began China's rapid march to a market economy, China's leadership realized that it needed to re-enter the club. It was a matter of national prestige. But it was also a hard-headed issue of economic advantage. As long as China remained outside the treaty, countries were free to place high tariffs on Chinese-made goods -- or to to block their entry unilaterally.
The talks began in July 1986, and a deal seemed within reach three years later -- until the student protests in Tiananmen Square were crushed. Then everything froze.
There were a few signs of life after Mr. Clinton's election, but he was focused on the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, then the Senate battle to ratify a new accord that created the World Trade Organization, the earlier agreement's successor, as a truly powerful enforcer of world trading rules.
Meanwhile, China's enthusiasm for opening its economy waxed and waned.
It was not until Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang began exchanging state visits two years ago that the talks became serious. And then the magnitude of what China would have to do -- open its telecommunications market, allow the distribution of American movies, dramatically lower protections for its car industry, let American insurance companies sell policies around the country -- seemed more than the Chinese leadership could bear.
By April, though, Mr. Zhu was ready to deal. He came to Washington determined to seize the moment and cut a deal. He carried with him some breathtaking proposals: American firms could take up to 51 percent of Chinese telecommunications companies and insurance firms -- two strategic industries for China. Detroit's automakers could have full access to China within five years, with low tariffs. American negotiators were astounded.
The problem was that Bill Clinton was not ready.
Washington was awash in charges that China had stolen nuclear secrets. Mr. Clinton was still recovering from the allegations -- never proven -- that the Chinese government secretly contributed to Democratic campaigns. Moreover, Mr. Zhu's offer was missing an agreement that the United States could continue to act unilaterally if China sold steel or other products below cost to gain a share of the American market. It was a huge issue for the American labor movement.
The day Mr. Zhu was arriving, Mr. Clinton gave a speech warning that America should fear an economically weak China, not a militarily strong one. Many took that as a sign that he was ready for a trade deal. But his advisers were deeply divided.
Ms. Barshefsky; the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright all favored the deal. Mr. Sperling, the chief of staff, John Podesta, and political aides who focus on domestic issues were against it. And so was the biggest heavyweight in the administration, the treasury secretary at that time, Robert E. Rubin. "We judged it couldn't pass in Congress," he said. "And that would be a bigger embarrassment for the Chinese."
When Mr. Zhu arrived, Mr. Clinton invited him for a nighttime talk in the White House family quarters. It was a meeting full of miscues. Mr. Clinton said he could make a deal -- but it would be politically hard for him, and could be politically difficult for Mr. Zhu.
It would be better, he said, to announce "major progress." The prime minister was confused, but did not insist. And so the visit stumbled on, with Mr. Clinton "only half focusing on it," said one participant.
Then the White House published a 14-page list of Mr. Zhu's "concessions" -- which many of China's industrial and political leaders had not seen. They were outraged at what was being given away. So were American executives, but for different reasons. At a meeting at the White House the next week, they cheered Ms. Barshefsky -- and screamed at Mr. Sperling. Mr. Clinton had an explosion of his own over the breakdown. "I've rarely seen him as angry as he was after Zhu left town," said one.
Mr. Clinton called Mr. Zhu, who by that time was in New York, and asked him to restart talks. But Mr. Zhu said he could not do so until he got back to Beijing. And as soon as he returned, he was under attack there.
Weeks later, the C.I.A. delivered an analysis to the White House declaring that Mr. Zhu had been politically undercut by the failed trip, and that his political enemies were using the list of trade concessions to bury his economic reform program. Mr. Berger later told a colleague that the April meeting was "one of the biggest foreign policy mistakes of the second term."
It might have been fixable, but the NATO bomb that blew up the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in early May also blew up the talks. The wave of nationalism that followed left China's leaders in no position to make concessions.
In late August Mr. Clinton wrote Mr. Jiang a letter, hand delivered by Senator Diane Feinstein, the California Democrat. He asked to get the talks started again at an Asian summit meeting in New Zealand. But the meeting was a dud. "The president kept saying, 'All our negotiators are here, let's get going,' " recalled one White House official. "And Jiang would nod, say something noncommittal, and nothing would happen."
Mr. Clinton kept pushing. On Oct. 16, he called Mr. Jiang and said he would soon send a "bottom line" offer and would follow it up -- if Mr. Jiang wanted -- with a visit by Ms. Barshefsky.
"Jiang's response was not very revealing," said one silent participant allowed to listen in on the call. "But we thought that there was a serious division in the Chinese leadership, and the only way to resolve it was to force the issue."
But there was a downside. In April, China was the supplicant, looking for the deal. Now Mr. Clinton looked like he wanted it more than Beijing did. "It's never good to look too eager," warned Ms. Barshefsky.
On Nov. 8, Mr. Clinton called again, wondering if Mr. Jiang had read the American offer. He had, Mr. Jiang responded, sounding interested but noncommittal. Ms. Barshefsky, he said, should come to Beijing. But Mr. Clinton ended with a caution: "I don't want to send Charlene to fail."
Once the talks began, Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling realized the Chinese side was treading water. "They clearly didn't have instructions from the top," Mr. Sperling said. The deal they offered was far less than what Mr. Clinton turned down in April. After three days Mr. Sperling, taking a prearranged cue from Ms. Barshefsky, blew his top. Soon after that, Ms. Barshefsky did her take-me-to-your-leader routine.
Mr. Zhu offered the Americans the right to buy up to 49 percent of telecommunications firms, and extend protections against surges in Chinese imports for 10 years after the agreement takes effect. But he said there were political limits to what he could do.
"Control of information was clearly their sensitive point," Mr. Sperling said. "The whole idea of letting foreigners take 51 percent control of the telecommunications network -- Zhu made it clear he couldn't do it."
He sent the negotiators back to the table. But by Sunday night, lower-level Chinese officials were clearly fighting a rear-guard action, raising anew issues that the Americans thought were long settled. On Sunday night, Ms. Barshefsky called Mr. Clinton to report that the talks were "in a downward cycle" and that she planned to leave on Monday morning unless there was a sudden break.
Mr. Clinton, she recalls, said, "If you can't break the cycle, come home." But clearly he was disappointed.
The next morning, back in the negotiating rooms in the Ministry of Foreign Trade, things looked worse. Then Mr. Sperling and Ms. Barshefsky were told that Mr. Zhu -- who does not make a habit of visiting drab Chinese ministry buildings -- wanted to see them upstairs. There, he talked about the political pressures on China. Ms. Barshefsky leaned over and wrote on Mr. Sperling's legal pad, "This is like a Seinfeld episode."
But after a few minutes, Mr. Zhu made the concessions necessary for the Americans to claim they got a respectable deal: foreigners could take up to 50 percent of telecommunications firms, and the United States could continue invoking its anti-dumping laws against Chinese imports for up to 15 years. A few other items sweetened the pot.
Relieved, the two Americans decided to take the deal. But first, they needed a private place where they could place a call to President Clinton. There was only one: the women's bathroom. "It wouldn't have been so bad," said Ms. Barshefsky. "Except that Gene wanders around a lot when he's talking on a cell phone."

HEADLINE: Doing Good or Doing Well: It's Starting to Get Blurry

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THERE is a new phrase in the charity lexicon, one that began as an oxymoron and quickly evolved into an accurate description: nonprofit business. A growing number of charities are creating profit-making subsidiaries, some to make money from the intellectual property they own, and others to separate customers who can afford to pay for services from those who receive those services free, or at a nominal charge.
The poster boy for this phenomenon is Minnesota Public Radio, which last year sold a mail-order business begun with small loans from its directors, putting $90 million into its endowment. The sale made it the financially strongest public broadcasting charity in the nation. 
 Then there is Family Service of America, whose social workers help troubled families without charge or for modest fees. Xerox Corporation hired this nonprofit to provide the same services to employees whose families needed counseling.
There is a flow the other way, too. The Fidelity and Vanguard mutual fund companies, for example, have created public charities that accept tax-deductible donations, with the donors later advising on the charities to which the money should be passed.
As these examples show, it is getting hard to distinguish organizations that are out to do good from those that want to do well. And it is going to get harder, according to scholars, executives of nonprofit groups and tax lawyers who say that fundamental economic and political forces are blurring the lines between charitable and commercial activities, in some cases to the point where they cannot be differentiated.
"You have to work very hard to keep straight in the public's mind what is charitable and what is commercial," said Peter Goldmark, the president of the Alliance for Children and Families, the successor to Family Service of America. That's why his group's for-profit division uses a different name: FEI (for Family Enterprise Inc.) Behavioral Health.
MONEY is the reason for this blurring. Despite all the talk about a golden era of philanthropy, increased donations accounted for just 8 percent of the nonprofit sector's growth from 1982 to 1992, the latest year for which detailed analysis is available, said Lester Salamon, a political science professor at the Johns Hopkins University and an expert on nonprofit finance. Fees accounted for 52 percent of the growth, while government contracts and grants accounted for the remaining 40 percent, Professor Salamon said in a report financed by the Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York.
The growing reliance on fees paid by clients stems in large part from national political changes, experts on the nonprofit sector said. James J. McGovern, a tax lawyer with KPMG Peat Marwick, said that in the last 20 years, sources of financing for nonprofit organizations have switched. "In 1975, four-fifths of support came from contributions and one-fifth from program service revenue," said Mr. McGovern, who until 1996 was the Internal Revenue Service assistant commissioner overseeing tax-exempt organizations. "Now it's the reverse. What drove this was the Reagan administration's decision to significantly defund, or not fund, the third sector of the economy."
Nonprofit hospitals are an example of the revenue shift. Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance -- always the mainstay -- dwarf charitable gifts, which have shrunk to 5 percent of nonprofit hospital revenues, down from 11 percent in 1982.
Professor Salamon is one of many nonprofit experts who believe that charities change as their lifeblood of donations is transfused with fees. "Commercial values drive out charitable values and, increasingly, charities are having to rely on commercial activities to grow," he said.
The evolution of the nonprofit business, or the commercial nonprofit, as it has also been described, began during the late 1970's. Charities that historically solicited donations to pay for services that they distributed free, like summer recreation programs, began charging fees to clients. Museums and other institutions, which had charged token admission fees and opened many events to the public, raised prices and clamped down on who paid.
A variety of Washington researchers lauded these moves, theorizing that if recipients of charitable services paid part of the cost, they would make wiser use of those services.
By contrast, Burton A. Weisbrod, a Northwestern University economist who has studied nonprofits, argues that such commercialization is retarding the growth in donations and may lead to their decline.
Gifts to charities, including religious organizations, have held steady at about 2 percent of individual incomes for decades, despite significant increases in the standard of living and wealth, Professor Weisbrod said. Charities, he said, are too quick to jump at alliances with businesses that appear to offer money in exchange for the use of their names.
But there is no free lunch, he said, noting that such deals are often accompanied by "a loss of confidence by the public in charities, with donations declining only to be replaced increasingly by this commercial, ancillary activity in a sort of downward death spiral."
Death may seem a strange word for a sector of the economy with total revenues of about $750 billion this year. But Professor Weisbrod said the corrosive, long-term effect of commercialization is that "charities are losing the claim to have some kind of special status as they just become front men or agents for these profit-seeking firms."
On the other hand, many charities that plead for donations have assets that could supplement or replace donations, said Will Haddeland, a vice president of Minnesota Public Radio.
Minnesota Public Radio grew wealthy because Garrison Keillor, the host of "The Prairie Home Companion," wanted to give away a Powdermilk Biscuits poster to promote his program at a cost of about $3 a poster. The board balked, said Mr. Haddeland, who was a director at the time, but then agreed after someone suggested enclosing a coupon offering T-shirts and other items for sale with the biscuit logo. "To our amazement, we had a 25 percent response rate and we realized there's a business here," Mr. Haddeland said.
The sale of the catalog business to Dayton-Hudson for $120 million was criticized because $6.6 million in fees were paid to executives of the nonprofit broadcasting operation. "You have to pay people competitively," he said, adding that some of the catalog profits were set aside to pay for trials of other business ventures.
Mark Weinberg, a lawyer in Rockville, Md., who represents nonprofit organizations, said creating a sister for-profit also makes it clear that charitable assets are not being used for unfair advantage. Mr. Weinberg said that when a surplus broadcast studio, for example, is leased to businesses, the charity can say, "We do that through our taxable entities and we pay taxes on those profits just like every other business."
Of course not all nonprofit groups engage in commercial activities. And many of those that do impose rules to protect their images and limit their liabilities.
But the lure of easy money is a siren call and has drawn many charities into relationships that have been sharply criticized for going too far.
Professor Weisbrod pointed to the University of Wisconsin, which accepted money and equipment from Nike under a contract that would have prohibited "disparaging" the company. Complaints about restrictions on intellectual inquiry killed that clause, but Professor Weisbrod said the dispute is a reminder that "you can't become dependent on a revenue source without developing some allegiance to the source."

HEADLINE: 3 Women in the Men's Club Wield Money and Influence

BYLINE: By KAREN STABINER; Karen Stabiner is writing a book about single-sex education.

 BODY:
WITH a rueful laugh, Ann Rubenstein Tisch recalled what people back home in Kansas City, Mo., used to say about rich people: If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people He gave it to.
"I was determined," she said, "not to be one of them." 
 That was before she went on a blind date with Andrew Tisch, a scion of the family that owns the Loews Corporation, which has revenues of $20 billion. Now married seven years and the mother of two daughters, Mrs. Tisch responded to a reporter's stated intention to pay for breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue with a blush and an apology: "They'll never understand," she murmured, gesturing at the dining room staff. "We own the hotel."
To skew Shakespeare: Some people are born wealthy, some attain wealth, and some, like Mrs. Tisch, have wealth thrust upon them. The question is how to handle it, without becoming one of those people her relatives joked about. It is an increasingly common quandary, if not on so grand a scale. Initial public offerings from technology companies and the coming transfer to baby boomers of an estimated $12 trillion in inherited money mean that many more people will have what Sarah Pillsbury, a philanthropist and film producer, bluntly described as "more money than we need."
More women are involved in philanthropy, too, because they have made their own fortunes or because they demand a voice in how charitable dollars are spent. "For baby boomers and those younger, there's much more likely to be a partnership between men and women, though, in most cases, still, it was not the woman who created the wealth," said Dr. Gary Tobin, the president of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, in San Francisco, who conducted a five-year study of Jewish philanthropic families.
Such is the case with Mrs. Tisch, along with Melinda Gates, who almost six years ago married William H. Gates 3rd. Patty Stonesifer, Mr. Gates's longtime colleague, now helps manage the couple's foundation. Ms. Pillsbury, an heir to the Pillsbury baking fortune, took control of her inheritance immediately after college. These women, all in their 40's, demanded membership in what was predominantly a men's club; their presence is already affecting the nature of philanthropy and its beneficiaries.
 
Ann Rubenstein Tisch
Mrs. Tisch, the daughter of an upper-middle-class couple committed to community service, came to wealth with the right instincts. As a television journalist with an interest in education, she found stories that moved her, including one that she carried in her "mental Filofax" for years, about a Milwaukee day care center that enabled teenage mothers to complete high school. One girl had burst into tears when asked where she thought she would be in 10 years.
"That girl was doomed and she knew it," Mrs. Tisch said. "The answer was to keep young women from being in that situation."
But she lacked the resources to effect that kind of change -- until she married. Mr. Tisch was involved in "the usual suspects," she said, the United Jewish Appeal, art institutions, zoos, Cornell, his alma mater. Together, they formed the Ann and Andrew Tisch Foundation, incorporating her priorities as well, like the National Association of Breast Cancer Organizations and the Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem, a single-sex public school opened in 1996.
This year she formed the Young Women's Leadership Foundation to facilitate contributions to the school. She also hired a guidance counselor, on the foundation's payroll, to help 11th graders apply for college.
Mrs. Tisch would not disclose the cost of establishing the Harlem school (nor the size of her family foundation's endowment). But ticking off the meetings she attended, she insisted: "It's about sweat equity as much as anything else, about time as well as money. It would be easy to write checks, but that doesn't make these schools public institutions, and it doesn't make them replicable. We didn't want this to be about an affluent family treating a few girls to a quality education."
 
Patty Stonesifer
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, at $17 billion the largest philanthropic organization in the United States, intends to do just that, although its program is co-educational and the numbers are huge by comparison: the new Gates Millennium Scholars Program will spend $50 million in each of the next 20 years to send minority students to college, part of the $855 million the foundation spends each year.
At their level, sweat equity mostly involves the energy needed to sign checks. The programs alter social reality by their existence.
Patty Stonesifer is the co-chairman of the Gates Foundation and the only former Microsoft employee there. Economically, she has journeyed even farther than Mrs. Tisch: a technology multimillionaire and philanthropist herself, Ms. Stonesifer was born the sixth of nine children to an Indianapolis car salesman and a part-time physical therapist.
"Scrambling to find two quarters to put in the church basket on Sunday was just the way we lived," she said. Now she is point person for the richest man in the world. There is nowhere to hide: one morning, she was waiting to meet a grant applicant at Tully's, a Seattle espresso bar, when a stranger pressed a proposal into her hand. She receives 1,000 proposals a month, she said.
Ms. Stonesifer oversaw Mr. Gates's initial foray into philanthropy, the donation of hardware and software to libraries nationwide. Critics charged that Mr. Gates was merely colonizing distant territories and training a new generation of Microsoft dependents.
Mark Dowie, whose history of philanthropic organizations will be published next year by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, was a skeptic. "I don't think he had a clue what he was doing with the early philanthropy," Mr. Dowie said.
Ms. Stonesifer, a defender of the library project, said, "Time will judge him more kindly." Grant recipients, she said, were thrilled.
The second wave of Gates philanthropy focuses on global health and education, a shift that Ms. Stonesifer attributes in great part to Melinda Gates. Ms. Stonesifer turns the interests of the Gates into strategy. She wrote the list of six possible educational projects that evolved into the Millennium Scholars Program. She and the foundation co-chairman, William Gates Jr., will hire staff members to administer the growing list of education and health projects.
Ms. Stonesifer, like Mr. Gates 3rd, looks to the entrepreneurial Microsoft model for inspiration. The Gates Foundation, she said, wants to bring in consultants and staff members from the field in which the foundation intends to spend money, so that they won't "lose touch" with the people they support. This differs little from running a business, she said, adding, "I am sober about the responsibility, because a billion dollars can transform many institutions that are doing wonderful work."
By contrast, spending the cash is an emotional rush. For years Ms. Stonesifer seemed comfortable in a space just south of forthcoming; in interviews she was crisp. As it came time to announce the scholarship program (and, coincidentally, to pack her older child off to college), she was "overwhelmed." She cried in public. She did so again in a recent interview as she recited imagined dialogues between hopeful parents and their children. Being able to change fate, it seems, takes a little getting used to.
 
Sarah Pillsbury
Ms. Pillsbury was not ambushed by wealth. The question for this child of affluent Minnesota Republicans was how best to use her resources. "I come from a very philanthropic community in Minnesota," she explained recently. "It's not enough to do well; you have to do good. You really can't hold your head up in public if you aren't contributing to society in some way or other."
Ms. Pillsbury came of age in the mid-1970's, just as the counterculture was figuring out what to do in adulthood. Insulated from society's ills, she said encountering the real world was a "shocker" that "helped to develop the moral outrage that fuels my interests."
But the philanthropic community, which heavily supported existing institutions, offered few models for the progressive political giving she had in mind. So 23 years ago, she and three friends founded the Liberty Hill Foundation in Los Angeles, dedicated to grass-roots community work.
Liberty Hill is a nonprofit public charity, so it has no endowment. Each year, it must raise what it gives away. The budget for the 2000 fiscal year is $2.8 million, said Tori Osborn, the director, $2 million of which will be disbursed.
The foundation remains an anomaly, one of about a dozen nationally that give away not just money, but also control over how most of it is spent. "People close to the ground are the ones who are in a better position to make decisions," Ms. Pillsbury said. "But there's a mistrust of poor people: if they were smart, they'd be rich, as though poor people chose to be poor."
The foundation has awarded grants through a community review board to diverse local organizations, like a police monitoring group and a living-wage campaign. Several have become independent organizations.
Mr. Dowie, the historian, saw a link between Ms. Pillsbury's work and the latest wave of giving. "Younger philanthropists are trying to create value with their money, not financial value, but value in society," he said. "They don't mind taking risks. They don't mind offending power." Or, as Mrs. Tisch said: "It's less noblesse, and more oblige."
 
Children of Wealth Inherit More Than Money
THE offspring of Ann Tisch, Patty Stonesifer and Sarah Pillsbury will inherit wealth. Their parents are determined that they also inherit some idea of how, productively, to part with it.
Mrs. Tisch devised a program to encourage her young daughters' instinctive generosity. One-third of their "piggy bank money" is to save, one-third to spend and one-third to give away. She has also made sure that the children glimpse life as it is not lived on upper Park Avenue, taking them to meet Eddie, a homeless man whom Mrs. Tisch reported on when she worked for NBC-TV.
Ms. Stonesifer's son and daughter were slightly older when technology made their mother wealthy, but she had long since begun their education in giving. "My son and daughter worked together at a food bank from the time my daughter was 11 or 12," she said.
Her children now realize that they have "exceptional resources," she said, and can target their spending. Her son, a college freshman, hopes to develop environmental programs for children. Her daughter, 15, worked last summer in Fiji with a housing group.
Among these families, the Pillsbury children -- a 15-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy -- have had the least formal philanthropic education, in part because they knew early on about their mother's work with the Liberty Hill Foundation. Ms. Pillsbury sent them to public elementary school, to educate them "in the world," she said.
Rather than enforce philanthropy, she presented her children with situations that would elicit a response. This fall, they will join the foundation's youth-oriented van tours of poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Liberty Hill's intent is to move money from the city's affluent west side to its needier south and east sides; the youngsters on the tour, including Ms. Pillsbury's own, are tomorrow's potential donors.

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE;
Don't Worry? Yeah, Right

BYLINE: By Neil Strauss 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
This week's No. 1 pop album, "Breathe," by the country singer Faith Hill, extols the virtues of true love, faith in God, the smile of a stranger and the eyes of a child. Though there may be little that is recognizably country on this album of slick pop-rock ballads with a CD booklet that looks like a Victoria's Secret catalog, it does have one thing in common with the earliest commercial country successes more than 70 years ago: It is the sound of pop's rear guard marching, waving the flag of traditional values in a society complaining about their disappearance.
But on Tuesday afternoon, pop's rear guard received a lecture from the front line. Pressing a panic button, the Country Music Association convened what it called a town meeting -- its first in 10 years -- of record label presidents, songwriters and some 500 others in the business. Executives from Manhattan and Los Angeles flew in to discuss two changes that have punctured the vacuum that is the Nashville music business: the Internet and consolidation. 
 One of the most significant developments in the record business in the 90's has been the emergence of a third region to rival the dominance of New York and Los Angeles. The South Coast, as it is called (despite a frequent lack of proximity to the ocean), rose when Garth Brooks started an unprecedented country music boom in the early 90's. That rise solidified when Master P and his No Limit label in Louisiana helped turn the South into rap's creative center.
But with this new national prominence, Southern music empires have lost their immunity to outside business influences. In a shrinking record industry, what affects New York and Los Angeles causes bigger waves in Nashville.
The town hall meeting was divided into two halves. First, for two hours, the gathering was told not to fear the coming of the Internet. That message came from Hillary Rosen, the formerly fearful chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America; Marc Geiger, the ever-enthusiastic chief executive of the Internet site Artist Direct Network; Phil Ramone, the producer and founder of N2K Entertainment; and others.
Then another panel of experts told the audience not to fear the consolidation that has constricted the record, concert, radio and publishing businesses in recent years. But in telling their colleagues not to be scared, panelists ended up inciting more fear. Though Ms. Rosen asserted that Internet music piracy was under control, she was speaking to a songwriting town, for which issues of performance rights, licensing fees and the breakdown of royalty payments on the Internet have not yet been worked out satisfactorily.
Crash Craddock, the president of 37212, the first Internet company to open on Music Row here, was the first audience member to protest, complaining that traditional radio stations didn't have to pay licensing fees to play music. But his Internet radio stations, even though they have no sources of revenue like advertising, will be required to pay fees to the recording association for transmitting music.
The consolidation segment of the meeting was even more ominous, with executives fooling no one by saying that layoffs were good because they allowed the newly unemployed to become independent entrepreneurs. "I'm on a binge to try and buy radio stations," said Larry Wilson, the chief executive of Citadel Communications, which already owns more than 160 stations. He went on to explain that it was wonderful that a company can own "six or seven stations in one market."
This was probably not very reassuring to record executives who complain that country-music stations have become too limited and closed-minded in making additions to their play lists. It was interesting, however, to observe that broadcasters feel the same way about Nashville; radio executives complained that they were desperately in need of new country superstars, but that Nashville kept churning out copycat singers who all sounded the same.
By the day's end record executives and radio programmers had proven themselves to be two mirrors facing each other, sending the same reflection back and forth ad infinitum. What country may really need is someone to point one of the mirrors in another direction.
And this is where the Internet comes in. "Based on what they were saying, radio is going to have less and less superstars because radio is playing less and less new artists," Mr. Craddock said. "That concerns me. But they also said that as the trees grew bigger, there'd be a lot of nuts to pick up. And I feel like a squirrel with my cheeks full of nuts. Because the Internet will be a place for people to hear the music that's not on the radio."
And this is where the new Faith Hill record comes in. "I've seen walls that could never be broken," she sings, "come tumbling down."

HEADLINE: Making Manhattan An Island of Calm

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR GORDON 

 BODY:
ONE Sunday morning back in the 1980's, long before the art galleries invaded Chelsea, two architects were riding their bikes down the old West Side Highway. As the men, G. Phillip Smith and Douglas Thompson, turned off at 23rd Street, pedaling east, they noticed a vacant lot on the northwest corner of 10th Avenue. "We came screeching to a halt when we saw the 'For Sale' sign," Mr. Smith said. "It was love at first sight."
The corner lot was the perfect size for their purposes. Once the site of two brownstones, it measured 54 by 40 feet. They also liked the rough-edged, mixed-use nature of the neighborhood, which had a gas station on one corner, the old elevated train tracks to the west and the Empire Diner and London Terrace apartment complex across 10th Avenue. 
 "We have this thing about vacant lots," Mr. Thompson said. "It's the blank piece of paper, the empty canvas. We always had a dream to claim a corner of space and build ourselves a decompression chamber."
They didn't want to renovate an old building. They wanted to start from scratch and create their own structure from the ground up. That's why they started to ride their bikes around the city every weekend searching for an empty lot. The architects phoned the real estate broker first thing the next day and learned that the property had already been sold, for $50,000, but they asked the agent to keep them posted.
"We let her know that we really wanted the property," Mr. Thompson said. After three years of waiting, their patience paid off. The property came back on the market, for more than $200,000, four times the previous price. This time, armed with a drawer full of credit cards (which they quickly maxed out) and a short-term construction loan, the architects were able to buy it.
Working in a gradual, reflective way in contrast to New York's frantic pace of life, the two men began to evolve a concept for their space. In their spare time, they sketched ideas out on napkins and tablecloths, planning a building that would serve several purposes: living space, a design studio for Smith & Thompson Architects, and -- to help pay its own way -- commercial tenants. All would be mixed into an intriguing village of spaces, courtyards and terraces that could also provide an oasis from the urban environment.
How often does the chance come along to own a piece of Manhattan? Not often, unless you're Donald Trump. Most people are used to renovating an older building, fitting into the envelope of someone else's design. But New York offers a surprising number of options for those who are resourceful and adventurous, willing to challenge conventions. Vacant lots in odd configurations or out in peripheral, frontier neighborhoods wait to be developed. Mr. Smith and Mr. Thompson, through a combination of imagination, methodical planning and a kind of do-it-yourself Zen persistence, would spend the next 10 years shaping their dream into a reality. "Remember," Mr. Smith said, "none of this had anything to do with real estate speculation. We weren't interested in maximizing the site for future profit. We wanted to make a beautiful place."
The dream had been percolating in their imaginations ever since they first met as architecture students at Columbia University during the turbulent 1960's. After completing their studies, both men, with the help of fellowships, went on design pilgrimages around the world, studying ancient and modern architecture. Mr. Smith worked for the Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi, whose buildings would have a profound influence on his later work.
"Doshi's office in Ahmadabad was in a built-up urban neighborhood," he recalled, "but it had a courtyard, and you went in from this noisy street into a quiet and magic environment." Later, he would work with the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who left a deep impression on Mr. Smith by successfully combining transparency and openness on a gritty street corner in Tokyo with his 1989 Tepia Conference Center.
For their oasis in Chelsea, Mr. Smith and Mr. Thompson would synthesize traditions of 20th-century modernism with ideas they had accumulated in their travels.
"At one point we thought about just living like gypsies on the site," Mr. Thompson said, "parking a trailer on it and building a swimming pool. Then we could drive away whenever we felt restless."
Gradually a more realistic idea evolved, one that acknowledged, even honored, the geometric reality of the city.
"Most people think of Manhattan as a closed, finite kind of space with the grid as the dominant force," Mr. Smith said. They decided to try to maintain the urban grid while inserting a fluid sequence of spaces within the enclosed area.
They knew from the start that there had to be a courtyard.
"The Noguchi museum in Long Island City was a constant touchstone," Mr. Smith said. "It is one of our favorite places in the city." They also knew that they wanted to establish a presence on the corner of 23rd and 10th, with at least two stories, respecting the lines of the street and giving the structure an inner transparency.
Another important influence on their thinking was an old house in Cairo that they had seen in a book about traditional Egyptian architecture. "It was extremely rich in plan and elevation, with so many different levels of interest," Mr. Thompson said. There were many similarities to what they ended up designing: an L-shaped building organized around an open courtyard for both public and private functions, with balconies and multilevel terraces.
From the beginning, they looked for an economy of means and flexibility. By designing everything themselves, they were able to eliminate architectural fees, and they also acted as their own general contractors. To save costly labor, all phases of construction were carefully orchestrated. After the foundation work ended, a framework of steel I-beams was bolted and welded into place like a jungle gym, a job that took only two days because steel sections had been stacked on the delivery trucks in the order of assembly.
More money was saved by using cold-rolled steel as it came directly off the mill, in precut sheets of 10 by 20 feet. The size of the plates established a modular 10-foot-square unit that the architects used throughout the project. (This also worked nicely with the dimensions of the lot.) The architects searched through stacks of steel the way decorators look at fabric swatches. "Every steel mill has a unique finish," Mr. Thompson said. "Most come out fairly black." A set that came from a mill in Pennsylvania had a consistent powdery red finish, a kind of cordovan color, that caught their eye.
After the exterior steel walls were in place, they were coated with a parafin-based sealer to prevent rusting and to protect against graffiti. Conventional timber framing was used for the rest of the structure and then covered in some places with gray stucco or white resin-coated fiberglass, which contrasts with dark steel. Cubic elements stacked like blocks were designed in such a way that different spaces could be combined and recombined over time and could easily be adapted to changing functions. The building, which is approximately 4,800 square feet, ended up costing about $140 a square foot.
The courtyard and two gallery spaces on the lower floors were finished first, in 1997. Several restaurants expressed interest in renting the space, for higher revenues, but Mr. Smith and Mr. Thompson wanted sympathetic neighbors in their little village. The J. Cacciola Galleries moved from SoHo into the ground-floor space, with 2,400 square feet, including a subterranean level. Jim Kempner Fine Arts also left SoHo and moved to the second floor (1,400 square feet).
"The building is helping us all to be together," Mr. Smith said. "It's really like a small community."
AS you approach from the west, the building appears to be hovering like a lantern in the late October twilight. It seems too thin at first -- rice-paper thin -- too insubstantial for this city, more like a temporary structure erected for a street fair. Where are the defensive barriers? The thick walls and narrow entry points that normally signal the line between public and private space? They are almost nonexistent.
Getting closer, you begin to see that the effect is a skillfully composed illusion. The perimeter walls are not paper after all, but armor-plated with steel. Step through the portal into the courtyard, and something changes. Even though the outer membrane is only a quarter-inch thick, street noises are muffled, and it is surprisingly peaceful, even meditative. The city is still out there, rude and clamorous, but it suddenly seems distant. Everything fits neatly into a framework of solid and void, except a parabolic opening that has been cut to accommodate the branch of a tree that stretches into the courtyard. The floor of the courtyard is covered with gravel. Pavers, made from recycled plastic decking, have been placed like stepping stones in a Japanese garden.
"You just don't see many buildings like this in New York," said Dru Arstark, the director of Jim Kempner Fine Arts. "Everyone loves it. We have so many new clients. Many of them just walk in off the street. The building draws people in."
She continued: "My heart melted when I first saw the opening in the wall for the tree. What kind of architects would do that? I loved their sensitivity to the environment."
For such a relatively small structure, there is a great deal going on. Each space leads into the next with a surprising clarity of purpose. One is constantly aware of the sky and the drama of the street. Lines of sight are intentionally arranged to create a shifting play between privacy and exposure, transparency and opacity. Multiple views and openings divide and transform the action on the outside of the building into a series of mini-theatrical events: advertisements on the side of a bus, pedestrians passing, the yellow flash of a speeding cab are glimpsed briefly through slitlike openings.
Conventional borders were further dissolved in the way the architects arranged their combination work-and-living area on the third floor. A system of "Murphy desks" fold up into the wall so that the space can be open for entertaining or living on the weekends. Then there is a small sleeping loft, perched precariously above the design studio.
The architects led the way up a folded steel-plate staircase to one of two roof terraces. Looking out over the busy intersection of 23rd Street and 10th Avenue, Mr. Smith pointed out how the building continues to grow as a work in progress. New spaces set back like rooms of a pueblo village will soon rise in tiers toward the bare wall of an adjacent building. The roof terrace will become a "sky room," with walls but no roof and a private sanctuary for sleeping. "This process is completely open-ended," Mr. Smith said. "The building continues to unfold."
Amid the hectic city streets, this building is a study in slowness. This gradual, almost organic approach is not just for small buildings, they believe, but can just as easily be applied to much larger projects. (The team recently completed an award-winning design for the phased expansion of the Jacques Marchais Center of Tibetan Art on Staten Island.)
There is something inherently quiet about the place and the men who designed it. In explaining their philosophy about living and working in one place, Mr. Smith paraphrased a Zen Buddhist saying he once heard in Japan: "The real master in the art of living makes little distinction between his art and his leisure," he said. "He simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both."

HEADLINE: In America;
Cuomo's Quest

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It was thought to be dangerous terrain, and the advice of some high-powered political advisers was blunt. Don't go there.
Poverty was a merciless quagmire for a politician. Even Bill Clinton had said that the era of big government was over. Politicians exhibiting an unnatural interest in the poor could expect to be viewed as weirdos or, far worse, liberals. 
 "When I took over the department, I talked to one of the sharp political guys in town," said Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "He said, 'Look, never say poverty. It's political suicide for you. The impression is going to be that you're an old-time liberal. You're the son of Mario. You're the politics of yesterday.' "
Mr. Cuomo filed the advice. He set about remaking HUD, which for awhile had been targeted for demolition by the Republicans. President Clinton seemed to like the work he was doing. HUD's budget grew.
Then Mr. Cuomo started traveling the country, visiting places that were -- despite the booming economy, despite the creation of millions of new jobs -- still poor. He went to the tough neighborhoods like Harlem and South Central Los Angeles, but also to places far removed from the consciousness of most Americans -- scenes of economic devastation like Guadalupe, Ariz., and Kasigluk, Alaska, and chronically depressed areas like Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta.
Administrations generally expect drum rolls and sustained applause from their cabinet secretaries, at least in public. But Mr. Cuomo would come back to Washington and write reports with titles like "Now is the Time: Places Left Behind in the New Economy." He would show slides of people living in squalor on Indian reservations and give speeches in which he would declare that now -- when the economy is surging and the budget surplus is huge -- is the time to invest in those parts of the country that are hurting.
"If not now," said Mr. Cuomo, "when?"
As recently as six or seven months ago that kind of behavior was considered politically problematic. Some White House aides made it clear they were not happy with the HUD secretary's insistence that the economy had not cured all ills.
But a funny thing happened to Mr. Cuomo.
Nothing.
He didn't get struck by lightning. The President didn't suggest that he zip it. And the media coverage he got was positive.
To be sure, the secretary went out of his way, often, to tout the administration's economic successes -- the balanced budget, creation of 18 million jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in decades, decreases in poverty among blacks and Hispanics, etc.
But he would also say, as he did in a speech to the National Press Club in April, "I can tell you that the poverty rate, the despair, is just as bad in some places as it has ever been." And he characterized the conditions on some of the Indian reservations as "a scar on this nation's soul."
Mr. Cuomo, it turns out, was onto something. Within a few months America's most perceptive political observer, Bill Clinton, was making his own tour of the nation's poorest venues, and reaping rave reviews throughout. On July 5, in Hazard, Ky., with the national press corps looking on, Mr. Clinton stood in the searing heat and told a crowd:
"Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all Americans have been blessed by it. This is a time to bring more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that have not fully participated in this economic recovery."
Poverty was back on the political/ policy map.
In their campaigns to succeed Mr. Clinton, Al Gore and Bill Bradley are arguing all over the country about who would do best by the poor, and even the Republicans are lip-synching the lyrics of compassion.
Will any of this translate into real help for real people? Perhaps. If the economy holds.
"It's a different story when the people are worried or anxious about their own circumstances," said Mr. Cuomo. "Then they turn inward. But if they're O.K. with their mortgage, and they're O.K. with the tuition, then they can start to look at things beyond their own circumstances. Another way of saying it is, all things being equal, the better angels will win."

HEADLINE: Caught Between Eras: China's Factory Workers

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The middle-aged workers outside the aging Beijing No. 2 textile factory said today that they already knew their days of employment were numbered -- that they knew it even before China signed a landmark agreement this week to open its doors wider to global competition.
Their biggest worry, they said, is not the impact of China's probable admission to the World Trade Organization. They agree that it is essential for China's future, and they know that it should eventually expand the country's exports of textiles, like the cotton cloth their factory makes. 
 What worries them now, said the two workers, who stopped for a discreet conversation, is how well the government will support them after they get the inevitable notice from their factory, which sheds more workers every month. Will they get a livable allowance? What if they need expensive surgery? Will they have any help finding new jobs in a fast-changing economy?
"I hope they won't just throw us out into the society," said one of the workers, Mr. Wu. Now in his late 40's, he said he doubted that he could ever find another job, because his health had been damaged by 28 years of loud noise and cotton dust in the plant.
Mr. Wu and a fellow worker, Mr. Tang, in his early 50's, spoke candidly about their fears -- and their surprisingly bitter feelings toward their factory managers -- on condition that their full names be concealed.
Workers like these two toiled for a pittance for decades, with the lifetime promise of a Communist state's "iron rice bowl." Now, caught between two economic eras, they feel betrayed.
Mr. Tang pulled his last pay slip from his pocket and pounded on a table, his voice quivering. "Look at this!" he said. "Eighty dollars a month, after 35 years of work!"
"We haven't had a pay raise in seven years, but during that time the wallets of the managers have grown fatter and fatter," Mr. Tang said. "In this country the workers have the lowest status."
Such fears and angers, shared by millions across the country, add up to one of China's greatest challenges. And it will be even greater if China fulfills the market-opening commitments it made on Monday to the United States in return for American endorsement of its application to join the World Trade Organization.
That challenge is the creation of a better safety net for the tens of millions of workers who are being displaced in this wrenching transition.
Even more daunting than the problem of urban workers, and receiving far less official attention, is the task of creating new jobs and lives for millions of inefficient farmers who are expected to lose out to global trade and may join the country's vast floating population of migrants who compete for bottom-rung jobs in the cities.
"China's social security system is far from ready for the structural change in employment that would be brought about by W.T.O. accession," concluded a recent report by the China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank in Beijing that is a joint venture of the Chinese government and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The country has only begun to create Western-style unemployment, welfare, pension and health insurance systems -- all vital to smoothing the transition from the old government-run economy to a modern market one.
"It's inevitable that older state enterprises and economic sectors here are going to lose out," said Hu Angang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "I think it's crucial that government aid should not go to the losing enterprises to prop them up.
"Instead, the aid should go directly to the laid-off workers. That's the key to a successful transition."
The government has been acutely aware of the problem in the last two years as laid-off workers and retirees in dozens of cities have held protests when promised subsistence allowances were not paid.
In the past, state enterprises had lifelong obligations to their workers, including living allowances and medical care for those laid off. But in the 1990's many ailing or moribund enterprises have simply had no money to give out.
To stave off spreading unrest, last year the government mandated the creation of thousands of "re-employment centers" in every city and required local governments to share the costs of living stipends with laid-off workers' former companies.
Workers enrolled at the centers are supposed to get training and job referrals, and in the meantime are supposed to receive monthly subsistence payments of about $20 to $35, depending on the location.
But the coverage is spotty, and many failing companies still pay little or nothing to their former employees, leaving them to fend for themselves. And under current policy, the re-employment centers are supposed to be phased out at the end of 2001.
The No. 2 textile mill on the east side of Beijing, where Mr. Wu and Mr. Tang work, employed about 7,000 workers in the early 1990's. Since then it has laid off 3,000, with more sent packing every month. The nearby No. 3 textile factory, which employed 6,000, shut down entirely in June.
Workers from those plants have no re-employment center, the men said, and have had to search for new jobs on their own. They are receiving monthly stipends of $28. A few former co-workers have found jobs mopping floors at new shopping centers, the men said, while some sell items in street markets.
For laid-off workers and for those who, like Mr. Wu and Mr. Tang, still have jobs because of their seniority, one of the greatest worries is health care.
Even when they use the company clinic and hospital, workers are expected to pay for many services and drugs, to be reimbursed later for most of the cost. But because their company is so short of money, the two men said, workers are kept waiting a year before they are repaid.
Class divisions in the company's medical system are another source of bitterness. "Workers have to go to one clinic while the managers go to another one, on the third floor of the hospital," Mr. Tang said. "The workers can't even get herbal medicines for a common cold, but the managers get whatever they need.
"The managers get a free health checkup every two years, but the workers don't get any checkups."
The two men have heard that the textile industry should boom some time after China enters the World Trade Organization, since the United States would be required over five years to end the quotas that limit American imports from China.
But they know that this brighter future may be beyond their own grasp.
"Only when a textile factory can get better machinery, and better-educated and more skilled workers, can it compete," Mr. Wu said. "So the immediate effect of converging with the world economy is that even more workers will be laid off."
Still, and perhaps remarkably, both men seemed to offer sincere and unqualified support for Chinese membership in the trade group.
"Without more global competition, China will be hopeless," said Mr. Tang, who knows at first hand about bad management and shabby equipment. "China can get rich only by competing with capitalist societies.
"We know that this factory will no longer exist in the next few years. We all hope it will be transformed into a new factory in a capitalist system."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall Again on Renewed Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell for the second consecutive session yesterday after the Labor Department reported that the rise in consumer prices in October met expectations. And for market participants, it left the door open for another increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve should inflation accelerate.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1, to 99 29/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.13 percent from 6.06 percent on Tuesday. 
 The economic statistics released yesterday were somewhat anticlimactic, some market participants said, because the data came on the heels of the Fed's decision on Tuesday to raise the federal funds rate for the third time since June.
The Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of a percent in October, the smallest rise in the last four months, which kept the year-over-year increase to 2.6 percent, economists said. While the rate of increase did not accelerate, it is still higher than the 1.6 percent pace last year.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, noted that the 2.1 percent year-over-year increase in the core rate was a touch higher than the 2 percent rise in September, which in turn was up from the 1.9 percent August reading, all of which suggests that the core rate of consumer price inflation may have already hit its low point.
"Housing starts in October rose a barely perceptible one-tenth of a percent and seem to have plateaued since April," he said. "But there is virtually no evidence to date that would indicate housing activity has begun a cyclical decline, and it's instructive to note that slowdowns in aggregate economic decline are invariably preceded by cyclical falloffs in housing."
Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the data confirmed that the housing sector had peaked from earlier highs. "Nevertheless, single-family starts remained strong, pointing to continued strong spending on housing items," she added.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said: "The housing sector is clearly not dead yet. The recent dip in mortgage rates has rekindled housing activity."
Which brings analysts back to the interest rate increase by the Federal Open Market Committee. "The Fed's tightening move was accompanied by both a shift to a neutral bias and a market expectation that the F.O.M.C. will keep policy on hold for quite some time," Mr. Fine said. "But the prudent bond market assumption is that the next Fed move will be another tightening unless economic data suggest otherwise."
Mr. Fine added, "The realization that the Fed is acutely aware of, and ready to act against, potential inflationary consequences of excessive economic growth has brought the recent bond market rally to a screeching halt, and together with an overbought situation and looming corporate supply has produced today's negative tone."
Many corporate deals are coming to market for investors seeking to add yield offered by nongovernment debt because they think gains in Treasury securities are limited. Among them are the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which is planning to price $2.5 billion of debt today.
The sale, managed through Goldman, Sachs & Company and J. P. Morgan Securities, will be in three parts: $750 million of six-year notes that are expected to offer a yield 190 to 195 basis points over a comparable Treasury; $750 million of 10-year notes, with yields about 215 to 220 basis points over a comparable Treasury, and $1 billion of 30-year bonds yielding about 225 basis points over a comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Drug Groups and U.N. Offices Join to Develop Malaria Cures

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Major drug companies have joined international agencies in an unusual approach to keep research in antimalarial drugs from ending because of the drugs' poor commercial potential.
Each year 300 million to 500 million people become ill from malaria, and a million die, mostly in Africa. The problem is getting worse because some established treatments are becoming less effective.
 Although the market is vast, "people who need these drugs can't afford to pay," said Richard B. Sykes, chairman of Glaxo Wellcome, which plans to join the World Health Organization and the World Bank in a program called the Medicines for Malaria Venture. The nonprofit project, with a $30 million yearly budget, plans to develop and register a new antimalaria drug every five years.
 The sum budgeted is only a third of the estimated average $500 million cost of discovering and marketing a new drug, but industry and public officials fear that without a new approach, no new antimalaria drugs will come to market. 
 The joint venture "has been created because the increased costs of developing and registering pharmaceutical products, coupled with the prospects of inadequate commercial returns, have resulted in the withdrawal of the majority of research-based pharmaceutical companies," said the W.H.O. director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland.
 The organization aims to halve the incidence of worldwide malaria by 2010, when the first drugs developed in the new venture should become available.
 Robert Ridley, acting head of the program, said the idea to set up an independent group grew out of discussions by industry officials on how to keep drug companies interested in an unprofitable business area. In the joint venture, the companies will work with academic researchers.
 Officials estimate that the cooperation will still require a cash outlay of $150 million for each drug developed, in addition to such in-kind contributions as access to companies' chemical libraries.
 Then, Mr. Ridley said, the industry would have to help make sure that any newly discovered drugs were made widely available. "You're not going to get a $1 million blockbuster drug, but you can make it so it's not a huge money loser," he said.
 So far, 120 research projects have submitted requests for financing and three have been selected to receive $4 million through next year. Glaxo Wellcome will work with Bristol University, SmithKline Beecham with the University of California and Roche of Switzerland with the University of Nebraska.
In addition to W.H.O. and the World Bank, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Global Forum for Health Research and Swiss and British government agencies are supporting the project.

HEADLINE: Benjamin Schwartz, 82, Dies; Expert on Mao's Revolution

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Benjamin Schwartz, one of the first scholars to show that Mao Zedong developed his own brand of Communism beyond Soviet control and a professor emeritus of history and political science at Harvard University, died of cancer on Sunday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 82.
Although not as well known publicly as his mentor, John K. Fairbank, who helped build the field of Chinese studies in the United States through constant proselytizing, Dr. Schwartz in his books furnished several crucial ideas that still help form the foundation for American understanding of China. 
 Among them were his research on Mao, showing how the young Mao had masterminded the Chinese revolution by turning to the poor peasants instead of following Marx's reliance on urban workers.
Another insight was Dr. Schwartz's recognition that for 100 years the critical question for China has been "wealth and power," or how to catch up with the West economically and militarily.
In World War II, Dr. Schwartz was an officer in the cryptoanalysis branch of the Signal Corps, helping break Japanese codes.
Although he was known as a modest man who did not seek personal titles or pursue consulting contracts like many other Harvard professors, during the height of the Vietnam war in 1969, when Harvard students occupied university offices and brought the school to a standstill, he was improbably selected to a special committee to defuse the crisis.
"Ben was like the man with his finger in the dike and held the university together at a time when it was not clear it would hold," said Marshal Goldman, associate director of the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard.
Benjamin Isadore Schwartz was born on Dec. 21, 1916, in East Boston and grew up in a poor family that was further set back by the Depression and later moved to Dorchester, a working-class section of Boston.
He graduated from Boston Latin, the city's premier high school for talented students, and was admitted to Harvard College in 1934 as a scholarship student, commuting daily from home. The experience of being poor, a day student and Jewish at Harvard in the 30's was difficult, friends said, and he found the other students and faculty snobby and elitist.
When he graduated magna cum laude in 1938 with a major in romance languages and literature, he expected to become a high school teacher or rabbi, and received a master's from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
But the war intervened, and after the war, with his knowledge of Japanese, he returned to Harvard, where he encountered Professor Fairbank, always on the lookout for bright students to convert to the gospel of Chinese studies.
Mr. Schwartz fell for the pitch, like many others. He soon earned another master's, this time in regional studies, and a Ph.D. in history and Far Eastern languages. Harvard appointed him an instructor in history and government in 1950.
In 1951, his doctoral dissertation was published as a book, "Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao," by the Harvard University Press and immediately established him as a pioneer in the fledgling study of Chinese Communism.
At a time when the United States was at war with the new government in China over Korea and there was a widespread belief that the Chinese Communists were merely an extension of Soviet power, Dr. Schwartz demonstrated that Mao had led the Communists to victory in China by defying Soviet plans and orders. Mao had discovered, after repeated failed uprisings in China's cities by other Communist leaders, that the real revolutionary force in China was the impoverished peasantry. Dr. Schwartz's book remains a key source today.
His second book, "In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the West," was published by the Harvard University Press in 1964, adding to his stature as an authority on Chinese intellectual history.
Drawing on an encyclopedic knowledge of classical and modern Chinese literature and philosophy, Dr. Schwartz showed that the overriding goal of the country's leaders from the late 19th century on has been to resume China's rightful place in the world by catching up with the West, or in Chinese terms by a search for wealth and power. Yen Fu was a member of the traditional gentry of the late Qing dynasty who was the first to translate European works into Chinese, largely to seek out the secret of Western power.
That goal remains paramount today, as the search by Beijing for economic and military modernization leads to clashes with the United States over issues like opening China's market to American investment or the theft of nuclear secrets.
In his later years, Dr. Schwartz drifted further back into Chinese history. In 1985, he published "The World of Thought in Ancient China."
He was appointed to an endowed chair, becoming the Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science in 1975. Dr. Schwartz continued to work in his office every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., where he was available to students. And he ate lunch without fail in the cafeteria of the Fairbank Research Center where anyone could talk with him.
"He was a product of the Depression, and he felt it was his job as a professor to be there for his students," said Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University.
Last year, the American Historical Association gave him its Award for Scholarly Distinction.
Surviving are his wife, Bernice; a son, Jonathan, of West Hartford, Conn.; a daughter, Sara-Ann Erichson of Montclair, N.J.; and four grandchildren.
One question his colleagues have is whether the tradition of lunch in the Fairbank cafeteria, always well attended by professors, students, and visiting Chinese scholars and officials, will continue. Dr. Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University, said, "We just don't know what it's going to be like without him."

Rising Oil Prices Help Push Shares Lower; Dow Drops 49.24

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks stumbled yesterday as oil prices neared three-year highs, rekindling fears on Wall Street that inflation could creep up despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate increase.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 49.24 points, to 10,883.09. 
 The Nasdaq composite index ended with a loss of 26.13 points, to 3,269.39. The 1.65 billion shares traded constituted the market's busiest trading session, breaking the record of 1.48 billion shares set on Tuesday, when it also set a revised closing high of 3,295.52.
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index slipped 9.36 points, to 1,410.71, after setting a revised closing high of 1,420.07 on Tuesday.
Late in the Tuesday session, the Nasdaq market shut down for about 20 minutes, because of system problems. That affected the initial reports of closes for both the Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 indexes.
"There is probably some aftermath of worries as to what the Fed will do even though it said it will remain neutral," Peggy Farley, president of Ascent/Meredith Asset Management, said of yesterday's retreat. "There are probably some lingering worries that some statistics will lead the Fed to do something more."
Though the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that the quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates would reduce the risk of inflation, the central bank also warned that the tight job market remained a concern.
One worry on Wall Street yesterday was the rising price of crude oil, analysts said.
"I don't think that the Fed action totally eliminated the risk of another hike in the next few months," said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst and senior vice president at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "Profit taking is certainly in order."
Also putting pressure on stocks was the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which fell 1 point in price, to 99 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.13 percent, from 6.06 percent on Tuesday.
In economic news, the Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in October. The growth, off slightly from the September pace, matched forecasts.
"I don't see the market heading south in any meaningful way," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners. "Long term, we're still very bullish."
Declining stocks outpaced advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a three-to-two ratio, on heavy trading of 960.1 million shares.
Oil stocks closed higher, lifted by rising crude prices, which approached three-year highs in New York after the world's leading producing nations vowed to maintain deep supply cuts until April. Exxon closed up 1 1/16 a share, to 80 1/4; Chevron closed up 3 9/16, to 96 9/16.
Financial-sector stocks, which are sensitive to moves in interest rates and were bolstered Tuesday by the Fed's decision, slipped yesterday as the bond market weakened. Citigroup fell 1 3/4, to 56 3/8; J. P. Morgan eased 2 3/4, to 139 3/4.
The Oracle Corporation jumped 6 5/8 a share, to 71, in heavy trading after the software company presented a bullish outlook to Wall Street analysts Tuesday.
Priceline.com, which lets Internet users name their own price for a variety of goods and services, including airline tickets, rose 8 5/16 a share, to 77. The company said it would take a one-time $1.1 billion charge to offer tickets from United Airlines, American Airlines and US Airways, three major carriers it had not previously offered.
And shares of the Microsoft Corporation slid 2 1/4, to 85 1/16, after its chairman, William H. Gates, said in a television interview he was willing to discuss "any sort of resolution" to the government's antitrust case against his company.

HEADLINE: Czechs Backtrack 10 Years, to the Time of Their Life

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 17

 BODY:
This was a day for the has-beens, the have-nots, the still-haves and the never-have-hads to come together and remember the good times. And for people here, what times those were!
Ten years ago today Czechoslovakia was giddy with righteous resistance and rose up to overthrow Communism so swiftly and smoothly that the people called it the Velvet Revolution. 
 Proclaiming that "truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred," the playwright Vaclav Havel emerged from the oppression and obscurity of dissent to run the revolution from the stage of the Magic Lantern theater, and then, in a fairy-tale ending to a magical month, moved into Prague's Castle as president.
If the magic has since dissolved, its power could still be felt today, as Czechs and Slovaks -- now citizens of different nations -- savored anew their heady revolt.
"It was once in a lifetime," said Jan Bubenik, one of the leaders of the Prague students whose confrontation with Communist riot policemen on Nov. 17, 1989, began the uprising, bringing to Czechoslovakia the changes that had already swept Poland and Hungary and broke down the Berlin Wall. "Once in my life, I had a moment when I knew exactly what was good and what was evil. It will never come again, because now everything is sort of gray. But back then I really felt like the knight on his white charger."
Mr. Bubenik was speaking today at one of the many commemorations organized by students, the revolution's leaders and their foreign friends to mark the end of Communism. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, now a baroness, unveiled a statue of Winston Churchill. Former President George Bush, who celebrated the first anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Prague, received an honorary doctorate at Charles University and lauded what he called the transformed world that has emerged from the cold war.
In the improbably grand surroundings of the vast Prague Castle, Mr. Havel joined in a reminiscence about the revolt and the circumstances that forged it with Mr. Bush, Lady Thatcher, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, Germany's former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Lech Walesa of Poland, his fellow dissident and former president, and Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of Francois Mitterrand, the former French president. Then he awarded them his country's highest honor, the Order of the White Lion.
But there were simpler moments, too. At the Cafe Slavia, haunt of Czech men and women of words since the last century, Mr. Havel joined a handful of reporters who covered the revolution 10 years ago.
The revolution went so fast, he said, that he cannot define his favorite moment. Three events stood out, however: the resignation on Nov. 24, 1989, of the ruling Politburo; a protest the next day of some half a million people on Letna field, long the Communists' preserve and favorite parade ground; and then the announcement that the Communist Party had simply abandoned the leading role it had written into the Constitution for 41 years.
It was at the mass demonstration, Mr. Havel said, "that I felt in my mind that this really was the breaking point, because we had always had to consider the possibility of a confrontation -- and there I got the clear impression that there was not going to be one."
Indeed, there was none: the neo-Stalinists who had expelled half a million Communists from the party after the Soviet Union led an invasion in 1968 to crush the Prague Spring reforms of Alexander Dubcek gave up this time with barely a whimper. When the Politburo stepped down that Friday night, Nov. 24, the shouting was left to the tens of thousands who danced and drank beer on Wenceslas Square, and to Mr. Havel and Mr. Dubcek on stage at the Magic Lantern, toasting the Reds' departure with pink champagne.
The mood has soured in the decade since, the country has split, the economic surge that came with capitalism has petered out into stagnation. Czech unemployment, at 6 percent, is low but rising. Much remains unfinished and imperfect, and the pall cast by high hopes unrealized permeated even today's celebrations.
"The Communist regime got into our pores, and it's very hard to get rid of that," concluded Pavel Zacek, another leader of Prague's students in 1989.
Vaclav Maly, who introduced Mr. Havel and the others who electrified the crowds of November 1989, is now the Roman Catholic Bishop of Prague. He recalled the raw energy that came a decade ago from those masses, but reflected that the revolution was actually "too easy."
"People don't like to hear that," he said, still -- like Mr. Havel -- possessed of an almost boyish grin and engaging passion. "People don't want to change. They expect always a messiah, a savior. But the savior won't come."
Still, if things are not quite what many hoped they would be, very few Czechs -- even the 18 percent who now say they would vote Communist -- say they would turn the clock back to the days when they had to fill out dozens of forms simply to get a paltry amount of hard currency or to make a coveted trip next door to West Germany or Austria, and see their own lives ruined and their children denied study and other opportunities if they dared to dissent.
The revolution "is the best thing that could have happened to us," said Eva Hadkova, 29. "When I look at my parents, basically, their lives were almost wasted, much different than they could have had. But I have no problem, even though I know a lot of people are complaining. I can get a very good job, I can travel."
Vladimir Valenta, 45, a janitor, said he lived better before the revolution but still wouldn't turn back the clock. "We keep forgetting that things I now see on the street every day -- a good car, a decent piece of clothing -- we could see only perhaps once every half a year," he said. He said that standing on Wenceslas Square 10 years ago was a drunken high without alcohol, "better than a rock concert."
Now, in one of the most tangible signs of the change the revolution wrought, its makers are scattered in many different careers and fields, and around the world.
One who was absent today from Prague was Jiri Dienstbier, who shared jail terms with Mr. Havel and emerged from the revolution as his foreign minister. Now a lecturer in the United States and the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Dienstbier acknowledged that many expectations were dashed in the past decade, but rejoiced that his people are now part of the world.
"When people started coming to me after 1989, asking me 'What can I do for you?' I always told them to take as many young people as possible to your universities, to give them a different perspective, because everything was closed here."
Even the dissidents had to learn, taking high office in their 50's, "things we should have learned at 25," Mr. Dienstbier said. "Even if a lot of things were spoiled in these 10 years, these young people will be a totally different generation. This is a fantastic basic change. If that was the only success of all we did, it made it worthwhile to do it."

HEADLINE: Inflation Still Tame but Resurging Commodity Costs Bear Watching

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index went up just enough in October to sustain concern about rising inflation without showing much evidence of a rise.
The price index, the nation's most popular inflation measure, rose just two-tenths of a percent last month, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Higher prices for apparel, airline fares, electric power and a few other items contributed to the increase, which was the smallest since June. But the prices of most of the goods and services that Americans buy held steady. 
 "Inflation has some moderate upward creep to it, but it is contained; there is no upward breakout yet," said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroecomomic Advisers Inc. in St. Louis.
Inflation has been mild for most of this decade, but the booming economy, labor shortages, a weakening dollar and rising import prices all suggest to some forecasters that inflation might finally begin to rise more quickly. And they saw in the October report some evidence to support their concern.
"We have this consistent pattern of a steady acceleration in inflation, and I do not see any sign that it will cease," said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. He noted that when the index was measured over a 12-month period, it rose 2.6 percent in both September and October. That compared with a year-over-year rise of 2 percent or less in the first half of the year.
Rising oil prices made most of the difference. Remove energy and food, and the so-called core inflation rate -- the soundest measure of inflation in the view of many economists -- is up 2.1 percent over the previous 12 months. Core inflation has hovered at this year-over-year level for months. In October, it rose two-tenths of a percent.
The stock and bond markets, however, seemed to worry about future inflation or that the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates Tuesday, might do so again in the not-too-distant future. The yield on long-term Treasury bonds rose to 6.13 percent yesterday from 6.06 percent Tuesday, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.24 points, to 10,883.09. Investors often respond to rising inflation or rising interest rates, or the expectation of either, by shifting money from stocks to bonds.
The stock market would really respond, Mr. Makin said, if the year-over-year inflation rate broke above 3 percent. "Intuitively, people say, 'If I don't see a 3 in front of the decimal point, inflation is not a worry,' " he said. "If we have 3 percent inflation, we will see 7 percent long-term interest rates and that would mean the stock market is way overvalued."
Petroleum prices dipped in October, and that helped to hold down the inflation rate. But they have rebounded in recent days, suggesting that oil might be an inflationary factor in November. Moreover, the secondary effect of rising oil prices has not yet found its way into the index, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the consumer price division of the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department.
Oil, for example, is a raw material in products made with plastics, but few of those products have risen much in price. Prices for toys, often made with plastics, fell last month, and trucking rates have held fairly steady, although airline fares jumped 5.3 percent in October.
Fuel costs contributed to that jump, said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, but it was not the biggest factor. "Airlines enjoyed peak business travel in October and business fares are the least amenable to discounting," he said.
Elsewhere, prices reflected no particular trend. Apparel prices jumped six-tenths of a percent in October, reflecting temporary factors like the introduction of fall and winter clothes as well as changes in the way the bureau calculates clothing prices. Tickets to movies, plays, concerts and sports events jumped in October after falling in September. Cigarette prices, which jumped in September, fell in October. Telephone rates rose, but prices for other information processing fell, as did computer and software prices.
Still, inflation concerns persisted. New-car prices rose just one-tenth of a percent, but 2000 year models represented only 37 percent of the bureau's car price survey. As that percentage rises, so too will car prices, economists said. That is the implication of a rise last month in the prices that vehicle manufacturers charge dealers, the Labor Department said. The dealers may try to pass the increase on to consumers.
"My sense is that times are good enough so that dealers can discount car prices a little less," said Richard Berner, chief domestic economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
What really makes some forecasters brace is "shelter," the biggest component of the index. Shelter, which covers rent and a rental equivalent reflecting the cost of owning a home, rose just one-tenth of a percent in October and 2.2 percent over the last 12 months.
That is far less than the average rise in home prices. The purchase of a home is considered by the Labor Department to be an investment, not a daily living cost. But some economists argue that rising home prices must eventually have a spillover effect, pushing up rents and the daily cost of owning a home.
"The housing thing is the key to the future rate of inflation," Mr. Makin said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Hits Snag in Renewing 'Oil for Food' Program for Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 17

 BODY:
What the United States hoped would be a quick and painless renewal of the program under which Iraq sells limited amounts of oil to pay for goods to relieve civilian hardships turned today into complicated negotiations when Russia proposed changes favorable to Iraq.
The extension of the "oil for food" program for another six months requires Security Council action by the end of the week. American diplomats hoped that approval would be more or less automatic, so that the council could concentrate on the larger issue of agreeing on a new arms inspection system for Iraq. 
 Until Iraq meets disarmament obligations, by proving that its prohibited biological, chemical, nuclear and missile systems have been destroyed, international sanctions remain in place.
That larger agreement has no deadline, and the council is now in its sixth month of debating how to replace the United Nations Special Commission with another inspection system that all five permanent members can force Iraq to accept. The government of President Saddam Hussein has already rejected a draft version.
The five permanent council members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- have been meeting daily to narrow differences, but an accord is still weeks away, if not longer, diplomats say.
"We aren't there yet," Peter Burleigh, the American representative working on the Iraq issue, told reporters today.
The Netherlands, which now holds a rotating council seat, and Britain are co-sponsors of the resolution being discussed. It proposes a suspension, not removal, of sanctions when Iraq demonstrates its compliance with disarmament requirements.
But the five permanent members are far apart on issues including how to decide when Iraq is in compliance, and for how long sanctions may be suspended before the situation is reviewed.
A Western diplomat who has followed the largely secret talks said the real challenge now was to convince Iraq that the Security Council could find a consensus that would hold.
"Otherwise Iraq will say: 'The council is divided; we are not interested,' " he said.
An Arab diplomat said the old inspection system could have led to a removal of sanctions. The Iraqis look at the new proposal, this diplomat added, and see only a suspension after meeting the same goals.
On the extension of the oil for food program, under which Iraq earned more than $7 billion in oil sales in the six-month period now ending, Russia is trying to introduce changes. They would relax air travel restrictions on Iraq, double the amount of money allowed for spending to upgrade the Iraqi oil industry and generally allow Baghdad more flexibility with available funds. American officials would like to keep all discussion about substantive changes out of the debate on the oil for food extension.
The Security Council heard a report today from Benon Sevan, who coordinates and directs the program at United Nations headquarters. Mr. Sevan again told the council of concerns about the number of contracts for Iraq purchases put on hold in the sanctions committee, where the United States frequently raises questions about items Iraq wants to buy abroad.
Secretary General Kofi Annan sent the council a report this week that was largely positive in assessing the progress of the program, which has now delivered 12 million tons of food to Iraq in three years and $729 million in medicines and medical equipment, as well as agricultural supplies and material needed to repair basic services.
But Mr. Annan was critical of the Iraqis for curtailing the freedom of the United Nations to monitor the distribution of imported civilian goods by not making Iraqi escorts available.

A 1911 Fire As Good TV, Bad History

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IF you watched Ric Burns's version of New York history last night on PBS, you heard horrible stories about sweatshops and saw awful pictures of garment workers burned at the Triangle shirtwaist factory in 1911. Then, as the music turned from somber to triumphant, you saw politicians and union leaders respond with "epoch making" reforms that protected workers across America.
Some of it was true. The fire was a horrific tragedy caused by unsafe conditions at one factory. But some economic historians disagree with Mr. Burns's depiction of the garment industry, and they point to evidence that the dozens of safety regulations inspired by the fire did little to protect workers. 
 As depicted by Mr. Burns, immigrants were brave souls who crossed an ocean only to become "hapless employees" unable to resist "nightmarish" exploitation in "brutal, dehumanizing" garment factories. The tyrannical bosses depicted might sound plausible in an isolated company town in West Virginia where there was no other place to work, but in New York a worker could walk across the street to a competing company or a whole new industry.
Turnover was high as workers left for better jobs -- a dynamic economy that somehow becomes a menace in the documentary. "The problem with the garment industry," says Mike Wallace, a professor of history at John Jay College, "is that it is thousands of small businessmen, many of them recently garment workers themselves." It was the "laissez-faire competitive market at its absolute worst," Dr. Wallace says in appalled tones. He explains that garment companies had to "bid against one another for contracts" (imagine that!), so they were forced to pay their workers "next to nothing."
His conclusion doesn't jibe with another terrible aspect of laissez-faire economics, which is that companies must bid against one another for workers. Nor does it jibe with data collected in 1908 by the United State Immigration Commission, which surveyed immigrants' pay in 21 industries and found that garment workers' pay was 8 percent above average. Their wage nearly equaled that of American-born workers, and was triple the typical wage in Italy or Eastern Europe.
A GARMENT factory in 1911 was pretty bad by today's standards, but not compared with the alternatives back then," said Price Fishback, a professor of economics at the University of Arizona, who has analyzed the history of workplace safety in two books. Long before the fire, he noted, manufacturers had financial incentives to be safe.
"Workers demanded a premium for taking risks, so if you made the factory safer you could get away with paying them less," Dr. Fishback said. "Also, you'd have less chance of getting hit with an expensive lawsuit."
To avoid expensive, unpredictable court battles, manufacturers joined unions in supporting the workers' compensation insurance system, which was passed by the New York State Legislature the year before the Triangle fire. "That was the political reform that had the most impact on safety," Dr. Fishback said, "because it increased the financial incentives for employers. Their insurance premiums would go up if there were accidents."
Dr. Fishback has detected little impact of factory safety laws like those passed after the Triangle fire, and other researchers agree. "The laws certainly were not the driving force behind the improvement in work safety and health in this century," said Mark Aldrich, an economist at Smith College and the author of "Safety First," a historical analysis published in 1997.
W. Kip Viscusi reaches similar conclusions about the modern regulations brought by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. "OSHA regulations reduce job fatalities by only 2 or 3 percent, often at enormous expense," said Dr. Viscusi, an economist at Harvard Law School. "The workers' comp system is much more effective because it reduces job fatalities by a third. But the most important factors are wealth and technology. We're richer, so we demand more safety, and it's now cheaper to provide safety because of technological innovations."
All those other factors, of course, do not make for compelling television. A fire provides better pictures. It's easier to understand the relative grimness of yesterday's factories if it's blamed on villains you can see, and the story comes to a far more satisfying ending if you imagine that a few politicians and reformers rode to the rescue. Melodrama is so much simpler than history.

HEADLINE: U.S. Thinks Iraq Is Rebuilding Ruined Military Installations

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The Pentagon's senior intelligence officer said today that Iraq had begun to rebuild military installations the United States and Britain destroyed last December and that he could not rule out the possibility that President Saddam Hussein had resumed building chemical or biological weapons.
Vice Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that American intelligence officials continue to monitor Iraq's program closely but that it was easy to hide weapons production inside legitimate commercial factories. 
 "I can't say authoritatively there is no work going on on," he said in an interview with reporters at the Pentagon today. "In fact, we assume that there is."
Admiral Wilson's assessment underscored the Clinton administration's quandary as the United Nations Security Council struggles to reach agreement on resuming international weapons inspections in Iraq more than 15 months after Mr. Hussein expelled inspectors, setting off a confrontation that culminated in air strikes last December.
In a rare interview by the top officer in the Pentagon's intelligence wing, Admiral Wilson also said China had embarked on a significant effort to modernize its military, which is the world's largest with some three million soldiers, though it is considered to be far behind the United States in technology and firepower.
Having seen American military might prevail in the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, China has begun actively seeking advanced aircraft, missiles and other weapons, he said.
"They have clearly made that an economic priority," he said.
Last week, American officials disclosed that the administration and the Pentagon had raised serious objections to Israel's decision to sell China a sophisticated, $250 million radar jet similar to American Awacs, fearing that the technology would increase China's ability to threaten Taiwan.
On Iraq, he said he knew of "no significant, precise evidence" proving Iraq's resumption of its weapons programs, which would be a violation of the cease-fire agreement that ended the gulf war.
Admiral Wilson, who visited the Persian Gulf last week, said the raids last December had set Mr. Hussein back militarily, while regular strikes by American and British jets patrolling the "no flight" zones over northern and southern Iraq since then had significantly damaged Iraqi air defenses.
But he said Mr. Hussein remained firmly in power.

HEADLINE: Year 2000 Computer Costs Estimated at $365a Person

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The government said today that the cost of repairing the Year 2000 computer problem would be $100 billion, or $365 for each man, woman and child in the United States.
For all that, the Commerce Department predicted that the effect of computer failures on the economy would be merely "something like a tangled shoelace for a world-class marathon runner." 
 In a new report, the government said the economy was sufficiently "stable, large and resilient" that failures -- even those overseas -- would not seriously affect the $9 trillion gross domestic product.
"Any glitches that pop up next year should not hurt our economic growth," Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said. "I am not going to lose any sleep."
The $100 billion figure for total repairs from 1995 through 2001 was generally in line with other estimates but is still an enormous amount.
It is roughly the same as the total spent last year by seven of the largest federal agencies and just more than the personal fortune of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates.
Robert J. Shapiro, the under secretary of commerce, said some precautions -- such as companies adjusting inventories to hedge against possible supply problems -- could affect the "pattern and timing" of economic growth. Such moves could add to growth during the last three months of 1999 but would most likely slow it during the first months of 2000 to compensate.
Mr. Shapiro also said consumers who decided to stockpile food, water or other supplies could drive up prices in the last part of this year.
Another government report, being released on Thursday, predicted only a slight risk of "serious or widespread disruptions" in the nation's food supply. Consumer hoarding and weather-related problems could cause spot shortages, but food companies have made "remarkable progress" in getting their computerized systems ready, the report said.
President Clinton's top expert on the Year 2000 problem, John Koskinen, also cautioned today that "several hundred thousand" smaller companies had not performed any repairs, apparently intending to fix problems after they occur.
Mr. Koskinen warned that business owners would find long waits for technical support and new equipment early next year, and "some of them may lose their customers and go out of business."
"We are getting close to its being too late to start," Mr. Koskinen said.

U.S. Plans to Crack Down On I.R.S. Agent Misdeeds
Urged by Congress to get tough on abuse of taxpayers, a new team of Treasury agents plans a sharp increase in investigations of I.R.S. employees for misconduct. Indeed, the number of cases expected to be opened against I.R.S. employees will soon nearly equal the number of cases of suspected of tax crimes.
The I.R.S. goal has stirred worries even within the inspector general's own staff that investigators are being forced to search for far more misdeeds than may exist. Page A1. 

Scramble for Technology Workers
Thanks to the booming technology-based economy, companies' long-standing scramble for qualified technical workers has taken on an air of desperation. A severe shortage of engineers who design hardware and software and create Web pages has led companies and their recruiters to try all sorts of tricks. A1.
 
Ethics Inquiry Sought for Rubin
A coalition of consumer and community groups has called for a government ethics investigation into former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's decision to accept employment from Citigroup, the financial services conglomerate, contending the move presents an "undeniable appearance of impropriety." Mr. Rubin said that his decision to join Citigroup was unrelated to anything he worked on while in government. C17.

Hewlett Profit Beats Estimates
After warning last month of an earnings shortfall, Hewlett-Packard posted results that beat analysts' revised estimates. Carleton S. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard in July as president and chief executive, said she was setting a goal for the year of 12 percent to 15 percent growth in revenue and earnings.

HEADLINE: Time Warner To End Gifts Of 'Soft Money'

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Time Warner announced today that it would no longer make unregulated donations to political parties, saying such "soft money" contributions distort the electoral process and sully the givers.
The company joins a handful of other corporations in swearing off contributions to the parties, but advocates of changes in campaign finance said it was too early to declare the unilateral actions a trend. 
 Time Warner, which owns Cable News Network, Warner Brothers and Time magazine, among other properties, has given roughly $1 million to the Republican and Democratic Parties in each of the last two elections.
Gerald M. Levin, the chairman at Time Warner, said much of the soft money had been used for misleading and negative advertising that cheapened the nation's political dialogue. Mr. Levin said the company would use the money instead to increase coverage of politics and to sponsor electronic town meetings to educate the voters better.
In a memorandum to employees, Mr. Levin and Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, said the company would halt its corporate giving to the parties but would continue to operate a political action committee using voluntary contributions from employees to make donations to individual candidates.
The memorandum referred to the company's "special responsibility" to provide full and fair coverage of politics, an acknowledgment that many in the newsgathering side of the company were uncomfortable with the political largess.
The situation is analogous at other major television companies that are owned by conglomerates with broad interests and big political budgets. General Electric, which owns NBC, and the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, are substantial contributors to parties and candidates. Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives virtually no money to the parties, but its political action committee contributes sizable sums to candidates.
Advocates of overhauling campaign finance applauded the Time Warner announcement, but other corporations, unions and wealthy individuals showed no sign of following the company's lead. Time Warner has not been among the biggest corporate soft-money givers -- it ranked 46th in 1997-98 with $471,000 and is 48th in the current cycle, with $155,000 so far this year. In 1997-98, Disney ranked 8th over all among corporate soft-money donors, General Electric 29th and Viacom 434th, said FEC Info, an independent group that tracks campaign expenditures.
"I think what they've done is courageous, and we hope it will be a good model for other companies around the country to follow," said Charles Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, a group of business executives who favor the elimination of soft money.
Much of the soft money is used to pay for advertisements that are not supposed to support an individual candidate. Critics say the advertisements are merely a means of circumventing spending limits imposed on candidates but not on the parties.

U.S. Investors Salivate Over Chinese Stocks In Pact's Wake

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
MAYBE it depends which side of the Pacific you're on.
In the days since China and the United States signed a deal that may lead to Chinese admission into the World Trade Organization, the Chinese stock market has made small gains, with indexes of mainland stocks up about 1 percent. Hong Kong stocks did better, with the leading index of such shares up 3.6 percent since Friday. 
 But most of the relatively small number of Chinese stocks traded on major American stock markets have risen sharply. In some cases they have gone absolutely berserk. Suddenly, any stock with China in its name seems to have willing buyers.
The biggest gains have gone to stocks that previously had been of little interest to American investors. By contrast, China Telecom (Hong Kong), which provides cellular telephone services in China and has been an institutional favorite in America, rose on Monday and Tuesday but fell $5.9375, to $86.5625, yesterday, and is up just 2 percent for the week.
But such languid performance is more than offset by other stocks that have skyrocketed. A list of nine stocks -- all traded on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq and all with the word "China" in their names -- shows increases of at least 60 percent for six of the nine since Friday. Investors who put an equal amount of money into each of the stocks on Friday -- the last trading day before the W.T.O. agreement was announced -- would have more than quadrupled their money by yesterday's close.
The most amazing move came in the shares of China Prosperity International Holdings, a company that does property renovations in China -- but that has also been talking about doing something related to the Internet.
China Prosperity was once something of a hot stock, moving as high as $37 a share in Nasdaq trading in 1996 -- adjusted for a later reverse split. But it had fallen out of investors favor, and by Monday was trading at $1 a share.
Then on Tuesday, the stock leaped to $11.06, trading as high as $14, and volume rose to 521,100 shares, or more than had traded in the previous year. That however, was just the prelude. Yesterday, volume totaled 4.4 million shares, or more than the total volume in this country since the company went public in 1995. The price leaped as high as $80, then began to slide before ending at $32.0625.
There was no announcement from the company, but the same could not be said for another suddenly highflier. China Resources Development, a distributor of natural rubber, reported that its losses were growing. It added that it had no explanation for the stock's movement in Nasdaq small-cap trading.
That stock jumped $19, to $25 a share, in trading yesterday, on volume of 906,800 shares. That volume is nearly twice the total number of shares outstanding.
Another amazing performance was turned in by the Dransfield China Paper Corporation, which rarely trades on Nasdaq. During October, there were only two days when shares in the company, which distributes paper products and is building pulp mills in China, were traded. The price then was $1 a share. It fell to 43.75 cents on Monday, and then did not trade Tuesday.
But yesterday, with anything named China looking hot, 1.3 million shares were traded -- more than triple the total volume traded since the company was listed on Nasdaq in 1997 -- and the price rose as high as $29 before closing at $12.
China.com, a company based in Hong Kong that provides a portal for Chinese users of the Internet, leaped from $58 on Friday to a close of $105 yesterday, trading as high as $137. It had gone public, at $20 a share, in July.
Even China Tire, a company that makes car and truck tires, got in on the action. Since Friday, it is up 77 percent, to $10.625.
It is not easy to explain such moves based on expectations of what will happen if China is successful in entering the World Trade Organization, something that could yet be derailed by Congressional opposition. Changes in the Chinese economy will arrive over a period of years, and the opening of the economy to competition from foreign companies may damage some Chinese businesses even as others are helped.
But there seems to have been little in the way of such analysis regarding many of the stocks that were moving yesterday. Instead, Internet chat rooms were full of comments about how certain stocks were sure to keep moving because there were relatively few shares available for trading. Traders were chasing performance, and in the process they were creating it.

The Ego Behind the Ego in a Trump Gamble

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
ROGER J. STONE has worked with Donald J. Trump for 19 years, a relationship longer than any of their marriages that is now reaching its blissful apotheosis with Mr. Stone as director of the Donald J. Trump Presidential Exploratory Committee.
Like his client, Mr. Stone is thin-skinned, with a shatter-proof ego. Adores power, and the myriad ways to grab it. Has a Sisyphean struggle with hair color. A history with the National Enquirer. 
 And an aversion to shaking hands with strangers. "For him it's a health issue, for me it's a suffer-fools-gladly thing," Mr. Stone said, during lunch at a Manhattan restaurant. "I used to watch Lee Atwater" -- once his partner -- "brown-nose people he didn't like or respect. I can't do that."
Inside the Beltway, news that the strategist behind Mr. Trump's latest gamble is Mr. Stone has been greeted with delighted groans, hisses and the occasional murmur of grudging respect.
This is, after all, the corporate and political fixer who, at 19, was an entry-level dirty trickster for Richard M. Nixon; whose 30th birthday party was given at the "21" Club by Roy Cohn; who consulted on campaigns for Ronald Reagan, George Bush and countless lesser Republicans; and who cites, among his shining moments, his successful $27 million strategy for the United States Sugar Corporation to defeat a penny-per-pound tax on sugar to help restore the Everglades.
"It was a superb program to tell the voters why not to vote for it," he fondly recalled. " 'How do you know the money will really go to the Everglades? These politicians in Tallahassee, you can't trust them.' "
Two questions about Mr. Stone.
First: Just how odd a duck is he? Answer: Very.
The balding spot apparent years ago has disappeared, and the dye job is obvious. Mr. Stone hates his natural mousy brown color. Clarification: yes, he always wears suspenders, but never red ones. "People with blond hair do not look good in red," he said. "And you shouldn't call them suspenders. It's more accurate to call them braces."
With his silver watch fob, spread-collar shirt and wide-striped double-breasted suit tailored to accentuate his bodybuilder's silhouette, Mr. Stone, a fan of Fanny Brice and Al Jolson, says he often feels like someone born in the wrong era. "I never owned a pair of blue jeans until I met my second wife," said Mr. Stone, 47.

THAT preternaturally youthful face?
He credits decades of following a regimen of Chinese herbs, breathing therapies, tai chi and acupuncture, in which he learned personality types correspond to a specific organ. Roger Stone is a kidney. He says that means he is aggressive.
For all his eccentricities, Mr. Stone is nothing if not resilient. In September 1996, soon after the lurid sex revelations about Dick Morris, the Democratic consultant, the National Enquirer wrote that Mr. Stone, then a volunteer spokesman for Senator Bob Dole, had placed ads and photographs seeking sexual partners for himself and his second wife, Nydia. Mr. Stone denied the stories, saying the ads had been placed by a former domestic helper who had stolen photographs and his checkbook. He bowed out of the Dole campaign.
Of that time, he says now, with a thin smile: "An awful lot of people left me for dead after that, but I'm still here."
Second question: just how ruthless is Mr. Stone?
Answer: The man who enjoys being known as the Prince of Darkness, really, really did not want it published that his three grandchildren -- by way of Nydia's past marriages -- call him, shucks, "Pop-pop."
A leading Republican consultant said, "Roger does have a sense of ethics, loath as he is to admit it."
That said, Mr. Stone is an exuberant negative campaigner, known for drawing journalists to seamy rumors. As a Nixon fan and a volunteer for the Committee to Re-Elect the President, he donated money to the presidential primary campaign of a Republican challenger, using the name of a left-wing group, and then mailed the receipt to a newspaper. In 1989, for local New Jersey Republicans, he designed a direct mail piece with government-style writing that said, "important tax information enclosed." It warned homeowners that their taxes had doubled, courtesy of the Democrats.
When it comes to political shrewdness, Mr. Stone was precocious. As a junior, then vice president of his northern Westchester high school, he manipulated the ouster of the president and his own succession. Running for re-election as a senior, "I left nothing to chance," he said. "I built alliances and put all my serious challengers on my ticket. Then I recruited the most unpopular guy in the school to run against me. You think that's mean? No, it's smart."
As for handling the maverick Mr. Trump, whose various business interests he has long represented, Mr. Stone is clearly having a grand, unbuttoned time of it. After Mr. Trump announced his tax-the-rich notion, "Every Wall Street economist trashed our plan," Mr. Stone said. "A conventional politician would pull his hair out, but we love it!" Attention, for better or worse, was paid.
He professes little interest in the mainstream candidates, although he keeps his four Washington Rolodexes spinning for his corporate clients. As long as Mr. Trump is in the race, Mr. Stone said, by way of understatement, "We're not going to bore anyone to death."

HEADLINE: Senator Hagel's Deceptive Bill

 BODY:
In the welter of unfinished business left behind by Congress this year, campaign finance legislation again stands out. Nevertheless, progress has been achieved. The House passed a reform measure in the summer, and 55 senators backed some form of "soft money" ban promoted by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold. Less noticed but also significant, five more Republican senators now say some controls on soft money are needed. Congress can build on these gains next year.
A presidential election year is not usually productive legislatively, but cleaning up the election fund-raising system could prove an exception to that rule. A sign of the turning tide came yesterday with the announcement by Time Warner, one of the biggest corporate donors, that it would no longer make soft-money contributions to the political parties. With its action, Time Warner joins a growing number of companies that are in open rebellion against traditional fund-raising. Through groups like the Committee for Economic Development, that rebellion has spread despite heavy-handed warnings from Senator Mitch McConnell, a leading defender of soft money. 
 Meanwhile, Senator McCain has gained in the polls by supporting a campaign finance overhaul and has promised to bring up his bill again next year. This growing support for limits on special-interest money has produced a new danger, however. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, an articulate critic of current fund-raising practices, has proposed an alternative bill to control soft money. His bill has gained some adherents, but it is fatally flawed. The danger lies in this measure's serving as an excuse for not passing genuine improvements in the campaign finance system.
The objective of reformers, embodied by the McCain-Feingold bill, has been to outlaw soft money -- the unlimited contributions by corporations, unions and rich donors to political parties that circumvent the tight limits on donations to the candidates themselves. Mr. Hagel argues that an outright ban on soft money is extreme. He wants to cap such donations to parties at $60,000 a year, raise the ceilings on regular donations to individual candidates from $1,000 to $3,000, and allow an individual aggregate of $75,000 a year to parties for all races.
These ceilings are unacceptably high. They would not end the corrupt soft-money system so much as legitimize it. The $60,000 annual cap would actually be $120,000 for each two-year cycle, translating into $240,000 for a couple, along with $300,000 for each couple for direct donations to candidates. The caps would be a step backward, legalizing donations from corporations (outlawed in 1907) and from unions (outlawed in 1947). Another loophole in Mr. Hagel's bill would allow unlimited donations to state parties for use in federal elections.
In defending his bill, Mr. Hagel argues that the McCain-Feingold measure, with its complete soft-money ban, is dead in the Senate. He says he is only trying to find a middle ground. But this is no middle ground. It is a surrender to the corrupt status quo. The tipoff is that Mr. McConnell, the Senate Republicans' chief fund-raiser, has praised Mr. Hagel's bill and announced hearings on it for next year. Surely no more hearings are needed on this issue. Mr. McConnell is simply trying to use hearings as an excuse to forestall stronger legislation.
What is actually going on is that pressure is building on wavering Republicans to break the filibuster engineered by Mr. McConnell and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to thwart the majority support in the Senate for the McCain-Feingold bill. That pressure has led George Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio, along with Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Craig Thomas of Wyoming, to back Mr. Hagel's bill, apparently hoping that their constituents will be fooled. Their anxiety is at least encouraging. Mr. Hagel can now perform a service by acknowledging the flaws in his own bill and bringing it closer to serious reform.

HEADLINE: Open Trade With Cuba

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If the United States can reach an agreement to open China's economy to foreign investors (front page, Nov. 16), surely it can reach an accord with Cuba to open its markets after 37 years of economic isolation. 
 The arguments for supporting a trade deal with Cuba and its bid to join the World Trade Organization are not very different from those asserted by the Clinton administration to support open trade and W.T.O. membership for China. As in the China deal, an agreement with Cuba would reduce tariffs on various industrial and agricultural goods and lift many barriers for American banks, insurance and telephone companies to operate there. Moreover, a deal with Cuba would lock in Cuba's commitment to economic reforms and thereby increase pressure for greater openness, more press freedom and enhanced rights for workers.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS AGREES WITH WHITE HOUSE ON SPENDING CUTS

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The White House and Republican leaders in Congress agreed on Wednesday to an across-the-board spending cut to the long-overdue federal budget, and then, after grappling all day over how to make that cut, shook hands on it this morning and made a deal.
The two sides agreed on an across-the-board budget cut of 0.38 percent, out of about $610 billion in spending for Federal agencies. Then they argued all day about how to perform that fiscal surgery, which would yield close to $1.3 billion this year. 
 Shortly before midnight on Wednesday they agreed to exclude military personnel from the cut and to give the White House the flexibility it sought on imposing the cut on the rest of the government, said Senator Pete V. Domenici the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee.
Their daylong dispute was "like when you go to buy a house, and you've agreed on the price, and all that's left is a disagreement over the color of the trim on the tool shed," said Robert Stevenson, a senior aide to Senator Domenici.
Minutes before midnight, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, said he planned to file the final spending package on the floor of the House before dawn. The White House said at 1 a.m. today that it was still reviewing the bill's fine print.
The House will meet this morning to debate it. Congress is operating under a 24-hour continuing resolution, keeping the government running without a real budget until midnight. Under expedited rules of procedure that members jokingly call "martial law," the House is expected to pass the final package, containing the last five of the year's 13 spending bills, and send it to the Senate.
Then another battle is likely in the Senate. It involves Federal price controls for dairy farmers, an issue so crucial to the combatants that they are threatening to shut down the Senate, block any final budget bill and keep Congress in session well into December.
Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, has placed a formal hold on the final spending package in an effort to protect his state's 23,000 dairy farmers from legislation favoring Northeastern milk producers.
The budget cannot pass, and Congress cannot adjourn, until he lifts that hold, because the legislation he opposes is in the final spending package that will be filed in the House, voted on and most likely passed today before going to the Senate.
Jack Lew, the White House budget director, said the dairy dispute was so dire that it raises a real risk of a government shutdown."
This looming problem dismays many members of Congress. When the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, began talking about it on the House floor Wednesday, members began to moo.
The day's war of words began when the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said President Clinton had agreed in a telephone call from Turkey to an across-the-board cut of 0.38 percent in the budget, which is now 47 days overdue. That cut was a political do-or-die issue for the Republicans, but only part of the financial solution. The final piece was agreeing on how to impose it.
The senators, representatives and White House aides coming and going through the Senate's corridors for the negotiations looked exhausted after 10 nearly nonstop days of talks.
Republican leaders were pressing hard to finish without spending more money. "If I were king, I would have their heads all cut off," the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said on Wednesday.
The White House was seeking every last new dollar it could extract from Congress before shaking hands, including $100 million for a program for disabled workers.
The Republicans needed nearly $7 billion in savings to allow them to say that their spending bills would not dip into Social Security surpluses -- a political point they have made daily, since spring, but still have not formally fulfilled.
So the White House brought nearly $7 billion to the bargaining table today, enough to cover the Republicans demands without an across-the-board cut.
Up to $3.5 billion would come from a one-time transfer from the Federal Reserve's portfolio of government securities - -- strictly bookkeeping device, since the money belongs to the government to begin with.
The rest would come from delaying government paychecks for military personnel and many civilian employees for about 48 hours, until just after 12:01 a.m. next Oct. 1, the start of the next fiscal year. This would not save any money, but simply shift more than $3.2 billion in spending into next year's budget.
Both proposals remained in the final package, along with the across-the-board cut. Both sides agreed to exclude military personnel from the cut. Then came the stumbling block: how to impose the $1.3 billion cut.
The argument was over who would control the budget-cutting scalpel, what programs could be protected and which ones could take deep cuts.
Both sides described this as an "issue of flexibility." Two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton vetoed a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut that Congress passed, almost exclusively with Republican votes, calling it a "blind and mindless" exercise.
To make such a cut seem sensible to Democrats, the White House insisted on shielding some programs and cutting others more deeply.
Shortly before midnight, they won an agreement. Senator Domenici said that its terms allowed some programs within federal agencies to be protected from the cuts; other programs could be cut by up to 15 percent to make up the difference and achieve the savings.
That helps "make it not really across the board, but driven by policy," Mr. Lew said. "With a little more room to concentrate, it becomes a tool we can manage."
An across-the-board cut was a matter of principle for the party's conservatives in the House, who wore big buttons on their lapels today saying they had "stopped the raid on Social Security."
Just as important to two Democratic senators are demands for their home states.
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia is threatening a filibuster to protect his state's coal miners from a Federal court ruling barring them from dumping in valley streams. His last-minute legislation that would stop the court ruling from taking effect for two years. The White House first supported Mr. Bryd's effort, then said it would veto any bill containing it. It appeared to be striking a noncommital stance on the issue on Wednesday.
Then there is Senator Kohl and the dairy dispute.
This year the House approved a measure that lets a system keeping the price of milk in New England artificially high to remain in place for another two years.
Mr. Kohl has placed a hold on every piece of legislation pending in the Senate, including the budget bill, to stop that measure from becoming law.
"Raw politics -- that's what originated it, and that's what keeps it going," Senator Kohl said in an interview Wednesday.
Authority for the cartel expired on Sept. 30, though a judge's order has kept the pricing mechanism in place temporarily. In September the House voted, 285 to 140, to extend the system. Then Mr. Hastert and Mr. Lott agreed this week to attach a two-year extension of the cartel to one of the final spending bills.
"The milk issue is all about economic self-interest," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said last month. Now it will be decided in the closing hours of this Congress.

HEADLINE: Need for Computer Experts Is Making Recruiters Frantic

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The managers at Vivid Studios, a Web site consulting firm here, are accustomed to calls from employment recruiters trying to poach their technical staff. But the day a suitor telephoned looking for Nevil was a new low.
Vivid's receptionist assured the recruiter that it would be difficult to put Nevil on the line. And with good reason. Nevil is a black Labrador retriever. 
 Thanks to the booming technology-based economy, companies' long-standing scramble for qualified technical workers has taken on an air of desperation lately. A severe shortage of engineers who design hardware and software and create Web pages has led companies and their recruiters to try all sorts of tricks, like the Nevil-seeking entrepreneur who called each name listed on Vivid Studio's Web site.
Recruiters are known to send e-mail to all the engineers at a company, offering to beat their existing salaries. At dawn, recruiters scour Internet job-placement services for the most recently posted resumes before a competitor makes contact. At restaurants, they pull business cards from fishbowls in which engineers had placed them hoping to get a free lunch -- not a job offer.
"I was going to a funeral recently, and a friend said, 'Don't recruit,' " said Noelle Tardieu, a recruiter who works under contract for Silicon Valley companies. Weddings, however, are another matter. Ms. Tardieu says she reads the marriage announcements in the newspaper to find names and titles of prospective recruits.
So it follows that the heavily courted engineers and other technology-trained employees are cashing in. Salaries in specific high-demand areas, like Web site programming and development, have gone up 18 to 20 percent the last year, said Eric Campbell, vice president for human relations at Docent Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., which makes software for corporate training.
"We wind up six months after we hire an engineer having to fight off offers for that same engineer for more money," he said. "It's become a very predatory environment."
One big change in recent years is the extent to which stock options have become part of the package. Fifty percent of junior technical employees now have stock options, up from 35 percent three years ago.
To seal deals, recruiters offer candidates overseas airline tickets, increase vacation time to four or five weeks from the usual two weeks for starting employees or toss in 11th-hour signing bonuses that can range from $5,000 to $20,000. Other perquisites now seem commonplace: employees can redesign offices or cubicles, bring pets to work, work at home and dress casually -- even at interviews.
Longtime recruiters and compensation experts say the scramble for talent is the most intense they have ever experienced. "It's a free-agent market and the folks out there know it," said Mark Edwards, president of iQuantic, a compensation consulting firm in San Francisco. "I haven't ever seen companies be more flexible in how they attract and retain folks."
The fervent demand for technology employees often funnels down to the recruiters, where it comes out in a spigot of offers, cajoling, creativity, relationship building and, occasionally, ambulance chasing. Indeed, when the rare layoffs do occur at a company involved in a merger or experiencing a downturn, recruiters wait in the parking lot to scoop up the discards.
"I bag 'em and tag 'em," said Sandra C. Chroman, a recruiter in Silicon Valley, adding that recruiters fight over junior techs in the parking lot.
"I joke that I keep engineers bound and gagged in my trunk and just drive around the high-tech companies and drop them off on the lawn," she said.
If only it were that easy. Ms. Chroman said she had heard all the tricks of the trade and used a few of them herself. One tactic, she said, is to walk into high-technology companies, make friends with the receptionist through small talk, explain she wants to send everyone in the company a mailer and then walk out with a company phone list.
"Receptionists will give you people's home phone numbers," Ms. Chroman said. "It's amazing what some people will give you."
But lately Ms. Chroman, like many other recruiters, is looking outside Northern California for talent, notably at companies and universities in Canada and Mexico, where engineering candidates are not in as much demand as they are here. In addition, thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, their citizens are not required to obtain visas.
Another place often visited by recruiters is cyberspace. Comfortable with technology, engineers looking for better offers post their resumes on a growing number of Internet job services, like monster.com, where recruiters in turn look for the latest talent that may be willing to switch employers. "I check it every morning at 6," said Mara Flores, a contract recruiter for Fujitsu Software, who said she also used a program called a Web crawler to search the Internet for newly posted resumes from engineers.
But if demand for engineers has been tough on companies, it has been good for the recruiting business. Well over 1,000 recruiters operate in Silicon Valley, Ms. Tardieu estimated, a number that includes freelance recruiters, recruiters who work for agencies and contractors who sign on with specific companies. Ms. Flores said it was not uncommon for an aggressive recruiter, even with only a few years experience, to earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year.
The leeway given to recruiters by their client companies varies. Some companies conduct the financial discussions themselves; in other cases, they provide some flexibility, or recruiters insist upon it -- in working out signing bonuses, for instance.
And despite some seeming cutthroat tactics, the recruiters appear to treat one another cordially, even with a sense of brotherhood. There are few stories of back stabbing. Recruiters say they rarely hear of competitors disparaging one another or using dirty tricks to steal a candidate. More often, the battle simply comes down to who can best marry a willing candidate with a job opening and enticing benefit package.
The phenomenon is not confined to Silicon Valley, with at least 350,000 openings nationwide for programmers, systems analysts and computer scientists and engineers, according to a 1998 study by Virginia Tech and the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group. Today, the association reports, one of every 10 information technology jobs remains unfilled.
"We have the same trouble in Boston, New York, Dallas and Chicago," said Mr. Campbell of Docent.
At a recent job fair in Mountain View, in the heart of Silicon Valley, Hewlett-Packard said it had hundreds of jobs available in the Bay Area and thousands worldwide. The story echoed at booth after booth of prospective employers; easels and binders full of jobs, from administrative assistant to patent lawyer, but mostly engineers. A sign at the booth of Kaiser Electronics, a military contractor, sought to lure candidates with the promise of "Every Other Friday Off."
For the candidates, the experience can be both flattering and overwhelming. Samir A. Batla, 29, worked as an engineer at Ernst & Young in San Francisco until he decided four months ago that he wanted a new job. He posted his resume on monster.com and within days had heard from 11 recruiters.
Various sales pitches ensued, and the price tag escalated. Mr. Batla expected to earn $70,000 to $80,000, but he found his sticker price soon soared to $85,000 to $100,000. He said he was offered stock option packages that could have made him a millionaire if the company went public and its stock continued to climb.
The recruiters sought to sell him on intangibles, too. Some tried to sell him on the value of working at a smaller company, others at a larger, more established office. They talked to him about the culture of the prospective workplace, and this turned out to be an important hook for Mr. Batla, who said money was only one criterion. Another was attire.
"I decided I wouldn't work at any company if I had to dress up for the interview," Mr. Batla said. Ultimately, he settled on Vivid Studios, the Web design company. "To the interview, I wore blue jeans and a collared shirt -- what do you call those, polo shirts?" he said. The people interviewing him, he said, "were wearing shorts, T-shirts and sandals -- I felt overdressed." He took the job with the title of senior engineer.
Vivid Studios, onetime home of Nevil, the Labrador retriever, also knows what it is like to lose employees. The dog's owner, Dan Lederer, 40, quit Vivid recently to pursue a quieter life with his family in Plainfield, Mass., population 550.
Mr. Lederer, a Web site designer who said he was hounded by recruiters while working at Vivid, is now freelancing and says he seems to have found a recruiter-free zone in the Berkshires. "If you don't want to be called, it's nice to be out here," he said. Still, Mr. Lederer said he would not mind hearing from a recruiter who could offer him a job with money, benefits and one other perquisite: permission to work remotely from his home on 13 secluded acres.
"With the pay and the whole scenario working out, yeah, sure," he would entertain offers, he said. These days, it might not seem so much to demand; he and Nevil may be getting more offers than they can handle.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Game Shows, Greedy and Otherwise

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
"If I won a lot of money," said the contestant on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," a forthright housewife with double chins, "I'd like to lie in a bath of melted chocolate."
Her bath would be in England, where she was a contestant on the original version of the quiz show. No one has said anything quite so refreshing on the phenomenally successful ABC version, but then sweetness and sincerity are the marks of the game's American cousin. Despite astonishing similarities to the English original, the ABC "Millionaire" also displays a connection between wholesomeness and making money that is as bedrock American as Ben Franklin. 
 As in England, a contestant can get a phone friend or the strangers in the audience to help. If he hears a question he doesn't want to answer, he can pick up his money and walk away. Competition is so soothing and benign here, it seems positively virtuous.
It took just one generation of copies to unveil the darker side of this healthy competitive spirit, though. The Fox show "Greed" is the evil twin of "Millionaire." Although in many ways it is such a slavish imitation that it practically dares the "Millionaire" creators to sue, "Greed" offers a Darwinian vision of ruthless competition. "Millionaire" reflects Americans as we wish we were; "Greed" reveals what we fear (and perhaps believe) we must be to survive. Both are close enough to reality to hit a cultural nerve, yet exaggerated enough to be escapist fun.
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has done more than reinvigorate the game show genre and ABC's fortunes. (It finishes its latest run on Wednesday, with its inevitable return date undecided.) Its impact even goes beyond the way "Final answer?" has become a catch phrase, understood and overused by almost everyone. What is most revealing is how the show's feel-good attitude has evoked a visceral response in an exceptional range of viewers, of all ages and classes.
An ABC promo shrewdly pinpoints at least part of that appeal: "They look like ordinary people; they could be your friends." The contestants do look as if they might be strolling around a mall in a white, suburban, middle-class neighborhood. They are dentists and teachers from towns with names like Cherry Hill and Falls Church. When asked what they would do with their winnings, they say they would pay off their parents' mortgages or send their children to college. And unlike Hollywood glamour-pusses, they are often in need of diets and orthodonture.
But the viewer's ability to identify with the person next door is not the deepest reason for the show's resonance. On an unconscious level, "Millionaire" creates an idealized vision of America as a society of tolerant, generous, good-willed people.
Almost all the contestants have been white men -- until Tuesday, when the show had two players, both of them women. "It's ladies night," the host, Regis Philbin, announced in anticipation on Monday, with evident relief. Even that homogeneous group of men, though, reflects a changing, inclusive America. With a matter-of-factness the sitcom "Ellen" could only have dreamed about a few years ago, one gay contestant brought a man introduced as "his partner" to root for him. When he returned for his second night on the show, he told Mr. Philbin how he had celebrated the night before: with dinner from McDonald's. It is hard to imagine a more Middle American value than that.
Another white man brought his African-American girlfriend; the camera went to her often, notably when he lost and she sweetly mouthed the words, "That's O.K."
Michael Davies, the show's executive producer, says that contestants are chosen on their ability to play the game, with no questions asked about their private lives and no attempt to balance the group by race or sex. (That must be true; surely there would have been a greater range if they had tried.) In the quiz show variation of "don't ask, don't tell," loved ones are introduced any way the contestants wish, with no one prodded to say "friend" instead of "partner," or vice versa. As Mr. Davies says, each player has a life story, and "we tell their stories." Those mini-narratives may seem like time fillers, but they give the show its "Our Town" aura.
Mr. Davies, English by birth, is in a good position to note the differences between the original show and the American adaptation. In England, people who want to become contestants are chosen at random in the first round of screening, rather than qualifying through a phone quiz as the Americans do. "In this country, lottery winners are not really respected because they never earned it," Mr. Davies says.
On the surface, the American and British shows are as similar as two Starbucks, with a mirror-image set, the same searchlights and clanging music, even the same phrases repeated by the host. "It's a good one," the English host says of a correct answer. (And we thought that was a Regis line.) But where the English host deliberately unsettles contestants, Mr. Philbin is a cheerleader. The shows' franchised sameness may reveal the global-village unity of the media age, but the differences in tone help explain the American appeal.
Part of America's diversity, of course, is the room it leaves for opposing points of view. "Do you feel the need for greed?" Chuck Woolery asks his "Greed" contestants, waving piles of cash under their noses, acting out the quiz show host as Mephistopheles. Here, if contestants choose to move ahead, climbing what is called "the Tower of Greed" toward a jackpot of $2.2 million, they must answer the question. And while a "Millionaire" contestant who reaches $32,000 will leave with nothing less, on "Greed" a wrong answer means losing everything -- except, that is, the $10,000 bonus a player can get for eliminating a competitor.
There is the essence of "Greed." The show has a team of players, but when a flashing light called "The Terminator" hits one of them, that person gets to challenge a teammate to face off on a single question. The loser leaves the game; the winner takes his money. Behind the facade of teamwork, contestants are waiting to stab each other. Turning a game show into a blood sport is not a surprise, coming from the network that has given the world "When Good Pets Go Bad." And though nothing like the phenomenon of "Millionaire," "Greed," now in its third week, has been a success for Fox.
As a spectator sport, "Greed" is a more dramatic game than "Millionaire." But it evokes uglier sentiments and brings in less conventional contestants. In a blood sport, after all, the audience needs villains as well as heroes. The less appealing players on "Greed" are not vile as in professional wrestling, but the principle is the same. Along with wholesome types like historians and librarians, its contestants have included an oversized nightclub bouncer.
The most memorable contestant has been an air traffic controller named Curtis, with a personality that veers between cocky and surly and hair that seems a cross between Edward Scissorhands and a porcupine. At the start of tonight's show (at 9) he and his two teammates return to decide whether to risk the million dollars they have won, taking a chance to double it.
Why are there such eccentrics on "Greed" and not "Millionaire"? Because on "Greed," a contestant's entertainment value counts. Bob Boden, an executive producer of the show (along with Dick Clark), explains that in an early selection round, potential contestants must pass a quiz as they do on "Millionaire." After that, they audition by playing a test game and are chosen not only on their skill but also on "looks, telegenic quality and personality," Mr. Boden says. "Our goal is to represent society with the greatest possible range."
These contestants are not model-gorgeous, either, but they are not so uniformly, wholesomely Middle American as the "Millionaire" players. And they are not so dominated by white men. (No one has a satisfactory explanation for that part of the "Millionaire" phenomenon, though the idea that men are quicker to punch in keypad answers is high on the list of desperate guesses.)
However contrived, "Greed" sends its own visceral message, similar to the chilling one Michael Douglas delivers in Oliver Stone's 1987 film, "Wall Street." As Gordon Gekko, the snaky financial genius, he proclaims, "Greed is good," justifying cutthroat competition as the foundation of American capitalism. That may seem like a pure 80's vision, but it may also be ready for a return in this healthy economy.
And game show viewers get to choose between two vicarious experiences: they can be as happily competitive as Ben Franklin or as savage as a Wall Street shark. One show offers an appealing picturesque fantasy; the other may be closer to the truth.

HEADLINE: Cooper Union Picks Physicist as First Black President

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art has appointed its first black president, a 53-year-old theoretical physicist and former research manager at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
George Campbell Jr., president and chief executive officer of a nonprofit corporation that, among other things, provides scholarships in engineering and other science-based disciplines for economically disadvantaged minority students, will become the school's 11th president in July, said Milton Glaser, the graphic artist who is vice chairman of Cooper Union's board. 
 "We're a unique school in the arts and sciences," said Mr. Glaser, who has been affiliated with the school since he graduated from it in 1950. "He seemed to be the perfect figure to reconcile art and technology, which we believe to be the top social issues of our time. He has an extraordinary interest in the arts and humanities."
Dr. Campbell's appointment to head the school comes at a time colleges and universities across the country are struggling to draw more minority students into engineering. Last year, 10 percent of students nationwide who received bachelor's degrees in engineering were African-American, Hispanic and American Indian, Dr. Campbell said.
Dr. Campbell has played an active role in tackling the problem in his work during the last 10 years at a nonprofit corporation, the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering.
During the last two decades, the organization has provided scholarships for 7,000 students, 10 percent of all minority engineering graduates, a spokeswoman for the school said.
He is a member of the Congressional Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology and a member of the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee's socioeconomic and work force panel.
Dr. Campbell, a Harlem resident, said he looked forward to the challenge of working as the school's president. For the last five years, he has served on the advisory council for the school of engineering at Cooper Union. "I'm delighted," Dr. Campbell said. "I think it's a terrific opportunity. Cooper Union is a very prestigious institution. It has been very important to the city for a very long time."
Founded in 1859 by the industrialist Peter Cooper, the college was one of the first to prohibit racial discrimination in enrollment, according to Dr. Campbell. It has about 900 students, and it occupies three buildings on the edge of the East Village.
It is one of only a handful of private American colleges offering a free education to every student.
Dr. Campbell was selected from a pool of seven applicants after a four-month search, said Richard A. Bernhard, chairman of the trustees. Dr. Campbell replaces John Jay Iselin, who stepped down in April after 10 years.
Dr. Campbell received his bachelor's degree in physics from Drexel University and his doctorate in theoretical physics from Syracuse University. After his graduate work, in theoretical high-energy physics, he joined AT&T Bell Laboratories, one of the nation's premiere research institutions.
During his 12 years at Bell Labs, Dr. Campbell worked in various research and development positions. Besides Cooper Union, he works closely with several universities, serving on advisory boards and as a trustee.
He is an avid collector of African-American paintings and sculptures and African art. For six years, he was on the board of the Crossroads Theater Company. He is married to Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. They have three children.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 14.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AMERICAN BEAUTY," starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin). 

* "AMERICAN MOVIE," featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Mr. Smith so affectingly reveals, Mr. Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle and finds Mr. Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile his own life is eloquently presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Maslin).
 
* "ANYWHERE BUT HERE," starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang (PG-13, 113 minutes). In a knowing film adaptation of Mona Simpson's widely praised, if not often wildly eventful, first novel, Ms. Sarandon is show-stopping as the 14-year-old heroine's mother and main nemesis. And Ms. Portman, who proves her mettle in a fully formed dramatic role, does a terrific job of holding her own in the film's battle of wills. Even when the material meanders, Mr. Wang supplies insightful, affectionate direction, just as he did for "The Joy Luck Club." A women's picture made with feeling and acted with great flair (Maslin).
 
* "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH," starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder workout than they got from "The Truman Show." Mr. Cusack plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Mr. Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
 
"THE BACHELOR," starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes). This crude, frantic yuppie farce stars Mr. O'Donnell as a selfish, marriage-shy bachelor who botches his proposal to his sweetheart (Ms. Zellweger) days before his grandfather dies and leaves him $100 million on the condition he marry before his 30th birthday. That gives him 27 hours either to win back his true love or find another wife. After running through his ex-girlfriends, he finds himself besieged by a horde of prospective brides chasing him through the streets of San Francisco. Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a few satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic 90's (Stephen Holden).
 
"THE BONE COLLECTOR," starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes). One of the year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but preposterous whodunit stars Mr. Washington as a quadriplegic forensic detective tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse with him by leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes. Ms. Jolie is the police officer (and former model) whom he instructs by cell phone on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the usual manipulative jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in sustaining an atmosphere of menace, and Mr. Washington's and Ms. Jolie's star chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much as a kiss (Holden).
 
* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
 
"BRINGING OUT THE DEAD," starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But Mr. Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his "Taxi Driver" days, and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more contemplative than it looks. Mr. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
 
* "DOGMA," starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout comedy is any less outrageous than that. Mr. Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Mr. Rock's and semi-repartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin).
 
* "FELICIA'S JOURNEY," starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes). In the brilliantly realized surreal thriller, adapted from William Trevor's popular novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant Irish girl searching for her boyfriend in the English midlands, is befriended by Joseph Hildritch (Mr. Hoskins), a catering manager who also happens to be a serial killer. Mr. Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, elevates this cat-and-mouse game into a film that transcends genre by entering the characters' consciousness and implying a world of half-discernible connections in which the weather, the landscape and the chance encounters of strangers suggest the sense of a grand design (Holden).
 
"HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL," starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes). If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until its feeble pulse beats no more. This is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950's William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire played by Vincent Price offered five strangers $10,000 each to spend the night in a spooky old mansion. In the new version the ante for survival has been raised to $1 million apiece. Even allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original opened, the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some things have not become devalued over the years: words like junk, for example. "Hill" was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
* "THE INSIDER," starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mr. Mann directs this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the 90's, truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa "All the President's Men." While Mr. Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for "60 Minutes," and Mr. Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Mr. Crowe movingly captures the complexity of Mr. Wigand's situation. Shaky docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on "60 Minutes." But this is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mr. Mann's stylistic brio at its best (Maslin).
 
"THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC," starring Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Tcheky Karyo and Faye Dunaway. Directed by Luc Besson (R, 130 minutes). The Hundred Years' War feels twice that long in this shrill, frenetic account of Joan of Arc. It's a film whose main revelation is that the Middle Ages may have been a lot more lurid than previously reported. Mr. Besson directs plenty of grisly, hand-held battle scenes and absurd scenes of royal scheming, while Ms. Jovovich talks. Like this. And doesn't seem faintly plausible as France's teenage martyr. Here's a case where "Don't shoot 'The Messenger' " would have been sound advice (Maslin).
 
"MUSIC OF THE HEART," starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110 minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt, no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other violin stars. Not a bad reason for Mr. Craven to have sidelined the claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
 
* "PRINCESS MONONOKE," with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
 
* "THE STRAIGHT STORY," starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Mr. Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall. And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been possible without Mr. Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its heart. Mr. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result: a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).

HEADLINE: Fed Was Anticipating a Rate Increase, October Minutes Say

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers anticipated six weeks ago that they might need to raise interest rates this week to slow the economy but decided then there was no immediate need to do so, according to the minutes of their Oct. 5 meeting, which were released today.
Members of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee thought a faster-than-expected economic revival abroad plus rising cost pressures at home had set the stage for higher inflation. But they concluded that conditions had not yet hit a danger level, the minutes said. 
 "Members saw little risk of a surge in inflation over coming months, though some pickup from the current subdued level of core price inflation was a distinct possibility," the minutes said.
Policy makers saw little risk in postponing a rate increase but "they believed that the committee probably would need to move to a less accommodative policy stance in the relatively near future, possibly at the November meeting."
Several factors troubled the policy makers as they looked ahead, including the possibility that gains in productivity might not continue to generate the increased output needed to offset higher wages and prices.
"A further pickup in productivity was by no means assured, and a number of other favorable developments in supply and prices that had acted to restrain inflation in recent years had already begun to dissipate or reverse," the October minutes said, citing increased energy and health-care costs and rising import costs as the dollar weakened.
The minutes are traditionally released after the next meeting of the open market committee. At its meeting on Tuesday, the Fed raised two key short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, a move foreshadowed by the committee's unanimous decision in October to adopt a stance toward tighter policy.
The Fed minutes said the economy had "substantial momentum" that should carry through the end of the year before slowing. But they cautioned that a faster-than-expected revival in foreign economies and rising United States exports might offset part of the anticipated slowing in domestic demand.
The policy makers were clearly uncertain in October about inflation prospects, with several of them commenting on the "surprisingly benign" behavior of prices for so long.
In any event, they feared that even if the pace of economic expansion moderated it would occur with labor markets so tight and consumer spending so strong that there was still a risk of higher inflation.

HEADLINE: No Easy Labeling

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
When it comes to some prominent economic and social issues, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops can make all but the most liberal Democrats look pale.
Last April, for example, the bishops issued a statement calling for an end to capital punishment, not least because it "is often applied unfairly and in racially biased ways." In September, they joined other religious groups in a document that called access to housing "a sacred right" and urged the government to do more to help the poor find permanent shelter. 
 But in recent annual meetings, in considering internal church issues, the bishops have often taken conservative positions, underlining their gradual shift toward the right in the 1990's, a result of two decades of appointments by Pope John Paul II. On Wednesday, for example, the bishops voted to adopt a statement of new standards for Catholic universities that would require theologians to be certified by a bishop to show they were teaching "authentic Catholic doctrine."
And in 1998, on abortion, which the bishops see as a human rights issue, they pledged themselves to challenge politicians, particularly Catholic politicians, who support abortion rights to undergo "a change of heart."
The apparent difference in directions, some prelates and authorities on the church say, can be attributed to a more conservative stance by the bishops on the internal church issues, and those have come to dominate meetings of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
In the 1980's, by contrast, the bishops' conferences were preoccupied by debate on sweeping pastoral statements about wealth and poverty in America and the nation's role in preserving world peace.
"In the 80's, we were dealing with a lot of big, spectacular issues," said Bishop Robert N. Lynch of St. Petersburg, Fla., in a news conference after the bishops' meeting ended today. In the 90's, he said, "it seems to be a lot of internal issues."
And on those issues, the bishops have felt pressure from the Vatican to follow its direction. Three years ago, for example, Rome sent back to the bishops for revision an earlier version of the higher education document, which is titled, "Ex Corde Ecclesiae," a Latin phrase meaning "From the Heart of the Church." The Vatican asked for a more legalistic approach to the relationship between the church and the university classroom.
"They're getting all kinds of instructions from the Vatican," said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America. "And they're fairly deferential to the Vatican."
Earlier this year, church authorities in Rome ordered an American priest and nun to end their longtime ministry to gay and lesbian Catholics and their families. Despite hopes expressed by some of the ministry's supporters, the bishops made no move to question the decision.
The shift toward the right is even more apparent because the conference lacks a consensus-building figure, who could unite conservatives and moderates among the bishops, as it had in Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the Chicago archbishop who died in 1996.
And among those the pope has elevated to church leadership is very likely the man the Vatican will choose as successor to Cardinal John O'Connor, who as archbishop of New York occupies the nation's most prominent and influential see.
Cardinal O'Connor did not attend the bishops' meeting this week. But his presence was felt in two letters he sent, both of which were read aloud. One expressed his support for the document on higher education.
The other bade an apparent farewell to his fellow prelates. In that one, he said it would be "the height of presumption" for him to expect that Pope John Paul II would allow him to remain in office much beyond his 80th birthday, next Jan. 15. Who might succeed him has been a matter of growing, if often private, speculation, including at the bishops' meeting.
But as a body at least, the bishops will probably continue to defy easy labeling.
Father Reese said that looking beyond their opposition to abortion and their support of state aid to parochial schools the prelates still stood "to the left" on many issues. As examples, he cited the bishops' support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was defeated recently in the Senate, and their concern for the rights and well-being of undocumented workers.
The conference's president, Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, head of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston, said the bishops were not "pulling back in any way" from addressing issues outside the church. "I think you will see us addressing more things like assisted suicide, capital punishment, sanctions against Iraq and Cuba," Bishop Fiorenza said. "We will respond to those issues out of what we believe, out of our faith."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
New Apartment Tower in Upper 90's

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Work is to begin in January on a 12-story rental building on the southeast corner of 97th Street and Lexington Avenue that will be the first of three new residential buildings that its developers plan for the immediate area.
The initial $32 million project, Carnegie Terrace, will have studio to two-bedroom apartments, with 513 to 1,050 square feet on average, in a brick structure that will rise to 6 stories along 97th Street and to 12 stories on Lexington Avenue. Eighty percent of the apartments are to be rented at market rates; the remaining 20 percent are to be leased to tenants with incomes of $14,950 to $26,700 a year, depending on family size. The building will also have 5,677 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a 150-car garage. 
 Carnegie Terrace, to be completed by May of 2001, is part of a larger plan by Navigator Realty to erect apartment buildings on two other sites it owns on Lexington Avenue between 96th and 98th Streets, both now vacant or used for parking. The plan envisions at least 385 additional apartments in two residential buildings, as well as 27,000 more square feet of stores.
"Essentially, what we are doing is building a new neighborhood," said Kinne S. Yon, who with her brother, Cornelius E. Sigety, are principals of Navigator Realty.
The plan for the three buildings in East Harlem, several residential brokers said, underscores the continued northward migration of market-rate housing into the high 90's on the Upper East Side.
Brian G. Edwards, director of leasing at the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage, said that in the last decade's construction boom, a string of high-rise residential buildings was built along Third Avenue north of 86th Street, culminating with a 522-unit mixed-income rental that opened in 1992 on the north side of 96th Street. He said that when that building, called the Monterey, was successfully leased, it showed that "people were willing to cross the perceived traditional boundary of the Upper East Side to the north side of 96th Street."
In the current development wave, he said, the activity is spilling southeast to First Avenue, where several rental buildings are rising. They include the Chesapeake, with 208 units, at 94th Street and First Avenue, and Century Tower, with 128 apartments, at 90th Street and First Avenue. With Carnegie Terrace, he said, the activity will move northwest to Lexington Avenue.
The Sigety family, which owns and operates the Florence Nightingale Health Center at Third Avenue and 97th Street, has owned the development sites between 96th and 98th Streets since the 1970's. A decade earlier, Charles Sigety, the family patriarch, who is now retired, began buying properties in the neighborhood to redevelop into nursing homes. While the elder Mr. Sigety built a pair of nursing homes, both operated under the Florence Nightingale name, on two of the properties in the mid-60's and 70's, only the one on 97th Street, constructed in 1975, remains.
In 1987, Charles Sigety, according to his son Cornelius, removed the older nursing home, on 96th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues, from the state-subsidized system and sold the building to the Related Companies, a Manhattan developer, who razed it to make way for the Monterey. Over the years, state health officials repeatedly found that the home was not meeting quality health care standards, according to the State Health Department.
With the favorable response to the Monterey, Cornelius Sigety said he and his four siblings, who took over control of the three development sites from their father, decided to build housing on them, but by the early 1990's, the housing market had flattened. It also took three years to get the sites rezoned, which he said was necessary to make the projects economically feasible. The zoning change permitted larger and taller buildings, up to 16 stories from 7, to be constructed on the sites.
Though the rezoning was granted in 1997 by the City Council and approved by Community Board 11, it drew opposition from residents and members of local housing organizations, including tenants of Charles Sigety, who over the years accused him of trying to drive them out so that he could demolish the buildings and develop the land. The older Mr. Sigety is not involved with the housing projects and is no longer part of the operation of the existing nursing home, Cornelius Sigety said.
David E. Givens, chairman of Community Board 11, said he voted against the plan because "I would rather see more moderate-income housing built, which would be more beneficial to local residents." He said his hope was that neighborhood residents would qualify for the low- and moderate-income units in Carnegie Terrace and that the other buildings would also include such units.
Henry M. Calderon, a board member who is president of the East Harlem Chamber of Commerce, takes a different view. "Having market-rate housing," he said, "will send a strong signal to the investment community that East Harlem is not just a low-income neighborhood."
For Carnegie Terrace, a so-called 80-20 project, Navigator Realty received $32.6 million in bond financing from the New York State Housing Finance Agency and is working to secure a letter of credit from the Dime Savings Bank to protect bondholders.
Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, the brokerage that is the leasing agent for Carnegie Terrace, said Carnegie Terrace, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron, will have mostly studio and one-bedroom apartments. Amenities planned at the building, which is one block from a subway stop, include a roof terrace, health club and doorman.
Though monthly rents have not yet been set, she said they would be competitive to those in comparable area buildings, which average $40 a square foot annually. That means that if leased today, the apartments would have monthly rents of about $1,800 for a studio and $3,500 for a two-bedroom unit, she said. Monthly rents for the low- and moderate-income units will be $326 to $541.
Cornelius Sigety said he would start construction on the second building, on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 97th Streets, after the first was leased.

HEADLINE: Deal to Revamp Organ Allocation Is at Risk

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
A bitter fight over whether, and how, to restructure the nation's system for distributing donated human organs has erupted in Congress, and a deal struck last week that would have cleared the way for the Clinton administration's long-planned overhaul was on the verge of falling apart today.
Under the agreement reached last week between Donna E. Shalala, secretary of health and human services, and a bipartisan group of Congressional appropriators, new federal rules governing organ allocation would take effect by late December or early January. The agreement was attached to a spending bill that is to be considered soon by Congress. 
 But in a last-minute move late Wednesday, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, inserted a provision that would counteract last week's deal into a package that includes two popular bills, one that would help disabled people get back to work and another that would extend certain tax credits. That provision would delay the effective date of the rules by three months, giving Congress enough time to return from its winter break and take action to overturn them.
The tax credit and work incentives measure passed the House tonight. So now there are two major pieces of legislation working their way through the House and Senate, each with minor amendments governing organ allocation that are diametrically opposed.
Because the differing provisions cannot be stripped out of the bills, it is possible that both could be approved; in that case, Senate staff members on both sides of the issue said, the bill signed last would take precedence. But no one today was quite certain how it would turn out.
"It's a mess," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who supports the Republican leadership and is pressing to delay the federal rules.
Mr. Torricelli is not the only member crossing party lines. As chairman of the Senate subcommittee that governs health spending, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, worked with Dr. Shalala to reach last week's agreement. Today, a very angry Mr. Specter predicted that the matter might wind up in court, and he threatened to filibuster the tax credit legislation to block the actions of his fellow Republicans.
At the same time, the action of the Republican leaders placed the Clinton administration in a ticklish position. The administration strongly supports both the tax credit and workplace bills, and Mr. Clinton is not likely to veto them to keep the organ allocation deal intact.
"Right now, we have a very serious problem," said Dan Mendelson, associate director for health at the Office of Management and Budget.
The dispute stems from a bitter political and economic feud over which patients should have priority in receiving human organs, the nation's scarcest medical resources. An estimated 62,000 Americans are waiting for a heart, lung, liver, kidney or pancreas, and last year alone, 4,000 people died waiting. But waiting times vary greatly from region to region, and in February 1998, Dr. Shalala declared the current system unfair and said she intended to overhaul it.
Dr. Shalala's proposal, twice delayed by Congress, would force organs to be shared across bigger regions, with the sickest patients getting first priority, and would also greatly increase the secretary's authority over the private network that contracts with the government to distribute donated organs. The network, the United Network for Organ Sharing, has opposed the plan.
The proposal has also touched off a fight between large and small transplant centers, with small centers insisting that Dr. Shalala's rule would put them out of business by steering organs to big-city hospitals. This accounts for why the issue does not divide along party lines; members of Congress who represent states that have big transplant centers tend to support the administration, while those who represent states with smaller centers want the current system to remain intact.
"The stakes are extremely high," Senator Torricelli said. He added: "Hospitals will close, donations of organs will be altered. This is an issue that deeply divides the Congress, and it is something that should be debated and voted upon in the Congress."

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Appears to Be Stabilizing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The trade deficit appears to be stabilizing as foreign economic growth picks up and the voracious American demand for imported goods and services slows, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday.
While the gap by which imports outpace exports widened in September, to $24.4 billion, the third biggest on record, analysts said it would have narrowed for the second consecutive month had it not been for the surging price of imported oil and an off month for exports of aircraft, which tend to occur in bunches. 
 "We've really seen some improvement" since the deficit peaked at $24.9 billion in July, said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International and a former trade official in Washington. He added that while the jump in oil prices would tend to mask this trend in coming months, the United States was well positioned to supply high-technology products to developing and newly industrialized countries that are increasingly able to afford them.
On the other hand, the deficit with China in September inched up to $6.9 billion from $6.87 billion, the biggest gap ever with any country. This provides ammunition to those in Congress who oppose the agreement reached Monday under which China is to lower barriers to American exports in return for support of its application for membership in the World Trade Organization.
Supporters, including Mr. Hormats, counter that such large imbalances show how important it is that Chinese markets be opened and that China be admitted to the world trade group, which sets the rules for international trade.
In September, the amount of what the United States bought from China was 6.3 times what it sold to China, up from 5.9 times in September 1998. Exports to China edged up just $100 million, to $1.3 billion.
The trade deficit with Japan climbed to $6.6 billion in September from $6.4 billion, with American purchases 2.5 times its sales compared with 2.1 times in the month a year earlier. Exports were virtually unchanged at $4.6 billion.
Marcus Noland, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the deficit with Japan, whose economy is still weak, would most likely expand in coming months until higher prices slow Japanese exports.
But he called trade adjustment elsewhere in Asia on track. "Those economies are pulling out of their recessions," Mr. Noland said, referring particularly to Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
Over all, American exports amounted to $81.7 billion in September, $700 million less than the record set in August. The biggest factor was a $900 million decline in capital goods, which the Commerce Department said consisted primarily of civilian aircraft. By contrast, agricultural sales, which have been depressed, rebounded to the highest level in almost two years, and consumer goods also sold better in world markets.
Imports edged up to a record $106.1 billion, $700 million more than in August, despite a $400 million decline in foreign motor vehicles and parts. This is in sharp contrast to the first nine months of the year, when automotive imports surged 22.5 percent, compared with figures in the period a year earlier.
Swamping this was a huge rise in the nation's bill for imported oil, a $6.8 billion jump reflecting higher volume as well as higher prices.
The nation's deficit with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped to a record $3 billion in September from $2.7 billion in August.
Despite the recent stabilization, the American trade deficit so far this year totals $191.6 billion, or 58 percent more than the deficit in the period a year earlier. It is on a path to reach $255 billion. While this is already a record number of dollars, the deficit in the past has represented a larger share of the American economy, a more accurate measure of its importance. In 1987, the last time the trade deficit set a record before this summer, it accounted for 3.3 percent of gross domestic product; it now represents 2.9 percent.
Yesterday's report also showed that the deficit with Western Europe shrank to $3.5 billion from $4.4 billion, while that with Canada fell to $2.9 billion from $3.3 billion. The deficit with Mexico was unchanged at $2.2 billion. Unlike the aggregate figures, comparisons with individual countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variations.

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Reggae Beat Keeps St. Lawrence Winning

BYLINE: By RON DICKER 

 BODY:
They developed their swagger in Brooklyn and their ball-handling skills on the island of Jamaica and other points south. Traveling a well-worn trail, they have now transferred their talents and aspirations to New York and points north.
The five Caribbean members of St. Lawrence University's soccer team have divined strengths from each leg of a journey that has taken them to snowy Canton, N.Y., just minutes from the Canadian border. In the process, they have transformed their sport into a big player on campus. 
 Although the Saints still play in the shadow of the school's Division I hockey team, they are casting their own shadow on Division III soccer. St. Lawrence, which has a 39-game unbeaten streak, advanced last weekend into the quarterfinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament with victories over Norwich University of Vermont and Plattsburgh State. St. Lawrence next faces Messiah College of Pennsylvania tomorrow.
In the regular season, the Saints were a perfect 17-0, having trailed in just two games, and they are bursting with Caribbean flair. They blare their theme song, "Destiny," by the Jamaican reggae artist Buju Banton, before each match. They're hoping that destiny will help them bring St. Lawrence its first national soccer championship. Last season, the Saints lost to Williams on penalty kicks in the N.C.A.A. quarterfinals.
"We don't want to be like the Atlanta Braves, doing well in the regular season and folding in the playoffs," forward Howard Beckford, a product of Canarsie High in Brooklyn and Jamaica, said this week.
This year, the Saints feel they are better-equipped to deal with postseason pressure. A big reason is their largest contingent of island-born Brooklyn players yet. Not to mention midfielder Danny Annan, a four-year starter who played at Port Richmond High on Staten Island after immigrating from Ghana in west Africa.
"The biggest thing they bring is not really from Brooklyn," Coach Bob Durocher said. "It's their technical ability. The kids are very good on the ball. You can tell they were playing all the time. They were probably playing a lot of soccer on the streets. There's a lot of spontaneity, a lot of offensive ability."
Durocher's Caribbean recruiting pipeline opened when he was approached at practice in 1991 by a visiting economics professor named Gladstone Hutchinson. A former star at Oneonta State and a native of Jamaica, Hutchinson had connections to Jamaicans and other immigrants who were outstanding soccer players and academically minded.
Most came from Brooklyn high schools and played on a club team called the Rovers. The Rovers' coaches, Donovan Dixon and Errol Phillips, screened the players, and other prospects would emerge through an annual scouting combine at St. John's.
The migration to St. Lawrence began with a St. Francis College transfer named Chris Rose, a Jamaican, who was the leader of a Saints team that went 5-8-3 in 1992. Then Andre White, a star on Jamaica's junior team, enrolled the next season and St. Lawrence finished 8-4-3, its first winning record in eight seasons.
Durocher was so encouraged that he added one Brooklyn player a year for a few years before recruiting them in bunches. Now, St. Lawrence has qualified for the postseason four straight years.
The current crop, according to Nick Hillary (Samuel Tilden High), a senior fullback, comes from poor single-parent families that moved to New York so the children would have better educational opportunities. Hillary, the second oldest of 13 children, calls his mother, Dorrette, "my right hand."
Hillary, 24, who served as a tank gunner in the cleanup operation after the Gulf War, hopes to pursue a teaching career. He is the Saints' emotional leader and enforcer. He said he has urged the team to focus on the playoffs and push the unbeaten streak into the background. "We need to play every minute like it's our last," he said.
Beckford, a junior forward, turned down Division I-A offers to play for St. Lawrence, which has no sports scholarships, although athletes can earn most or all of the $30,000 tuition through need-based and academic scholarships. Beckford said Durocher was the selling point. "He wasn't wondering whether I had 4.4 speed," said Beckford, who plans to attend law school. "He was concentrating on my academics."
Jamal Ballantyne, a sophomore forward from Brooklyn Friends and originally from the island of St. Vincent, is St. Lawrence's fastest player and has 6 goals and 6 assists. A high school teammate, the sophomore midfielder Allan Maragh, from Jamaica, is also a full-time starter. Another Jamaican, Andre Webster, a sophomore forward out of Brooklyn's South Shore High, was slowed all season by abdominal and knee injuries and has been left off the tournament roster.
The team's leading scorer with 10 goals and 5 assists is Ryan Carruth, a junior striker from Boulder, Colo. Carruth knew he would be in for a different experience at St. Lawrence when his first stop on a recruiting visit four years ago was to Andre White's house. Dreadlocks flowing down to his shoulders, White strummed a guitar to a reggae record while the two chatted about school.
Now Carruth and many of the other American-born Saints are regulars at the house shared by the current Jamaican players, especially when they are cooking curry chicken and dumplings. "They bring a creative style of soccer," Carruth said. "And as people they bring a certain charisma that adds to the chemistry."

HEADLINE: 1968 Redux: New Issues Are Hot, Value Stocks Are Not

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It's beginning to feel a lot like 1968.
Back then, the economy was barreling along, nearing the end of what was to be the longest period without a recession in American history. Individual Americans had more of their money in stocks than ever before, and the best-performing stocks were the ones that appeared to offer the worst values -- at least to those old-fashioned investors who worried about things like earnings. 
 In Washington, the government was bragging about its budget wizardry. The fiscal year that began in mid-1968 produced the first budget surplus in more than a decade.
The 1961-69 expansion will be replaced as the longest period of growth if the United States gets through the winter without a recession. Gimmicks and all, the federal budget is again in surplus. Households have more of their wealth in stocks than ever, and investors who pay attention to earnings are missing out on the best-performing stocks.
Over the last 18 months, an investor who carefully went through the stock market and chose a portfolio that was balanced among sectors and focused on the 10 percent of stocks with the lowest ratios of prices to earnings -- in other words, a value investor -- would have lost money.
But somebody who took the opposite strategy, buying only the stocks that were losing money or had the highest ratios of prices to earnings -- in other words, the kind of companies that seem overpriced to begin with -- would have a portfolio that rose 34 percent.
Those calculations come from Gina Moore, a research analyst at Aronson & Partners, a Philadelphia-based money management firm. She ran the numbers back to 1962, and reports that the only other time that value stocks trailed by so much was in the 18 months that ended in June 1968.
"It's mind-boggling," said Theodore Aronson, the firm's founder. "People are so underestimating risks." Mr. Aronson, a value investor, is not having a good year.
There are differences between now and 1968. Then inflation was rising, and the Vietnam quagmire was worsening. In the stock market, the expensive stocks that were flying high were generally smaller technology stocks with no profits but lots of hype. There are some such stocks now, most notably among Internet issues, but the most expensive stocks also include many of the big technology companies, whose financial success is clear.
But the similarities may be more significant. In 1968, the stock market had been rising, with only minor interruptions, for two decades, and the last recession, in 1961, was a distant memory. Many hot initial public offerings doubled the first day they traded. American households had a record 23.7 percent of their assets in stocks -- a figure not exceeded until 1998, when it hit 24.3 percent. (In 1978, after a brutal bear market, the figure was down to 8.5 percent.)
The lesson is that long bull markets and prolonged expansions breed complacency. In 1968, there was talk that central bankers could "fine tune" the economy to prevent recessions indefinitely. Now there is a "new paradigm" in which technological progress assures inflation-less growth.
Those who profited in 1968 were destined to suffer later, as the leading stocks of that market crumbled. The laggards of that era held up better, but virtually every stock was devastated in the 1973-74 bear market.
There is nothing visible now to stop the ascendancy of this year's market stars, and cautious voices have repeatedly been shown to be wrong as stocks they called overvalued proceeded to double and more. Just like 1968.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TURKEY: THE LOANS;
U.S. Is Reconsidering Money for Russia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton administration is quietly reassessing whether to slow two major loan programs to Moscow as the war in Chechnya accelerates and the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination call for a cutoff of aid to Russia.
In public, White House officials have said that they continue to favor modest economic support for the Yeltsin government, and that termination of the aid runs the risk of further destabilizing Russia before two major elections there. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, reiterated that position on Monday when he told reporters that despite the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, it would not "make sense for us to affect" a forthcoming loan from the International Monetary Fund, "assuming the economic and transparency criteria are met." 
 But within the administration, divisions on the question are growing; advocates of both views say there is a movement to go slow on two major loans -- one from the International Monetary Fund and another from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
"There has been a debate brewing in our government over engagement versus disengagement for a year now," one senior administration official said today. "But in recent weeks it has gotten much more intense, and there are some strong voices for disengagement."
The first issue is whether the United States should allow the International Monetary Fund to release a long-delayed payment of $640 million to keep Russia from defaulting on past monetary fund loans. The money, part of a $4.5 billion program, would actually never enter Russia; it would simply be transferred from one I.M.F. account to another.
But its delivery would take economic pressure off Russia's central bank, which officials in several departments of the administration fear could send a political message that Moscow will not have to pay a price for its continued military action in Chechnya.
Administration officials say that they are making the decision on the merits, and ignoring the political impact on Vice President Al Gore, who played a major role in the development of the administration's economic support program for Russia.
But Mr. Gore's staff appears increasingly worried about his vulnerability on the issues, especially because Gov. George W. Bush Jr. of Texas, the Republican front-runner, has said he will call for a complete cutoff of the aid to Russia in a foreign policy speech he is expected to deliver on Friday. And Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Bush's leading challenger for the nomination, has already opposed the loan while the war in Chechnya continues.
An even bigger issue is the Export-Import Bank loan, a half a billion dollars for the export of American-made oil equipment to Russia. Unlike the monetary fund loan, this money would come directly from an agency of the United States government. Again, it would not go directly to Moscow but rather to American companies supplying Russian oil companies with equipment.
Nonetheless, it would constitute the first resumption of direct American aid to Moscow in more than a year, and officials say the semi-independent Export-Import Bank has come under pressure from the administration to put the loan on "administrative hold," perhaps for a year or more.
In both instances the administration is making the case that, at the moment, the loans should be slowed for economic reasons that have nothing to do with Chechnya.
That enables it to avoid the question of whether they should seek to cut off the money as an act of political protest over the Chechnya military campaign, as they did to Indonesia during the violence in East Timor earlier this year.
In the case of the monetary fund loan, lengthy negotiations with Russia have yet to resolve some issues of "transparency" -- public explanations of how Russia is spending money and regulating its banks. The fund is insisting, for example, that Russia commit to a public audit of Sberbank, a major bank owned by the government, and make a series of amendments to its bankruptcy laws, among other demands.
"At this time Russia has not met the economic criteria," said one senior administration official deeply involved in the issue.
But asked whether Russia's behavior in Chechnya would be considered in coming weeks, the official added, "These things are always complex and there is a desire to maintain flexibility."
There are two Export-Import Bank loans pending, both of which have received preliminary approval from the bank's board of directors and were referred to Congress for a 30-day review period, now complete. The board is now free to approve the loans whenever it feels ready. But that moment still seems weeks or months away, and could be longer.
One of the deals involves $203 million in financing for the sale of equipment and services by ABB Lummus Global Inc., a Bloomfield, N. J., company, to update the Ryazan Oil Refinery near Moscow. The second is $292 million in financing for exports by Halliburton Co., of Dallas, to rehabilitate the Samotlar oil field.
The loans were controversial before the Chechnya fighting because the Russian company that will benefit, Tyumen Oil Co., is a player in a complex takeover effort that involved the bankruptcy of another oil company. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 10 percent controlled by the United States government, is a major creditor of the bankrupt company.
The takeover dispute has already reached the Russian courts; there have been charges that the bankruptcy was manipulated by Russian oligarchs. The conflict has persuaded some administration officials not to aid Tyumen.

HEADLINE: Bill Expands Health Benefits for Disabled People Who Work

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Congress and the Clinton administration said today that they had agreed on a bill expanding Medicaid and Medicare so that people with disabilities could return to work without losing their health insurance benefits.
Supporters said the legislation was the most important step by the federal government to help disabled people since passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. It was also the most significant health legislation to emerge from Congress this year, the supporters said. 
 The House of Representatives approved the compromise legislation tonight by a vote of 418 to 2, and the Senate is expected to approve it within a few days.
Under existing law, when disabled people go to work, they often lose Medicaid and Medicare. Without such coverage, they often cannot obtain the health care or medical equipment they need.
"The president is thrilled," said Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House. "He sees this as one of the most important initiatives emerging from this year's budget negotiations."
Republicans saw the bill as a way to help people who want to work and pay taxes, rather than depend on federal aid.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware and chairman of the Finance Committee, said: "No one should have to choose health care over employment. This bill will make that choice unnecessary."
Advances in medicine have allowed many people with disabilities to work. And with the unemployment rate at a 29-year low, many employers are eager to hire them. Often the jobs carry no health benefits and disabled people are unable to find or afford insurance from private companies.
Eight million disabled people of working age receive more than $50 billion a year in cash benefits from Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. Fewer than 1 percent return to work. The number of people receiving disability benefits has risen in the last decade.
The bill sailed through the House in October on a vote of 412 to 9, after a similar measure was approved by the Senate in June, 99 to 0. But the bill has been imperiled at every stage by one dispute after another, most recently by disagreements over how to pay the cost, about $800 million over five years.
The bill includes an unrelated provision that would delay federal rules to create a national system for allocating kidneys, livers and other human organs donated for transplant.
The whole package was bundled with legislation to extend expiring tax breaks, including credits for research conducted by technology and pharmaceutical companies. The package was separate from the appropriations package that Congress was also considering today.
White House officials said Mr. Clinton opposed delay of the organ distribution system and hoped to delete it, but he was not threatening to veto the underlying bill.
Under another section of the bill, states could provide Medicaid to workers who are not actually disabled, but have physical or mental impairments that are "reasonably expected" to become severe disabilities in the absence of treatment.
This could be a boon to people who have been infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but have yet to develop symptoms of the disease. Medicaid would help them get protease inhibitors and other powerful drugs so they could fight off AIDS and continue working.
The same section of the bill could help people with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and other chronic or degenerative conditions. States could also provide Medicaid to workers with potentially severe physical or mental impairments that could be traced to birth defects.
Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of New York Republican and chief sponsor of the House bill, said: "The bill sends a message to people with disabilities. If you go to work, you won't be punished, and you don't have to impoverish yourself just because you want to become a taxpayer."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and one of his aides, Connie Garner, found ways to rescue the bill when it appeared that it might sink under objections from conservative Republicans.
The legislation would help disabled people in these ways:
*People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability benefits because they return to work could keep their Medicare coverage for eight and a half years. That is four and a half years more than they get under current law.
*People with disabilities could buy Medicaid coverage even if they took jobs and earned money that would otherwise disqualify them. They could be required to pay premiums to cover some of the costs.
*States could allow disabled workers to buy Medicaid coverage, even if the workers lost eligibility for cash benefits because of improvements in their medical conditions.
The bill would establish a way of providing employment and training to people with disabilities. The government would issue a voucher, or ticket to work, that could be used by a disabled person to buy such services from either a state agency or a private business.
The cost of initiative would be offset by an assortment of cutbacks and minor changes in other programs, including the school lunch program, loans to college students and fees for lawyers who represent Social Security beneficiaries.

HEADLINE: School Board's Approval of $300,000 for a Film Angers East Orange

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Residents here expressed concern and some anger today over revelations that the school board in this financially strapped city approved spending $300,000 to help finance a film conceived by the district's superintendent as an educational tool.
While some people expressed concern about spending public education funds on a movie set in an economically depressed area and sprinkled with four-letter words and possibly objectionable sexual references, others criticized it as a misuse of resources in a district where many basic needs are unmet. They blamed the superintendent, John Howard Jr., whom some critics have termed autocratic and ineffectual in guiding the 12,000-student district. 
 The existence of the film script and the appropriation were first disclosed today in The Star-Ledger of Newark.
Chief among the critics of the appropriation for the film was the East Orange mayor, Robert L. Bowser, who questioned "the purpose of the content and the subject matter" of the film, adding, "Simply put, this filmmaking project is just inappropriate, particularly in light of the fact that I believe the funds could have been put to better use to address pressing issues facing our children concerning the mastery of the basics." The district has a $139 million annual budget.
Mr. Howard declined to comment on the dispute and said through a spokesman that he would speak about it "at the appropriate time."
Repeated attempts to reach members of the city's school board, who approved the $300,000 expenditure, and to determine what exactly it was to be used for, were unsuccessful.
The Rev. Dwight Gill, pastor of New Hope Baptist Church here and a frequent critic of the school system and of Mr. Howard, said that he and others would call for the superintendent's resignation over the incident. Although he conceded that he had not read the film script, he said it was an example of the "self-centered, egotistical style" of the superintendent.
"All of this seems to be about Dr. Howard's dreams rather than the school district's needs," Mr. Gill said. "The schools are in terrible physical condition, the test scores are not improving and the administration is top-heavy."
The title page of the script for the movie, "Dragonfly," reads, "Story by Dr. John Howard. Written by the East Orange Film Cooperative." A reading of the script shows it to be an uplifting amalgam of "West Side Story," the television show "Fame" and the recent film "The Substitute." It is set in a fictional East High School in a four-square-mile city identical in size to East Orange, where Haitian-American gangs and gangs of native-born American blacks are at each other's throats, in a rivalry not entirely unlike the real-life tensions in East Orange.
The plot pits a cynical white teacher who plays to and exploits the students' worst impulses and tenuous social situations against a benevolent black teacher who tries to lift them above their circumstances and bring out their talents for dance, music or computers. The script's earnest tone is punctuated by a dialogue that sometimes uses expletives as it seeks to mimic the slang and speech of the high school setting.
As with most disputes in East Orange, the current one owes some of its vehemence to longstanding political rivalries in the city of 78,000. Mr. Howard and the majority of the school board date to the administration of the former mayor, Cardell Cooper, now a top official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Bowser is a longtime political opponent of Mr. Cooper and, since winning the mayor's office two years ago, he has been quick to highlight problems in the city that he believes are the legacy of the previous administration.

HEADLINE: New Digital Cameras Poised To Jolt Worldof Filmmaking

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 18

 BODY:
A digital video camera was perched like a bazooka on the shoulder of the director Mike Figgis as he carved a path through the oblivious pedestrians on Sunset Strip, following the actor Stellan Skarsgard into a swanky glass-faced office. At the same moment, not far away, three other digital cameras were following other actors as they made their way down the sidewalk, chatted on cell phones or bickered at curbside, the real world swirling all around them.
Whatever this film in progress might add up to artistically, Mr. Figgis, the British director best known for the Oscar-winning "Leaving Las Vegas," is at the very least extraordinarily ambitious, some might say audacious, about exploiting the digital technologies that are beginning to seep into the Hollywood mainstream. 
 For years digital moviemaking has been a grass-roots movement among aspiring filmmakers who resented the dominance of the Hollywood aesthetic. Mr. Figgis's film, "Time Code 2000," brings the new technology inside the walls of the major studios -- in this case those of Sony Pictures, which, not coincidentally, is owned by a company that also manufactures digital equipment. Once inside the walls, many believe, digital moviemaking will have a major impact on the way movies are made and how people view them.
"Time Code 2000" is being shot in real time; that is, as one continuous take, without editing, that lasts a predetermined 93 minutes. The four cameras dance across a half dozen sets and down city streets with a breathtaking seamlessness, following the film's characters in and out of meetings, assignations and confrontations.
Mr. Figgis thought of doing the film just a few months ago, and he said the digital technology would require only four to six weeks of postproduction work instead of the typical several months, time spent mostly fussing with the sound mix. The film potentially could be available for theatrical release before the end of the year. When it appears in theaters, he said, the images from all four cameras will be shown simultaneously, either in horizontal strips with four images shown from left to right or stacked two-atop-two, allowing audience members to edit the film in their own heads as they switch attention from one image to another and try to follow the plot.
Despite many predictions that digital technology will transform the industry, its potential influence is still far from certain. For one thing, many filmmakers are extremely resistant to using digital video because of the flat, bland image that videotape often produces, particularly in comparison to the richer images recorded by film.
The cost of converting to digital projection systems is also formidable -- $100,000 per projector multiplied by the more than 34,000 screens in the United States alone -- and theater owners and studios have very different ideas about who should pay the tab. Meanwhile, even the adventurous Mr. Figgis must transfer his digital tape to old-fashioned film so it can be projected by the machines now in place.
Nevertheless, digital proponents remain exultant. "It's a revolution," said Rodger Raderman, chairman of iFilm, a San Francisco-based company that distributes digital films on the Internet. "And I believe it's coming faster than most people think."
Documentary filmmakers, in particular, have been at the forefront, driven by economic necessity and a lack of interest from the entertainment industry in financing their projects.
Such respected directors as Penelope Spheeris and Spike Jonze have done work in digital video, and earlier this month New Line Cinema announced that it had signed a deal with Spike Lee to make "Bamboozled," a movie entirely on digital video.
When digital filmmaking's full potential is reached, a growing number of people in the industry believe, it might even threaten a studio power structure that has held firm since the advent of sound and has absorbed such technological challenges as television and VCR's.
"It is beyond imagination what this is going to do to filmmaking," said Mr. Figgis, whose roots are in music, theater and experimental film. "What has been an exclusive medium of high finance, banking and financial exclusivity is now going to become something that is within the reach of everyone."
The theory is that even the most modestly financed filmmaker could afford to shoot a movie and transmit it to theaters digitally at little expense.
This revolution, if that's what it is, is being driven by the convergence of several technologies: relatively inexpensive digital video cameras, only now becoming widely available; digital projectors that eliminate the need for film; and the growing ability of the Internet and other information pipelines to transmit digital sounds and images to multiplexes, living rooms and computer screens without reliance on a studio's expensive production and distribution services.
It may even become possible to distribute and market those films effectively on the Internet if the example of this summer's "Blair Witch Project," a cheaply made horror film that became a huge hit after a shrewd marketing campaign that exploited the World Wide Web, is a guidepost to the future.
"The whole economics of the business are basically turned upside down by digital technology," said Bruce Apar, editor in chief of Video Business, a magazine published by Variety. "It will change the movie industry, absolutely."
Emerging technologies may push change even further. Some will allow filmmakers to bypass not only film, but also digital tape, making it possible to shoot onto digital sticks, which resemble credit cards, and computer disks, both of which break down images into binary code. The images can be downloaded to a computer and transmitted the same way that any other computer file is transmitted. They can be edited on the computer screen, extraordinary effects can be added, and the resulting movie can be sent by modem or satellite to any place in the world. Then theater owners can download the movies and project them onto a screen with the new generation of digital projectors.
The financial savings can be considerable even with available digital equipment. Digital cameras cost a small fraction of what film cameras cost, and prices are plummeting. New software allows anyone to edit film on a home computer. There are no costs for developing film, no need for reels of celluloid. Instead of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to make copies of a movie, producers could make as many copies as necessary at the click of a mouse.
Mr. Figgis illustrated, picking up a small, hand-held camera that was resting on a nearby chair. "See this? It's a new, state-of-the-art digital camera. Costs about $3,000," he said. "I'd be using it on this movie except the tapes are only an hour long and I need two hours."
"Time Code 2000" is being made on a budget "in the low millions," Mr. Figgis said, about 5 percent of the $60 million that is spent on the average major studio production. Most of his budget is going to pay the union wages of those working on the film and for the handful of sets he is using.
"If I were some young filmmaker in Ohio or someplace," Mr. Figgis said, "and I could use friends and shoot on found locations instead of on sets, this movie, this very same movie, could be made for about $100,000."
Mr. Figgis's film looks little like the slick, visually sumptuous films that Hollywood studios regularly produce. It is rapid, jerky and definitely ragged around the edges, but Mr. Figgis believes that moviegoers who accepted "Blair Witch," which had many of the same qualities, will accept his film, too.
The emergence of the new technology is most visible on the proliferation of Internet sites devoted to digital films (even the major studios have begun to get involved in this) and in the growth of the microcinema movement, in which digital filmmakers exhibit their work in cities around the country.
The attraction to filmmakers is only partly economic. It is also artistic. Digital video makes filmmakers more mobile, better able to shoot scenes without cocooning themselves in studios or at on-site locations, and freer to move through the bustle of real city streets, even interacting with real people. For most of the century filmmakers have been restricted to shots of no longer than 10 minutes, a length limited by the size of film magazines. (A 20-minute magazine has recently become available.) Digital cameras, however, can shoot and shoot and shoot.
Studio executives, who acknowledge that the technology will change their business, are not so sure that it will make them as irrelevant as some filmmakers might hope. Studios, they argue, will still be the marketplace where creative ferment produces the best stories. And it will still be the studios -- and the surrounding world of agents and producers -- that will retain control of the copyrighted characters (think "Batman") and the top-name actors who will be needed to make a movie, even a digital movie, rise above the expected glut.
By the time production on "Time Code 2000" ends on Friday, Mr. Figgis will have shot the film more than seven times. Then he will choose the version he considers best.
If his project feels a bit like a stunt, Mr. Figgis does not disagree, though he prefers the term "performance art." His movie is intended, in part, to draw attention to the possibilities created by digital technology.
"My hope is to have the film released, at least in a couple of theaters, before the end of the year," he said. Columbia Pictures has not decided whether it will release the film late this year or early next year. What is telling, though, is that it is possible to release a film so quickly.
"I think," Mr. Figgis said, "it would be nice to have this look at the cinema of the next century come out in the last week of this century."

Pursuit of Stock Wealth Brings a World of Swindlers
Along with the greatest bull market in American history comes a world of low-priced stocks and high-priced dreams, of grimy offices and sham companies, of swindlers who bilk Americans out of roughly $2 billion a year, securities regulators say. The problem is so severe that regulators and prosecutors have made it one of their chief goals to crack down on what they used to dismiss as "penny-stock fraud." 
 It was in this world that Albert Alain Chalem and Maier Lehmann lived -- and died. The men, who were promoting stocks over the Internet together, were both shot in the head on Oct. 25 and left to die on the marble floor in the $1.1 million home in Colts Neck, N.J., where Mr. Chalem lived.

YELTSIN AND WEST CLASH AT SUMMIT OVER CHECHEN WAR

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 18

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin and the West squared off over Chechnya today, as the Russian leader told a European summit meeting that the West had no right to criticize Russia for its campaign against "bandits and murderers."
But President Clinton insisted that the West was only trying to do for Chechnya's civilians what it would have done for Mr. Yeltsin himself when he was on the barricades: defend their rights against the abusive authorities. Excerpts from their speeches, Page A21. 
 Seldom since the end of the cold war has Russia appeared so isolated on the world stage as one by one, Western leaders at the meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe declared that Russia's indiscriminate bombardment of Chechnya was needlessly killing and wounding its own citizens.
Mr. Yeltsin, looking unusually hale and combative, mocked the idea that the plight of civilians justified Western meddling in Russian affairs. He branded the calls for peace talks as hopelessly naive.
But unlike the sharp human rights debates of Soviet times, the criticism of Moscow today was more in sorrow than in anger, as Western officials lectured Russia that its treatment of civilians in Chechnya fell below civilized norms.
In surprisingly personal remarks, Mr. Clinton sought to justify the West's intercession over Chechnya by recalling how Mr. Yeltsin clambered onto a tank to prevent an assault on his government headquarters by hard-line Communists during the final days of the Soviet Union.
"President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my life as a citizen of the world, before I become president, was when you stood up on that tank in Moscow when they tried to take the freedom of the Russian people away," Mr. Clinton said. "If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president, I would have hoped that every leader of every country around this table would have stood up for you, and not said, 'Well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part of.' "
Mr. Yeltsin listened attentively to Mr. Clinton and later gave him a bear hug. Still, there was no sign that the Russian had been persuaded.
While Mr. Clinton and other leaders argued that moral considerations sometimes justified intervention in another nation's affairs -- military action in the case of Kosovo and public criticism in case of Chechnya -- Mr. Yeltsin ridiculed the notion as "humanitarian interference."
"You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya," Mr. Yeltsin said at the 54-nation meeting. "There will be no negotiations with bandits and murderers."
Behind the public fireworks, the Russians also pressed privately to deflect the West's criticism of their Chechnya policy.
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov gave American officials a diplomatic paper that hinted Russia would drop some of its objections to American policy toward Iraq if Washington offered a private assurance that the issue of Chechnya would not be brought before the United Nations Security Council.
A small measure of agreement was reached when Russia agreed to allow a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to visit Chechnya. That was less than the mediation role that some Western governments had sought for the organization.
But Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, "I think we got a good foot in the door."
With parliamentary elections only a month away in Russia, domestic politics appeared to be a significant factor in the fiery tone of Mr. Yeltsin's speech. The president and other Russian politicians have discovered that a hard-nosed policy toward Chechnya and open defiance of the West is very popular with Russians.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party, is one of the few major Russian politicians who have even broached the idea of negotiating with the Chechens, and for that he has branded a virtual traitor by some capitalist reformers.
Even though the fighting has resulted in more than 200,000 refugees, many of them ethnic Russians, many Russians seem to think this is an acceptable price to hunt down the Islamic militants who invaded Dagestan last summer and who are generally blamed for a spate of terror bombings in Moscow and other cities that have killed nearly 300 people. The Chechen guerrilla leaders accused of the attacks deny the charge.
The antipathy many Russians harbor toward people from the Caucasus has further tempered their sympathy for the Chechen refugees. Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations, has also sought to defuse the talk of a humanitarian crisis in Chechnya by asserting that the main fighting would be over by Feb. 1, and that the 200,000 refugees could then return.
Then there is the determination of the Russian military to avenge its defeat in the 1994-96 Chechen war, and not only to subdue Chechnya, but to also send a message to the region that Russia is still a power to be reckoned with.
The Russian annoyance with the West has been further fanned by a host of other disputes, including the Clinton administration's interest in pressing ahead with an antimissile defense and its position on oil pipelines in former Soviet areas.
Today, for instance, Mr. Clinton watched approvingly as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia signed an agreement to build a pipeline that would channel oil from the Caspian Sea to international markets without passing through Russian or Iranian territory, dealing another blow to Russian influence in the region.
The dispute over Chechnya delayed the signing of a new Charter on European Security, which was to have been concluded today.
In criticizing the Russian policy, Western officials sought to make clear that they agreed that they were not challenging the Kremlin's right to use military force to put an end to terrorism and to prevent the nation from fracturing.
The problem, they said, lay in the way Russia was pursuing that goal -- indiscriminate rocket attacks and bombings that have taken a heavy civilian toll and have fostered a new generation of embittered and revenge-minded Chechens.
"We are all determined to fight terrorism," said Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. "But the force we use to fight it should always be proportional, and focused on the actual terrorists. We cannot and must not fight them by using their own methods, by inflicting indiscriminate violence and terror on innocent civilians."
Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, added, "War is no way to eliminate terrorism."
As much as such comments irritated the Russians, they fell short of what some Western critics, like former United States national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, have urged: the cutoff or Western credits and assistance.
But in Washington, some officials now say the administration has begun to reassess its modest economic support for the Yeltsin government, and is considering going slow on two large loans, one of them from the International Monetary Fund.
During the first Chechen war, Mr. Clinton and other Western leaders were slow to criticize Russia. Mr. Clinton, in fact, even likened Mr. Yeltsin then to Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, while Vice President Al Gore initially insisted that Chechnya was an internal Russian affair, echoing Moscow's current position.
In part, today's comments by Western officials appeared intended to persuade their own publics that they are not ignoring the matter.
Mr. Clinton's comments were among the most persuasive, a number of people who gathered here for the meeting said. White House officials said Mr. Clinton rewrote the remarks as the meeting began to mention Mr. Yeltsin on the tank.
As filtered through the Russia media, however, Mr. Clinton's argument may have become lost or distorted. The state-owned ORT television network presented Mr. Clinton's comments as an indication that he was impressed by Mr. Yeltsin's moral character and had been won over by the strength of the Russian president's address.
President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia sized up the problem before the meeting. "It is not easy to influence Russia," he said.

HEADLINE: Mistrustful of U.S., Egyptians Are Bitter About Crash Inquiry

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 18

 BODY:
As the inquiry into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 moves into a delicate new phase, Egyptian and American officials face high stakes in trying to find conclusive and satisfactory answers to questions about what brought the plane crashing into the ocean late last month.
For the Egyptian government, the results of the investigation could affect both national pride and the fortunes of the country's tourism industry, one of its economic lifelines. In a sign of how volatile the issue of the inquiry has become, conspiracy theories are now circulating wildly in Egypt, troubling both American and Egyptian officials. 
 Some have blamed Israel's intelligence service for the crash; others have suggested that the American investigators are covering for the plane's manufacturer. And as unlikely as the theories might seem, they have been embraced here more easily than the very different hypothesis put forward by American investigators: that the aircraft and all 217 people aboard might have been brought down by a suicidal Egyptian pilot.
The response by the Egyptian public and government to that suggestion has been so bitter that some say it is unclear whether the Egyptian government will ever cooperate fully with the kind of exhaustive criminal inquiry that is the next step favored by many American investigators.
"Even if they are persuaded that there is reason to suspect this pilot, I wonder whether Egypt will feel comfortable allowing an F.B.I. team to come to Egypt and begin asking questions at will," said a Western diplomat here.
Already, an Egyptian challenge to the working American theory has delayed any decision to shift responsibility for the case to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. American and Egyptian officials in Washington are reviewing the evidence that has been gathered by accident investigators from the National Transportation Board in hope of reaching a joint decision on how to go forward.
Egyptian experts are expected to help interpret voice recordings from the cockpit, while diplomats from the United States and Egypt will try hard to present a picture of partnership. Only with the permission of the Egyptian government could American investigators begin any kind of criminal inquiry here into the background of Gamil al-Batouti, 59, the reserve pilot who the Americans think might have been responsible for the crash on Oct. 31.
But the Egyptian government is likely to listen closely to the anger being voiced by ordinary Egyptians, who say the pilot sabotage hypothesis is little more than the product of an overactive American imagination.
"The Americans are trying to harm Egypt's reputation by any means," said Mohammed Sami, 62, a retired executive of the Egyptian railway authority. "They just want to take every small thing and turn it into a very big complicated thing that backfires against Egypt."
The United States and Egypt are close allies, and both have good reason for wanting to defuse any dispute or tension. Egypt receives more than $2 billion a year in assistance from the United States, making it the second-largest recipient of American aid, behind Israel. The United States relies heavily on Egypt as a mediator in peace talks and as a potential staging area for troops in the event of renewed conflict in the region.
In Washington, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, insisted at a briefing today that the United States and Egypt had been "working very, very closely together at all levels in the investigation."
"Our long and close friendship will not be harmed because we have confidence that the Egyptian government, like the United States government, wants to get to the bottom of this," Mr. Rubin said.
But in Turkey today, Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, amplified his government's reluctance to accept the American theory that the plane had been brought down by pilot sabotage. So far, the foreign minister said, it is too early to label the crash anything but a technical failure.
"You can't jump to conclusions from someone quoting the Koran and say that this was more than an accident," Mr. Moussa said.
Mr. Moussa's reference was to a phrase, translated as "I put my trust in God," that Mr. Batouti, then sitting at the controls of the aircraft, was heard to have uttered at the start of events that led to the crash. The American investigators at least initially thought Mr. Batouti's use of the phrase was an indication that he might have been preparing for death.
But Egyptian officials have scoffed at that notion, saying that if anything, Mr. Batouti's language might be a sign that he had encountered some kind of emergency in the cabin. In a new response to the American theory, EgyptAir today dispatched a team of medical and technical experts to the United States, and officials said they would seek to address what Mr. Batouti's former colleagues have called the unfounded accusations against him.
Since the crash, Egypt has allowed the United States to assume primary responsibility for the investigation into the cause. But under international agreements, it could reassert its authority over the investigation at any time, experts here say.
There has been no indication that Egypt might take such a step. But in an implicit warning, Al Akhbar, the semi-official Egyptian daily, complained in an editorial today that the publicity given in the United States to the theory of pilot sabotage "indicates that there is an intention to rule out any American responsibility for this tragic accident."
On Wednesday, Louis B. Freeh, director of the F.B.I., said that if Egypt did assert primacy in the case, the United States would carry out its own investigation, but he acknowledged that such an inquiry could not extend to Egypt without permission from the Egyptian authorities.
Along with its stated aversion to a rush to judgment, the Egyptian government has solid practical reasons for at least wishing that the American inquiry would shift away from a finding of pilot misconduct.
Any conclusion that an EgyptAir pilot was responsible for the crash could subject the state-run airline to heavy liability claims. And an adverse ruling would almost certainly rebound against Egypt's tourism industry, which has only now recovered from the setback caused by the 1997 killings of 58 foreign tourists during an attack in Luxor.
At the same time, the suspicion and bitterness with which many Egyptians have responded to the American theory reflect a view that runs deep here: that the United States and other Western powers, for all their declarations of partnership, do not have Egypt's best interests at heart.
Those sentiments could be heard today in conversations around the capital, as Egyptians spoke with near unanimity in rejecting the American version of events.
"They're looking for a scapegoat," said Issam Abdel Moneim, 58, an accountant.
"They want to escape responsibility," said Amr Abdel Kalik, 21, a student.
"They are not neutral," said Manal Ali, 30, a secretary.

HEADLINE: Chechnya and the West

 BODY:
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia growled this week at Western leaders meeting in Turkey that they had no right to criticize his nation's war against "bandits and murderers" in Chechnya. On this point, the Russian president is simply wrong. Mr. Yeltsin and his allies in Moscow need to listen to warnings by those leaders who tried during the European security conference in Istanbul to explain that using bombs and tanks would not work, militarily or diplomatically, to oust Chechen terrorists.
President Jacques Chirac of France, for example, said this war to combat terrorism was "a tragic error" that was taking too many innocent lives in the breakaway republic. President Clinton, who had compared the earlier Chechen war, from 1994 to '96, to the United States' Civil War, this time tried another tack. 
 Mr. Clinton reminded Mr. Yeltsin about the beneficial side of meddling by outsiders. He noted that the West had rallied to Mr. Yeltsin in August 1991 as hard-liners tried to take over the government and the Yeltsin forces were in the streets of Moscow. "If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president," Mr. Clinton told the Russian leader, "I would have hoped that every leader of every country around this table would have stood up for you and not said, 'Well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part of.' "
Whether it was the tougher words of the Europeans, the more understanding tone of Mr. Clinton or other unrevealed factors in the Istanbul meeting, the Russians did agree to allow the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to visit Chechnya and help seek a political resolution to the conflict. That, at least, is good news. It means that the leaders meeting in Turkey will have both a political and humanitarian role in the region. But Chechnya is still a raw battlefield that Russian leaders are using to rally political support at home even as criticism mounts abroad.
While Russia's need to pursue terrorism is understandable, Mr. Yeltsin and his government should take note of Gov. George W. Bush and those in the Clinton administration who want to take a harsher line against Russia. Mr. Bush has suggested cutting off aid until Russia stops killing Chechen civilians. Such threats, aimed more at the American voters than at the international arena, sound better on the campaign trail than they would as policy. Aid to Russia is in America's own interest -- not only to provide help in dismantling Russia's nuclear weapons but also to foster economic and civic stability in an emerging democracy.
The Russians, however, must realize that good will in the West and especially in America is in their interest as well. The stream of refugees from Chechnya and the bombings in downtown Grozny are images the American people care about. In the long run, these cruelties add to American doubts, not simply about Chechnya but about the willingness of Russia's leaders to move away from the brutal methods of the past.

HEADLINE: A New Front in the PCB War

 BODY:
New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who has been suing big corporations right and left recently, has now charged General Electric with impeding navigation along a stretch of the Hudson River and thus preventing the river from reaching its full potential as a commercial and recreational waterway. The suit represents a novel attempt to speed a resolution of the 25-year controversy over PCB contamination in the Hudson. If successful, the suit may also establish a precedent for claims against other companies whose activities can be shown to have restricted economic development along New York's waterways.
But the furor surrounding Mr. Spitzer's announcement inflates its immediate importance. The real battle is still the struggle between the company and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which will decide late next year whether to require G.E. to undertake an expensive dredging operation to rid several contaminated "hot spots" in the river of PCB's. G.E. has never denied responsibility for the chemicals, which were discharged from two now-defunct plants north of Albany years ago. The E.P.A. regards PCB's -- polychlorinated biphenyls -- as a health risk to wildlife and to people who regularly eat fish caught in the upper Hudson. PCB's are also among the biggest remaining obstacles to the ecological recovery of the river. 
 Mr. Spitzer's suit does not address environmental or health risks. Instead it argues that the costs associated with removing and storing toxic sediments are so high that the state has been unable to dredge the Champlain Canal, an important navigable waterway that stretches from Lake Champlain to Waterford, about 30 miles south of the old G.E. plants. As a result, Mr. Spitzer asserts, economic activity has suffered. His suit seeks to force G.E. to pay the extra costs of dredging the PCB's, a sum that could be at least $10 million. At his news conference, Mr. Spitzer openly invited other communities up and down the Hudson to bring similar actions if his strategy turns out to be successful. His hope is to achieve what one of his associates called a "critical mass" of lawsuits that will force G.E. to undertake widespread dredging, whatever the outcome of the E.P.A. investigation.
G.E., which called the suit absurd, was not alone in questioning Mr. Spitzer's approach. There was much confusion over whether the canal actually needed dredging, with the New York State Canal Corporation saying no and several local officials saying yes. The Canal Corporation, a division of the state Thruway Authority, controls 524 miles of canals. It would presumably have to put up part of the money if a judge rules in favor of dredging the canal.
Meanwhile, John Cahill, Gov. George Pataki's environmental chief, warned that the depositions and other requirements associated with the suit would siphon valuable resources from the environmental agency's study and from a state investigation. The Pataki camp, unduly sensitive to any challenge to the governor's claim to be the state's top environmentalist, is clearly annoyed by Mr. Spitzer's intervention. Compared with the E.P.A.'s investigation of health and ecological damage along the entire river, Mr. Spitzer's suit seems too narrow to get the job done. But the war to rid the Hudson of PCB's is an important one, and Mr. Spitzer has every right to join it.

HEADLINE: Congress on Record Course for 'Pork,' With Alaska in a Class of Its Own

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
It was a throw-away line on NBC's "West Wing," biting in its indictment of an inventive, sometimes outlandish bid by Congress to spend taxpayer money. There, amid a list of appropriations requests recited by a fictional White House aide, was a gem: $2 million to monitor Alaskan skies for volcanic ash.
"There are volcanos in Alaska?" a "West Wing" aide asked, smirking. 
 Cue laughter and eye-rolling.
But in the chandelier-studded offices of Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee controls billions of dollars, the joke was not funny. That is because the item was not a made-up bit of drama, something writers of the series knew when they used it. It was a genuine Stevens request and a sparkling example of the senator's mastery at steering copious amounts of money to his home state.
In fact, Mr. Stevens has gotten so good at sending taxpayers' money Alaska's way that he is threatening to outdo even the legendary Senator Robert C. Byrd in that department, a man whose name adorns many a highway and building in his home state, West Virginia.
"They laughed hysterically about that: $2 million to track volcanic ash in Alaska," said Connie Godwin, Senator Stevens' press secretary. "They would be lucky about the $2 million if they were on that KLM plane 10 years ago that dropped thousands of feet because of the ash it sucked in."
Bolstered by a fat economy and a budget surplus, this year promises to set new records in Congress when it comes to funneling taxpayer money to projects like counting walruses and fixing Y.M.C.A. swimming pools. Detractors call it pork, but those who benefit call it filet mignon.
"This is the greatest pork barbecue of all time, and unfortunately, at this barbecue, it's the taxpayers who are getting cooked," said Jim Campi, a spokesman for Citizens Against Government Waste, an organization dedicated to eliminating pork, or the billions of dollars routed to projects back home that are not requested by the White House or reviewed by a Congressional committee. The organizations will be busy tallying all the special projects in all the final spending bills over the weeks to come, but right now, Congress is primed to surpass last year's numbers easily, Mr. Campi said.
So far, the pork estimate in 7 of the 13 spending bills for the 2000 fiscal year is $14.65 billion, Mr. Campi said, while the record for pet projects, set in 1997, was a total of $14.5 billion. And this under a Republican regime devoted to less government.
For Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is seeking the presidential nomination and has made pork-busting a mission, this increase in pet projects ranks among his greatest disappointments. He calls it an evil linked to special-interest groups. "I can't judge the projects on their merits," Mr. McCain said. "I can judge the fact that the entire legislative process has been turned on its head."
In the tussle for pet-project money, known as earmarks, few lawmakers hold greater sway than the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the panel that divides billions of dollars to keep the military churning, farmers afloat, research institutions financed and highways built.
For Mr. Stevens, the 76-year-old veteran of three decades in the Senate, what is remarkable is not so much that he carves out millions of dollars for projects in his state, with the help of the other two members of the Alaskan delegation, Senator Frank H. Murkowski and Representative Don Young, who are also Republicans. It is that he manages to do so despite the fact that his home state has about the same number of people as Milwaukee, 614,000.
In some places in rural Alaska, townspeople are so appreciative that they call the dollars "Stevens money."
"He has been able to master the art of putting his state first in line, even though it was the last to join the union," said Marshall Wittmann, director of Congressional relations for the conservative research group, the Heritage Foundation. "This was the art of Byrd: take an underpopulated rural state and just pour in millions upon millions of federal money."
Mr. Wittmann added, "The joke was that the federal government was going to move to Martinsburg, West Virginia, and now there is a danger it will move to Anchorage."
Last year, Alaska received more money through earmarks per person -- $273 -- than any other state, according to Citizens Against Government Waste. Hawaii came in second, at $155. The national average was $19. Mississippi led in earmarked money in 1998, thanks to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
This coming year could be a tossup between the two states, considering the $375 million that Mr. Lott wrangled to begin building a $1.5 billion Navy ship that the Pentagon never requested.
Senator McCain said Mr. Stevens was gung-ho about pet projects "because he feels that Alaska has never been given the equal consideration that other states have been given."
As for Alaska, it will find itself with a bevy of new projects in the new year, with some already signed into law, and others waiting in the wings pending Senate approval.
There is, for example, $900,000 for an airport on St. George's Island, a speck of a place off Alaska's coast. There is $2.5 million to train Russian and other foreign workers in oil field management in Alaska, $7.9 million to build the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and visitor center in Homer, $2.2 million for a senior citizens center in Anchorage and $15 million for the University of Alaska to study the aurora borealis, a perennial pet project of Mr. Stevens.
Military bases in Alaska also benefit. There is $9.5 million to fix a highway at the Elmendorf Air Force Base, $12 million to refurbish the barracks at Fort Richardson and another $13 million to build a parking ramp for a C-130 there.
Sea life, too, would be well tended. There is $100,000 to conduct a census of Pacific walruses, $4 million to help stranded sea lions and $5 million to monitor fish.
Protecting fish and its fishermen ranks high on the list, with millions of dollars earmarked for projects related to salmon, including $900,000 to the Bering Sea Fisherman's Association, which is so well cared for that it does not even have to demand money for its struggling fishermen.
"Senator Stevens, God bless him," said Jude Henzler, the executive director of the association, based in Anchorage. "He's been a godsend to the fisherman in general. You can't lard it on too thick."
One amazing feat of Senator Stevens' is a request for $22 million in emergency financing over a three-year period for four tiny towns in southeast Alaska that were hard hit by restrictions on tree cutting.
But in the spirit of "one person's pork being another's prime cut," as Mr. Wittmann, of the Heritage Foundation, put it, the money has gone, and will go, a long way to helping these communities stay alive. And this, Mr. Stevens' press secretary said, is the unspoken value of pork, which the senator believes is categorized much too broadly.
"If it wasn't for Senator Stevens, we'd be in a lot of trouble for sure," said Stan Filler, the mayor of Sitka, a southeastern Alaska town of 8,000 people that suffered from the timber industry's decline. Sitka would receive $4 million over three years to set up new businesses and repair roads and buildings. "For a lot of years, we didn't get anything, flat nothing," Mr. Filler said. "It wasn't like we were even here."

HEADLINE: On Budget, Everything in Moderation

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
For all of the partisanship and intense wrangling of the past 10 days, the budget agreement between President Clinton and the Republican-run Congress ended up being most remarkable for its moderation.
Despite the temptations posed by an era of federal surpluses, the package approved by the House tonight contains no expansive new spending programs, such as President Clinton's proposal for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Nor does it include the $792 billion tax cut over 10 years that the Republicans tried to push through, only to be stopped by Mr. Clinton's veto. 
 In fact, the struggle over spending for the 2000 fiscal year showed that both an impeached president and House Republicans, reduced to a razor-thin majority, proved remarkably resilient. The outcome came about because each side, in effect, fought the other to a draw. As a result, both sides could take credit today for a spending agreement that will take another step toward paying down the national debt.
And the most far-reaching effect of this year's budget struggle may well be a consensus that has emerged through two years of political combat that Social Security payroll taxes should no longer be used to pay for other government programs.
President Clinton first used the "save Social Security first" refrain in 1998 to stop Republican tax cuts. But this year, with the size of the surpluses growing almost monthly, Mr. Clinton softened his stance to allow for new spending. He said that 63 percent of the total budget surplus over 15 years should be used for Social Security with the rest going to other programs.
That was when the Republicans decided to trump Mr. Clinton and call for the entire Social Security reserve to be protected. Many Republicans said this week that their pledge had created a powerful new political weapon to contain federal spending in a time of surplus.
"The big thing was when it was obvious that we stopped the raid on Social Security, we set a parameter that was impenetrable," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
Indeed, the idea of leaving Social Security revenue untouched has now become so widely embraced that some version of it is recited by presidential candidates across the political spectrum, from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to former Senator Bill Bradley.
Senator Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, said, "I think it's going to be very difficult for either party to go back at any time in the future and acknowledge that they are using the Social Security trust funds."
This idea could come back to haunt the Republicans as much as the Democrats -- constraining tax cutting as well as spending. "We checkmated each other," said a senior Democratic staff member. "We said 'save the surplus to stop tax cuts.' They used it to stop spending programs. So it came out as a draw."
The Republican focus on Social Security, which has long been an issue that Democrats wielded against Republicans -- was part of a fundamental shift in tactics by the brash conservatives who swept to control of Congress in 1994 on a pledge to reduce the scope of government. It came in fits and starts across the year.
The Republicans began the year pledging fiscal restraint but then blew past the spending limits set in the 1997 balanced budget law by more than $30 billion. They approved a $792 billion tax cut but failed to generate much public enthusiasm for it. So instead of fighting after Mr. Clinton vetoed the tax cut, Republican leaders made a pragmatic decision to adjust to the limits of divided government and to the mood of an electorate that is no longer dominated by the angry and economically pressed voters who swept them into office.
They borrowed, and sightly retooled, historical Democratic campaign themes. They promoted education spending. They put more money into the military and certain health programs than even Mr. Clinton had asked for. They struck compromise after compromise with the president, thus moving more in line with a time when their preferred presidential candidate is running as a "compassionate conservative."
"We've kept the bulls-eye off our forehead, unlike the last four years," said Representative John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican.
And oddly enough, after years of cacophony, the Republicans found a unifying theme in Social Security.
Almost daily, Republicans pledge to keep the money brought in from the Social Security payroll tax from being used to pay for other government programs -- even though Democrats wield studies from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the Republican spending bills are full of gimmicks and actually risk eating into the Social Security reserve by $17 billion.
The theme helped Republican leaders rally the party's moderates, who want to pay down the national debt, and its conservatives, who believe that the refrain has created a powerful new political firewall that will prevent both parties from increasing the size of government now that deficits are no longer forcing reductions in spending. Of the projected $3 trillion surplus across the next decade, $2 trillion of the money would be in Social Security revenue.
"It's a moment that's dripping with irony," said Marshall Wittmann, director of Congressional relations for the conservative research group the Heritage Foundation. "We've reached the fourth year of the Republican revolution and they are laying their political future on defending the cornerstone of the welfare state."
He added, "If you ask Republicans what time it is, they say 'save Social Security.' If you ask what the weather is they say, 'save Social Security.' It's a kind of unity they haven't had since they took over."
Whether Republicans can really benefit politically from the Social Security issue in next year's elections is another question. Among the public at large, polls show voters still trust Democrats far more than Republicans when it comes to issues relating to the retirement fund.
Irritated by Republican commercials accusing Democrats of wanting to raid Social Security, House Democrats today continued to showcase all the accounting gimmicks the Republicans used to hide the true levels of spending they approved.
Still each side could point to victories. Mr. Clinton received money to pay for his signature programs to hire 100,000 more teachers and 50,000 more community police officers. He secured money to pay the country's back dues to the United Nations and finance the Wye River Mideast peace accord. And the White House fought off provisions on mining and oil drilling that it had opposed as threats to the environment.
Republicans got a foothold for their efforts to loosen federal restrictions on how education money can be used. They put in place language to limit federal financing of groups that promote abortion rights overseas. They prevailed in increasing military spending even more than Mr. Clinton wanted. And they won a largely symbolic across-the-board spending cut.
"If this were a football game, the score would be pretty close to a tie," said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican. "This is a deal where no one got a scalp, but everyone came back from the hunt with something to brag about."

The European Central Bank left its interest rates unchanged, two days after the United States Federal Reserve nudged up a key rate. The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 nations that use the euro, had raised its interest rates two weeks ago and indicated at the time that no further rise was planned soon. The decision to keep interest rates steady came at a regular meeting of the central bank's governing council. The bank governors issued no statement. The European Central Bank left its main lending rate at 3 percent for loans to banks. It raised that rate from 2.5 percent on Nov. 4.

HEADLINE: FINAL BUDGET BILL IS PASSED BY HOUSE IN BIPARTISAN VOTE

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
United by a desire to proclaim victory and leave town, Republicans and Democrats in the House joined tonight to pass the final budget bill, seven weeks after the fiscal year began.
Congress then passed a resolution that will continue government operations for two more weeks while the Senate finished its work. 
 The House voted 296 to 135 for a package of five spending bills containing $385 billion, sending the measure to the Senate. There, an avalanche of oratory from three Senate Democrats seeking benefits for their states blocked the bill's path and briefly threatened a government shutdown, a threat that evaporated when the Senate extended the budget deadline until Dec. 2.
Moments after the House passed a new budget resolution, the Senate did the same. A short time later, the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta, carrying the resolution, left for Athens so President Clinton could sign it.
After the earlier House vote on the omnibus spending bill, in which 170 Republicans were joined by 125 Democrats and one independent supporting the bill, both parties claimed victory in nearly identical language.
After seven months of haggling over 13 spending bills, and after 10 days of negotiations between the White House and the Republican leaders in Congress, both sides said the result represented the essence of compromise.
Mr. Clinton called it "a hard-won victory for the American people."
And the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, said Congress had "basically turned the corner on how this town does business" by limiting spending in a booming economy, allowing the government to pay down part of its $3.6 trillion debt.
The Republicans won a $17 billion spending increase for the Pentagon, along with more money for politically popular health research and education. They said they kept their promise to refrain from using excess contributions to Social Security to pay for the spending bills.
The Democrats and the White House were able to assert that they had won the money for hiring more primary school teachers and police officers, underwriting Middle East peace agreements and finally paying $351 million of the $926 million withheld by Congress in dues the United States owes the United Nations.
Both sides agreed to provide $12.8 billion over five years to teaching hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers who were suffering financially from cuts in Medicare imposed by Congress in 1997.
The 84 Republicans voting no were protesting spending increases won by the White House for programs like foreign aid and environmental projects.
The 51 Democrats who voted no, a quarter of their party in the House, split with the president over the compromises the White House made in its final negotiations with the Republicans. Some rebelled over restrictions Republicans sought on aid to international family planning groups in exchange for freeing up the back dues owed the United Nations.
Mr. Clinton agreed to a ban on using such aid to promote abortions to free $351 million of the money that the United States owes the United Nations. He can waive the restrictions, but then $12.5 million in federal grants to women's health groups would be shifted to a children's fund.
Angry at this trade-off, 19 House Democrats who are women demanded that the White House make amends. Steve Ricchetti, a deputy White House chief of staff, told them today that the administration would ask Congress next year for more than $500 million in grants for the groups.
Other Democrats protested what they called bookkeeping tricks that allowed Republicans to say they had protected Social Security surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office says the bills dip into at least $17 billion of the retirement reserves.
The final deal, agreed to early this morning, included some of this sort of sleight of hand, such as delaying the last payday of next September for Pentagon personnel and some civilian government employees so it falls in the next fiscal year. That saves no money, but eliminates expenditures in the 2000 fiscal year.
But the Senate was not ready to pass the bill, with three Democratic senators threatening to hold it hostage.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, threatened to hold back the continuing resolution over a law, stripped from the final spending package, that would have required satellite television companies to carry local stations in rural regions. When the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, promised him the Senate would take up such a measure by April, he relented.
Then Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, rose. He had threatened to block any bill, including a resolution and the final budget package, over language in the spending bills that he said favored dairy farmers in the East and hurt his state's milk producers.
"One of the options we have is to vote against a continuing resolution, which would in effect shut down the government at midnight, which is something I have considered," Mr. Kohl said. "It's not a step that I'm going to take."
The maneuvering was necessary because Congress was operating under a resolution that kept the agencies covered by the spending bills running for 24 hours without a real budget. But the passage of a resolution keeping the agencies going until Dec. 2 alleviated that problem.
The Senate will soon take up the final budget package, which includes these five separate bills:
*One bill includes $315 billion measure for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education. Of that sum, $229 billion is for mandatory programs that Congress must finance, like Medicare and Medicaid. The rest, $86 billion, is medical research, special education and job training.
*A measure for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments totals $39 million.
*Two $15 billion bills were included in the package, one for the Interior Department, one for foreign aid.
*A $429 million bill for the District of Columbia included a $576 million emergency measure for the flood victims of Hurricane Floyd.
But the budget battle is not over.
Tonight, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, dean of Senate Democrats, took the floor with amendment, seeking to protect his state's coal miners from a court ruling ordering them to stop dumping waste from mountaintop mines into valley streams.
He wanted to attach his amendment, which the White House has opposed, to any legislation he could.
"We're being impeded and we're being wronged by the White House," Mr. Byrd said. "This is the time to head off the dragon. Beat it back! Take up the sword that I offer! Take this sword!"
While Mr. Podesta was flying to Athens with the resolution, Mr. Byrd's amendment passed on a vote of 56 to 33. That vote attached his amendment to a completely different resolution.
The Senate intended to send it to a legislative graveyard.
Mr. Lott, in an effort to grind down opponents to the budget bill, said the Senate would take it up again at 1 a.m. on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official Is Charged With Assault

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
A former New York City health official was charged yesterday in United States District Court in Brooklyn with assaulting and intimidating Trans World Airlines crew members last year after detonating stink bombs on a flight taking off in New York and one departing from Paris.
The former official, Victor E. Botnick, 45, set off a stink bomb on T.W.A. Flight 925 during takeoff from Charles De Gaulle Airport on Aug. 1, 1998, according to court papers. The searing fumes made crew members and passengers teary-eyed, forcing the plane to return to the gate. 
 Eight days later, court papers said, Mr. Botnick set off another stink bomb as T.W.A. Flight 924 took off from Kennedy International Airport. This time, two crew members checked beneath Mr. Botnick's seat and found glass shards and a wet area reeking of burning rubber, according to the papers.
The court papers said that Mr. Botnick, a frequent flier on T.W.A., became angry after the airline inadvertently canceled his family's reservations on a flight to Israel to celebrate his son's bar mitzvah in December 1997.
Mr. Botnick, a Yonkers resident, was released yesterday on $150,000 bond. Federal Magistrate Roanne L. Mann instructed Mr. Botnick to stay away from airports and airplanes unless he received specific approval from the court.
Mr. Botnick, who was accompanied by his wife, Lee, glared at reporters as he left the courtroom and said "no comment" to questions. When a reporter tried to follow him, he turned around and said "Did you understand? No comment."
In the 1980's, Mr. Botnick served as a special assistant and confidant to Mayor Edward I. Koch. He resigned as the head of the municipal hospital system in 1986 after admitting that he had falsely claimed to be a college graduate.
Gina L. Mendola, Mr. Botnick's lawyer, said the charges against him were "trumped up" to support a separate federal investigation in New Jersey. "There is not a great deal of evidence against my client," she said in court. She declined to comment further.
Cynthia M. Monaco, the assistant United States attorney who is handling the case against Mr. Botnick in Brooklyn, confirmed that he was being investigated by the United States attorney's office in New Jersey on a separate matter, but denied that there was any connection. Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in New Jersey, said there were no charges against Mr. Botnick at this time, but declined to comment further.
Magistrate Mann has allowed Mr. Botnick, who is unemployed, to drive or take the train to New Jersey to meet with federal investigators, as well as to Connecticut, Washington and Maryland to consult with lawyers and look for jobs. Mr. Botnick turned in his passport to court officials.
At yesterday's hearing, Ms. Monaco requested that Mr. Botnick undergo a psychiatric evaluation. The court denied the request after Mr. Botnick's lawyer objected, but ordered him to continue psychiatric counseling with his own doctor. Mr. Botnick, who never removed his red-and-black ski jacket, nodded as he stood quietly with his hands clasped in front.

HEADLINE: Bronx School Will Expand But Phase Out Poorer Area

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
After months of heated debate, a Bronx school board overwhelmingly approved a plan last night to expand Middle School 141 in the affluent neighborhood of Riverdale but narrow the school's attendance zone to phase out students from the nearby, poorer Marble Hill neighborhood.
Under the zoning change, which the school board approved in a 7-to-2 vote, children from Marble Hill will attend a new middle school, M.S. 368, to be built closer to their neighborhood. The plan has come under attack, partly because the school is to be built on a site where environmental studies have found contaminated soil. The planned site is adjacent to an elementary school where tests showed elevated lead levels earlier this month, escalating the controversy. 
 Some Marble Hill parents have complained that the plan is an elitist scheme to keep poor and minority children out of the school in Riverdale, a mostly white community. But proponents say that M.S. 141 will become more racially diverse under the plan, which will convert it into a rigorous academy for grades 6 through 12.
At a time when the city school system is struggling to retain middle-class students, the conflict in Riverdale underscores how difficult such efforts can be. While opponents say the plan smacks of racial and economic prejudice, supporters say it is the last hope of maintaining at least some diversity in the Riverdale schools.
They point out that the plan would simply be reinstituting the attendance zone that M.S. 141 had before 1992, when a previous board voted to expand its zone and bus students into Riverdale from Marble Hill. The school has lost more than half its white population since then, they say.
The student body at M.S. 141 is now about 16 percent white. But G. Oliver Koppell, the school board president, predicts the number will grow to 30 percent to 40 percent once M.S. 141 is converted to a combination middle school and high school with a more challenging curriculum.
The protest has mostly focused on the rezoning issue, but in recent weeks, opponents have focused more on whether the site for the planned school for Marble Hill students is environmentally safe. At a public hearing on Tuesday and at last night's meeting, many parents voiced concern about the recent elevated lead levels at P.S. 37, which is next to the site for the planned school, M.S. 368, on Tibbett Avenue in Kingsbridge.
The opponents have also raised questions about an ambulance garage that the city is building near the site, and in particular about a 2,000-gallon diesel tank that will be on the garage property. In addition to at least a dozen parents, Dr. John Rosen, a pediatrics professor at Montefiore Medical Center who specializes in environmental medicine, urged the school board to conduct further tests on the site.
"I would consider this an absolute necessity from an environmental safety and public health standpoint," he said.
But Bernard Orlan, director of environmental health and safety for the Board of Education's Division of School Facilities, said yesterday that any soil with unacceptably high levels of chemicals would be removed before construction. He said the nearby diesel tank would not pose a threat because it would be closely monitored.
"Based on all the results so far, it appears there are some areas of the site that need to be cleaned up," Mr. Orlan said. "But we haven't seen anything that would be fatal to the project."
Residents of Riverdale and Marble Hill have been fighting about the plan since it was proposed in 1997 as a way to ease overcrowding and bring back quality neighborhood schooling in District 10. The district is the city's largest, with more than 40,000 students.
The previous board, which was mostly black and Hispanic, rejected the plan last winter. That prompted Riverdale residents to flock to the polls during the May school board elections and vote in a seven-member slate that campaigned on the promise of pushing through the plan. The slate was led by Mr. Koppell, a longtime resident of Riverdale and a former State Attorney General. Only two members of the previous board remained in office, and both -- Charles Williams, who is black, and Myrna Calderon, who is Hispanic -- voted against the plan last night.
Chancellor Rudy Crew signed off on the plan last month, on the condition that all students currently enrolled at the Riverdale school have the option of staying there.
Dr. Crew dedicated $14 million to expand M.S. 141 and $15 million to help build M.S. 368, which is to open in 2001. The Board of Education had already set aside $30 million for the M.S. 368 project.

Declassified government documents show that analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency were deeply pessimistic about the chances of success for President Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to reform the Soviet Union's Communist system even in the final days of the cold war.
C.I.A. experts in the late 1980's and early 1990's came to believe that Mr. Gorbachev was genuinely interested in reform, yet the agency remained concerned that political instability could lead to a return to hard-line Communist rule or anarchy. 
 A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the C.I.A. released 24 intelligence estimates today that show how the agency sought -- sometimes far too cautiously -- to keep up with the incredible pace of events between 1988 and 1991. The declassified reports provide insight into an enduring debate over whether the C.I.A. really "missed" the collapse of the Soviet Union, as critics charge.
The reports were declassified by the agency in conjunction with a conference being held here on the role that American intelligence played in the final days of the cold war.
Clearly, the rapid change in eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union caught the C.I.A. off guard and forced the agency to focus much more on political developments within the Soviet Union than ever before. In 1988, for example, the chief of Soviet analysis at the C.I.A. told Congress that the agency had "never really looked at the Soviet Union as a political entity in which there were factors building which could lead to at least the initiation of political transformation that we seem to see."
Late in 1988, the C.I.A. suggested that Soviet weaknesses gave the West a wedge to achieve "marginal bargaining advantages" in arms control talks, but not to expect true reform.
By April 1989, however, the C.I.A. wrote an analysis that included an unusually large section devoted to dissenting views. The C.I.A. was divided over how significant Mr. Gorbachev's reforms were. Still the report concluded that the Soviet Union would remain an adversary.
C.I.A. analysts worried that Mr. Gorbachev's hold on power was fragile, and were concerned because Moscow still had an enormous military even though its economy was cratering. In September 1989, for example, even as the C.I.A. had become convinced that Mr. Gorbachev was sincere, it still told President Bush that Mr. Gorbachev's chances of remaining in power were "doubtful at best."
By November 1990, even after eastern Europe had gone through a peaceful liberation, a C.I.A. report outlined "nightmare scenarios" that could lead to civil war or chaos in the Soviet Union. The paper stated that "the old Communist order is in its death throes," and that the crisis of perestroika was threatening to "tear the country apart."
That estimate seemed to overstate the extent to which a poor economy was leading to unrest and a breakdown of political authority, a new C.I.A. history noted this week.
In April 1991, the C.I.A. found that "anti-Communist forces are breaking down the Soviet empire and its system of governance," and it laid conditions in which die-hards might move to reassert control "with or without Gorbachev."
Then in July 1991, the agency reported that "the U.S.S.R. is in the midst of a revolution that probably will sweep the Communist Party from power and reshape the country within the five-year time frame of this estimate." The C.I.A. was far too cautious. The next month, the Soviet Union went out of business.

HEADLINE: Minimum Wages, City by City;
As More Local Laws Pass, More Businesses Complain

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
What bothers Henry A. Berber most about the new "living wage" ordinance in Los Angeles is the picketing at his restaurant, La Luz del Dia, during a busy lunch hour. "The way they are dressed," he said, "they give the impression they are my regular customers, very dissatisfied. It hurts me personally."
The pickets are in fact community advocates who pushed for passage of the local law, which increases minimum wages at companies doing business with the city. Because Mr. Berber leases his site in a subsidized tourist zone, the ordinance requires him to pay $8.76 an hour, not the $5.75 that is standard pay for kitchen help here. The reasoning is that all his workers should benefit from the public largess that makes the quaint Olvera Street where his Mexican restaurant is situated so profitable. Mr. Berber has raised his bottom wage, but only to $6.75 an hour, without health insurance -- and the pickets are trying to get him to go the extra distance. 
 "I am moving in the direction of conforming," he said, leaning for emphasis across a huge, cluttered desk that almost filled his small, low-ceilinged office. But to pay the full wage now, he said, would put his restaurant in the red.
Here and elsewhere, a small but increasing number of employers who do business with government are suddenly finding themselves required by local ordinances to grant big raises and benefits to their low-wage workers. Forty cities and counties in 17 states, particularly those with large constituencies of low-wage workers, have enacted such wage laws since the movement began five years ago.
As one follows another, lately at the rate of a new ordinance a month, the movement has begun to broaden from a simple emphasis on higher wages into a wide range of requirements involving health insurance, vacations, sick pay, job security and incentives to unionize.
"You have to look at the living wage movement in the context of the utter failure of federal labor law, now so stacked against workers," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, director of the Los Angeles Living Wage Coalition. She cited what she said was Washington's failure to raise the national minimum wage to keep pace with the needs of the working poor or to strengthen labor's bargaining power. The coalition, an amalgam of community groups, churches and unions that organized the picketing at Mr. Berber's restaurant, is out to redress the balance.
As the ordinances spread, business opposition and complaints about higher costs and patchwork regulation are on the rise. But the vast majority of affected companies, though often ducking full compliance, have generally lived with the law rather than give up profitable contracts, subsidies and leases on choice city-owned properties like Olvera Street, three studies have found. The early evidence suggests that relatively little of the extra cost has been passed on to the cities or to consumers. Companies are absorbing the higher wages or finding ways to offset them.
"The cost increases for companies in Los Angeles were only 1 to 1.5 percent of their total expenses," said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who led one of the studies.
The "living wage" movement is an increasingly popular tool for improving the lot of janitors, cleaning people, restaurant and health care workers, security guards, school bus drivers, parking attendants and others who earn less than $8 an hour. That group represents 25.7 percent of the work force, or 28.5 million people.
Yet only a fraction of these workers -- no more than 44,000, according to an analysis by Mr. Pollin, Mark Brenner and Stephanie Luce -- are covered so far by wage ordinances, the largest group being the 9,000 or so in Los Angeles. But more than 50 other cities and counties are considering such bills. One alone, in San Francisco, would nearly double the number of workers covered nationwide if the proposal now before the Board of Supervisors passes.
The ordinances cover the companies that tap the public till through a tax abatement, for example, or a service contract to clean schools or through leases at a city airport; the companies can be cut off if they fail to raise wages. Here in Los Angeles, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have accepted the ordinance as lessees at the international airport, imposing the new wage -- $8.76 without health insurance, or $7.51 in pay and $1.25 for health insurance -- on the contractors and subcontractors who supply baggage handlers, security screeners, wheelchair attendants and the like. The airlines' own employees generally earn more in wages and benefits than the law requires.
"United resisted the ordinance for a while and could have tied us up in court for a long time," said Isaac Nuru, lead organizer at the airport for the Living Wage Coalition. "But it did the moral thing; it did not want a bad press."
The ordinances have their limits. They are hard to enforce even when city officials audit corporate payrolls, as they do in Los Angeles and one or two other cities. Further, though companies like United and Delta comply with the ordinance at the city-owned airport here, workers employed by contractors at the airlines' other sites in the city are not covered. And companies do not have to comply with the ordinances in most cities until existing contracts and leases are renewed or revised, though some companies do so anyway.
Host Marriott Services did. It runs bars and restaurants at the airport here and has applied for a revision of its lease to expand. Even before submitting the application, the company increased the pay of 700 airport workers to the levels specified in the ordinance, which took effect last January at the airport. And in a bit of horse trading, Ms. Janis-Aparicio's coalition has endorsed Host Marriott's request.
"You monitor every lease that comes up for renewal or revision," she said, "and you go to the company and say, 'We want to work with you.' "
Still, much of American business, once indifferent to a movement that seemed to apply to so few workers, is now fighting the effort more vigorously -- denouncing the laws as an excessive cost for business and a distortion of wages, which should be set in the marketplace, not by government.
"When you raise the wage so much, a lot of the people you are trying to help will lose their jobs," said Thomas R. Larmore, a lawyer in Santa Monica. He heads a Chamber of Commerce committee formed recently to prevent passage of a wage proposal in Santa Monica that would be the first in the country to go beyond companies that benefit directly from city business. The ordinance would apply to an entire commercial district, a two-mile stretch of Pacific coast developed with public funds as a tourist mecca.
Within this zone, which extends three blocks inland from a promenade overlooking the ocean, no company with more than 50 employees would be allowed to pay its workers less than $10.69 an hour. Other provisions, borrowed from the Los Angeles ordinance, include paid vacations, a health insurance requirement and a provision to protect workers against retaliation.
The zone flourishes, the argument goes, because the city spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop it as a tourist and entertainment center, and limited the number of hotel rooms, to help keep room rates high, often above $300 a night. Low-wage employees, advocates say, should share more of this public bounty, or at least earn a high enough wage to live in Santa Monica. Most commute from poor Los Angeles neighborhoods.
Mr. Larmore says such reasoning is spurious. "It is totally backward to say that business is subsidized by the city," he said. "It is business that is lifting the city," he added, by providing a huge flow of tax revenue that allows the city to provide many services.
A majority on Santa Monica's seven-member City Council, which recently approved a ban on automated teller fees for nonbank customers that has been temporarily set aside by a local court, favors the ordinance. But rather than act now, the council is likely to wait while the wage issue is fought out in next year's election campaign. The Chamber of Commerce is raising money to support candidates who will oppose it.
Wage ordinances have become a goal of such national groups as the Independent Areas Foundation and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now that seek to bring community groups together in social action campaigns. And with increasing frequency, the ordinances are becoming big issues in local politics.
In San Francisco's Dec. 13 runoff election for mayor, the issue divides Willie Brown, the incumbent, who has been lukewarm about a wage law, and his challenger, Tom Ammiano, president of the Board of Supervisors and chief sponsor of the proposal. It specifies a wage of $11 an hour, surpassing the current national leader, San Jose, where an ordinance requires $9.50 with health insurance and $10.75 without. By comparison, the national minimum wage is $5.15 an hour; adjusted for inflation, that is nearly $3 less than it was in 1968.
"If the bill is watered down too much, say to $9 an hour," Mr. Ammiano said, "and nonprofit organizations are exempted and there is not enough funding for enforcement, then I would advocate taking the proposal to a referendum."
The first such ordinance was enacted in Baltimore, in December 1994, largely through the efforts of a community organization called Build. Last November, Build got thousands of residents in poor neighborhoods to the polls. Most voted for the re-election of Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, who is increasingly using the city's ordinance as a model for contracts that the state makes with private companies.
Here in Los Angeles, Mayor Richard J. Riordan tried to block the measure, but his veto was overridden by the City Council. "I believe employers should be aware that employees who earn under $10 an hour cannot lead an independent life," he said. "But I do not believe that government should dictate wages. We have seen this fail in Socialist and Communist countries. It will do irreparable harm."
Mayor Riordan said, however, that he agreed with supporters of the wage ordinance that income inequality had increased in part because of the decline in union bargaining power. Several ordinances try to reverse that trend through an "opt out" loophole that lets companies partly off the hook if they agree to let their workers organize.
Half of Mr. Berber's 28 employees, for example, have signed a petition seeking union recognition. If he granted recognition voluntarily, the opt out clause would allow him to negotiate a labor agreement that permits pay and benefit levels below the city's mandated wage, at least temporarily. But he would be locked into a union -- a central goal of Ms. Janis-Aparicio's coalition.
"Whenever you rely on legislation solely, the gains can be lost," she said, noting that the Los Angeles City Council's current pro-labor bent could disappear in a future election. "So we need to build union agreements that have community support and will last."
While running a refugee center here, Ms. Janis-Aparicio, 39, was recruited into her present line of work in 1993 by Miguel Contreras, now the powerful executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
Mr. Contreras, who had worked with Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers, was mindful of the public support -- the consumer grape boycott -- that had brought such success to the farm workers. So he asked Ms. Janis-Aparicio to set up a nonprofit organization that could foster similar community support for labor. She founded the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which operates with a $1 million annual budget and 18 salaried staff members. The wage issue soon became the central cause.
"This question of job inequities in the public sector, if we address it as a union, people say we are self-serving," Mr. Contreras said. "But if it has the cloak of religious leaders and community activists, then it becomes a community issue."
 
New York Law Covers 1,400
New York was one of the first cities to adopt a "living wage" ordinance. Overriding a veto by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council enacted a law on Sept. 11, 1996, that was narrow in scope and has never been expanded.
About 1,400 people are covered. They are employees of companies that have contracted with the city to supply security guards, food service employees, cleaning workers and temporaries. A "trend toward paying low wages" appears to be "most egregious" in these four areas, the ordinance declares.
But rather than fix a uniform minimum, the ordinance requires the city comptroller to determine the prevailing wage for each class of workers. The wages today for most of these workers fall between $7.50 and $12 an hour.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK;
A Saintly Jew Whose Spirituality Rejected Jews

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
As a brilliant but radical philosophy student in Paris in the late 1920's, she was nicknamed the Red Virgin and the Categorical Imperative in Skirts.
But today Simone Weil is remembered mainly as a French Jew who used her stunningly original intelligence to denigrate the Jews on the eve of World War II and espouse a mystical Christianity of her own invention. 
 Last week French and American scholars gathered at Columbia University for a conference to discuss her writings and her odd combination of beliefs.
Why is there such interest in this young Frenchwoman with such repugnant views on Jews? A woman who joined General de Gaulle's Free French in London before dying in 1943 at the age of 34 from tuberculosis aggravated by self-imposed starvation? (She was trying to share the hardships of the occupation.) Even her admirers speak of her as a kind of mad virtuoso.
T. S. Eliot called her genius "akin to that of the saints," while Albert Camus spoke of her "madness for truth." At the conference, Sylvere Lotringer, a professor of French literature at Columbia, called Weil "one of the great minds of the 1930's and 40's, pushing her ideas to the limit without pity for anyone, in a kind of delirium."
As a young teacher, Weil worked on behalf of the unemployed and dreamed of restoring dignity to manual labor. She joined the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War, compared Hitler to Julius Caesar and encouraged de Gaulle to unify the French resistance by creating a National Council of the Resistance. Later, she advised de Gaulle to ban political parties in France once the war ended because their lust for power encouraged totalitarianism.
Weil wanted to found an elite nursing group to tend wounded soldiers at the front. Only months before her death, she begged to be parachuted into occupied France on a secret mission -- "preferably a dangerous one."
Not surprisingly, however, the conference was dominated by Weil's hostility toward Judaism. She died before the horrors of the Holocaust became known, but in general she saw the Israelites of the Old Testament as cruel imperialists and their God as vengeful and violent. The lives of the patriarchs were "sullied with atrocities," she said, while the prohibition against idolatry encouraged "the chosen people" to self-worship.
"I am paralyzed by the thought that I am accused of descending from people who could not find anything better to give humanity than Jehovah," Weil wrote. Christianity, she believed, sprang from the spirituality and grace of ancient Greece but had been subverted by imperial Rome, which turned it into a centralized, dominering religion in its own image. She was never baptized, nor did she join any Christian church.
As a paraphrase of Weil's view, Jeffrey Mehlman of Boston University said: "Rome, the incarnation of imperial statism, ripped Christianity from the spiritual fabric that sustained it and reinterpreted it spuriously as the heir of the this-worldly religion of Israel and its God of vengeance."
Some scholars at the conference felt Weil viewed Hellenic civilization through rosy spectacles. She explained away the destruction of Troy, for example, by saying the Greeks never gloried in it as the Romans did in their anihilation of Carthage.
For Page duBois, a classicist from the University of California at San Diego, Weil's sense of the purity of ancient Greece was based on "selective reading" that omitted "the sex and drinking."
Still, there was no agreement on Weil's attitude toward fellow Jews or the effect of her thinking on contemporary anti-Semitism. Michael Stanislawski, a professor of Jewish history at Columbia, called her an anti-Semite whose views were an "unpardonable perfidy" to some.
Sylvie Courtine-Denamy, a French philosopher, pointed out that under the collaborationist Vichy regime of Marshal Petain, Weil proposed limiting Jewish entry into the French civil service and sought to encourage Jewish assimilation and mixed marriages.
But Mr. Lotringer defended Weil, arguing that assimilation was a way of shielding France's Jews from persecution by eliminating them as a separate minority.
The mystical nature of her Christianity led her to welcome suffering -- which she called "affliction" -- believing it brought the soul closer to God. This, several speakers suggested, may have diminished her sympathy for Jewish suffering in occupied France.
Her attitude toward Judaism seems rooted in a conviction that the ancient Israelites were aggressive and cruel. This caused her to battle oppression -- except, it seems, against her own people.

HEADLINE: Low Wages Are Relative

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Serfs of the Service Economy" (Op-Ed, Nov. 16): 
 Bruce Raynor overlooks that many low-paid service positions in the United States pay significantly more than unskilled work in underdeveloped nations. I am a lawyer and some of my clients are immigrants from impoverished countries, where they often were agricultural workers. While none perceive that a $7 per hour job here is a godsend, most see the many opportunities here for their children and them, and many feel quite privileged simply to be in the United States.
Low-paid service jobs can be deemed "exploitation" in relation to professional jobs, and working conditions should be improved, but it must be remembered that the economic situation in much of the rest of the world is far beneath that found here.

HEADLINE: Is This the End of the Story for Books?

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
First the scroll, then the codex and the Gutenberg Bible. And now the electronic book? Almost nothing causes more anxiety in the publishing world than the idea that books as we know them might one day be replaced by electronic or e-books. Will paper books, with their distinctive smell and touch, the special, almost trancelike intimacy they can engender between writer and reader, vanish forever? And if so, what will the experience of reading be like in the 21st century?
Books will still be around, many scholars say, but we may read in a different way. Only a handful of e-books -- portable devices with screens designed just for reading -- are available today. Among those already on the market are the SoftBook, which sells for around $300 and a commitment of $19.99 a month to buy material for it, and NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook, advertised at $199. Within six months, Microsoft plans to begin shipping the Reader, a new program designed to make the text on a computer screen look as it does in real books. Unlike the current crop of e-books, Microsoft's Reader is not a separate device; it is software designed for use on someone's home or laptop computer. The Reader will be available as a free-standing program for use with Windows. By giving the program away or selling it at low cost, Microsoft says, it will stimulate the manufacture of more e-book devices that the company hopes will eventually all use the Reader. 
 But is the act of reading something that needs improving? Analysts say that existing e-books are selling poorly because consumers are satisfied with the old-fashioned reading experience. "People aren't interested," said Tom Rhinelander, who analyzes the electronic book market for Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., concern that studies computer use. "The market went nowhere in a year. The fundamental reason is that people who read books don't have a problem with books today."
 "The main issue is that if it's not broken, don't replace it," Mr. Rhinelander said.
Regular books have clearer typefaces than computers, and they are lighter. And e-books have batteries that make them hot. "If you're a consumer, how would you consume this?" Mr. Rhinelander asked. "You would buy a $300 device and download it and relearn how to read. If you're a book lover, you're not putting them in a bookcase and giving them to friends."
Even the architect of Microsoft's new Reader program, Bill Hill, admits: "People do not like to read on the screen." He added, "It's horrible."
Consider that some studies have shown that the average person reads no more than three to five paragraphs of text on a computer screen before pressing the print button.
At its best, reading results in a change of consciousness, a total immersion. Indeed, researchers have documented that during periods of total absorption in reading, there are changes in respiration and heartbeat. Computers, with their heft and weight, their lighted screens and distracting icons, interfere with that experience.
But a new generation of readers weaned on computers, habituated to receiving information in short takes, may not find it difficult to acclimatize to e-books.
Robert Darnton, a professor of history at Princeton University who has championed electronic publishing for scholarly dissertations, said, "I think it's only a matter of time before we can have mechanical devices that will make possible a satisfactory but new experience of reading."
But he conceded: "One thing that seems to be missing is paper, the feel of a book when you hold it, its grain, its texture, its elasticity, its whiteness. The sensation of paper is bound up in the experience of reading. We have a long-term kinetic memory of paper. How will we substitute a new medium for it or improve on it?"
Mr. Hill said he drew on histories of reading and studies of its psychology and physiology in developing Microsoft's Reader. "The book today is at the apex of millions of years of evolution," Mr. Hill said. "It goes back beyond the printed word and tablets of stone."
Initially, people read on tablets or scrolls without punctuation or spacing between the words. Reading was a communal experience, with texts mostly being read aloud. In the third or fourth century A.D. came the codex, pages bound at the inner margins, which made reading easier because the reader could thumb through the text. The codex formed the prototype for the modern book. Two pages, side by side, also made it easier for the eye to flow across the text, as did adding page numbers. As with nearly every new development in reading, the appearance of the codex brought about social change and facilitated the spread of Christianity, which was a religion of the Book.
In the Middle Ages, punctuation and word separation came into use. Possibly some time in the early Middle Ages, reading became a private experience rather than the communal one of reading aloud.
Gutenberg's printing press and the advent of movable type in the 15th century paved the way for the Reformation, which was a reaffirmation of Christianity as a religion of the Book, with a Protestant translation of the Bible required in every church in England.
After the Reformation, the Enlightenment spread through Europe by means of the printed word, books and pamphlets, resulting in "a secularized world in which print culture is fundamental," said Mr. Darnton of Princeton.
Of primary importance in the history of the book is the evolution of typefaces. Books are usually printed in serif type. In this face, each letter has at least one serif or tiny dash attached to it, giving the eye a kind of horizontal line to follow across the page. Many computer texts are printed in sans-serif, blocklike letters that are harder to read. The text in paper books also has kerning, a term for printing certain letters closer together, and ligatures, the blending of two letters into one, both of which ease the eye's path across the page.
Most new technologies begin by trying to duplicate previous technologies, said Anthony Grafton, a professor of history at Princeton. "Early photographers did what the landscape painters were already doing. Later, they did things no painter had thought of. The camera could both duplicate ways of dealing with nature and create new ones."
That is in a sense what companies like Microsoft are trying to do: recreate the experience of reading a printed book.
Mr. Hill said the main feature of the Microsoft Reader was its new display technology ClearType, which is designed to make a computer screen look like a page in a book, with letters having the same clarity and resolution as they do on paper. The Reader software will have a built-in dictionary, and it will enable the consumer to download hundreds of books into one portable device. As with other programs, the consumer will be able to write in the margins of the e-book and save his place, and instead of the text scrolling down the screen, a new page will appear with the click of a button. Microsoft, SoftBook and Rocket eBook have also joined to establish a universal format for all e-books, called the Open eBook standard.
Still, Microsoft's program works best for reading from a standard LCD screen, the kind found on many laptop computers -- a substantively different act from reading a paper book. And that's a real drawback, according to its competitors. "In the end you're holding onto this big, hot piece of hardware with a short battery life," said Martin Eberhard, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nuvomedia, which makes the Rocket eBook. Of course, with the Rocket eBook and other reading devices, you're still holding a pricey electronic device with a screen.
Mr. Grafton of Princeton says the history of the book shows that one form doesn't necessarily replace another. Most computers still use scrolling, just as medieval texts did, for instance.
With e-books, people may learn to read in a whole new way, Mr. Grafton said. Instead of reading being a linear experience as the reader's eye moves across the printed page, reading may become "circular," with the reader following text from link to link on a computer screen with the click of a mouse.
E-books may also become simply an alternate form of reading. "Many forms of reading exist in any complex society," Mr. Grafton said. "I read my American Express bill differently from the way I read the text I'm teaching."
"Reading," he added, "is a complicated, multiple process."

HEADLINE: Gore Campaign Responds to Money Crunch

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Fund-raising for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign is lagging, forcing Mr. Gore to add new money-raising events and slash spending, campaign officials said today.
Mr. Gore expected to have completed all of his major fund-raising events for the primary campaign by the middle of November, but instead he has added at least three more fund-raisers to meet the campaign's $4 million target for the October-December period. 
 The first of these was held on Thursday night in McLean, Va., at the home of Terry McAuliffe, President Clinton's chief fund-raiser, and brought in about $200,000. Events planned for New York and Nashville in December are expected to raise more than $1 million.
Aides to Mr. Gore said that the campaign was in strong financial shape, but the hurriedly scheduled fund-raisers and a campaignwide effort to cut costs belied their assertion.
The money crunch has also led Mr. Gore to schedule more official events in his role as vice president, using his office to make policy announcements that are not overtly related to the campaign and thus can be paid for with taxpayer money.
Mr. Gore, campaigning in New Hampshire today, said his plan was "not to use the official events to campaign," but "to promote the administration's ideas."
Asked if he thought this was appropriate, Mr. Gore said: "Sure. To use official events to promote the administration's agenda? I don't know why it wouldn't be."
In an effort to conserve scarce dollars at the presidential campaign, Mr. Gore closed fund-raising offices in Washington and California today, with all efforts now concentrated in Nashville and New York. The overall fund-raising staff has been reduced to 6 people, from a peak of 40 this summer and early fall, a senior Gore adviser said.
The vice president's political traveling party has been cut to just two aides, from six or seven: Michael Feldman, a political adviser, and Chris Lehane, the press secretary.
Salaries at Gore headquarters in Nashville have been capped at $95,000 a year, down from the $180,000 a year that some advisers were making before the severity of the financial crunch became clear.
Mr. Gore's public appearances and private fund-raising events have been simplified, eliminating studio-type lighting for town meetings with voters as well as elaborate menus for money-raising dinners.
Mr. Lehane said that all major fund-raising efforts would be completed by the end of the year, yielding more than $40 million. The overall figure includes an estimated $13 million in federal matching funds and $4 million to cover the legal and accounting costs of meeting federal campaign finance regulations.
The Gore campaign applied for $9.2 million in federal matching funds in early October and expects the request to be approved by the Federal Election Commission as early as Monday, Mr. Lehane said. A second filing, for about $4.5 million, will be submitted in early January, he said.
The campaign expects to raise nearly $3 million in the early months of next year, chiefly through direct-mail appeals and donations solicited over the Internet. Mr. Gore has already raised more than $500,000 over the Internet; the campaign of Mr. Gore's Democratic rival, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, announced this week that he had raised more than $1 million through his Web site.
Mr. Gore's advisers became alarmed at the end of September when the profligate spending became apparent, leaving his campaign with less money in the bank than Mr. Bradley's even though Mr. Gore had raised $5 million more than Mr. Bradley. On Oct. 1, Mr. Gore reported $10.3 million cash on hand; Mr. Bradley had $10.7 million.
Campaigns have to report figures on donations and spending only every three months, so a current comparison is not available.
But the decision to schedule three additional big-dollar events is a clear sign that the vice president has had trouble meeting his fund-raising targets and that spending continues to be a problem.
When Mr. Gore moved his campaign headquarters to Nashville from Washington last month, he said he was doing so to be closer to his Tennessee roots and to the voters. But he also hoped to sharply reduce the costs of running his campaign out of Washington, including $60,000 a month in rent. The new headquarters, in a former suite of medical offices in Nashville, rents for roughly a third of that.
A December dinner in Nashville is the last planned major fund-raising event, with a goal of roughly $1 million, a senior Gore adviser said. "We're not calling it the Super Bowl, and we don't rule out doing additional events later on, but this is the major push," the adviser said.
There are no current plans to again call on President Clinton's fund-raising prowess to assist the vice president, the adviser said. Mr. Clinton appeared at three Gore events in August and September that yielded more than $600,000.
Mr. Gore, confident that he will prevail in his primary battle with Mr. Bradley, is already looking ahead to the spring post-primary period when his campaign treasury will be emptied by travel and television advertising costs.
He is scouring the federal government for program and policy announcements that he can make in his role as vice president that will give him opportunities then to generate news coverage that he will not have to pay for, Mr. Lehane said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Foreign Policy

 BODY:
After a bumpy foreign policy debut on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas faced the obvious task of showing that he understands international issues even though he lacks direct experience with them. In a speech yesterday at the Reagan library in California, the Republican presidential candidate placed himself solidly in his party's internationalist mainstream with warnings about isolationism and protectionism. His simplistic approach to arms control was the major flaw in a generally balanced overview of the foreign policies he would pursue if elected president.
On China, Russia and other nations in Asia and Europe, Mr. Bush outlined moderate Republican positions that would be consistent with the management of American foreign policy over the course of recent decades. And after his wobbly performance on foreign policy issues in recent months, he seemed determined to let no freelance remarks blotch a speech drafted by a number of senior advisers to his father, former President Bush, and to former President Reagan. Mr. Bush followed the text word for word. 
 He called for dealing with China "without ill will -- but without illusions." Avoiding naming the Clinton administration, he rightly criticized President Clinton's rush several years ago to embrace China as a strategic partner. Mr. Bush described China realistically as an emerging world power that has interests in common with America, but may also threaten America's interests in the future. His harsh criticism of Chinese human rights policy was justified. His intention to work with China on economic and political issues, while remaining wary of China's increasing military power, was sensible.
The broad outline of Mr. Bush's analysis of Russia was thoughtful. He understands that Russia remains a great power because of its nuclear arsenal, its natural resources and its sheer size. He wisely suggested that the United States reach out to a younger generation of Russians committed to democracy and reform, including political leaders outside Moscow. On nuclear proliferation, Mr. Bush promoted more funding for dismantling nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, and his general concerns about the issue were well put. But his downgrading of ratification of the Start 2 treaty as a priority was a mistake, particularly if there is no effort to move to the next round of arms cuts.
Mr. Bush's other prescriptions for controlling the spread of nuclear weapons were more dubious. His rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty only compounded the error made by Senate Republicans in rejecting the treaty last month. His reliance on missile defense systems underestimated the difficulties involved in developing a reliable shield. It also underemphasized the crucial matter of trying to work with Moscow to amend the antiballistic-missile treaty.
One speech cannot eliminate questions about Mr. Bush's familiarity with national security affairs. Nor did it provide a blueprint of what he would do if elected. But it was a serious effort to which the other candidates will no doubt be responding.

HEADLINE: Army Increases Incentives for Some Who Enlist

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Trying hard to fill its ranks in an era of prosperity and relative peace, the United States Army is offering bigger enlistment bonuses and shorter hitches for some recruits.
The inducements vary widely, and the Army's Web site encourages prospective soldiers to contact recruiters for more details. But even a cursory visit to the site is apt to be startling for middle-aged veterans who recall a somewhat less hospitable Army. 
 Sign-up bonuses up to $20,000 await some enlistees qualified for the specialities most in demand, like intelligence posts. Moreover, for the first time qualified recruits will not have to choose between a sign-up bonus and money for college. Some who qualify for the $20,000 bonus may also be eligible for up to $50,000 in college aid later.
Enlistees who score high enough on their military-aptitude tests can sign up for two years, instead of the traditional three, and receive up to $26,500 for college or vocational training.
The new bonuses are not a surprise in view of the military's difficulties in finding and keeping people. There has been no draft since 1973, and with a booming civilian economy there has been little incentive for many young people to join up.
For the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the Army fell short of its recruiting goal for the second straight year, recruiting about 7,000 fewer men and women than the 74,500 it said it needed. For the current fiscal year, the Army needs to recruit about 80,000 people to stay at its Congressionally mandated level.
The Air Force and Navy have also had trouble keeping up their strengths, although less than the Army. But their Web sites make it clear that they, too, recognize the need to project themselves as friendly and full of opportunities. (The Marine Corps, the smallest of the services, continues its spartan approach: "The few, the proud.")
The Army bonus offers include $4,000 for enlistees who sign up for three or more years and report for active duty no later than Dec. 27. Recruits with some college training can get $4,000 to $8,000. Enlistees who choose airborne training will get a $3,000 bonus, which can be combined with some other bonuses.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Shares Battered After Warning About Profit

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Shares of Caterpillar Inc. plummeted 12 percent today after the company warned that fourth-quarter earnings would not meet expectations.
The profit warning was the third in the last year at Caterpillar, which said yesterday that it was suffering from weaker-than-expected sales of its heavy equipment in North America. 
 Shares of Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, fell $6.75, to $49.1875, on the New York Stock Exchange. The drop also weighed down the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 31.81 points, to 11,003.89.
Caterpillar had warned earlier this year that it was having trouble in Asia and Latin America, as well as experiencing weakness in the demand for its mining equipment. But yesterday, company executives said that softening construction business in North America and increased price competition had forced the company to trim expectations.
"Demand for our type of products" has not risen to the level the company thought it would, said Marsha Hausser, a spokeswoman for Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill. "North America has been down, and the industry is softening."
The company released few details about its fourth-quarter problems, saying only that its executives had been too optimistic and that some revenue that was anticipated from a federal highway construction bill had not materialized.
In a statement early in the day, Caterpillar said it expected fourth-quarter revenue and profit to be slightly ahead of the third quarter, in which the company reported earnings of 61 cents a share on revenue of $4.7 billion.
Analysts had been projecting profit of 97 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. Wall Street analysts reacted to today's news by drastically revising their fourth-quarter estimates, though few made sharp cuts in their forecasts for next year.
"There are three factors," said Tobias Levkovich, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The marketplace is not as strong, a lot of equipment has already been replaced and interest rates are higher."
Among those who made revisions today, the consensus was that Caterpillar would earn 66 cents a share in the fourth quarter, according to Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, down from 83 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1998.
Analysts said there were indications that the construction and housing boom that had been a main driver of the nation's economic engine might have peaked, and that many construction companies might have already reached full capacity.
Although construction activity remains robust, several analysts said that some of the world's leading construction and heavy equipment makers, such as Ingersoll-Rand, Komatsu of Japan and Deere & Company, had stepped up their manufacturing activity and introduced new products and vehicles.
"There are so many manufacturers making machines; everyone's adding capacity," said David A. Bluestein, an analyst at PaineWebber. "We have a market that is still reasonably strong, but the outlook is mixed."
Despite the warnings, Caterpillar said it was witnessing a rebound in sales in Asia, and strong growth in its truck engines and financial products divisions. The company said revenue and profit next year were expected to be slightly ahead of this year; if analyst estimates are correct, profit this year could be $2.62 a share, down 36 percent from $4.11 a year ago.
After record revenue of $20.9 billion in 1998, Caterpillar has been trying to reduce costs and hoping for a turnaround in the global economy. What was unexpected, analysts said, was that North America -- which accounts for more than 55 percent of the company's revenue -- would sour for Caterpillar in the midst of a strong economy.
Last March, the company warned of an earnings slowdown, noting that profits should improve in the second half of the year. But third-quarter profits fell 34 percent, and if the revised forecasts are accurate, they mean a drop of 20 percent from near- record profits of a year ago.

HEADLINE: Trade Pacts Must Safeguard Workers, Union Chief Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Raising the stakes in labor's dispute with President Clinton over trade, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, called on the administration today to scuttle a worldwide round of trade-liberalization talks unless negotiators first take steps toward protecting workers' rights.
Mr. Sweeney, already angry about last week's trade agreement with China, said American labor unions want Mr. Clinton to persuade trade ministers gathering in Seattle on Nov. 30 to allow trade sanctions against countries that violate basic labor standards, like the ban on child labor. 
 The labor movements in the United States and in other industrialized countries are taking a much more aggressive approach toward the Seattle trade talks than toward previous rounds of negotiations, insisting that workers' rights be included in any new trade agreements. In past rounds of trade talks, corporations and developing nations prevailed with their arguments that worker rights have no place in trade accords.
In what was billed as a major address to the National Press Club here, Mr. Sweeney rejected accusations that labor's attacks on the World Trade Organization and the China deal stemmed from protectionism and isolationism.
"The debate isn't about free trade or protection, engagement or isolation," he said. "The real debate is not over whether to be part of the global economy, but over what are the rules for that economy and who makes them -- not whether to engage China, but what are the terms of that engagement, and whose values are to be represented."
Union leaders view the Seattle trade meeting as a landmark opportunity to establish for the first time a worldwide system of enforceable labor rights. Labor officials say these rights would enable workers, and not just corporations, to enjoy the fruits of expanded trade.
Mr. Sweeney said it was time to ensure that any future trade agreements take into account not just corporate concerns, but also the concerns of workers, environmentalists and human rights advocates.
Mr. Sweeney said he was pleased that President Clinton had backed labor's call to have the trade organization ministers set up a committee that would draft rules on core labor standards. But with developing countries vowing to block such a move, union leaders fear that Mr. Clinton will drop his commitment to labor rights, rather than block the planned round of worldwide trade talks from moving forward.
"Until the W.T.O. addresses these important issues, there will be no support for a major new round of trade negotiations," Mr. Sweeney said.
Some labor leaders are warning that if President Clinton leaves the Seattle talks without winning an international pledge to create a system of worker rights, he will further antagonize union members who are already fuming about his deal to let China join the W.T.O. Union leaders are angry that the administration agreed to China's membership in the trade organization without having gotten China to agree to allow independent trade unions and to free imprisoned labor leaders.
Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said: "There's no question that Bill Clinton is the single head of state fighting hardest for and leading the effort for a working group on labor. We will continue to make an all-out effort to achieve that goal."
The anger at the administration, union leaders say, might not only soften labor's support for Vice President Al Gore in his campaign for the presidency but cause a diversion of union money and manpower from Mr. Gore's race to a fight against the China trade accord and the W.T.O.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is working with environmental, consumer and human rights groups to sponsor a large rally in Seattle to protest what they see as the trade organization's pro-corporate tilt and its frequent overruling of countries' environmental and consumer protection laws.
The trade organization's meeting, scheduled to run from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2 and bring together ministers from 135 countries, aims to set ground rules for a multiyear round of trade talks that would liberalize trade in agriculture, financial services, Internet services and other areas.
As an example of how labor values might be included in trade rules, Mr. Sweeney argued that W.T.O. rules should allow China's trading partners to seek sanctions against China for using forced labor and barring trade unions.
"This is a country where anyone attempting to organize a union is immediately arrested and imprisoned -- no exceptions," Mr. Sweeney said of China.
Developing countries are seeking to block the trade organization from creating enforceable core labor standards and even from taking the preliminary step of setting up a working group on labor rights. Such core labor standards, union officials say, would include a ban on child labor and on forced labor, and a right to form trade unions and engage in collective bargaining.
Third world countries fear that allowing their trading partners to seek sanctions for violations of such labor standards would pave the way to banning their exports.
"These countries say that we'll just slap restrictions on their exports and make them poorer," said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
Thomas Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, expressed alarm at Mr. Sweeney's call on Mr. Clinton to block the new trade round unless worker protections are included. Mr. Donohue has backed creating a working group on labor.
Insisting that the new trade agreements will increase American exports and jobs, Mr. Donohue said, "I think John Sweeney and other labor leaders are smart enough to recognize that to scuttle this trade round and the China-W.T.O. deal would not be in the interests of this country, its workers, its economy or its national security. This is a watershed opportunity to bring China into the international trading system and to get it to adhere to the international law."
Mr. Sweeney's speech made clear that he would rely on an alliance with environmental, consumer and human rights groups to pressure the W.T.O. "We will continue to organize in the Congress against any trade accords that do not include workers' rights and environmental protections," he said.

Who Doesn't Want to Be a Millionaire

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
When historians look back at America as it rang in the momentous year of 2000, what will they find? Y2K panic? An outbreak of millennial spirituality? "Prosperity with a purpose"?
Guess again. What they are going to see instead is a country drunk on a TV quiz show called "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." As the countdown to the new millennium intensifies, it is impossible to exaggerate the appeal of ABC's nightly national Vesuvius of greenbacks. Even in the few days since its success landed it on the front page of The New York Times, the show's numbers have continued to soar. "The Virgin Mary, Arnold Schwarzenegger, leprechauns -- nothing could stop Regis Philbin and his mind-numbing multiple choice show," wrote Lisa de Moraes in The Washington Post, chronicling the also-ran ratings for such other network sweeps stunts as the heavily promoted spectacular "Mary, Mother of Jesus." 
 Not only is the "Millionaire" viewership huge, but in an era of "niche" audiences, when every fractionalized demographic in the nation is pandered to by its own cable channel, "Millionaire" is gathering Americans from all walks of life around the electronic hearth in the way "I Love Lucy" once did. Low-attention-span kids and surly teenagers watch. Parents watch. The elderly watch. Who could imagine a happier ending to our long siege of White House sexual revelations and workplace massacres? At last, a G-rated cultural value that unites the entire American family -- greed!
All brought to us by the wonderful world of the Disney Company, which has finally found a dirt-cheap entertainment formula that pleases Wall Street without offending any major faith. If you can find a link on the ABC Web page that doesn't lead to a "Millionaire" promotion, jokes the veteran Hollywood agent Bernie Brillstein, "the site it takes you to has Walt Disney turning over in his grave."
"We've come to a tough moment at the end of the millennium," says Rosalyn Weinman, an NBC executive who holds a doctorate in sociology. "All the stuff our parents told us didn't come true. No one cares if you're good. People only care if you're good-looking and rich." Not that NBC won't try to get its share in a gold rush: the network is shamelessly scrambling to bring back "Twenty-One," its own notorious contribution to the 1950's quiz-show scandals. How will the new "Twenty-One" be different from the old? I asked Fred Silverman, who is readying the retread in L.A. "The first thing," he replied, "is that it is not going to be fixed." The second: "more accessible" questions.
Back in the 50's it was the young Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin, on his way to the Kennedy White House, who led the contestant Charles Van Doren, the star fraud of "Twenty-One," into a Washington hearing room to confess to a disillusioned nation. At my urging this week, Mr. Goodwin caught an episode of "Millionaire" and, once he had, sounded almost nostalgic for Mr. Van Doren, who, though fed questions in advance, was at least a bona fide egghead. Mr. Goodwin thought "Millionaire" was "a joke" and has no use for its dumbed-down questions. "In the 50's," he said, "we cited these contestants as examples of how we were intellectually ahead of the Russians. The shows were designed to create heroes, people to admire and look up to for their learning and knowledge. Now they're trying to make audiences feel better about themselves."
The return of the quiz-show craze in the late 90's, Mr. Goodwin added, suggests a parallel between now and the 50's, another prosperous "time of dullness" with "really intense public apathy and little ferment over public issues." And certainly "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" gains intellectual heft when compared with the current political culture's debate over Al Gore's wardrobe. Yet affluent as the 50's were, they are nothing next to our current boom, which rivals the late-19th-century Gilded Age in terms of its creation of fabulous wealth.
Mark Twain called the Gilded Age a time of "money-lust." This week terms like "voyeurism" and "vicarious orgasms" and "ecstasy" kept popping up when I canvassed people about the late 1990's appeal of "Millionaire." In this sense, the new quiz shows were a phenomenon waiting to happen; they're the giddiest manifestations yet of a culture that offers a pornography of wealth almost everywhere you look.
"So what's it like to be worth $400 million when you're 27 years old?" asked Fortune in its cover story on "The Young and the Loaded," one recent example culled from the avalanche of media celebrations of dot-com zillionaires. (Answer: darned good.) The new Esquire features a first-person confession by an anonymous, freshly minted millionaire exulting in his financial virility in the same terms that men's magazines once celebrated sexual prowess. To up the ante on the debut night of "Millionaire" this month, ABC led into it with "Annie," the musical about the Depression-era orphan who finds happiness in the loving arms of the eponymous Daddy Warbucks. "The richest night of television!" is how the network promoted the double bill. Further gilding the already gilded lily are the relentless commercials on "Millionaire" for E*Trade, which not only invites viewers to play the market but to enter a sweepstakes that will award a million to the entrant who correctly guesses the Dow Jones average at year's end.
If this country is so rich, why are so many coveting prosperity they already have? The answer is that most people don't have it, and the gap between the haves and the have-nots -- and between the haves and the middle class -- is growing. While nearly half the country invests in stocks, 90 percent of the shares are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the households, according to studies cited by The Wall Street Journal; meanwhile, stock options have pushed the ratio of executive pay to factory-worker pay from 42 to 1 in 1980 to 419 to 1 in 1998. Nelson Aldrich Jr., the author of the memoir "Old Money," says the distribution of wealth among Americans now looks like "the pyramid on the dollar bill -- with the top sliced off and floating up by the transparent eyeball."
Americans aren't angry about these discrepancies. Politicians aren't vocal about them, with the fringe exception of Pat Buchanan -- and Donald Trump, who last week announced a confiscatory tax plan for the super-rich. Instead of getting riled, have-not and have-not-so-much Americans are looking for their own financial scores, especially quick scores. Las Vegas is our fastest-growing city. Day trading and Internet betting are in the stratosphere. According to this year's report by the federal commission on the subject, the national explosion in state lotteries and casinos has led Americans to spend far more on gambling per year than they do on groceries. For children addicted to acquisitiveness but not old enough to put cash on the table, there are chips, in the form of Pokemon cards.
In the corporate offices of television, where executives have to worry about when today's hits will fade, there seems to be unanimity about how the quiz-show fad could burn itself out. "If the economy tanks," says Dr. Weinman of NBC, "the whole thing falls apart. Then you have envy and jealousy." She is seconded by the psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who in 1955 won a total of $134,000 on "The $64,000 Question," until now the only quiz show to top TV ratings for a season, and its offshoot, "The $64,000 Challenge." Reminiscing this week, Dr. Brothers told of how she spent that long-ago windfall -- a Park Avenue medical practice for her husband, dishwashers for the rest of her family -- and also of how warmly the public responded to her winnings. She feels that the same approval accrues to 1999's quiz-show victors, at least for now. But in an economic downturn, she fears, there might be a backlash against overnight millionaires who got "something for nothing" and "did no real work."
At the height of the quiz show scandals in the 50's, John Steinbeck wrote a letter to Adlai Stevenson that The New Republic published under the headline "Have We Gone Soft?" Steinbeck wrote, "If I wanted to destroy a nation, I would give it too much and I would have it on its knees, miserable, greedy and sick. . . ." But you'll find no such jeremiads here -- or almost anywhere. Everyone loves Regis, the show is way more fun than Stone and Jane, and only a millennial-eve party pooper could imagine that the biggest bubble in the nation's history will ever burst.

The Downside of a Social Security Promise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
When President Clinton vowed in last year's State of the Union address to "save Social Security first," he in effect vowed to scuttle any attempt by Congress to use the surplus dollars in the Social Security trust fund for government programs or for tax cuts. He pledged to use the surplus money instead to pay down the federal debt.
At the time, many liberals cheered because the vow seemed a deft way to fight off a Republican plan to pass a huge tax cut for rich families. But the president's position, by locking away trillions of tax dollars, also blocks any plans liberals might have for using surplus money for traditional causes, like investing in urban schools or training disadvantaged workers. 
 Burgeoning Social Security surpluses must be used one way or another. Mr. Clinton argues that his choice -- buying back Treasury bonds from the public, thereby reducing federal debt -- is sound economic policy. He's right. But his plan is not the only sound economic use of the surplus.
Proponents of Mr. Clinton's plan point out that the policy boosts saving and private investment. When government buys back its bonds, it turns dollars over to bondholders. They, in turn, lend those dollars to companies that want to expand productive capacity. That helps the economy to grow, driving up the wages of future workers. The payoff of this plan is that high-wage workers will not feel much pain when it comes time to turn over taxes that are needed to support the elderly.
But there are other ways to boost saving and investment. Government spending on, say, early childhood education is also an act of saving and investment. Money is taken from taxpayers -- reducing their consumption -- and used to train smart workers for the future. The act of reducing consumption today in order to expand output tomorrow fits the definition of investment. So does building airports and paying for basic research.
So which is better: raising private investment by paying down the federal debt, or raising public investment by spending on schools? At that level of generality, there is no answer. Economists attack the question one project at a time -- with grunt work that tediously estimates benefits and costs.
Consider a public project to create after-school mentoring and tutoring programs for young students. According to recent research, such programs can produce large, long-lasting benefits for disadvantaged children -- cutting drug use and school absences by 45 percent or more. Those benefits can exceed the typical benefit that comes from throwing more money into private capital markets by buying back bonds.
The liberals who signed onto Mr. Clinton's Social Security vow sacrificed a lot. They agreed to keep hands off $2 trillion that is expected to flow into the trust fund over the next 10 years but not flow right back out to retirees. That decision could eliminate projects that have made up the core of the liberal agenda for more than 60 years.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS: Richard A. Posner;
Wide-Ranging Legal Thinker

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
As a federal appeals court judge, Richard A. Posner has an exalted job, but one held by a few hundred others. But to a wide swath of intellectuals, he is one of the most fascinating thinkers in the nation, especially about contemporary American social issues.
While most sitting federal judges rarely engage in public comment about subjects outside their courtrooms, Judge Posner has produced more than 30 books on a breathtakingly broad variety of subjects, including sexuality, aging, the economics of AIDS and literary criticism. Most recently, he produced a crisp legal and intellectual analysis of the investigation and impeachment of President Clinton in which he did not shrink from concluding that the president had committed perjury and obstruction of justice. 
 But Judge Posner's principal field, if one must be selected from the wide span of his work, is the intersection of law and economics. Before he joined the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, where he is now the chief judge, he was a law professor at the University of Chicago. On the campus where the Chicago School of economic thought revered the free market, he played a leading role in establishing a field of legal thought on the same foundation. It holds that most legal issues can be subjected to rational quantitative reasoning, often in the form of cost-benefit analysis.
Critics of the Chicago School argue that by elevating the value of increasing economic efficiency, the thinking is inevitably without compassion and often cruel.
Within the field of law and economics, Judge Posner has devoted an enormous amount of time to writing and thinking about antitrust law, the very area in which he has taken on a major role as mediator of any settlement talks in the Microsoft case.
While at the University of Chicago, Judge Posner produced a treatise on antitrust law in 1976 in which he projected the general libertarian skepticism over the way antitrust laws were enforced. In the book, he argues for a narrow view of antitrust law in which the best candidates for regulation are hard-core examples of price-fixing by corporate coalitions or cartels and mergers that would obviously stifle competition.
The Microsoft situation, in which a single company comes to dominate an industry, does not neatly fit into either of those categories. But as a judge and a thinker, Judge Posner has shown himself to be brazenly unpredictable on occasion.
"Richard Posner is one of the most important antitrust scholars of the past half-century," said Professor William Kovacic of the George Washington University Law School, himself a leading antitrust scholar.
Professor Kovacic said that although Judge Posner's overall approach to economic issues suggests he would be sympathetic to Microsoft, that might not be the case.
"It's a fascinating choice," he said. "Because if Richard Posner tells the government it will lose on appeal or Microsoft that it will lose on appeal, that judgment will come with an enormous amount of credibility." Judge Posner, he said, will be able to dissect the issues and probabilities of the way things may turn out, "like no other person in this country. His views will come with a towering reputation and a tremendous knowledge of the history in this area."
Before he was named to the federal bench in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Posner augmented his professional life by helping to found Lexecon Inc., a consulting firm that tried to put into practice the Chicago School theories. A large portion of Lexecon's early business when he was still a partner was advising companies as to whether their competitive practices would run afoul of antitrust laws.
As a judge, he has ruled on a few antitrust cases, with no obvious pattern in his decisions.
In 1996, writing for a unanimous appeals panel, Judge Posner ruled that it was a violation of the antitrust laws for an oil refiner to set a cap on the price of its product that retailers could charge. He wrote that he was obliged to rule that way in State Oil Company v. Kahn because of a well-established principle of antitrust law, but his opinion included a long argument as to why the principle was outdated and should be scrapped.
The next year, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling, adopting Judge Posner's criticism of the precedent.
In 1986, the Hospital Corporation of America sought to appeal a ruling from the Federal Trade Commission, which had disallowed a merger. Judge Posner upheld the commission, in a decision that Professor Kovacic said demonstrated that he was not a reflexive opponent of antitrust enforcement decisions.
In 1995, Judge Posner wrote a ruling that his critics said demonstrated his commitment to emphasizing economic efficiency. He ruled that thousands of hemophiliacs who contracted H.I.V. from a blood-clotting medicine could not join a lawsuit against the drug companies because such an action could "hurl the industry into bankruptcy."
Last month, Judge Posner wrote the dissenting opinion as the Seventh Circuit, by a 5-to-4 vote, upheld the constitutionality of laws in Illinois and Wisconsin that criminalize a late-term abortion procedure that opponents call "partial birth" abortion. Judge Posner's minority opinion said the laws were questionable because they were designed only to dramatize the ugliness of abortion, not to reduce the number of them.
Richard Allen Posner was born in New York City on Jan. 11, 1939, the child of Max and Blanche Posner.
Judge Posner is the father of two grown sons, one a law professor and one an investment banker. He and his wife, Charlene, also have three grandchildren. In addition to family pictures in his chamber, Judge Posner keeps a photograph of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. prominently displayed. Judge Posner was a clerk for Justice Brennan after he completed his studies at Harvard Law School, where he graduated first in his class in 1962 and served as president of the law review. His undergraduate degree is from Yale, where he was an English major.
It was his background in literature, he has said, that drew him to write an account of President Clinton's impeachment. In explaining why he wrote "An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment and Trial of President Clinton," he described both President and Hillary Clinton as having produced a drama worthy of Shakespeare.
The circuit court he administers covers Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. In addition to his judicial duties and relentless writing, he still carries a one-third teaching load at the University of Chicago Law School.
At 60, he likes to forsake the elevator every few days, he recently told a visitor, and climb the stairs to his office on the 27th floor of the Everett M. Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago. This summer, when the power was shut off in the building, he trekked up to his office where he was one of the few people at work.

HEADLINE: Colombia Tries, Yet Cocaine Thrives

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MAGUARE, Colombia

 BODY:
Under American pressure, for most of this decade the Colombian government has been sending planes to spray herbicides on the fields of coca that flourish in areas like this. With a new, more cooperative government in power in Bogota, last year was a banner year for that joint effort, with a record 135,000 acres fumigated.
But 1998 also turned out to be a record year for cocaine production in Colombia. By official estimate, acreage devoted to the cultivation of coca, the plant that provides the raw material for cocaine, surged more than 25 percent and is now three times larger than in 1994. Colombia has passed Peru and Bolivia to become both the largest grower and processor of coca in the world. 
 All told, at least 180,000 acres are now given over to coca cultivation, according to a survey made public by Colombia's Anti-Narcotics Police in September. An additional 14,000 acres are used for growing heroin poppies, another illicit crop that is booming despite the American-financed spraying campaign. Such crops were grown in only 10 of Colombia's 33 provinces five years ago, but are now cultivated in 21, the survey estimated.
The reasons for this surge, which is continuing, are many. American officials say the success of air interdiction efforts in Peru and Bolivia has forced traffickers to shift cultivation here.
The surge has also coincided with an intensification of Colombia's decades-old war against leftist guerrillas, with each fueling the other. The rebels earn money by selling protection to the growers, who are then free to cultivate still more crops without fear of interdiction.
Colombia acknowledges that more than three-quarters of all coca cultivation is concentrated here in the province of Caqueta and neighboring Putumayo, both strongholds of the country's largest rebel force, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The group operates at will across much of southern Colombia.
At the same time, American and Colombian officials have gradually come to realize that simple economic logic has propelled the explosion of coca production as much as the ebb and flow of the civil war.
Since the collapse of the Cali and Medellin cartels -- the two groups that dominated the cocaine trade until their leaders were arrested or killed in the mid-1990's -- trafficking groups too small to be regarded as cartels have proliferated. In striving to build supply networks of their own, they have provided credit to peasant farmers.
"You've got a much more decentralized situation with a lot more actors, well over 100, and that has increased demand," said Bruce Bagley, a University of Miami professor who is a leading academic expert on the drug trade.
"They don't have the capital or the equipment to fly coca in from Peru or Bolivia."
Colombian trafficking groups have also been experimenting with more potent varieties of coca, Col. Jose Leonardo Gallego, chief of the Anti-Narcotics Police, said in an interview while flying over this rebel-dominated region.
With the help of agronomists hired for the purpose, they have imported a type of coca native to Peru and grafted it onto the weaker species traditionally grown here to create a powerful hybrid.
"Now you have a variety that can be harvested six to eight times a year," Dr. Bagley said. "So along with the expanded area under cultivation, you get much greater productivity per plant and a higher alkaloid content, which means much less cost in refining and a bigger bang for your buck."
Furthermore, while the United States and Colombia may agree on the extent of the coca problem, they often diverge on solutions. The Colombian government has long had doubts about spraying campaigns and prefers to focus on crop substitution, but because the United States insists on spraying -- and is willing to pick up the costs -- that approach has been emphasized.
"To me, fumigation makes no sense," said Armando Borrero, a former national security adviser to the Colombian government, expressing a view often heard in official circles in Bogota. "It only forces the migration of cultivation."
In recent years, this area of rolling hills and fertile forest has been not only a prime region for growing coca but also a laboratory for efforts to check its spread. Three years ago, coca growers fought pitched battles with the police just south of here in an attempt to disrupt such efforts.
Nowadays, though, farmers here seem more willing to shift away from coca. The National Plan for Alternative Development, a government agency that seeks to wean peasants from coca to legitimate crops like coffee and sugar cane, operates a pilot rubber-producing program here that has attracted dozens of peasant families.
"It is a relief not to have the law after me anymore," said Nidia Perdomo, who grew coca for eight years before stopping in 1998. "You can grow as much rubber as you want, and you don't have any conflict with the police or the guerrillas."
The farmers' interest in abandoning coca may stem partly from a growing resentment of the guerrillas, who have been increasingly unwilling to pay the market price for coca paste as they have extended their control. At local markets, the guerrillas have imposed a ceiling of about $410 a pound for paste; elsewhere, traffickers offer up to $570.
When asked if it was the spraying campaign that made them stop growing coca, Ms. Perdomo, 41, and her brother Miller, 49, said no. "The problem with coca is that the profits do not go to those who grow it," she said. "The intermediaries make all the money while you are barely surviving."
Peasants eking out a living from small coca operations, however, often end up prime targets of the government's fumigation campaign. In addition, the spraying appears at times to undermine alternative crop programs based on rubber, palm and fruit trees.
Legitimate farmers commonly complain of being pushed into poverty after planes mistakenly spray herbicides on fields in which no coca is growing, or because pilots deliberately dump their chemicals.
"When you spray indiscriminately, as they often do around here, you kill off the rubber trees as well as the coca plants," said Jesus Bastidas, president of the Caqueta Rubber-Growing and Reforestation Association.
Juan Carlos Claros Pinzon, the crop substitution agency's director for Caqueta province, said: "Spraying works fine with large-scale commercial cultivation, but when it is aimed at the smaller producers, it creates a social problem and only makes our work more difficult. When we show our project to a person who has been left with absolutely nothing, he says, 'That will be fine in a year, but I am hungry today.' "
Many peasants then simply choose to become "raspachines," or day laborer hired to tend and harvest coca on large plantations. Those jobs typically pay $7.50 a day plus meals, twice the going wage for a worker on a legitimate farm.
Using the slang term for those who run the drug trade, Wenceslao Villa, operations director for the alternative development agency founded in 1996, described the problem this way: "You fumigate, and the narcos follow behind, offering support and financing" to the peasants.
A lack of money has hurt the alternative crop strategy favored by the Colombian government. Mr. Claros learned that firsthand when he recently visited rebel leaders in San Vicente del Caguan, capital of the demilitarized zone that the Colombian government handed over to the rebel group last November. The hope was to get peace talks started, but the zone is now the focal point of the guerrillas' drug operations.
"One guerrilla commander asked me how much money I can spend in a year," Mr. Claros recalled. "I answered that I have a budget of $4 million and he nearly laughed in my face. To them that is nothing -- what they pay in one weekend at two or three peasant markets to buy coca paste."
The proposal for American aid to Colombia now before Congress contains a sizable increase meant for alternative development programs like the one here. But for the foreseeable future, the American focus is likely to be on aerial spraying, much to the dismay of Colombian officials who believe the program inadvertently helps the enemy.
"The day after, it looks like you dropped napalm, but four months later it is all flowering again," Mr. Villa said. "You've actually done them a favor by cleaning up the lot."

HEADLINE: Far From New York, Prayers for a Victim but No Curses for the City

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Tex., Nov. 19

 BODY:
The members of the First Baptist Church here have been saying nearly continuous prayers for Nicole Barrett since Wednesday, taking turns in hourlong shifts in front of a wooden cross in a room attached to the church's gymnasium, where they sit or kneel and ask God to grant her a speedy recovery. They have been at it since word first spread through East Texas that their former neighbor had been seriously injured in Manhattan by a man who had fractured her skull with a brick.
Ms. Barrett, 27, a native of Athens, was attacked on Tuesday afternoon while she was walking near the intersection of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue. It was the latest in a string of frightening assaults on people in New York's public spaces. She was placed on the First Baptist Church prayer list within a day, and has been the topic of countless conversations here ever since. 
 But the Rev. Kyle L. Henderson, the church's senior pastor, said that while the attack on Ms. Barrett -- especially its brutality and unfathomable randomness -- has been a subject of intense talk, a key element is missing from the discussion: blame for New York City, where the young woman had gone to try her prospects but where she is now suffering from a severe brain trauma she received while merely walking down the street.
With her parents at her side, Ms. Barrett is at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where hospital officials said yesterday that her condition was improving.
"There's been an improvement in her level of wakefulness," said Lorinda Klein, a hospital spokeswoman. "They've seen movement in all four extremities. She's opened her eyes and closed them again. She is moving her arms and her legs; this is a good sign."
Ms. Barrett's brother Scott told a Fox Five News reporter last night that the attack would probably not dampen his sister's enthusiasm for New York. "She liked the city so much it wouldn't surprise us if she came back," he said.
In Athens, Mr. Henderson said, residents were horrified by what has befallen Ms. Barrett. But few people in this city of 12,000 think that the assault is a reflection on New York, which he said seemed no more dangerous than many other places in America. "I don't think that New York really has the reputation here in the South of the way it used to be talked about," he said. "It's not a place where people say the social fabric is breaking down. This week it happened in New York. Next week it could be Oklahoma City. It could be Fort Worth."
Mr. Henderson's words, echoed in two dozen interviews in this city 70 miles southeast of Dallas where Texas prairie gives way to Southern forest, appear to represent a palpable swing in public perception of the city and the dangers it holds.
In 1990, when Brian Watkins, a high school tennis champion visiting from Utah, was stabbed and killed by muggers on a Midtown subway platform, there was a public uproar, leading to calls for more policing in a city that much of America thought was out of control.
Mr. Watkins died after trying to defend his mother, who had been kicked in the head. New York, it seemed, was a metaphor for urban lawlessness.
The assault on Ms. Barrett, however, has been met with a quiet reaction among the people who knew the victim or her family. People here pray for her recovery. Otherwise, the mood is restrained -- a product, residents say, of their awareness that school and workplace shootings have been taking place in cities large and small, and their sense that New York has become increasingly safe in recent years.
"There's a whole lot of meanness in the world, not in New York in particular," said E. Herbert Gatlin Jr., a former mayor of Athens and now director of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "In fact, when you look at the number of people in Dallas that get shot, beat, hit and killed, I think Dallas might be meaner than New York."
Athens is a quintessential small Southern city, where pecan shells litter the sidewalks and handshakes are firm. The city's center is a courthouse ringed by one- and two-story shops. Its past is rich in cotton farming and brick manufacturing -- two products of the area's dark, clay-streaked soil. Its present includes a belt of strip malls that could be found anywhere in America, and two large employers -- Champion Homes Inc., which makes mobile homes, and Maxxim Medical, a surgical supplies manufacturer.
Crime is not unknown here. Recent federal statistics show that the local police record 1 or 2 murders a year, and as many as 9 rapes and 33 car thefts. But residents say the overall incidence of crime is low, and they feel safe.
And though they shudder at its details, most Athens residents seem to see no larger significance to the assault on Ms. Barrett than that described by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has portrayed it as a random act of violence that should not sully the reputation of New York City.
In fact, some Athens residents who have recently visited New York said the attack had given them pause to reflect on how much the city seemed to have improved from the days when it was legendary for its drug wars and drive-by shootings. This was true of former Mayor Gatlin, who said he was startled by the city's gritty and menacing feel 15 years ago, when he traveled to Manhattan to secure a municipal bond, and surprised "at how clean and well-lighted" it was during a recent trip.
It was also true for Sandra S. Abadie, youth coordinator at the First United Methodist Church, who made her first trip to Manhattan on Nov. 4.
"We saw the opera, we saw the plays, we rode on the subways and I never felt unsafe," she said. "The time I had was so fantastic, it just changed my whole impression of what I had heard about New York."
Those in Athens who had a bad impression of New York said it stemmed from a general preference for rural areas, rather than a belief that New York was a magnet for crime. "I don't like large cities in particular," said Daniel W. Rogers, family minister at the Eastern Hills Church of Christ. "Well, I guess I like Dallas -- in my rear-view mirror."
Even among the people who know Ms. Barrett, the appeal of New York was untarnished. Cheryl McMillan, whose daughter Misty was a close friend of Ms. Barrett's when they grew up, stood outside Athens High School on Thursday night and dabbed a tear. She was deeply troubled by the thought of Ms. Barrett lying injured in a hospital bed, but that thought did not change her sense of the city, a place where talent finds opportunity and cultural life thrives, she said.
"My youngest daughter is fixing to go to N.Y.U.," she said. "She's an honors student all the way, in theater and literature, and she wants to try it.
"She's fixing to go, and I won't stop her."

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
CROSSING: A Memoir, by Deirdre McCloskey. (University of Chicago, $25.) An economist and historian of considerable distinction who decided at 52 to become a woman focuses more on the emotional evolution of the crossover than its surgical side (though that was grueling enough).
 
HOMESICKNESS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $14.) An Australian novel that cogitates on the dubious pleasures of mass tourism as a group of 13 follows a senseless itinerary through surreal and baffling museums.
 
LIVES OF THE POETS, by Michael Schmidt. (Knopf, $35.) This big book (940 pages plus bibliography and index) is a history of English poetry from the 14th century to the present, by a British publisher and editor who has read about everything and does not fear to evaluate.
 
LOSING NELSON, by Barry Unsworth. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A provocative, absorbing novel whose mad hero hides from his own life by his elaborate identification with Admiral Nelson, a folly he understands well enough to labor at the same time to destroy it.
 
MY MOVIE BUSINESS: A Memoir, by John Irving. (Random House, $19.95.) A measured and genial personal history of seeing Irving's novels made (or not made) into movies; the rancor with which book people are often said to regard film people is nowhere, or hardly anywhere, apparent.
 
PASSAGE TO JUNEAU: A Sea and Its Meanings, by Jonathan Raban. (Pantheon, $26.50.) This hydrophilic traveler describes a physical and intellectual journey with a 35-foot ketch, some books and a deep alertness to what the sea has been up to for the Indians and their successors.
 
RIGHTEOUS VICTIMS: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999, by Benny Morris. (Knopf, $40.) A clinical and credible work by an Israeli historian whose narrative begins with the arrival of the first Zionists and identifies the reciprocal misunderstandings and economies of truth that have plagued both sides ever since.
 
SILENT STARS, by Jeanine Basinger. (Knopf, $35.) A film historian argues that many of the stars of the silents wielded talent and cultural scope that have been forgotten as the films themselves were forgotten, lost or just unseen.
 
SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE, by John Rolfe Gardiner. (Knopf, $24.) A thoughtful, well-built novel whose hero, an American doctor in World War I, becomes estranged from his family and ensorcelled by a French nurse and healer.
 
THE TINY ONE, by Eliza Minot. (Knopf, $22.) Ostensibly an elegy for a mother, this persuasive novel inspects the questing, swerving quality of the life and mind of an 8-year-old girl from her own perspective and those of others.

HEADLINE: Paranoid Enemies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his review of Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin's book, "The Sword and the Shield" (Oct. 31), Joseph E. Persico observes, "Paranoia seems to have been a communicable disease in the Kremlin." This is purportedly manifest in the Russian leaders' "absolute conviction that the United States intended a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union." 
 But consider the background: (1) The United States had already dropped the bomb on the Japanese. (2) The United States later maintained thousands of nuclear weapons permanently targeted at the Soviet Union. (3) The United States in 1954 offered two atomic weapons to France for use at Dienbienphu, an offer that was rejected by the French in order to protect their own troops.
(4) The United States openly threatened nuclear war over Cuba in 1962. (5) The United States consistently refused to adopt a "no first-strike" policy in its official nuclear stance.
Given these and other such precedents, Soviet "paranoia" seems a reasonable inference rather than a mere fantasy.
Incidentally, throughout the cold war American military doctrine was founded on the supposed axiom that a Soviet invasion of Western Europe was imminent. (Remember all those zealous Sovietologists who made a career out of counting Warsaw Pact tanks?) Given what was also well known about both the inefficiency of the Soviet economy and the low morale of Warsaw Pact troops, it is the American stance that truly qualifies as paranoid in its irrationality.

Hong Kong Is Hoping Disney Magic Rubs Off

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
EVER since it was handed back to China in July 1997, this former British colony has worried obsessively about what it was going to become. Now, it has an answer: Hong Kong will be the next outpost in the Disney empire.
This month, the Walt Disney Company announced plans to build a theme park here, its third outside the United States and second in Asia, after Tokyo Disneyland. While it would be cynical to say that this metropolis of 6.8 million will be defined by Mickey Mouse, it is hard to overstate the impact that officials here believe a Disneyland will have on Hong Kong's image and its tourism industry. 
 "We kind of faded out of the spotlight after 1997, and everybody wrote us off," said Mike Rowse, Hong Kong's tourism commissioner. "This project tells the world that we are alive and kicking."
As the man who negotiated the $3.6 billion deal to bring Disney to Hong Kong, Mr. Rowse is understandably keen to prove its worth. He contends that Hong Kong Disneyland, which is to open in 2005, will pump $19 billion into the economy over four decades, much of it through a revived tourist trade.
Mr. Rowse said that the theme park would attract 1.4 million additional visitors to Hong Kong in its first year, and 2.9 million more annually by the time it is fully developed in 2020. If these projections are accurate -- and the 17.5 million people a year who visit Tokyo Disneyland suggest they might be -- the park would reverse a steady erosion in tourist arrivals since the handover.
Last year, Hong Kong drew 9.5 million visitors, an 8 percent decline from 1997. Much of that can be attributed to the regional economic crisis. But even before that, Hong Kong was becoming less popular. In 1996, nearly 12 million people visited Hong Kong. Many were eager for a last look at a British colonial outpost. Once the Union Jack came down, the crowds went elsewhere.
Officials here note that the number of arrivals has rebounded 11 percent so far this year. But nobody disputes that Hong Kong needed a jolt -- something to remind tourists that it is still probably the most cosmopolitan city in Asia.
Disney executives said Hong Kong's international character was a key reason they chose it over Shanghai and other mainland cities that were lobbying to be the site of the first Chinese Disneyland.
"It's just an incredibly exciting city," said Judson C. Green, chairman of Disney's theme-park division. "It always has been, irrespective of the financial crisis."
Mr. Green said Disney was also attracted by Hong Kong's infrastructure. With a spectacular year-old airport and a gleaming network of roads, railways, tunnels and bridges, Hong Kong is one of Asia's easiest cities to get to and get around in. The site for the proposed Disneyland is in a quiet bay on Lantau Island, conveniently midway between central Hong Kong and the airport and not far from a high-speed train that connects the two.
Like other Magic Kingdoms, the park will have shops, restaurants and theaters -- some with an Asian flavor. It will also have three or four hotels, with a total of 2,100 rooms. Although the hotels could compete with those in Kowloon or central Hong Kong, few hoteliers seem worried.
"It will be a boon for all the hotels, because it will put Hong Kong back on the map," said Robert Hutchinson, former group director of marketing at Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, a leading Asian chain.
Mr. Hutchinson said that business people traveling to Hong Kong would have an incentive to bring their families; they could stay in the city for a week, then tack on an extra couple of days at a Disney hotel.
To be successful, Hong Kong's Disneyland will also have to attract millions of visitors from mainland China. Officials here said that they planned to work with Beijing to streamline the visa procedures. With opening day five years away, officials are confident of reaching an accommodation.
Even as Disneyland is poised to draw more Chinese visitors to Hong Kong, some people here fret that it will rob the city of its Chinese character. Disney's goal in Hong Kong -- as in Paris and Tokyo -- is to create an idealized version of America that pays little heed to the folkways of the host country.
"At the end of the day, what makes a city great is its ethnic identity," said David Tang, the founder of Shanghai Tang, a boutique that sells pricey clothing with a retro-Mao flavor, mostly to tourists. "This is a Chinese city. We have to cultivate these Chinese elements."
But Mr. Tang is a lonely dissenter. After years of worrying about its future -- fears that were compounded by the Asian crisis -- Hong Kong seems willing to bear the cultural baggage of Disney so long as it brings the crowds back. Besides, people here are used to foreign powers with global ambitions.

HEADLINE: Turn Left at Cloud 109

BYLINE: By James Fallows; James Fallows, the author of "Breaking the News" and other books, is a magazine writer based in Seattle.

 BODY:
On a business trip this fall I had what is becoming the standard airline experience. Nine p.m., arrived at Detroit's main airport, then waited until 10 p.m. for the baggage to appear. Next night's flight out of Detroit was delayed two hours -- and eventually canceled, around midnight, followed by a stay at the airport hotel and a 6 a.m. departure. An air trip from one off-the-main-route location (Allentown, Pa.) to another (Hartford) took longer than it would have by car, because of hub-and-spoke routing through Philadelphia. Plus, there was the traveling person's toll of Dead Time: the hours lost in taxis to and from airports, in lines at the check-in counter and security gate, in the aisle of the plane itself, waiting for victors to emerge in the battles for space in the overhead racks. Need I mention mini-pretzels as meals?
I know, travel complaints are boring if they're not happening to you. And complaints of any kind can seem unfair. The airlines are so safe. Their fares can be so cheap, if you're able to book weeks in advance and not change your plans. When everything goes smoothly -- no lines, no delays, no behemoth in the seat ahead of you reclining into your lap -- it can seem miraculous to be transported so far so fast. 
 But while trapped on a behind-schedule plane it can be tempting to dream of another possibility. Suppose there were an efficient way to travel that departed as soon or as late as you desired and went directly where you wanted to go (rather than to the Major Airline Hub that is least-far-distant from your destination). A way that didn't involve the hours of padding time to allow for unexpected lines and hassles at the airport. A way that didn't require the Gulf Streams or other multimillion-dollar corporate jets that now spare the rich the annoyances of commercial travel.
A tiny company based in Duluth, Minn., named Cirrus Design believes that it can offer a glimpse of such a new, futuristic transportation system. The company was founded by the Klapmeier brothers, Alan and Dale. Their basic idea is to build small airplanes that ordinary people will find simple and safe enough to fly, that are fast enough to beat the airlines on door-to-door speed for short- and medium-length trips and that are inexpensive enough, relatively speaking, to appeal to those who already constitute the market for fancy cars, expensive R.V.'s and vacation homes.
The oddest aspect of the vision may be that the United States government has implicitly embraced it as a feasible next step in avoiding transportation jams. Interstate highways are saturated; the hub-and-spoke airline system is overloaded, too; trains are suited mainly to densely settled corridors like Boston-Washington. NASA, the agency best known for explorations of space, is quietly advocating an "Interstate SkyWay" network, the name conjuring images from "The Jetsons."
"A small-aircraft transportation system," says Bruce Holmes, a senior NASA official, could "satisfy a large portion of the demand for Information Age mobility and accessibility, effectively unleashing the new economy's potential for standard of living and quality of life."
But before small planes can join the car in the family garage, they'll have to seem roughly as safe as the car, especially in the wake of prominent recent crashes. On July 20, after the United States Coast Guard shifted from a "rescue" to a "recovery" mission for John F. Kennedy Jr. and the Bessette sisters, Cirrus delivered the very first model of its SR20, the plane that it hopes will begin a new era in personal transportation, to its very first customer.
The Cirrus SR20, which was created by the Klapmeier brothers, does not have a perfect record. In March, Cirrus's chief test pilot, Scott Anderson, died in a crash as he put the SR20 through torture-test maneuvers before it went on sale. The company identified and corrected the defect that killed Anderson, a widely respected figure in Duluth, and received federal approval to go ahead with deliveries of the plane. Still, despite this disaster, the Klapmeier brothers can plausibly claim that the Cirrus SR20 is designed to be safer than any small plane now in service.
The contradictory elements of small-plane flight -- its inherent freedom and peril -- were intensified for me, as for everyone, by Kennedy's death. I had learned to fly about the time he did and took the check ride for an instrument rating four days after his crash. I had followed Cirrus's development for several years in the aviation press. The more I heard about their plans, the more I wanted to believe that they had, at last, created an aircraft that was fast and fun to fly, but exposed pilot and passengers to substantially less risk.
And so, in late September, I took a commercial flight to Los Angeles (90 minutes ground delay, air-traffic pileup at LAX), and prepared to fly halfway across the country in an SR20.
On my arrival in Los Angeles I was met by two men from Cirrus, Gary Black and Tom Bergeron. Black, the company's director of flight operations, is in his mid-40's; he's tall and lanky, with short black hair and the demeanor of a Navy flyer, which he once was. Bergeron, a Cirrus salesman, is in his early 50's, with wavy hair and an aggressively friendly air. He drove us a dozen miles inland from LAX to El Monte Airport, where the plane waited.
There are roughly 4,600 public airports in the United States that are open to anyone but have no scheduled commercial flights (versus the 46 big airports that account for 75 per cent of all airline traffic, and the 660 total that airlines serve). El Monte resembled a big shopping center -- one whose main Sears or Sports Authority buildings had somehow been vaporized -- with a vast paved lot, part of which was marked as a runway. Like other small airports, it looks like the aviation version of an antique car show.
Most of the 190,000 small planes still flying in the United States are aging veterans, and the typical small airport is lined with Cessnas that were designed 40 years ago or more -- like the stolid 172 Skyhawk, with its hammered sheet metal and its old-fashioned high wing -- and have been kept running through loving maintenance ever since. They are reliable but inelegant. Small propeller planes occupy a strange economic gray zone. New ones are quite expensive -- $150,000 and above for the humblest Cessna, half a million dollars and up for fast, fancy planes like the newer version of the Piper Saratoga that John Kennedy flew. But the great majority of sales are for used planes, typically 20 or more years old. And these can cost not much more than a fancy car or R.V. -- from $30,000 or $40,000 up to the high five figures.
A new Cirrus was initially priced at $144,500, with options, and has since risen to $179,400. In the airplane world, that is seen as cheap. The Cessna available for about the same price is much slower and less comfortable, and the Mooneys or Bonanzas that fly as fast cost twice as much. Another all-new plane soon to go on sale, the Lancair Columbia, is faster but more expensive.
There on the tarmac at El Monte, the SR20 was the general-aviation equivalent of an Audi A4 or BMW. The shape was streamlined, constructed of fiberglass rather than metal. The cockpit windows were big and bulbous, almost like those of a helicopter. The wings were low and set slightly behind the cockpit, with a little cuff, or change in the wing shape, halfway out along their length.
Gary Black opened the Cirrus's semi-gull-wing doors and got in the left-hand, pilot's seat; I got in the right. Bergeron, flying commercial back to Dallas, waved goodbye. Inside, the plane was curved and sleek, like today's best cars, using new material and geometry to maximize space and visibility.
"Most metal airplanes are made like mailboxes," says Mike Van Staagen, who oversaw the design of Cirrus's interior. "They're two-dimensional curves, and they're kind of hammered together with harsh angles." The effect of a hundred details make the Cirrus cockpit seem like a first-class seat, compared with the Aeroflot coach seat of the typical aging small plane. With a console between its leather seats, the plane has that new-car feeling. And where the classic aluminum airplane has the narrow shape of a cigar tube, the Cirrus takes a raindrop approach. The cabin is significantly rounder -- wider and taller -- but it still moves through the air with less drag. It is aerodynamic enough that the Cirrus can cruise at 160 knots (184 miles per hour) on the same 200-horsepower engine that takes a Piper Arrow only to 138 knots (159 m.p.h.). Because of its "slipperiness" in the air, it gets better gas mileage than some cars, cruising at 19 miles per gallon.
No one at El Monte seemed to know what this thing was: the control tower addressed each of the planes waiting to taxi by its model and number. "Cessna Two Charlie Bravo, cleared for takeoff on runway one-nine." When the controller got to the Cirrus, he said: "Uhhhh, you in the low-wing plane, follow the Cessna on takeoff. Bonanza Six Nine Sierra, give way to that other plane."
"That other plane" pulled to the start of the runway and was cleared to go. Black smoothly pushed in the throttle lever, the Cirrus reached its rotation, or liftoff, speed of 65 knots, and we began our aerial survey of Los Angeles. The plane climbed and turned easily, controlled by a little side stick, as in a military fighter, rather than a large yoke, as in most planes. A computer panel, like one in an upscale laptop, showed us where we were at all times with a "moving map" of obstacles, features and airports ahead.
Airline travel has been so utterly drained of romance that it is startling how interesting flight can seem when you are 2,000 or 3,000 feet, instead of 35,000, above the surface and you can look all around at scenery as it comes at you, rather than just out a little pane to the side. As Dale Klapmeier put it: "Visibility is a surprisingly large part of comfort. You're far more 'comfortable' flying in an airplane you can see out of than one where you're trying to get your head up over the panel."
We headed east over the Los Angeles Basin, seeing how freeways stitched its component cities into one great sprawl, following the visible marks of fire, flood and tectonic strain. We deviated south for a few miles to fly over the town where I grew up, circling until I was sure I'd picked out my parents' house -- and then headed straight for the San Bernardino Mountains, which separate the basin from the Mojave Desert. In the clear skies, we were operating under "visual flight rules," responsible for seeing and avoiding other planes.
An hour out of El Monte, we saw the towers of Las Vegas to our left, surprisingly concentrated and small-looking in the vast desert. Airliners descended past us from overhead toward the airport. We were like scuba divers watching giant fish swim past. Over Boulder Dam, blazing white against the serpentine blue lake, the controller alerted us to the waves of sightseeing planes headed toward the same destination at the same altitude. We moved across higher terrains, toward the canyon lands of Utah.
After circling over colorful rock formations for pictures and a view, we decided to stop at Bryce Canyon Airport, landing on what seemed an inexplicably long runway, suitable for LAX or J.F.K. Gary Black doesn't like to make hotel reservations. He enjoys the spontaneity of landing where he wants and seeing what's there. We taxied to a hangar that looked like a barn. Local pilots came out of the building to inspect this new plane.
The Klapmeier brothers were both obsessed by flight from an early age. Alan, the older of the two, says he dreamed of being a military pilot and cried when he got glasses in third grade and had to give up that fantasy. Nonetheless, he took flying lessons in high school. When Alan went to college, he bought a 1947-vintage Cessna airplane, and Dale and his parents also took lessons. "Dale is one of the few people who got to use the family airplane before he used the family car," Alan says.
Alan, now 41, has a stocky build and squarish face and a tendency to make wisecracks. Dale, 38, is taller, with a longer face and more sober air. By the time both were out of college, the brothers decided to start their own business building "kitplanes." Kitplane makers sell components of airplanes to hobbyists who then spend hundreds or thousands of hours welding and bolting them together. The brothers set up shop in a barn behind their parents' house, which was then near Baraboo, Wis. They searched scrap yards for spare parts, borrowing money from their parents.
Their first plane was a futuristic-looking cigar-shaped craft with one huge propeller in the back of the plane. It was made of fiberglass, which allowed a more aerodynamic shape, making the plane faster than standard metal planes. The brothers trekked from air show to air show, confident that when people got a look at this VK-30 quasi-rocketship, they would rush to buy the kits. Almost no one did.
"We were looking for people with a couple hundred thousand dollars to spend and the skill and time to put years of work into it," Dale Klapmeier now says. "Those people are not out there." The brothers stayed in business by designing a similar version of the plane for a company in Israel. And they started over, determined this time to tie their vision to market demands.
Perhaps the biggest problem facing the brothers' aspiring airplane company was the dwindling supply of customers. During World War II, vast numbers of Americans received flight training, and as that generation matured and prospered, the total number of active pilots rose to a peak of 827,000 by 1980. Then it began falling steadily, to a low of 616,000 in 1997. The only thing falling faster was the production of new planes. In 1978, Cessna, Piper and other companies sold a total of nearly 18,000 new aircraft. By 1994, their annual production was below 1,000. Although it has nearly doubled since then, the 192,000 planes in the general-aviation fleet are on average very old, since so few new ones have been built in the last 20 years.
The big aircraft companies insisted that liability-insurance premiums were the main cause of the production drop. And in the mid-1990's, Congress, backed by the aviation industry, pushed through the General Aviation Revitalization Act, which put an 18-year limit on manufacturers' liability for accident claims involving their airplanes. Since Cessna and Piper had sold virtually no small planes in the preceding 18 years, this greatly reduced their liability.
But the Klapmeiers reasoned that insurance was only part of the problem. "They weren't giving people a reason to buy," Alan says. Year after year, the manufacturers offered the same planes -- the Cessna 172, the Piper Archer, the Beech Bonanza -- each essentially the same as the year before, only more expensive.
"It was simply a value question," Alan says. "Somewhere in the late 1970's, you got to a situation where you could buy a new airplane for X dollars, or you could buy a 2-year-old version, with 200 flying hours, for one-half X. The lack of product improvement simply added up to bad value." The problem, he says, was like Detroit's in the 1970's -- without any invigorating challenge from the Japanese.
The Klapmeiers decided to become the Japanese. Three great obstacles, they argued, were keeping an increasingly prosperous public from buying planes -- cost, comfort and safety. And the perception that flying was unreasonably dangerous was keeping people out of the sky.
The next morning, at Bryce Canyon, it was my turn to sit in the left seat. As I taxied,I suddenly understood the runway's enormous scale. The elevation of Bryce Canyon's airport is nearly 7,600 feet, one of the highest in the United States. At that altitude the air is so thin that the plane had to struggle to find enough air to support it. We rolled down the runway, using 1,000 feet of distance, 2,000, 3,000, enough that the plane would have been aloft anywhere else. Finally it was going fast enough to build sufficient air pressure for lift. It edged up, and we headed toward the surrounding peaks.
For the next three hours, thin air and mighty peaks were the theme. Finally, as turbulence picked up from a storm moving through the northern Rockies, we went to 15,500 feet -- an altitude at which we were required to breathe oxygen. Objectively we were fine -- 4,000 feet over the nearest mountains, in a strong new plane just purring along, but the nonobjective part of my brain began to worry. The peaks below were menacing; in my mind, I started ticking off the safety features of the plane.
Over the last 50 years, small airplanes, like big ones, have become far more reliable mechanically. Year by year, the number of deaths in general aviation has declined. In 1998, there were 361 crashes, killing 621 people. The fatal-accident rate per hours flown was the lowest ever, 1.35 per 100,000 hours. So far in 1999 there have been fewer deaths, with more hours flown. Mechanical failures account for about 10 percent of all fatalities. The great majority of people who die in small planes die the way John Kennedy apparently did: by suddenly getting into "instrument meteorological conditions" -- flying inside a cloud, in haze, over water or unlighted terrain at night or in some other way that prevents a pilot from seeing the horizon -- in which a mechanically sound plane can no longer be controlled. For reasons that sound unconvincing until you try it yourself, it's impossible to keep an airplane level when you can't see the horizon -- unless you have been trained to comprehend the artificial-horizon and other instruments in the plane.
There's an assumption in aviation that if you don't like these potential hazards, you should stick to cars. But the Klapmeiers disagree. "No matter how good a pilot is, he's inevitably going to make mistakes," Alan says. "The cost of the mistakes shouldn't be death." The question for the Klapmeiers, as they tried to design a new plane, was how to make one that reduced both the opportunities for human error and the fatalities when errors unavoidably occur.
One way was to reduce the "pilot workload" -- all those switches to flip and gauges to check -- involved in flying a plane. Therefore the Cirrus was designed with fixed rather than retractable wheels (to avoid the "My God, did I lower the gear?" panic just before landing) and a variety of other simplified controls. The cuffs on the Cirrus's wings, the first Federal Aviation Administration-approved application of this concept, which was developed at NASA, allow the pilot to worry less about putting the plane into a stall or spin. And the large, vivid "moving map" in the center of the control panel enables pilots to take in their position in a single glance instead of through a variety of laborious calculations.
Accidents that do happen are also potentially less damaging, thanks to changes in the airplane's structure. The Cirrus has different, better seat belts, seats engineered to let the occupant survive as much as a 26G vertical drop and a fiberglass construction that affords crumple space to absorb shock, like modern car bumpers. And it has a parachute -- for the entire plane.
The parachute is the most radical and weirdly controversial feature of the Cirrus. Old-school pilots grumble that they'd rather have the extra 83 pounds (for the chute and supporting structure) for their own payload. But in his early days in flying, Alan Klapmeier was involved in a midair collision -- another small plane, taking off into the sun, hit his and knocked off a portion of the plane's wing- and he thought it was a miracle that his instructor steered the crippled craft to the runway for landing. "The effectiveness of the parachute had been demonstrated with experimental airplanes," says Paul Johnston, Cirrus's chief engineer. "But it was really Alan promoting the idea to us, because of his experience."
After some 40 test drops with parachutes -- first attached to big barrels of sand and eventually to real airplanes -- Cirrus developed a reliable parachute that should lower the plane to a survivable landing when all other options are exhausted. The plane would be severely damaged, but occupants should survive. "Veteran pilots will come up and tell me, 'Well, I'd never pull that thing,"' says Johnston. "But most people say, 'What a great idea.' To the uninitiated, it's a way to take the terror out of flying." As Alan puts it, "Even if no one uses the chute, there is a value in peace of mind."
Private planes, even ones with parachutes, may not be for everyone, any more than fancy R.V.'s are. But there is more in common between planes and luxury R.V.'s, Alan Klapmeier claims, than most people assume. An airplane lasts at least three times as long as a car, he says; it can be financed over at least three times as long a period; it retains considerable resale value when it is 20 or 30 years old, as cars do not. Therefore, by his calculation, the capital cost of owning and maintaining a Cirrus is roughly that of a $60,000 car.
Nevertheless, that's expensive. "But in 1997," he points out, "there were 965,000 automobiles sold in North America that exceeded $40,000 in cost. A great number of those people could have afforded to buy airplanes. So the reason people don't buy airplanes is not cost; it's that we haven't shown that they're practical."
The United States government seems to agree that personal aircraft, made fast, comfortable and safe, could be a practical alternative to our currently overloaded transportation systems. In a recent speech, Daniel Goldin, NASA's administrator, claimed that the impending saturation of the hub-and-spoke air network had already made airlines inefficient for all but the longest trips. On journeys of 300 to 400 miles, for instance, the effective "doorstep to destination" speed for airline trips, he says, now averages a mere 50 to 60 miles an hour. Using small airports can often increase this speed, because in cities, they are generally closer to business districts, and there are more of them in rural locations as well. Small planes are far more subject to weather delays than big planes, but weather permitting, they can go when the passenger wants, and can go more directly, avoiding hub-and-spoke connections. It is for such trips, of between 100 and 500 miles -- New York to Buffalo; San Jose to Santa Barbara; a nonhub site like Columbus, Ohio, to another one like Rochester -- that even slow small planes can be better than any alternative. Or at least better for some people: it is hard to imagine great throngs being prepared to take up flying just to avoid long lines at the check-in counter.
After lunch at Scott's Bluff, Neb., we took off again and came up on a large cloud system. Passing though little wisps of cloud on a clear day is exhilarating, because the swirling mists give you a sense of how fast you actually move. But entering a full cloud bank changes all the perceptions. The air is suddenly rougher. The windows seem covered by cotton. Your attention switches exclusively to the instrument panel. We activated an instrument flight plan, and I tried to keep the plane on course.
The Cirrus was designed for instrument flight, but it was not designed to handle ice. Even a quarter-inch layer of ice on the wings can affect a plane's ability to fly -- a reminder that weather is a fundamental source of risk in flying. Inside the cloud, the air temperature fell below zero Celsius, and Gary Black kept checking the wings for the first sign of rime. When he saw it, I called the controller, below us as we passed over South Dakota, to request a descent to air warm enough to melt the ice. The controller handled the transaction with brisk, formula-phrase efficiency. Then he asked if this was really a Cirrus SR20. When assured that it was, he suddenly shifted out of controller-speak to human discourse. "I have wanted so much to see that plane," he said, "Maybe some day I can get to fly one. Come on back!"
Sixty minutes later, 1,700 miles and 10 hours of flying time after we left El Monte, we landed in the twilight near Lake Superior.
Cirrus must now convince people that flying its planes is a safe, viable alternative to other means of transportation -- no small challenge. More immediately, the company must gear up production. The factory in Duluth is a spare, white-painted, modern-looking structure, with vastly more floor space than is needed for current production levels. The Klapmeiers established the factory here in 1994 in large part because there was a huge airstrip available from a decommissioned Air Force base, and because the city was willing to offer some $2 million in investment and incentives. Since the summer of 1994, when the first mock-up of an SR20 was unveiled at an air show, Dale Klapmeier has been Mr. Inside, keeping the design, testing and production moving, and Alan has been Mr. Outside, endlessly working the hustings to raise the $70 million the company has spent on testing, development and production facilities.
The company has bounced from one financing emergency to another, the latest and potentially most threatening occurring after Scott Anderson, the test pilot, was killed. Although he had flown the test planes for Cirrus's parachute-drop tests, routine flight tests were conducted without a parachute.
Cirrus and the National Transportation Safety Board quickly located the problem. In certain maneuvers that put high stress on the wing -- and that would probably not occur except in deliberate tests -- the aileron (which makes the plane bank left or right) could become jammed against the wing. Cirrus redesigned the aileron and ran countless tests. Gary Black took the plane up for its first postcrash flight. At the time of the accident, the company had 249 "contract holders" for the SR20 -- people who had put down a $15,000 nonrefundable deposit for the right to buy a plane when it came off the line. Four months later, when the first plane was delivered, the list numbered 333. In early November it reached 400. People on the list operate their own Web site, where the few who have taken delivery tantalize the others with accounts of the trips they take.
The brand-new plane in which I flew was the ninth SR20 built. The company is hoping to produce a plane every four days by the end of this year, and a plane every working day by next fall. That would move them through the current customer backlog in about two years.
When Tom Bergeron, the Cirrus salesman, dropped us off at El Monte, he asked me, "So, have you put down your deposit yet?" I laughed him off. "Come on, I'm still paying college bills!" I protested. But as I turned for a last look at the plane while driving away from Duluth, I thought: If I put down a deposit now, I wouldn't really have to start paying for at least two years. And my kids will be finishing college then.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Philosophy?

BYLINE: By Robert S. Boynton; Robert S. Boynton writes for The New Yorker and Lingua Franca.

 BODY:
Back when she was the star of her high-school drama club, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum wasn't interested in playing Emily in "Our Town." Her favorite role was Robespierre -- in a five-act, French-language production she wrote herself. Decades later, she still speaks fondly of the meandering walks she would take around the affluent Philadelphia suburb of Bryn Mawr, dreaming of the sacrifices the Frenchman made to advance his ideals. "I was fascinated by his dilemma of wanting liberty for everyone, but having to figure out what to do with individuals who won't go along with your plan," she recalled recently. "I still think about it all the time." Nussbaum also remembered the fun she had playing Joan of Arc, entranced as she was by the question of "how far to sacrifice friendship and personal loyalty to an abstract cause." Although Nussbaum eventually traded the stage for the academy, she still takes these early inspirations to heart. Synthesizing the passion of the revolutionary with the zeal of the self-sacrificing saint, she has become, at 52, the most prominent female philosopher in America.
In addition to producing a steady stream of books and articles from her perches at Harvard, Brown and now at the University of Chicago, she has cultivated a distinctive, even glamorous, public presence. Nussbaum has discussed Greek tragedy with Bill Moyers on PBS, presented Plato on the Discovery Channel and been photographed by Annie Leibovitz for her new book, "Women." More important, as a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books and The New Republic, Nussbaum's essays have become required reading for those with a taste for intellectual combat. Prized for her writing's acerbic bite, she first attracted notice in 1987 with a devastating attack on Allan Bloom's conservative diatribe "The Closing of the American Mind." Writing in The New York Review of Books, she denounced his proposal that universities dedicate themselves solely to educating the elite and savaged what she saw as Bloom's distorted reading of Greek philosophy. "How good a philosopher, then, is Allan Bloom?" she concluded. "We are given no reason to think him one at all." 
 Earlier this year, Nussbaum took aim at Judith Butler, the radical feminist philosopher who has attained cultlike status (through dense monographs like "Gender Trouble") for arguing, among other things, that society is built on artificial gender norms that can best be undermined with "subversive" symbolic behavior, like cross-dressing. Appearing in The New Republic, Nussbaum's 8,600-word essay, "The Professor of Parody," castigated Butler for proffering a "self-involved" feminism that encouraged women to disengage from real-world problems -- like inferior wages or sexual harassment -- and retreat to abstract theory. "For Butler," she wrote, "the act of subversion is so riveting, so sexy, that it is a bad dream to think that the world will actually get better." By abdicating the fight against injustice in favor of "hip defeatism," Butler, Nussbaum concluded darkly, "collaborates with evil."
The review received a visceral response within the academy and beyond. Butler's defenders branded it an ad feminam attack on an innovative thinker whose reputation was surpassing Nussbaum's own. "It was a crassly opportunistic act," said Joan Scott, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Others welcomed Nussbaum's blow against the hermetic politics of postmodernism. "The piece was a skillful and long-overdue shredding," said Katha Pollitt, the feminist writer.
Although it would be hard to find two more ideologically dissimilar thinkers than Bloom and Butler, according to Nussbaum's withering judgment they were guilty of a common crime: both were mandarin philosophers who refused to use their theories to help wage the battle for freedom, justice and equality. While Bloom was at least openly skeptical about philosophy's connection to democracy (he disparaged those who dared to seek practical advice from his beloved Greek texts), Butler drew Nussbaum's ire because she claimed to be using philosophy to address political issues even as she manipulated poststructuralist theory to sidestep them. "I thought of the Butler and Bloom reviews as acts of public service," she said. "But a lot of my impatience with their work grew out of my repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida."
The debate over whether philosophy should play a mandarin or public role has been a contentious one throughout American intellectual history. In the hands of thinkers like Sidney Hook and John Dewey, philosophy turned its attention "from the problems of philosophers toward the problems of men," as Dewey wrote in "Reconstruction in Philosophy" (1920). After the Second World War, the mainstream of American philosophy became reclusively "analytic," orienting itself around the study of logic, mathematics and the philosophy of science, while maintaining only a tenuous connection to the world at large. With John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" (1971), academic philosophy initiated a wary rapprochement with its more socially engaged past, using the analytic idiom to address age-old questions of justice. Nussbaum's work has played an important part in this revival, as she has extended Rawls's liberal insights to examine questions of gender, race and international development. She insists that philosophy be rigorous and, above all, useful. Whereas Ludwig Wittgenstein once compared philosophers to garbage men sweeping the mind clean of wrongheaded concepts, Nussbaum believes they should be "lawyers for humanity" -- a phrase she borrows from Seneca, her favorite Stoic thinker. Part wonk, part sage, Nussbaum is determined to make philosophy relevant to the modern world.
Given her rhetorical ferocity, I was surprised to find that Nussbaum was so soft-spoken when we met in her airy apartment in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. Dressed simply in a white T-shirt and black spandex leggings, she was tall and striking, with a square jaw and wavy, shoulder-length blond hair. Although she casually curled up on her living-room sofa, once we begin to talk it became apparent that there was little soft about her. She answered every question exhaustively, with a steely precision that let you practically see the footnotes hovering in the air. Her hair was still damp from a grueling Sunday routine: a 12-mile run along Lake Michigan followed by weight-lifting, intended as preparation for a fall marathon. (Because she "detests earphones," she later told me, she runs to a mental soundtrack: fully memorized extracts from "The Marriage of Figaro.")
Nussbaum taught at Harvard and Brown for 20 years before coming to the University of Chicago in 1995, where she has appointments in the law and divinity schools, as well as in the departments of philosophy, classics and Southern Asian studies. Her multiple affiliations attest to a breadth of intellectual interest that is rare in a world of academic specialists. While most scholars spend entire careers studying a particular era or thinker, Nussbaum -- in books like "The Fragility of Goodness," "For Love of Country" and this year's "Sex and Social Justice" -- moves easily from Aristotle to international development, from Dickens to contemporary feminism.
When I asked why she reacted so strongly to Butler's work, she furrowed her brow, looked down and spoke with the hushed, somber tone one might employ in addressing a grave threat to national security. "Butler is like the Pied Piper leading all the children away!" she told me. "If all these wonderful people drop out of politics, then there are that many fewer people left to fight against evil."
Such unabashed moralism is rarely heard from philosophers these days. "Martha is unashamedly interested in goodness, which she writes about with such shocking earnestness," explained her friend Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of the New Republic. "For her, philosophy is nothing less than an intellectual tool for the improvement of mankind."
But Nussbaum's high-stakes rhetoric can irritate her peers. "It's zany," said the literary critic Stanley Fish of Nussbaum's desire to make philosophy helpful. "In the end, all philosophy equips you to do is more philosophy -- it doesn't make you better at any other area of public life." The philosopher Richard Rorty was also dubious about her "impatient and dismissive" attacks on fellow thinkers. "Her tone sometimes suggests that to differ from her is to imperil the social bond," he said. Others attributed the hostility toward Nussbaum to jealousy. "There are a lot of shriveled souls in the academic world," said G.W. Bowersock, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Study, "and they feel intimidated by Martha because she is able to do so much so well."
With Nussbaum's concern for philosophy's nuts-and-bolts utility, it is not surprising that her strongest connection at Chicago is to the university's law school -- a contentious institution that has produced some of the most brilliant legal theorists and judges in the country. At Chicago, theory is never far from practice. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia taught here; Federal Judge Richard Posner (with whom Nussbaum taught a course on the French philosopher Michel Foucault) founded the influential "law and economics" movement here. Another prominent presence is the legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon, who drafted some of the nation's strongest antipornography laws.
Nussbaum believes that one of the most effective ways she can change public life is through her teaching at the law school. "Many of my students will go off to be clerks and eventually judges and even legislators," she said. "Right now I have three colleagues who are federal judges -- and when I sit down and talk with them, I hope I can change their views on some things, too."
Nussbaum's work as a "lawyer for humanity" comes primarily out of the liberal political tradition, one that extends from John Stuart Mill to John Rawls. This tradition emphasizes the equal worth of individuals and the inviolable freedom to choose your path in life -- regardless of gender, class, sexual orientation, race or nationality. While this perspective may seem common-sensical to outsiders, the insistence with which she applies her "universal" philosophy rubs against an academic establishment wary of making cross-cultural judgments.
In 1986 Nussbaum was invited by the economist Amartya Sen (the 1998 Nobel laureate with whom she was then romantically involved) to work with the United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research. Their aim was to find alternatives to the dominant theories of international development: one, the economist's view that a country's G.N.P. is the only reliable measure of social, economic and political progress; two, the relativist position that Westerners must refrain from judging foreign cultures.
To counter such positions, Nussbaum and Sen promoted the "capabilities approach" to development, enumerating a universal set of values -- the right to life, bodily health and integrity; the right to participate in political affairs; the right to hold property -- that could be used to judge the quality of life in any society. Unlike G.N.P. per capita's focus on opulence, wrote Nussbaum in "Sex and Social Justice," the capabilities approach "asks about the distribution of resources and opportunities. . . . It strongly invites a scrutiny of cultural tradition as one of the primary sources of such unequal abilities." For example, a wealthy Indian woman might have less "capability" than a poor Swedish woman -- because of the sexist society she lives in.
As part of her research, Nussbaum made frequent trips to India to study the problems of poor women there. She advised programs aimed at increasing female literacy in India and the prosecution of domestic violence there. Nussbaum has little patience with those who accuse her of foisting "foreign" values on other cultures. "It is better to risk being consigned by critics to the 'hell' reserved for alleged Westernizers and imperialists," she wrote in "Sex and Social Justice," "than to stand around in the vestibule waiting for a time when everyone will like what we are going to say."
Nussbaum's rights-based universalism also undergirded her arguments for equality for homosexuals. In 1993, she was asked to be a prosecution witness in Romer v. Evans; the case challenged a Colorado amendment that sought to overturn local laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination. In testifying, she discovered that the career of the politically engaged philosopher can be fraught with peril. Having never set foot inside a courtroom, the "lawyer for humanity" was unprepared for how little a hostile cross-examination resembled the free-ranging inquiry of the seminar. On the stand, Nussbaum cited classical texts to argue that there were no ancient precedents for denying homosexuals equality. "Plato's dialogues contain several extremely moving celebrations of male-male love," she explained, "and judge this form of love to be, on the whole, superior to male-female love because of its potential for spirituality and friendship." Her testimony was attacked by several conservative scholars who accused her of warping Plato's words. Nussbaum and her critics traded angry accusations of libel and perjury -- revolving around the interpretation of one notoriously difficult Platonic dialogue -- before the law was finally ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. When I asked whether she thinks her scholarly reputation was tarnished by all the mudslinging, Nussbaum handed me the 136-page law-review article she published on the case. It bristled with dozens of pink Post-its. "If you read this you will see that my arguments were all good and quite correct," she said curtly.
Nussbaum's "aristocratic" lineage derives from her mother's family, which traces its roots back to the Mayflower. Her father, George Craven, was a conservative Southerner who became a prosperous lawyer in the trusts and estates division of a large Philadelphia firm. Young Martha rebelled from the start. Much to her father's chagrin, she became involved in civil rights activism then swirling around Bryn Mawr. One day, she invited a black girl over to play. "Don't you ever bring a black person into our home again!" he scolded her.
Martha Craven fell in love with the theater while at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, where she wrote her French pageant. She attended Wellesley for two years before growing frustrated with college and joining a Michigan theater company that performed Greek tragedies. She acted in Aristophanes' "The Birds" and in the "Oresteia," which starred Bert Lahr and Ruby Dee. After a stint at the New York University drama school, Martha realized she preferred studying plays to performing them and switched to the classics department, where she earned her B.A.
Martha's Protestant father was horrified by her decision at N.Y.U. to marry a Jew named Alan Nussbaum, a linguist she met in a class on Greek prose composition. But she was an eager convert. "I had an intense desire to join the underdogs and to fight for justice in solidarity with them," she has written. For Nussbaum, Judaism offered a sense of community lacking in her own upbringing. "I read Martin Buber and understood that virtually every relationship I had observed at Bryn Mawr had been an I-It relationship, involving no genuine acknowledgment of humanity," she wrote. Her marriage to Alan Nussbaum ended in 1987.
Although Nussbaum thrived as a classics graduate student at Harvard, she felt embattled. When she became the first woman ever elected to the prestigious Society of Fellows (which guarantees a student three years of financing), the question of what to call her arose. "Someone suggested that since the masculine for 'fellow' was 'hetairos,' I should be called a 'hetaira,' which I knew full well did not mean 'fellowess,' but was in fact Greek for 'prostitute,"' she says. "I didn't like Harvard. I disapproved of the classicists. They were anti-Semites, racists and sexists and had a real thuggishness about them." The birth of her daughter, Rachel, only made Nussbaum more determined to prove her mettle in a male bastion. A photo of her in the maternity ward shows her proudly holding a copy of Aristotle's "Politics."
In the late 60's, the study of classical literature was largely a philological pursuit, and since Nussbaum was growing more interested in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, she started to take classes in Harvard's philosophy department. Aside from being predominantly Jewish, the department was also more open to interdisciplinary inquiry. She wrote her classics dissertation on a treatise by Aristotle, but she also began writing articles on Henry James and Proust that drew on the full range of her literary and philosophical interests.
Unfortunately, the very intellectual breadth that became Nussbaum's signature caused problems for her professionally. Although Harvard had originally appointed her jointly to teach classics and philosophy in 1975, Nussbaum was denied tenure by the classics department in 1982. The experience devastated her; she even considered bringing a sexual discrimination suit. Instead, she moved to Brown University, where she taught until she came to Chicago four years ago.
On my last day in Chicago, I sat in on a class Nussbaum was teaching on John Rawls and political liberalism in one of the law school's horseshoe-shaped seminar rooms. The day's discussion examined the status of the family in liberal political philosophy. "What would it be like for the principles of justice to apply within the family?" she asked. She and her students engaged in a lively debate about the tension between the family and the state: Is the family a voluntary private association or should it be regulated by government? Should a child be able to choose his own education or religion?
In 65 brisk minutes, Nussbaum interrogated the usefulness of the idea of "family" in contemporary America -- probing with the intensity of a legislator. "Perhaps we should drop the label of family altogether," she proposed, "and instead ask about the various goals and capabilities that people have in these kinds of associations." Would employing a looser notion of family change the state's stand on issues such as gay adoption or immigration? "What are the practical implications of my approach? I really want to know!" Her voice rose, as some in the class chuckled at her earnestness.
Sitting in her book-strewn office after class, I asked Nussbaum whether she didn't sometimes take philosophy too seriously. Weren't there cases in which theory didn't have to benefit humanity in any concrete way? For me, much of the joy of studying philosophy often derived precisely from the escape it offered from the world. Didn't this more purely aesthetic conception of philosophy's vocation deserve equal time?
Nussbaum would have none of it. "For any view you put forward," she said, "the next question simply has to be, 'What would the world be like if this idea were actually taken up?"' Arrogantly or not, her scholarly objective is not to impress her peers or win tenure -- but to influence future generations, "laying a foundation" for a more just world. "It's what happens in the long haul that really matters," Nussbaum said. "You just never know where or how your ideals will be realized."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Connecticut;
Leases of 23 of State's 31 Former Caldor Stores Sold

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHEN the Norwalk-based Caldor department store chain announced it was going out of business in January, bidders lined up almost immediately to buy the unexpired leases for the 31 stores it operated in its home state. So far, 23 have been snatched up by other major chains, and many have reopened.
Kohl's, a retailer better known in the Midwest, but pushing steadily into the Northeast, bought out the leases at nine sites. Another Connecticut-based chain, Ames, based in Rocky Hill, has accounted for seven, and Wal-Mart took six of the Caldor sites. Kmart bought one lease, in Bristol. 
 Joseph R. Ettore, president and chief executive of Ames, which operates 455 stores in 19 states, said no one in retailing was surprised at the scramble for the former Caldor properties.
"One thing Caldor was always known for was terrific locations," said Mr. Ettore. "Throughout the Northeast, they always seemed to get the best real estate. We would have liked one or two of the stores in Fairfield County, particularly out near Danbury, but those were highly competitive sites, and we didn't want to jump in."
In Fairfield, where Kohl's has purchased a former Caldor store on King's Highway, First Selectman Kenneth A. Flatto said the retailing community needed the good news.
"We actually had two chains go into bankruptcy about the same time, not just Caldor but Steinbach's," Mr. Flatto said. "But I understand the Gap chain is taking over the Steinbach's location, and now with Kohl's going into Caldor, the stores coming in seem to be as strong or stronger than the stores going out, so we're in pretty good shape."
He said the new Kohl's would be about a quarter-mile away from a new 100,000-square-foot office project planned for Kings Highway, which he said he expected would bring in number of new jobs, and potential new shoppers.
The executive director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, Edward J. Musante Jr., said Kohl's would take one former Caldor location on Route 1, and Wal-Mart another, on Main Avenue.
"In our region, and I guess I would have to say in all of Fairfield County, the retail industry is so hot we never expected these locations would last for very long," Mr. Musante said. "I think this area had been under-retailed for a long time, relative to the rest of the country."
But, he added, Norwalk is rapidly approaching the point where it has enough retail, at least as far as traffic is concerned.
"We're at a point now where, especially on a Saturday morning, it's getting difficult to get around," Mr. Musante said. "Also, any further development would start to encroach on residential neighborhoods."
At the height of its business, Caldor racked up $2.5 billion a year in sales and employed 20,000 people at 145 stores in 10 states. But in September 1995 it filed for bankruptcy, and while it struggled to develop a reorganization plan, it was unable to convince customers or its vendors that it was still viable. In January it announced it was closing its stores. Any leases that were not sold through the bankruptcy court, including those for eight stores in Connecticut, were turned back to their landlords.
That leaves stores in Brookfield, Enfield, New Britain, Newington, Norwich, Riverside, Stamford and Waterbury where the leases were returned to the landlord. But Arnold Peck, owner of Arnold Peck's Property World USA in Milford, said he didn't expect the landlords to have any trouble in filling the space.
"From what I hear, some of the same chains are negotiating for the other sites, as well, and other people are looking at them for theme restaurants, or giant computer stores -- there's really no kind of reuse that has an inside track," Mr. Peck said. "One thing I can tell you is someone else will come in -- Connecticut real estate is so hot, they're going to go. There might be someone on third base and heading home at some of these sites right now, but they're just not ready to talk about it right now."
 Edward J. Deak, a professor at Fairfield University and an economist with the New England Economic Project, which tracks the region's economy, said few retailers seemed concerned about reopening stores at a site where another chain failed.
"That doesn't seem to have inhibited any of the bidders," Dr. Deak said. "These stores were certainly snatched up pretty quickly. They were in high-traffic, well-traveled locations."
He said it was understandable that retailers were eager to gain outlets in Connecticut, where the federal government estimates 1999 total personal income at $131 billion, and with a per-capita income -- long first or second in the country -- of $39,972, according to the most recent federal Department of Labor statistics.
T HE population growth is not very strong in Connecticut, but the income growth is, which makes for good retail conditions," Dr. Deak said. He noted that developers had proposed a 1.5-million-square-foot mall at Interstates 91 and 95 in New Haven. "Those people aren't going to invest that kind of money if they don't think there's a market," he added.
Glen P. Guszkowski, vice president of advertising for the Kohl's Department Store chain, which is based in Minneapolis, said the nine former Caldor stores in it acquired in Connecticut were among 32 purchased from the bankrupt chain in the New York metropolitan area.
"The tristate area is a very viable market, with good demographics for our type of operation, so when those particular locations became available we investigated the various locations and picked those that had the best potential," Mr. Guszkowski said. The 32 will open next spring in two waves, the first in mid-March and the second, including the Connecticut stores, in mid-April. All are undergoing extensive renovations.
"The most obvious advantage to buying existing stores is the existing customer base, although those customers will have to be educated about what type of store Kohl's is, because we're not the same type of store as Caldor at all," Mr. Guszkowski said. "So there's a little bit of risk as well as an advantage."
He said Kohl's, which carries more name-brand clothing than the former Caldor, pushed into the East with locations in and around Philadelphia and Washington starting in 1997 and, he added, it has been satisfied with the results so far.
Mr. Guszkowski said that it was "a good bet that there will be additional locations in Connecticut eventually."
Mr. Ettore, of Ames, said Caldor opportunities fit in well with his expansion plans, including the takeover early this year of the 155-store Hills department store chain, which operated in the South and Midwest.
He said that besides the nine Caldor stores he bought through the bankruptcy proceedings -- seven in Connecticut and two in Massachusetts -- he has been negotiating with landlords for former Caldor properties that were returned by the bankruptcy court.
"I think when it's all over, we'll wind up with about 20 of the former Caldor stores," Mr. Ettore said. "From the very beginning, we put a check next to the locations we would want. Obviously, we didn't want every store. We have a store in Norwich, and they had a store in Norwich, but we certainly don't need another location in Norwich. We don't just take a store because it's empty. We want it to fit demographically, geographically, and in every possible way."
He added that "there's probably not much more opportunity for us in Connecticut."
"We don't have a presence now in Fairfield County, or in the western part of Connecticut in general. But we'd only go there if what comes up fits our profile."
KEITH T. MORRIS, a spokesman for Wal-Mart at its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., said that after submitting a winning bid for 12 stores in bankruptcy court in February, his chain negotiated leases for two others in July.
In Connecticut, Wal-Mart will take over former Caldor sites in Southington, Rocky Hill, Derby, Norwalk, Avon and Old Saybrook.
"We were looking to strengthen our presence in Connecticut," Mr. Morris said. With 14 stores in the state today, after the new stores are remodeled and reopened Wal-Mart will have 20. The first of the new stores will open some time in the first quarter of next year, most likely in Southington and Rocky Hill, followed a short time later by Avon. The others will be reopened at various times during the year.
"These stores were in markets that we have previously evaluated as potential development opportunities, so the timing was perfect," Mr. Morris said. "It allowed us to save a tremendous amount of capital versus building from the ground up, and looking for an appropriate site. It makes sense in some cases, if it's in the right location and it's the right size."
Wal-Mart often uses existing space for its stores, particularly in the East, where it has acquired former Rich's and Bradlees stores. It will look at any site from 60,000 to 220,000 square feet. Caldor stores it acquired range from 84,000 to 113,000 square feet.
Wal-Mart was founded in 1962, said Mr. Morris, but it didn't go into New England until the opening of a store in New Hampshire in 1991. Today, he said, it operates 97 stores in the New England states, not including the Caldor sites it will soon open.
"There are still growth opportunities in Connecticut," Mr. Morris said. "But for right now our energies will be devoted to making sure that we get these six stores renovated and opened."

Comehither.com

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
So how come my television screen and newspapers are filling up with come-ons for dot-coms? Besides cars and telephones, the ads on "Ally McBeal" are pushing eToys.com and petstore.com and drugstore.com. Dot-coms flash on my screen between murders and disasters on the 11 o'clock news. Ads in The Times shout Yahoo and Excite and eBay and E*Trade and ask me to think AltaVista every time I dream of Michelangelo's ceiling.
Quite remarkably, it seems the New Media have suddenly decided to enrich the Old. Or, if you prefer irony in your paradox, the Old Media are greedily wolfing down the poison that will hasten their destruction by the New. 
 Paradoxically, too, most of the dot-com companies still lose money on every sale, which means that the more successful their ads, the greater their losses. Indeed, they are bidding up the cost of commercials in what could turn out to be a giant Ponzi game: they are spending huge sums obtained from venture capitalists and stock-market gamblers on ads that can only increase their so-far unprofitable business and deficits. And they can only hope that the added traffic will cause investors to send them still more money.
That Peter-to-pay-Paul rondo is only one reason to wonder precisely what business the dot-coms are in. Mainly, even the best-known, like Amazon, Yahoo or America Online, are looking to tattoo their names on the minds of surfers while they evolve every season into a new enterprise.
For example, Yahoo and AltaVista began life as sophisticated "search engines," which quickly scour the Web to produce an index of documents answering your questions. Ask about Shakespeare's sonnets or sourdough bread, and they can instantly cough up texts, recipes and relevant commentaries. Instead of charging a fee, the search engines thought they could get rich from ads posted alongside their findings. But the appearance of many competitors (Hotbot, Excite, Google, et al.) soon ruined their prospects.
A further challenge was posed by the success of America Online, with its colorful array of public and proprietary goods and services. It became popular by also providing e-mail, chat rooms, bridge games and live reports on the price of stocks or airline seats. And once it, too, made itself into a search engine, AOL became an all-purpose Web gateway, a network of networks financed not just by advertising but also by a flat monthly fee from millions of subscribers.
That was only the beginning of the Web's evolution. Other gateways soon appeared and charged less than AOL. And searchers like Yahoo became gateways for no charge at all. Almost all these "portals" now offer news, e-mail and a cascade of services like tax advice, movie schedules, bill paying, games, clubs, calendars, football scores. For income, they look not to fees or even ads but to the growth of dot-com commerce -- their sales of goods and commissions for sending customers to other merchants.
Imagine a future, then, in which virtually every Web site is linked to every other. Read a news or feature story about a lovely resort and with a few clicks of a button you can locate a suitable airline schedule, order the tickets, choose a car rental and hotel, reserve golf time and restaurant tables and maybe also order babysitters, guidebooks and the appropriate wardrobe.
What AOL and the other gateways currently long to become is your port of entry to this vast commercial net. Some dot-coms may be content to sell a single line of goods or services -- videos, tulip bulbs, lipsticks or banking and bill paying. Some may grow like Amazon.com, which is fast becoming a department store offering not only books but also electronics and computers, CD's and videos, toys and drugs. And like Amazon, they may also compete with eBay, which brokers auction sales of both gems and junk among its customers.
Once enmeshed in the Web, every dot-com will relate to every other. Merchants find it useful to post complementary news and advice. And companies offering news and advice grow eager to link themselves to the sellers of goods and services. E*Trade.com, for example, began life as a stock market charging only small commissions. But it soon added headline news about the economy, business articles and discussion groups, a bookstore and shopping service and most recently a one-button connection to a full-service telebank. Similarly, The New York Times and other newsmongers will lure you with reading matter but hope to pay for it by directing you not only to ads but also to purchases inspired by your reading.
Potentially, every site on the Web can be a portal to all other sites, just as in the air age every American city can be a gateway to our country. The ultimate competition among the dot-coms will be for a place in the subconscious of every Web user. But while the Web stores must build warehouses and employ order fillers, the grandest portals will exist only virtually and collect from you every time you pass Go. Think of stocks and you may begin your Web journey on E*Trade. Think of news and we hope you'll reach for Nytimes.com, for The Times and most other publications also expect to be Net portals for communities of like-minded readers whom they can sell to Web advertisers and merchants.
So even in these primitive stages of Web commerce, the struggle for name recognition has grown fierce. A few name-brand dot-coms are hoping to end up with outsize reputations as Net ports, attaining the stature that actual ports like New York, London and Hong Kong achieved as centers of commerce. Since every Web site can blossom into a great portal, the richer ones are throwing all their resources into ads that might distinguish them from the pack. They want to be famous in the old world even before they are well defined in the new.

HEADLINE: Museums That Let the Senses Expand

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
BROOKLYN may have a show titled "Sensation," but memorable sensations with more nuance may be experienced by a regular visitor to museums and galleries in Connecticut. From show to show, an exhibition space is usually changed in some way. Sometimes, though, the transformations are astonishing.
The Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven is famous for its exhibitions of aesthetic or art-historical interest, but it isn't known for shows with strong sociological themes. Last spring, the museum presented "Closing: The Life and Death of an American Factory," about the demise of a North Carolina furniture manufacturer in 1993. The show consisted of color and black-and-white photographs by Bill Bamberger that focused on both the workers who would soon be unemployed and the physical plant, which was seen, in successive photographs, slowly emptying out. 
 This show had a narrative, with a story that was affecting even though the outcome was known. The photographs were widely spaced so that each would have maximum impact. And the walls were painted dark red, which abetted a feeling of decline and sacrifice.
In the contemporary era, pure white walls have been standard. So it was bracing when several strong colors were used for "New Worlds From Old," a dynamic juxtaposition of 19th-century landscapes from America and Australia last fall at the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford. The similarities between the works from the two places was a revelation. The color changes announced a new section or area for examination, and because the survey was exhaustive, the changes were a necessary stimulant that kept viewers alert for the sharp comparisons.
The Bruce Museum in Greenwich has a constant array of overlapping exhibitions, and recently, more rooms, including one that used to be reserved for meetings and receptions, have been given over to art. But the museum has a second mission: science. This summer brought shows in both domains that had to do with horses. The art side of things, "The Thoroughbred: Born to Run and Jump" included an entire array of objects related to the culture of horses, including racing, show jumping and polo. It's not that the horse itself is incidental to these objects, but the horses' achievements reflect most strongly on the owners, trainers and riders. Therefore, when viewers crossed over to the science side, "Horse Play," and glimpsed a mounted pair of horse lungs that looked like a bellows, they had a feeling of finally meeting the engine responsible for all the glory enshrined in all those objects.
Transforming the space and reminding viewers where they are, literally, when they look at art is something the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield does very well. Several shows have exploited the fact that the museum's building has served, through three centuries, as a farmhouse, a post office and a church. Ann Hamilton's subtle and purposeful alterations last spring specifically addressed the building's several layers of history, and Ms. Hamilton signaled her intention to plumb deeply by uncovering several windows that had long been hidden. Several other maneuvers had the same intention of exposing a long history, but the hands-on, decisive alteration of the structure announced that the artist was after something fundamental.
The physical transformation of exhibition space is both the means and the end of most exhibitions at the Zilkha Art Gallery at Wesleyan University in Middletown, for the gallery is a huge, uninterrupted naked space. It might be the ideal gallery for postmodern art because it resists the mere hanging of paintings on its concrete walls. Instead, its very vacuity means it is ideal for installation art, the point of which is to create an entirely fresh environment. Installations of an abstract sort work very well because the materials used to make them do not refer to anything outside themselves, and here those materials have ample space to show what they can do. On one memorable occasion, however, the gallery became the equivalent of other well-known interiors: last fall, "The Bed Show" surveyed sculpture incorporating beds or the concept of beds. The way they were displayed across the gallery's ample floor could easily remind a viewer of a furniture showroom or, something more compelling, a hospital ward.
It is hard to notice the transformation of a space when one hasn't seen that space before. The Brookfield Craft Center usually shows work that falls outside the realm of fine art. This year, in "The Storyteller's Art: Contemporary Embroidery," the promise was that the show partook of the fine arts in that it included narratives, anecdotal, allegorical and otherwise. The sensation was that these 16 far-flung fiber artists painted pictures with thread as complex and involving as any paintings, and yet the precision of the craft demanded that they do it slowly and painstakingly. The experience was a signal to drop preconceptions.
Sometimes the world outside the gallery conspires in a transforming sensation. Last fall, the Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut at Storrs presented a three-part exhibition dealing with Mexican art. A warm day in late autumn nevertheless carried hints that winter was on the way, and the gallery contained all manner of sugar skulls and skeletons used to celebrate the Day of the Dead in Mexico and to acquaint children with death. The message of change was a portent more potent than the New England weather.

HEADLINE: An Old Industrial City Turns to Entertainment

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
THE reproduction of a British Navy frigate from the Revolutionary War, H.M.S. Rose, was scheduled to return to Black Rock Harbor in Bridgeport for the winter on Nov. 10, but it arrived Nov. 1 instead. "It's a sailing ship," said Kaye Williams, the owner of Captain's Cove Marina, which is H.M.S. Rose's home port. "That's the kind of schedule it keeps."
It has been somewhat similar for Bridgeport, a city that until recently evoked metaphors of either being becalmed or storm-tossed. Bridgeport's long struggle back from obscurity has defied all schedules. Lately, though, with its tack set on tourism, the city is sailing on favorable winds. 
 "It's not the same old Bridgeport," said Rosemary Lodice, one of the executive producers at the Polka Dot Playhouse, a venerable small theater company with a new home downtown.
The "same old Bridgeport," Ms. Lodice said, was "the remains of an old industrial town. The new Bridgeport, she said, is "arts and entertainment. Something to be experienced and seen."
A visitor to Bridgeport has a choice of several museums and live theaters, independent league baseball, a zoo, one of the longest stretches of public sandy beach in the state, the nautical attractions of Captain's Cove, and a smorgasbord of restaurants serving a wide variety of ethnic, seafood, or regional cuisines.
In a word association game, the name "Bridgeport" used to produce responses that are perhaps best forgotten. Say "Bridgeport" today and chances are the answer will be "Bluefish" or more simply, "baseball." The Bluefish, this year's champion of the independent Atlantic League, shattered attendance records for independent baseball nationally, and all baseball, independent or affiliated minor league teams, in Connecticut.
No baseball team in Connecticut had ever drawn more than 300,000 fans for a regular season. The Bluefish drew 342,857 this year. The team played 120 games, 76 at home at its Harbor Yard stadium, and wound up with a 72-48 record. It then swept the league playoffs against the Somerset Patriots from New Jersey.
Though baseball is over until next April, the team has had a salutary -- and year-round effect on the city. Jena Maric, the executive director of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony, said the orchestra's subscription ticket sales have increased since the Bluefish came to town. Other attractions, from the Polka Dot Playhouse and the Barnum Museum, which are a short walk from Harbor Yard, to the Beardsley Zoo all the way at the other end of the city, also report a boost.
Another major draw for visitors is the Beardsley Zoological Gardens. Gregg Dancho, the zoo director, said plans for expansion include doubling the size of the zoo's New World Tropics building, which displays animals and birds from the South American rain forests in naturalistic settings.
"Most of our visitors are from out of town, many from Westchester County," Mr. Dancho said. There were 250,000 visitors at the zoo this year, and his long-term goal is to double that. The zoo has steadily expanded its offerings. A few years ago it added a carousel based on the defunct merry-go-round that was at the Pleasure Beach Amusement Park in Bridgeport's East End for the first two-thirds of the century. The horses on the zoo's carousel are reproductions of the original Pleasure Beach carousel horses, but the original restored horses are on display around it in the building.
This year, the zoo opened the Peacock Cafe, a restaurant to replace the old snack bar, and a sensory garden, with plants that stimulate all five senses. And, the Beardsley Zoo is the only place in Connecticut to see a live Siberian tiger.
If saving money is on your mind, there are pluses and minuses to visiting Captain's Cove, a bustling 400-boat marina with a restaurant, a fish market, and 26 shops fashioned to look like a tiny village.
The pluses: People are welcome to bring a brown bag lunch to a table on the dock and watch the boats all day, without spending a dime. Even the parking is free.
One possible minus: "I've had people come here and say, 'You know how many years I've been coming here, and I finally did it; I bought a boat," said Mr. Williams, the Cove's owner.
Once they have had their fill of the sea, visitors can explore three museums. The best known is the Barnum Museum on Main Street downtown, but there is also the Discovery Museum on Park Avenue, just a short hop off the Merritt Parkway, and the Housatonic Museum of Art is one of the state's least-known gems.
Through December, the Discovery Museum has a photography exhibit spanning the 20th century and includes photographs by many local photographers as well as major artists including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams. But the museum is at its most charming best with such off-beat exhibits such as one that explains how the human eye is fooled by optical illusions and a planetarium with shows designed for children and adults. "There's a bunch of quirky things here that adults appreciate more than kids," said Linda Malkin, the museum's senior vice president.
Some of P. T. Barnum's original exhibits can be found at the Barnum Museum. There's an Egyptian mummy and a freakish two-headed calf, both genuine. "We have a lot of fake things here, but those are legit," said Barbara Kram, the museum's executive director.
Spread throughout the halls, classrooms and offices at Housatonic Community College, in the middle of downtown Bridgeport, is the art collection of the Housatonic Museum of Art. The collection includes pieces from Connecticut artists as well Picasso, Chagall and Renoir. It has about 4,000 works in all, and 85 percent of them are displayed around the college.
The Housatonic also has special shows in its Bert Chernow Gallery. One work that will be on display until Dec. 23 is the "Wishbone Project." It has 8,000 clay wishbones, handmade by children and elderly adults working as teams, and suspended on monofilament fishing line so they appear to float surrealistically in the air.
Bridgeport has two theater companies and two orchestras. The orchestras perform at the Klein Auditorium, a 1,478-seat theater that is scheduled to be renovated next summer. Ms. Maric of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony said the orchestra goes back to the W.P.A. during the Great Depression. The present orchestra formed at the end of World War II. "This is our 54th season," she said. "We claim to be one of the oldest fully professional orchestras in the state."
Seventy percent of the seats are sold to season ticket subscribers, but Ms. Maric said there still are tickets available for the orchestra's remaining concerts. There will be a holiday pops concert on Dec. 11.
The Greater Bridgeport Youth Symphony Orchestras feature four orchestras with 240 musicians, grades 5 to 12, from 22 communities in Fairfield and New Haven counties. The orchestras will perform a concert of American music by Morton Gould, Leonard Bernstein and Duke Ellington in February.
The Downtown Cabaret Theatre and Polka Dot Playhouse are professional theater companies that produce intimate productions. The Cabaret Theatre also does weekend matinee productions for children. "What makes it most unique is the cabaret setting," said Bert Bernardi, an artistic director. Theatre goers are invited to bring their own food and drink.
The Polka Dot Playhouse just opened in September in its new home, a former bank converted to a 288-seat jewel box theater. Both will have musical productions for the rest of the year. The Cabaret is performing "Guys and Dolls," and "A Christmas Carol" for children, and the Polka Dot has "Annie Warbucks."
In the history books of Connecticut, the pages are anchored by the state's cities. But the state's urban communities cannot be ignored in the political and economic equations of today as well.
Besides that, these places are just plain interesting.
For those who haven't taken a close look recently (or at all), four guides suggest what to see in Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport and the Groton-New London area.
Whether you have a day, or just a couple of hours, whether you're hungry for a slice of pizza or a slice of culture, the articles on these two pages suggest places that are well worth exploring.

Hockey Arena Raises Hopes of a Livelier Trenton

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
CITY officials are hoping that the 8,000-seat minor-league hockey arena opened in Trenton last month will move the state capital another step forward in its revitalization effort.
Called Sovereign Bank Arena, the $50 million project rose over the last year and a half on 20 acres on the west side of Route 129. It is part of the revival of a 45-acre industrial district that was once home to the John A. Roebling & Sons and American Steel & Wire companies, manufacturers of cables for bridges, elevators and trolleys. 
 The project follows the opening in 1994 of a minor league baseball stadium about a mile to the southeast on the Delaware River waterfront. Trenton's mayor, Douglas Palmer, says the stadium has helped the city mute its image as a government center that shuts down by 6 p.m. and become, like other former industrial cities such as Newark and Baltimore, livelier municipalities. The arena project "extends that role," said Mayor Palmer.
Since 1994 other municipalities have followed Trenton's lead in building or planning minor league ball parks. Stadiums have opened in Frankford Township in Sussex County, Newark, Atlantic City and Bridgewater in Somerset County. Others are planned in Lakewood, Camden and North Wildwood.
One other minor-league hockey arena, in Atlantic City, is under way on the boardwalk, where the former convention center is being converted to a special events complex that will include a hockey arena.
Leisure industry professionals said there are several reasons why the growth of hockey arenas will not be as quick as the growth of baseball stadiums. Among them are that arenas are more expensive to build than ball parks and obtaining a hockey franchise is more difficult than obtaining one for a minor league baseball team.
Stoking the growth of sports complexes since 1985 is "a push toward affordable, family-oriented entertainment," said Robert Canton, national director of the sports, convention and leisure division at the Tampa, Fla., office of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
In the last 15 years, 90 minor-league baseball stadiums have been or are being built in the country, according to the office of Minor League Baseball in St. Petersburg, Fla., which governs minor league teams nationwide. That interest, Mr. Canton said, has spilled over to hockey arenas in the last five years.
Officials involved with stadium and arena projects said they not only were a way to compete for entertainment dollars, but also promoted economic development.
While Mr. Canton said such developments -- which, for the most part, are largely publicly financed -- can "generate a new level of interest" in municipalities, he cautioned against viewing them "as the sole catalyst to transforming blighted areas." Mr. Canton said that to increase the chances for success such projects should "be part of an overall plan to attract investment."
In Atlantic City, the ballpark and arena projects are considered a way "to bring family entertainment to the oceanside resort and establish it as more than just a gaming town," said James Kennedy, executive director of the state's Casino Reinvestment Authority. The authority, created under a 1984 state law to channel revenue from the casinos into urban renewal, and the city financed both projects.
THE $14.5 million, 6,000-seat stadium opened in 1998 as home of the Atlantic City Surf, an independent franchise in the Atlantic League. The site, 25 city-owned acres on Albany Avenue at the edge of an old municipal airport, is seven blocks from the Tropicana and the Hilton, the nearest casinos.
The stadium "will not have too much of an economic ripple effect," Mr. Kennedy said. He noted, however, that "it gives the city prestige and another amenity," adding that the long-term plan was to turn the land adjacent to the stadium into a recreation and park area, where an ice-skating rink is planned.
Mr. Kennedy said the hockey arena -- as part of the $76 million renovation of the city's landmark former boardwalk convention center into an entertainment complex -- was expected to have greater impact on economic development than the baseball stadium.
In addition to being home to the Atlantic City Admirals, an East Coast Hockey League team that is moving from Hampton Roads, Va., the 1,200-seat complex will also be the site of concerts and other sporting events, as well as the annual Miss America Pageant. The complex, scheduled for completion by 2001, will complement the $268 million convention center, which opened in 1997 in the city along with an adjoining 500-room Sheraton Hotel.
Trenton and Mercer County leaders say the baseball stadium and hockey arena are two anchors in an overall plan they describe as linking together a triangle of economic development. The third anchor is a $50 million, 199-room hotel and conference center, the city's first in decades. Construction of the full-service hotel, to be managed by Marriott, is to start next month.
"We expect all three to feed off one another," Mayor Palmer said, noting that while there had been some traffic and parking impacts they were outweighed by the benefits.
The $23 million 6,150-seat baseball stadium is home to the Trenton Thunder, an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. Attendance has averaged 440,000 a year, out of a possible 461,000, said Joseph Caruso, one of the owners of the team.
The stadium, part of a larger riverfront revival project that ultimately will include other recreational amenities like a fishing pier and an amphitheater, also has spurred the conversion of a nearby vacant factory to a restaurant/nightclub.
AND 18 months ago the Advance Group, of Bedminster, bought three adjacent half-empty office buildings with a total of 230,000 square feet, renovated them and brought them to full occupancy on a site Advance called Riverview at Trenton. The company is now negotiating for a 100,000-square-foot structure, the last building on the site,. and plans to start construction of a 750-car parking structure next year. It also plans to build a 400,000-square-foot, two-building retail and office complex as well as a second 750-car garage on the site.
"The stadium is not a panacea" said Stephen J. Kukan, senior vice president of business development at Advance. "But it shows the germ is in place for a serious revitalization effort, which bodes well for the growth of the city and, in turn, our investment."
The Sovereign Bank Arena, home to the Trenton Titans, part of the East Coast Hockey League, will also be the site of some 165 events, including concerts and other events, for which the seating will be expanded to 10,000.
The arena is considered the second phase of the redevelopment of the former Roebling complex, where the Berman Development Company L.L.C. of Trenton has built 181,000 square feet of office and retail space and is planning to build 50,000 more square feet of offices. A city-sponsored housing project -- 75 rental units for the elderly -- is also in place and work continues on the conversion of the former Roebling machine shop to a museum and science center.
Berman sold the land for the arena to the county and built it at a cost of $50 million, which includes the company's development fee. An additional $10 million was spent on street and parking improvements.
Ronald Berman, the company's chief executive and part owner of the hockey team, said 5,150 season tickets had been sold for its maiden hockey season this year,, indicating the arena so far has not competed with the ball park. There are also some early signs of an economic ripple effect, he said, pointing to an increase in business for area restaurants.
Agreeing with that assessment is Roland Pott, one of the developers and owners of the Urban Word Cafe, which opened last April on South Broad Street, across from the arena. In the early months business "was tough because there was little walk-by traffic," Mr. Pott said, adding that since the arena opened "sales have jumped."
He said it would also help his future development plans. The cafe and an adjacent bookstore occupy one of four buildings along South Broad Street with a total of 20,000 square feet that Mr. Pott said he and his partners had acquired. He said the other three buildings would be occupied by a nightclub, office space and artist studios.
Mayor Palmer said the challenge now was "to connect the transportation dots among the redevelopment areas and with the support of the hotel develop a market for overnight stays." While it's still too early to say what the arena and the stadium projects will really do, he said that they had accelerated the timetable to get to that goal.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Island's Second Hotel in a Decade to Open in a Month

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY

 BODY:
BARRING any unforeseen hitches, the 130-room, five-story Wingate Inn under construction here on Stewart Avenue is scheduled to open next month.
It will be only the second hotel to open on Long Island in more than a decade, following a 104-room Extended StayAmerica in Bethpage that accepted its first guests on June 30. 
 One other hotel is now under construction on Long Island, a 134-room facility in Melville that will also be part of the Extended Stay America chain. Another hotel is expected to start construction this winter, two others have all approvals and several more are in various stages of the planning process. In addition, older hotels are being upgraded and expanded.
Is there too much hotel construction? "Not for the demand," said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group, adding that room rates had "risen nicely."
Over a six-year period ended Sept. 30, occupancy rates on Long Island have risen from 63.6 to 76.8 percent and average room rates have risen from $75.21 to $111.44 a night, according to Smith Travel Research of Hendersonville, Tenn., an independent research agency that tracks hotels of 20 or more rooms.
"However," Dr. Kamer cautioned, "if the economy softens and business travel abates, that might be a different story."
The Garden City Wingate is representative of a new generation of hotels aimed especially at business travelers that dispenses with amenities such as the swimming pool and restaurant-bar of more traditional lodgings in return for lower rates.
The emphasis at the Wingate is on accommodating the business client, with an around-the-clock business center that will offer free facsimile transmissions anywhere in the United States and a computer, printer and copier. Rooms will have free high-speed Internet T-1 lines and two-line phones with a speaker, data port, voice mail and conference-call capabilities. The hotel will also have a meeting room with seating for 90 and a conference room for 12 people.
The "rack rates," an industry term for room rates without discounts, will be $139 a night until April 1 when they rise to $149 a night. But that is still far below those of a full-service hotel. At the nearby luxurious Garden City Hotel, rates range from $250 to $375 a night.
The Wingate will also have 12 suites, able to accommodate four to six people. Rates range from $179 to $209 a night; prices include breakfast.
"First and foremost, travelers want affordable accommodations," said Albert L. Salvatico, the developer of the $13.5 million Wingate, which will be managed by Hospitality Management of Garden City whose partners are Alan Fairbairn and Mr. Salvatico's brother, Louis L.
Albert Salvatico, who is an insurance executive, said he became a hotel developer "because I travel a lot so I know what travelers want and I also saw a good opportunity."
"As people see the hotels doing as well as they're doing and occupancies being so high, new people want to come into the marketplace with more hotel rooms because they see it as a place where they can make a profit," said Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention & Visitors Bureau and Sports Commission in Hauppauge.
Robert Lipper, president of Island-Metro Publications in Farmingdale, which publishes tourist and economic guides and tracks the hotel industry, estimated that 25 proposals for hotels were on the table, ranging from "someone saying we'd like to put a hotel up to people who are filing applications."
He estimated, however, that no more than 10 of the 25 were "serious proposals." Of those, he said, perhaps 6 would be built adding only about 1,000 new rooms to the region's current supply of about 15,000 rooms in all types of facilities including bed-and-breakfast inns.
Extended Stay America, a rapidly growing chain that owns and operates 352 hotels in 38 states, expects to open its Melville hotel early next year. It is seeking approvals from the Town of Brookhaven to build yet another with 104 rooms in Medford.
UNTIL Extended Stay America's entry into the Long Island market, the concept of providing rooms with kitchenettes for travelers who expect to stay a week or longer was available only at the 160-room Marriott Residence Inn in Plainview.
Now this type of accommodation is becoming the fastest growing segment of the Long Island industry. Another chain, Homewood Suites, is entering the market with a 138-room hotel to be built in Ronkonkomaa on Veterans Memorial Highway by a joint venture of Pitcairn-Parr of Ronkonkoma and Linchris Hotel Partners of Hanover, Mass. The hotel is expected to start construction this winter and to open a year later.
Demand for extended stay hotels, said Dr. Kamer of the Long Island Association, is a reflection of the growth of high technology companies on Long Island. "You have business travelers from other parts of the country and from around the world who come here for extended periods of time and don't want to rent an apartment," she said.
The average stay at an Extended StayAmerica hotel is three to four weeks, said Michael Wilson, vice president of marketing for the publicly traded company, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. At the Bethpage hotel, room rates for a 300-square-foot room with a fully equipped kitchenette are $469 a week and $94 a night and the hotel began achieving full occupancy within 30 days of opening, Mr. Wilson said.
The Homewood Suites hotel will be more upscale, with two-room suites and a full kitchen. The four-story building will have a traditional colonial-style design with a peaked roof and a brick exterior. Amenities will include an indoor pool, a business center, and a small convenience store for guests. Breakfast will be included in the rates, which have not yet been determined.
"Currently, there are no extended stay facilities in Suffolk County, and there is a need because of the way the economy has moved," said William A. Mullaney, senior vice president of Linchris Hotel Partners, which also owns the Hampton Inn in Commack.
Homewood Suites and Hampton Inns are both brand names of the Promus Hotel Corporation of Memphis.
Among hotels still needing approvals is a project by the J. D. Carlisle Development Corporation of Manhattan. The developer, which is about to start construction on a 268,000-square-foot shopping center on Carleton Avenue in Central Islip, has submitted plans to the Town of Islip for a $26 million, 225-room hotel that it proposes to build on the east side of Carleton Avenue, near the federal and state courts complex.
"We feel pretty sanguine about the project because we have several major chains, both extended-stay and full-service hotels, coming to us with offers," said Jules Demchick, Carlisle's president.
Some major investments are also being made by operators of existing hotels. The 35-year-old, 120-room Holiday Inn in Plainview, for example, is in the midst of being converted from a motel to a hotel. Rooms that had outside entrances are to be entered from interior corridors. When completed in the spring of 2000, the $7 million renovation will include a new lobby and a two-story addition with two meeting rooms on the ground level and six hotel rooms on its second floor. The restaurant and ballroom and the outdoor pool are also being refurbished.
THE 209-room Sheraton Long Island in Smithtown is also undergoing a $7 million renovation. "We have a very strong base of business, and to be competitive you have to invest money into your hotel," said Gary D. Tucker, the Sheraton's general manager. He said that there is still a strong demand for full-service hotels, which the Sheraton represents. Occupancy there is in the 80 percent range, he noted.
But industry observers are expressing some caution, saying that the demand for hotel rooms, which had been climbing over the last six years, is leveling off and that the market could be hurt if too many new rooms come on line, especially if the economy softens.
"If you have too many rooms, occupancy goes down, rates fall, and hotels get into trouble financially because they can't meet their debt service," said Mr. Lipper of Island-Metro Publications.
William A. Mullaney Jr., general manager of the Hampton Inn in Commack as well as president of the Long Island Hotel and Motel Association, noted, however, that hotel development on Long Island would always be limited because of the scarcity of land and the difficult approval process.
For example, a hotel was a permitted use for the 2.25-acre site occupied by the Garden City Wingate. Still, it took one year to get variances and three years to bring the project to completion, Albert Salvatico said.
John Tsunis, a Hauppauge lawyer and a hotel developer, said it took him two years to get approvals for two hotels he intends to build -- one with 139 rooms in Hauppauge, the other with 168 rooms in Farmingville.
Financing is beginning to become harder to get, Mr. Lipper noted. "One of the first things to get cut if the economy changes is travel and entertainment," he said. "The banks are becoming more cautious because so many got burned the last time around."

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
A Sophisticated Meal, Easy on the Wallet

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
IF appetizers are the apple of your eye, do I have a restaurant for you. It's called the California Cafe, but on weeknights, from 4 to 7, the bar and lounge area becomes appetizer heaven. That's when the price of every starter, including soups, salads and light entrees, is cut in half. Diners who enjoy the creativity, diversity, economy pr ordering two or three appetizers rather than conventional entree-centered meals will be delighted with the choices and fun available at this sleek Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall spot in Garden City (516-294-8686). Add a glass of any house wine for $3, and on Monday nights any bottle for half its regular price, and you have a varied and sophisticated feast for a virtual pittance.
A recent 12-dish spread for 4, complete with a bottle and two glasses of wine, cost $73. It was eaten off a paper-covered white tablecloth at a comfortable banquette of the warm, woody bar and lounge. (There is seating at the handsome mirror-backed bar or a number of tiny, uncovered cafe tables as well.) The California Cafe is anything but a typical shopping-center eatery. It is a handsome, even luxurious place that serves innovative West Coast dishes, often with Asian twists and turns, prepared by Daniel O'Connor, a talented chef. On weekends valet parking is available. 
 The 17 appetizers and light entrees on the menu in the bar and lounge are identical in size, quality and configuration to those in the dining room. The chef's warm, porous focaccia and crusty onion rolls tasted even better when dipped in the extra virgin olive oil available on every table; mibbling them made the task of choosing which and how many appetizers an agreeable one.
Dinner-sized plates, holding everything from dainty, fire-roasted Maine lobster to a huge sirloin burger (both $5.48) began arriving in short order along with a $23 bottle of Parducci pinot noir that was now $11.50. Although it's difficult to pick one dish over another when confronted with a virtual smorgasbord, some observations are possible. Definitely order soups ($1.75 cup, $2.25 bowl), though California-style salads ($2.75 to $3.48) are a close second choice. So-called light entrees ($4.98 to $5.98) are gigantic; diet-conscious eaters should target the Asian-influenced listings. The fried calamari ($3.48) was the single most outstanding dish we tried.
Both the soup of the day, a husky, warming puree of tomato-based vegetables, dense with navy beans, and the menu's portobello mushroom bisque were simply superb. The latter was creamy and rich but not so much so that it obscured the mushrooms' woodsy flavor. Aside from the absence of hearts in the hearts of romaine (just outer leaves), all the salads -- , a classic Caesar, a simple sprightly mix of baby, organic greens and especially the country concoction -- were first rate. The culinary counterpoint of goat cheese and dried cranberries in the country salad and the crusty spiced pecans in it and the romaine were noteworthy.
That thick, medium-rare sirloin burger on a warm bun, with nubbins of melting Gorgonzola cheese, sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions came with thin, addictive french fries lightly coated with a pesto of garlic, olive oil and parsley. An even larger light entree is the towering Oriental chicken salad ($5.98). Crowned with carrot hay and daikon sprouts and ringed by wispy cucumber rounds and crisp fried won tons, this colossus of Napa cabbage, onions, red peppers, enoki mushrooms, fried rice sticks, roasted almonds, carrots and grilled chicken strips, dressed in soy vinaigrette, is, as Mr. O'Connor says, "out of control."
The diners at our table were out of control when we devoured that tender, crisp, lighter than air, world-class calamari, with its pulpy, lively plum tomato and caper remoulade sauces. Aside from the Oriental chicken, the Asian contingent consisted of grilled chicken and smoked shiitake spring rolls ($3.48) presented with crunchy citrus jicama and hoisin barbecue sauce and a Thai beef and rock shrimp wrap ($4.98), soft, marinated meat and substantial shrimp in a mango sesame vinaigrette. The cold Maine lobster, a tiny taste of tail and claw meat strikingly turned out with a fan of cucumbers, asparagus, mango, watercress and dressed in a lemony vanilla bean vinaigrette, was overwhelmed by that citrus dressing.
 
Openings
When Mino Fazio was the chef at the now closed Da Mino in Port Washington, Nick Di Pacquale was one of his admirers. Now the two of them are partners at La Toscana, a new 100-seat storefront restaurant at 284 Glen Street in Glen Cove (516-759-1913) that opened last month where Il Vilero had been. Mr. Fazio, who is from Bari, Italy, said that his dinner entrees are priced from $17 (veal with shrimp) to $24 (veal chop).
 The Sea Port Restaurant, at 415 Main Street in Port Washington (516-883-3030), is the new name of Da Mino, an Italian eating place that was on this site. Paul Ram, the new chef who previously worked at Da Vinci and the Frog and the Peach, is now cooking more seafood than Da Mino offered. Steaks, chops and Italian dishes are also available.

HEADLINE: In Denver, Nostalgia in a New $50 Million Enclave

BYLINE: By MINDY SINK

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
FOR more than a century, the Elitch Gardens Amusement Park here was a place where families gathered for summer entertainment, picnics or just a stroll. Now, as houses replace roller coasters on the old site, the developers' hope is that those traditions will continue.
"There is a great phrase that the best cities have one foot in nostalgia, and one foot in prophecy," said Jonathan F. P. Rose, a developer based in Katonah, N.Y., who has joined a Denver developer and restaurateur, Chuck Perry, to form the Perry/Affordable Housing Development Corporation. "Some part of them reaches back to their past and the other to their future, and we really tried to do that here." 
 Mr. Perry and Mr. Rose bought the old amusement park site last year, four years after it had closed, and are building a $50 million mixed-use project there called Highlands' Garden Village. It is scheduled for completion in 2002.
The property, about three miles northwest of downtown Denver, is the first of three large mixed-use developments to go into construction here. The others are to be at the former Stapleton Airport and the old Lowry Air Force base.
So far, three homes are occupied and two dozen are under construction at Highlands' Garden Village. Later, stores and offices are to be built within walking distance of the homes. In the center of the site are two remnants of the amusement park's glory days -- the historic theater and the carousel house, which are to be restored. To date, 25 of the 31 detached houses in the first phase have been sold, with prices ranging from $200,000 to more than $300,000. The architect is Wolff-Lyon of nearby Boulder.
Following a master plan created by Calthorpe Associates of Berkeley, Calif., Highlands' Garden Village is designed to make the new homes and buildings blend in with the older, existing neighborhood around the site of the old amusement park, where family-owned shops and restaurants are within walking distance of the homes -- an element that Mr. Rose and Mr. Perry are now trying to emulate.
Most of the development's 51 houses will face existing homes outside the perimeter of the site. Like them, they will have a traditional look, with front porches and garages in the rear, reached from alleys between the houses. Some will have attached carriage houses with separate entrances above the garage, which may be used as rental apartments.
In later phases of the project, there will be a three-story housing complex with 63 apartments for the elderly; an 8-building, 90-unit apartment complex; 37 row houses and 90,000 square feet of commercial space. There will also be large areas of open space for community gardens and parks, a day-care center and possibly 23 live/work areas that are expected to be for artists.
In addition, the plan calls for a 34-unit co-housing complex -- where families live in their own homes, but are clustered together and share maintenance chores, child-care and meal preparation. The co-housing units are to have one to four bedrooms, and be priced from $140,000 to $250,000.
THE Elitch Gardens Amusement Park opened in 1890 on a broad hill that was considered remote from the bustling downtown at the time. It offered the public everything from botanical gardens to wild animals and thrill rides to big-name entertainers.
"When Elitch's left in 1994, it left a hole in the neighborhood," said Mr. Perry, whose home and restaurant are nearby. "There was a lot of uncertainty and concern about what would happen. This was not considered a 'hot' neighborhood then. It has always been primarily working-class."
Part of the development process involved meeting with community groups and residents who had endured long summers listening to the shrieks of riders on the Twister, the roller coaster at the park.
"I think the developers kept the good elements -- the theater, the gardens, the parks -- and it's no loss at all losing the amusement park," said Mary Riffle, who has lived across the street for 30 years. The developers plan three acres of parks and gardens.
The centerpiece of the project is actually a leftover from the park -- the historic octagonal two-story theater that was not only America's longest surviving summer stock showcase, but also where the first movies were shown in Denver and where stars such as Grace Kelly and Sarah Bernhardt appeared.
Currently, Perry/AHDC is trying to find a nonprofit organization that will renovate and run the theater with cultural events such as films, music festivals or plays.
"There is such a love and almost mysticism attached to this theater," Mr. Rose said. "What could we replace it with that could be any better? A shopping center? There's nothing we could do that would be better than this. These buildings come with such a heritage of goodwill that we can build upon."
Another remnant from the old park that has been incorporated into the design is the old carousel house, which will now serve as a gazebo near the restored "diagonal park" and the day care center. The carousel itself -- along with most of the rides from Elitch's -- was moved in 1995 when the owners relocated closer to downtown Denver in the Platte River Valley.
And there are other, less obvious, vestiges of days gone by. Elitch's was known as much for its gardens as for the Tilt-a-Whirl. Mr. Rose proudly points out that the honeylocust trees next to one of the completed houses had been moved within the park. Tulip bulbs were saved and will be replanted throughout the development in gardens and along walkways.
Although the novelty of the site's history makes it intriguing, it is actually the smallest of similar projects being developed in east Denver. One is at the former Stapleton Airport site on 4,700 acres, which is expected to have a mix of 12,000 residences and 17 million square feet of office and retail space. The other is at the old Lowry Air Force base on 1,866 acres, which is expected to have 4,000 homes and apartments and 2 million square feet of office and retail space.
All three of the developments hope to include schools and grocery stores, and there is a plan for a church at the former Stapleton Airport.
Mr. Rose considers these projects the recycling of previously developed land. "We're not reducing the supply of farmland, we're not destroying a forest, we're working where there's existing land," he said. "We're also working on existing infrastructure. A huge amount of environmental impact comes from the creation of new roads and new water and sewer systems."
Mr. Rose is a son of the late Frederick P. Rose, who was chairman of Rose Associates, a major owner-developer of housing in New York City. He left the family business in 1989 and now divides his time between his home office in Katonah and the Rocky Mountain region.
"At the time I started my business here, which is affordable housing, it was very difficult to do development work on the East Coast because of the recession," he said. "I had done some work in Santa Fe, and I love the Rocky Mountains, physically, the environment, the taste of the air."
Mr. Rose and Mr. Perry did their first project together in 1993, when they redeveloped the Denver Dry Goods building in the 16th Street Mall downtown.
The once-crumbling 104-year-old former department store now has 51 loft residences mixed with office space and a large retail space on the ground floor. The Denver Urban Renewal Authority extended partial financing both to that project and to Highlands' Garden Village.

HEADLINE: In Good Times, Cosmetic Surgery

BYLINE: By JOAN SWIRSKY 

 BODY:
WHAT price beauty? For Iris Grosso, 54, a divorced office manager from Great Neck, it was $20,500, which covered the cost of the face lift she had in August and the tummy tuck and liposuction she had in September on her thighs, stomach and knees. That doesn't include the cost of removing the bags under her eyes and the brow lift she had in 1993, or the nose job she had at 16.
She said her mother paid for her first operations and left her some money after she died that she used for her recent surgery. "I talked to my mother at the graveside," she explained, "and I knew she'd be happy I was doing this." 
 "I hated my parakeet nose and everybody saying 'Polly want a cracker?' to me," Ms. Grosso said, "and I always hated the bags under my eyes that I think I was born with. When I got older, I hated my turkey chin and jowls. Now I feel like a million dollars, and when people see me, they go bananas. They say, 'I can't believe you're going to be a grandma.' "
Ms. Grosso's willingness to spend tens of thousands of dollars on improving her looks is common on Long Island. With a high average income and a booming economy, Long Islanders are spending millions on cosmetic surgery, even though medical insurance covers the costly procedures only for patients who are disfigured by illness or injury.
The exact number of procedures performed on Long Island is not known, but a spokeswoman for the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons said the leading procedures in New York State were liposuction (16,647), eyelid surgery (11,315) and rhinoplasty (12,722). Only 5,687 breast augmentation procedures were performed, as opposed to 20,026 in California.
"It's an across-the-board phenomenon," said Dr. Frederick N. Lukash, 52, a plastic surgeon from Manhasset, referring to the teenagers, young adults and baby-boomers, male and female, who seek cosmetic surgery.
"People used to watch 'Father Knows Best,' but now they watch 'Baywatch,' where no one is dressed and they see all those perfect bodies, and they want them," Dr. Lukash said. "It's a youth-oriented society."
Cosmetic surgery patients are also less shy about telling the world than they used to be. "Plastic surgery, like psychiatry, used to be a private matter," Dr. Lukash said, "but today everything is an open book."
Edythe Guthy, a 33-year-old hairdresser from Levittown, is thrilled with her new figure. After losing 100 pounds and giving birth to two children, she found that her breasts had "no roundness and they were very unattractive." She paid for her breast augmentation with a loan from a finance company, although her fiance at the time told her "he loved me for what I am, with or without the surgery."
She said she opted for the surgery "to give me more self-confidence, which it did." Her fiance, who became her husband, "loves them," she said.
Dr. Robert Gotkin, 45, a plastic surgeon from Greenvale, confirmed that "breast enlargement is among the most popular choices, and this procedure and liposuction have replaced the nose job as the graduation presents du jour in the teenage set." About 25 percent of people having liposuction are men, he added.
Many of his patients seek cosmetic surgery "to stay viable in the workplace," Dr. Gotkin said. Other patients include widows and divorced people "who want to look better in order to meet someone new."
Mollie Seltzer, 55, a Manorhaven resident who works for a lighting company, nursed her second husband through four years of cancer treatment before he died two years ago. "We were married for 22 years," she said, "and when I looked in the mirror, I could see the toll all the stress had taken on my face. I looked haggard, 10 years older from all the crying." She decided to have a face lift, a brow lift, a rejuvenation for her eyes, and laser surgery around her mouth for the "lipstick bleed lines" common in former smokers.
"The thought of having general anesthesia was so scary that I almost canceled the night before," she said, "but I wasn't scared enough to not do it." The results were "worth it," she added. "Everyone said I looked beautiful, and when the U.P.S. driver at work told me I looked wonderful, I told him I had gone away on a two-week cruise.'
Ms. Seltzer recently read that "a woman over 35 has a better chance of being kidnapped by a terrorist than of meeting her soul mate, and it's true," she said. "Now, men notice me more than they did before, even younger men, and it makes me feel very good. But I did this for me, and I'll be doing it again when I'm 65. I tell my friends, 'Just go and do it.' "
Dr. Lukash said: "The root of everything we do comes down to self-esteem." He cited as poor candidates for surgery the woman who wants breast augmentation because her boyfriend likes big breasts, or the teenager whose parents both had rhinoplasty and want the same surgery for their child. "I say to these patients, 'The only reason for you to have this surgery is because you want it.' "
Dr. Gotkin added: "Sometimes a patient is depressed, and they want surgery for all the wrong reasons: they were rejected, or their spouse is having an affair." Other patients may have body dysmorphic disorder, he explained, in which they are disproportionately fixated on some aspect of their appearance. "In this case, they often need counseling or psychiatric help."
Prices vary from region to region, but on Long Island the cost of rhinoplasty is generally $7,500; a face lift, $10,000; breast augmentation, $5,000; breast reduction, $10,000, and liposuction about $3,000 per anatomical site. None of these figures, however, include anesthesia and use of the operating and recovery rooms, which will add at least $1,000 to the total bill.
The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons reports that more than two million plastic surgery procedures were performed nationwide in 1998. Of these, just over half were for reconstruction or repair after trauma, tumor removal and lacerations, the kind of work many plastic surgeons view as the core of their practice.
But it's the cosmetic surgery that pays for their Mercedes-Benzes. The business is so lucrative that it now includes a sizable but uncounted number of cosmetic procedures performed by dermatologists, ophthalmologists, dentists and other doctors who have gone outside their specialties to supplement their incomes with high-ticket procedures.
"Many of these specialists gravitate towards cosmetic surgery because their incomes have taken such a hit from managed care," Dr. Gotkin said. "They try to bolster diminishing incomes with elective, out-of-pocket procedures that are free of the encumbrances of the insurance industry. But most don't have the background or training to perform these procedures safely, nor the ability to deal with potential complications."
Age will eventually take its toll, of course, on even the finest face lift. But many people opt for truly temporary cosmetic procedures that won't last much longer than a hair-coloring job. And cosmetic surgeons report a rise in demand for these quick fixes as the millennium approaches.
Dr. Stephen Greenberg, a Great Neck surgeon, offers a package that includes a "power peel" to smooth and polish the skin, collagen injections to get rid of deep facial lines, and botox injections to decrease crow's feet around the eyes and lines in the forehead. The effects can last several months, he said. Prices vary by procedure but run into the hundreds of dollars.
Dr. Deborah S. Sarnoff, a cosmetic surgeon from Greenvale, said her "21st-century look-good, feel-great package" will remove age spots, unwanted hair on the chin and upper lip, and broken blood vessels in the face. She includes a facial, makeup application and skin-care regimen to maintain the new you."
"People are more interested in looking great for this once-in-a-lifetime experience," she said, "than they are in any potential Y2K problems."

HEADLINE: HOME REPAIR;
Carpentry, Asian Style: Using Japanese Handaws

BYLINE: By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI

 BODY:
MOST Japanese tools, planes, hammers and chisels are similar in appearance and design to their Western counterparts. Japanese handsaws, however, are different from handsaws designed and manufactured by European and American toolmakers because they cut on the pull stroke, not the push stroke.
Experts are not sure how this came about -- other Asian countries, like China and Korea -- have push-cut saws like ours. Some historians believe the Japanese handsaw was developed to cut the soft, straight-grained cedar and cypress woods that are the primary building materials of Japanese carpenters. Other authorities think the saw was designed to fit the needs of Japanese woodworkers, who work primarily from a seated position holding the work with their bare feet. 
 Japanese saws look different; they have long handles fixed in line with the blade. Since they cut on the pull stroke, not the push stroke, the blade is not under tension so there is no tendency for it to bind and bend as it cuts. Consequently blades on Japanese saws are harder and thinner and have more teeth per inch than Western saws. This means that the blades will cut faster and with less effort than a push saw, and because they are easier to control it is possible to make more accurate cuts.
Traditionally, Japanese saws were made entirely by hand. The saw maker forged a laminated blade blank, then cut and tempered the teeth. The blades were then fitted with a wooden handle wrapped with rattan. Today most saw blades are made from factory-rolled steel with the teeth cut by a power grinder fitted with a diamond wheel. While the wooden handle is still popular, many manufacturers are turning to more contemporary materials, like nylon, to fashion handles.
There are three types of Japanese saw: the dozuki, the ryoba and the azebiki. Each saw is designed for a specific use. In Japanese the word dozuki means shoulder or tenon, and the dozuki saw is used in cabinet making to cut dovetails and tenons. The dozuki has a thin blade with a single row of teeth. Some dozuki saws have a stiffening spine (usually made of brass) to keep the blade stiff and straight.
The ryoba is the traditional carpenter's general-purpose saw. It has a long straight blade with teeth on both sides -- crosscut teeth on one side and rip teeth on the other. This makes the ryoba an economical tool to buy because you get two cutting tools for the price of one. A ryoba blade is flexible, so you can work in tight quarters bending the handle away from the blade to keep from scraping your knuckles on the work.
Some ryobas, and a few dozukis, have blades that curve along the leading edge. The teeth, sometimes called "woodpecker" teeth, along this rounded edge allow you to make a plunge or pocket cut in the middle of the work without drilling a pilot hole first.
The azebiki has a short curved blade with teeth on both sides. The blade design makes it easy to make pocket cuts -- cuts in the middle of a panel -- and to cut in very tight spaces. This saw can also be pulled along a straight lie to make precise cuts.
Cutting with a Japanese saw takes a little bit of practice. Novices usually adopt a stance more natural to the western sawyer and grip the saw with one hand. However, greater control and accuracy can be gained by gripping the handle with two hands. Most western saws are positioned at a 45-degree angle for cutting, but Japanese saws cut better if they are held closer to the work at a shallow 10- to 20-degree angle. This puts more teeth in contact with the work so the cutting is faster and more accurate. It is also easier to operate the saw if the work is positioned below waist level.
In general, position your body directly in front of the cut and pull the saw toward you. It is easier and more accurate to start the cut by holding the saw with one hand while using the other to guide the blade; the fingers should be near the center of the blade not near the teeth. As the saw cuts into the wood, move the guide hand to grip the handle. Do not apply any downward pressure; instead let the teeth bite into the wood as you pull the saw.
Japanese saws can cost from $20 to $50, although it is possible to pay as much as $250 for a fine, handcrafted model. Admittedly most neighborhood hardware stores and even the average home center do not carry them. Instead, you will have to buy them through a mail order supplier.

The March of Progress

BYLINE: By JEFFREY RUBIN; Jeffrey Rubin is a professor of economics at Rutgers University.

 BODY:
SOMETIMES I wonder if all the attention to facts, figures and the future -- test scores, college placement statistics and so on -- ignores the importance of the day-to-day experiences high schools provide our children. In the language of the economist, there may be as much to the consumption benefits of school as there is to the investment aspect of school.
I bring this up because every year for the last eight, my wife and I have spent a good part of our weekends following our two sons and about 200 of their schoolmates as they performed with the high school marching band. For us, long night and weekend music practices, half-time shows at football games and spirited band competitions are as much a sign of autumn as cleaning leaves from the gutter or moving the summer clothes to the cedar closet. 
 We are band parents, a very odd species, more common in New Jersey than one would suspect. The members of this species spend a great deal of time watching the band perfect its show. On occasion they do venture out of the stadiums, dressed in school colors, if only to help sell decals or pester friends and relatives to buy candy. More likely, they can be found riding long distances on school buses jammed with teenagers trying to change from street clothes to band uniforms, or hidden away in high school sewing rooms stitching yet another uniform for the color guard. We are grown-up groupies.
We've been lucky; our two trumpets have enjoyed success on the football fields of New Jersey without ever have to strap on a helmet or get knocked unconscious trying to tackle a running back. (No one's child actually plays an instrument. Instead, we refer to our children as being a trumpet or tuba or clarinet. They and their instrument become one.)
On a Saturday earlier this month, we completed another season, culminating just as the seven before had. Under the artificially illuminated night sky, in the cold and wind of Giants Stadium, our band, the Piscataway High School Superchiefs, was one of nine in the Group V Open event. Bands, and their entourages of parents and siblings, aunts and uncles, came from five states to vie for the title.
The crowd oohed and aahed, applauded and rang cowbells or shook milk containers loaded with coins to spur on their band. Images of each band and its formations filled the giant screen high above the stadium.
Between performances, the screen offered a recorded message from Meryl Streep and Gloria Estefan. They recited the virtues of music education and pleaded with us to get involved in local school decisions to ensure a vibrant and expansive music program. Talk about preaching to the choir. I suspect that many in the crowd are frequent participants in school budget debates. We like to think that the pride our town takes in its marching band plays a role in our reasonably good record of passing budgets with enough money to maintain a strong music program.
As the final band completed its performance, Saturday night had turned into Sunday morning, and the cold wind blew pods from the nearby marsh grass across the field. The clock was nearing 1:30 a.m. The announcer turned his attention to the Group V results, reporting each band's score, from lowest to highest. It came down to just two bands; the Superchiefs and their perennial rivals from Pennsylvania.
Finishing second was a great accomplishment for our kids, but it is hard on the band parents. Year after year, a lot of people, young and old, learn some valuable lessons during band season; some are just a little harder to take than others.
After a cooling-off period that lasted as long as it took to drive from exit 16W to exit 10 on the turnpike, plus a few minutes of grumbling about the judges, our attention returned to the students and their teachers. And at 3 a.m., when the nine buses returned to the high school, the band parents were there to cheer this year's band. Mixed with the disappointment and sadness was the opportunity for parent and child to embrace and then walk away, knowing all the hours and all the work were worth it.
So, as the media and the policy analysts and the parents of New Jersey's children struggle to understand all the data available to evaluate school quality, my suggestion is that everyone take a closer look at the extracurricular opportunities a school district offers. Based on my experience, there is no better place to start than with the high school's marching band.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Welfare Reform Is a Success, So Voters Are Led to Believe

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
Only a group of Democrats would give up a perfectly good Sunday evening at home, with the Broncos and the Seahawks still playing football, for crying out loud, to go hear about the problems of the poor.
Yet there they were, members of the Princeton Community Democratic Organization, sitting in the Princeton Borough Hall and hearing not just the statistics but the very names and stories of the men and women and kids who have not yet been pushed or pulled out of welfare -- the verb is politically significant -- by Work First New Jersey, the state's welfare reform plan. 
 Everyone has heard about the great success of welfare reform, which combines a stick -- a five-year limit on the dole -- with numerous carrots, including help with child care, medical care, housing and transportation. A preliminary study of the system by Mathematica Policy Research has found that about 35 percent of 1,400 welfare families had left the rolls and found jobs that paid an average of $1,600 a month, nearly double the $800 average for those in the study who remained on welfare.
Good news for the success stories, certainly, although $1,600 a month is hardly easy street. But the 50 so men and women who met last Sunday were worried about the failures, the 27 percent in Mathematica's survey who were neither working nor receiving benefits, or the 12 percent who reported no means of support. Who were they, the organizers wanted to know on Sunday night, and who are they here in Mercer County, the capital county?
"The average age of the homeless in Mercer County is seven," said Sheldon Sturges, the president of the Princeton Democrats. The county's only homeless shelter, the Sleep-E-Hollow Motel on Route One in Lawrence, was flooded by Tropical Storm Floyd, and the homeless are now being sent to Pennsylvania, "like our garbage," Mr. Sturges added. "Twenty-sixe thousand people in Mercer County are living in povery, and 9,500 of them are children," he said.
Mr. Sturges added: "It's true that the welfare rolls are falling. But it's also true that the bottom 12 percent are falling off the face of the earth."
The Democrats maintained that the state government, which is run by Republicans, lacks the will to attack the problem of what welfare officials call "the hard to serve." And they were upset to read on a federal Web site that New Jersey still had $233 million funds from Federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, going unspent. Why wasn't some of that money going to the bottom 12 perecent? The news media elsewhere have picked up on similar unspent balances in other states and have asked the same questions.
In the case of New Jersey, that matter of the $233 million surplus is at least easy to answer. "That must be an old report, because it isn't true," said Jacqueline Tencza, the spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. "Through September 30th, which is the end of the federal fiscal year, we have spent or allocated all of the federal welfare dollars for New Jersey."
Some of the money -- like $100 million for a three-year child care assistance program -- only gets spent over time, Ms. Tencza said.
But that still leaves the harder question of what to do with former welfare recipients who have exhausted their eligibility and have either not been able or willing to pull themselves and their children into the working world.
"These are very vulnerable people," Sally Osmer, director of the Crisis Ministry of Princeton and Trenton, told the gathering. "They are not people who want to see themselves in this situation. They may not have engaged in the best planning, but they are still in crisis."
Connie Mercer, director of HomeFront, another social agency, listed the people she knew who were at the end of the rope: Chris, a single man, a graduate of Lawrence High School and a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic; Darren, HIV-positive and "a heavy drug addict." Sharon, who lost her benefits because she could not name the man who fathered her child several years ago.
"Just because the welfare rolls are lower, and my God, the rolls are lower! -- doesn't mean that welfare reform is a success," Ms. Mercer said.
The state is increasing the money it will spend on helping the hard to serve find employment and to stay off welfare, but ultimately, the question of helping those who can't or won't help themselves will become a political question, and therefore a political question for the chairman of the Senior Citizens, Veterans' Affairs and Human Services Committee, State Senator C. Louis Bassano of Union Township.
"Contrary to what some people believe, we are our brother's keeper," Mr. Bassano said. "We are a generous country, and when there is a disaster someplace we are the first ones there, trying to help, and I think people in America feel the same way about people who need help." But there is no blank check.
"For the people who need help and can't help themselves, the public wants society to provide the help," Mr. Bassano went on. "But the ones who can help themselves and won't help themselves, those are the ones people are willing to walk away from. And that reflects my feelings exactly."

Tropical Treats, at the Corner Store

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
BEHIND the counter of a bodega at West 169th Street and Audubon Avenue in Washington Heights, Antonio Araujo rings up purchases, hands over packs of cigarettes and occasionally dispenses a single, unwrapped cookie or candy to a customer wanting a reminder of home.
A dozen transparent plastic containers are stacked at Mr. Araujo's elbow, each holding 24 confections, like bread pudding, coconut balls and a caramel fudge called dulce de leche, sold in individual pieces for between 40 and 99 cents. On a patron's request, the clerk pries open a container and provides patrons with paper squares to pull one out. 
 "We sell loads of them," said Mr. Araujo, who, like the store's other employees and most of its customers, was born in the Dominican Republic. There, and in other parts of Latin America, the same sweets are sold this way.
In New York's Latino food stores, these confections are common. At least two or three containers stand on the counters at many bodegas, most of which are now owned by Dominicans, according to Alfred P. Placeres, president of the New York State Federation of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. Like the rugelach or macadamia nut cookies heaped in glass jars in other food shops in the city, these items suggest home cooking. There are also custardlike desserts sold in plastic cups.
Many of these tropical treats are produced by a handful of small Latino-owned bakeries in the city. Business is conducted in Spanish, and there is little contact with the English-speaking mainstream. Started with little capital and unable to obtain loans, some of these stores are struggling. The bakeries' finances are tied to those of the bodegas, which, Mr. Placeres said, have been squeezed by rent increases in recent years.
On the other hand, the sweets have plenty of potential customers. There are 750,000 Dominicans already in the city and 20,000 more arriving annually, according to the Dominican Studies Institute at the City University of New York.
"The market is there," said Rafael Reynoso, president of the Gollo Bakery, speaking in Spanish. Mr. Reynoso showed a visitor around his small bakery on Suydam Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, as workers scooped mounds of peanut confection onto trays. With two walk-in ovens, Gollo, unlike some even smaller competitors, makes bread and crackers as well as sweets.
Mr. Reynoso, 58, founded the company months after his 1991 arrival in the United States. His initial investment was $5,000, the proceeds from the liquidation of a cheese factory he had owned for 30 years in the Dominican Republic, he said.
In addition to himself and a son, Elizardo, Mr. Reynoso has six employees. Monthly sales are about $15,000 during the winter, which is the busiest season because customers often avoid candy in the summer in favor of ices, soda or ice cream.
Like many other small food companies, Gollo has no trucks of its own. So Mr. Reynoso uses 8 to 10 independent route salesmen to sell and deliver his wares. Each deals regularly with at least 20 bodegas a day.
Why is the food unpackaged? "Latinos won't buy anything wrapped," Mr. Reynoso said. He overstates the case a bit. At the Bravo supermarket around the corner from Mr. Reynoso's bakery, coconut cookies from New Jersey are sold in clamshell containers.
Raymond Cornil, manager of the Bravo store, said he knew Gollo's products and would consider buying them if they were packaged. "Loose things," Mr. Cornil said, "are for small businesses."
Mr. Reynoso would like to buy more ovens and mixers to increase production. But he has payments to make on the ones he bought from local equipment vendors, with whom he negotiated through translators because he and his son speak little English.
"I have many complications," Mr. Reynoso said.
Rachel Bakery and Candy, in the Bronx, is smaller than Gollo, said Meiling Martinez, who founded it six years ago with her husband, Raul. At first, she said, they operated it illegally in their home kitchen, working around the clock with other family members. "We couldn't sleep" because of the noise, she recalled.
Now with two employees, the company produces candies and other stove top products -- but no baked goods -- in a cramped industrial space on West 238th Street in Kingsbridge. Among its products is meringue candy, made of egg whites and sugar, just like the topping on meringue pies.
Mrs. Martinez laughed as she remembered her first failed attempts to produce candy in bulk with the family-sized recipes she had brought from the Dominican Republic. Initially, she said, the independent route salesmen refused to handle her goods, so she and her husband had to distribute them on their own. But when the salesmen saw the items popping up in bodegas, they began asking the company for orders.
Now, Rachel Bakery distributes its goods through Syn-Chriss Importer Wholesale, of the Inwood section of Manhattan. Syn-Chriss, with $3 million in annual sales, provides about 50 route salesmen with a range of tropical products for Latino consumers, said its president, Ramon Castillo.
Both Mrs. Martinez and Mr. Castillo said the route salesmen, or ruteros, have the most profitable link in the chain. Also, "They don't work the hours we do," Mrs. Martinez said. But still, said Mr. Castillo, himself a former rutero, "You have to be likable."
Despite her hard work and ownership of a business -- facts that many Americans would link with bright prospects -- Mrs. Martinez might be considered part of the "hidden unemployed" by some scholars. Many of New York's poor ethnic groups often start up businesses not out of entrepreneurial zeal but out of a lack of alternatives, said Silvio Torres-Saillant, director of the City University of New York's Dominican Studies Institute. "There isn't a job for them, so they conjure one up," he said, but the work often fails to provide decent hours and pay.
Mrs. Martinez, who immigrated 30 years ago and speaks English, sees no signs of the economic boom from her view in the Bronx. "People don't have money," she said. Her company was started with a $6,000 loan from her brother, but she has found no loans since.
Asked if she dreamed of expanding her company, she replied, "Sometimes it's not good to have dreams."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Trade Pact With China: Hold the Applause

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
FOR more than 100 years, American business has been bewitched by the size and potential of China. The experience, of course, has been a rocky one. But the dreams live on.
Investors are not immune, either.
In the glow of the trade liberalization agreement that the United States struck with China last week -- a necessary condition for China's entry into the World Trade Organization -- many Chinese stocks have surged on major American exchanges. 
 The trade deal is good news, but the market's reaction may be premature and, some experts say, overdone.
Over the past 21 months, Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has traveled to China eight times. Last week, he took some time to put the trade agreement into perspective. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. The United States is China's biggest single trading partner, but this country exports only about $15 billion of goods and services there each year. If this deal is approved by Congress, should people expect that number to skyrocket?
 
A. Even if exports doubled, which they will not, it is not a watershed event. It's pretty clear that a year from now we will not be celebrating the end of the U.S. trade deficit as we know it. This agreement is generally a constructive development, but not one of instant gratification for investors around the world.
Possibly the most important conclusion I would take from this is that it is really a watershed event for Chinese economic reform. And it offers a real chance that we will be able to participate in what is likely to be the greatest economic development story of the 21st century.
 
Q. Aside from trade, is it likely that foreign direct investment in China will rise as a result of the agreement?
 
A. I think foreign direct investment will go up a lot. So far this year, it has slumped compared to 1998: through October, about $32 billion in direct investment, compared with $46 billion a year earlier. To a large extent, that is a byproduct of the Asian crisis, which has acted as a disincentive.
 
Q. What sorts of companies are likely to benefit most rapidly from trade liberalization?
 
A. The telecom area will be a real opportunity immediately. Anything with a technology content to it has demand for it. Given the lack of infrastructure, the wireless opportunities are truly extraordinary. I go to China a lot, and almost everyone in Beijing or Shanghai has a cell phone.
Opportunities in financial services may not emerge quite so promptly, but it is hard to say.
 
Q. To what extent is the publicity surrounding this deal masking the difficulties companies will face in trying to break into China?
 
A. There will clearly be sentiment in some quarters to avoid giving too much away to foreigners. But the Chinese leadership has demonstrated they are pretty determined to play by the rules.
Still, the culture of bureaucratic corruption, which is something I have heard about but not seen, is not something that gets broken overnight. And there is no mistaking the depth and breadth of the bureaucratic culture in a managed economy. There is nothing foolproof here.
 
Q. In order for China to gain acceptance into the W.T.O., Congress, European nations and Canada must approve. Will they?
 
A. Seven months ago, when the deal fell through, the political forces were struck against a deal.
But now there is an increased likelihood of Congressional approval. And I think the Europeans will definitely follow suit. The economics are just too compelling not to do this. It is basically a win-win proposition to have greater access to the world's most populous economy.
 
Q. Will this give W.T.O. members a boost at the next round of trade liberalization talks that will start in Seattle later this month?
 
A. I think it is really important for the Seattle talks, because it will have a significant impact on the tone of the discussions. As a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, W.T.O. has been in search of an identity. Managing the accession of China will be very important to it.
 
Q. Will trade liberalization have an immediate impact on China's economic growth?
 
A. Throughout most of the 1990's, the Chinese economy, which is about $1 trillion in size, has been growing at about 10 percent a year. This year it will grow around 7 percent, and it could expand at an 8 or 8.5 percent rate in 2000.
Admission into the W.T.O. won't hurt growth, but it won't help much either over the next year or so. Over time, say the next three to five years, you will begin to see some meaningful growth, probably driven by foreign direct investment, but also by Chinese consumers, who have been on the sidelines.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM/MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS;
Furniture Store of Older Era Swept Up in Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Nearly 30 years ago, as part of federal urban renewal, the city took possession of the block of 125th Street that is home to Nat Krohn's store, Corvett Furniture Corporation. Mr. Krohn was allowed to stay on as a tenant, and he did, paying rent to the city.
But now the chickens of urban renewal are coming home to roost in a coop that looks very much like Corvett Furniture. Harlem is being redeveloped on a grand scale, and most of the bedraggled block between Lexington and Third Avenues where the store sits is being swept up in the change. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation is selling the land to the Blumenfeld Development Corporation, which has agreed to develop a retail complex there. So, at the end of December, Mr. Krohn must vacate the premises after 47 years.
All the furniture in his store is on sale, half price. He is more than half angry.
"I was even thinking of going to get Al Sharpton, and I hate the guy," he said.
The city says that it has agreed to pay Mr. Krohn $169,000 in relocation benefits, although he says he has nowhere to relocate to. Mr. Krohn first learned of the city's plans more than a year ago, said Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
It would be hard to argue that more development in East Harlem, whose rebirth has lagged behind that of central and western Harlem, is a bad thing. The company has said that it plans to bring a shopping center with a 10-screen multiplex to the block, where, other than a fast food restaurant on the corner, Mr. Krohn's is the only commercial business.
As Corvett Furniture prepares to pack up, Seaman's Furniture is preparing to move in down the street. It has signed a lease with Gateway Ventures, which is developing an $8.6 million project at the northwest corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street.
Mr. Krohn's store is the old-fashioned kind, with couches and television sets and bedroom sets spread over four unfancified floors. There are pictures of him and his wife with the horses they own and train. And there is a group of employees who call themselves the "gray-haired club," most of whose members have several decades of service at the store.
"There was a relationship between the customers and the store," said Jose Ruiz, who has worked at Corvett for 35 years. "But there was some kind of more deep feeling: friendship." AMY WALDMAN

HEADLINE: Bumpers Cave In to the Bump and Grind

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
WHEN the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rammed a 1999 Mazda Protege into a pole in Virginia early this year, the impact reached California.
At Mazda's North American headquarters in Irvine, officials scrambled to clean up a public-relations mess. The '99 Protege suffered $4,609 in damages in four 5 m.p.h. crashes -- the worst showing, by far, of nine vehicles tested. It was also a turnabout; a '97 Protege had suffered just $1,930 in testing damage. 
 The problem stemmed from a redesign. To trim about two pounds, part of a broader effort to reduce weight and improve mileage, Mazda had eliminated an aluminum bar and energy-absorbing foam. After the test results became public, Mazda decided to return to the previous design for 2000-model Proteges.
 Bumper tests like these can leave consumers scratching their heads. How can a series of 5 m.p.h. impacts cause nearly $5,000 in damage? Don't federal rules protect consumers' wallets from such big whacks?
Not really, consumer advocates say. Indeed, there has been a decades-long debate over whether consumers are served or shortchanged by the rules governing bumpers.
In 1977, the government required that the bumpers of all new cars meet a 5 m.p.h. standard. That meant there could be no damage to safety-related items (headlights and turn signals) or to exterior surfaces (the body or sheet metal). It did allow damage to bumpers and attaching hardware. The standard was later strengthened to prohibit substantial harm to the bumper, allowing only minor damage.
Then, during the energy crisis, automakers complained that the heavier bumpers reduced fuel economy. In 1983, the government relaxed its rules.
Cars must now meet this standard: A 2.5 m.p.h. crash cannot damage safety-related parts or body panels. There can, however, be damage to the bumper. Lots of damage.
"You could destroy the bumper," said Brian O'Neill, president of the insurance institute, a lobbying and research group that is largely financed by the insurance industry. The institute tests the bumpers of about 25 vehicles a year.
Why should consumers care? After all, the insurance companies are the ones writing the big checks.
"Consumers don't realize how much difference a good bumper makes in terms of what they pay every six months or so to their favorite institution, the auto insurance companies," said Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute. That organization, which is also financed by auto insurers, provides information to help the companies set rates. "Premiums are influenced by how frequently collisions occur and how much money it takes to repair the damage," Mr. Hazelbaker said.
Since nearly half of collision claims are for $1,000 or less, they have a big effect on insurance premiums. And minor damage almost always involves bumpers.
"These are low-speed collisions that all too often are generating high repair bills," Mr. O'Neill said.
Not only do flimsy bumpers mean that consumers pay higher premiums, but the deductible comes directly out of the consumer's pocket. The most common collision deductible is $500, Mr. Hazelbaker said.
The financial penalty can be even larger for the millions of people driving supposedly rough, tough light trucks, particularly sport utilities. The current bumper standard -- weak as it is -- applies only to cars. There is no standard for light trucks.
"These people think they are in an invincible Goliath when in fact their invincible Goliath has an Achilles' heel," said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety.
Although the damage suffered by the Protege was high, it has been worse for trucks, including minivans.
The midsize sport utility vehicles tested by the insurance institute suffered damage from $2,918 ('99 Mercedes ML320) to $6,282 ('99 Mitsubishi Montero Sport). Four of the six had repair bills of more than $5,000. Among pickups, the '98 Dodge Dakota had $3,863 in bumper damage; the '98 Toyota Tacoma had $4,361.
If the automakers are failing to design better bumpers, can they be compelled to do so? The United States Department of Transportation could impose stricter standards, but hasn't. That leaves groups like the insurance institute, which uses the carrot and stick of publicity.
"We are trying to embarrass the automakers that have bad bumpers and praise the automakers that have good bumpers," Mr. O'Neill said. He said he had seen some improvement.
This may save money for the insurance companies, but Mr. O'Neill says there is also a clear benefit to consumers. "If you ask a consumer would you like a car with a bumper that sustains expensive damage or one that sustains no damage, I think the answer is clear," he said.
The problem, consumer groups say, is that many automakers have either forgotten, or no longer care about, the original purpose of bumpers: to take the hard knocks of daily driving and protect the rest of the vehicle.
Bumpers first appeared on automobiles in 1906. (The Wescott touring car was the first vehicle with standard front and rear bumpers, in 1919.) Today, designers strive to blur the lines between where the bumper ends and the car begins, but Mr. O'Neill argues that bumpers should again be distinct and utilitarian.
In his view, a bumper should be set away from the expensive sheet metal and lights. It should jut out, making it hard for an impact to reach the body. It should absorb the energy of a minor collision.
"A bumper should bump," Mr. O'Neill said.
He cites the 1981 Ford Escort as a standard that manufacturers should emulate: its bumpers sustained no damage in any of the four tests. Like the bumpers of many past cars, the Escort's were mounted to shock absorbers. And they stuck out.
"Unfortunately, it was not one of the prettiest cars on the road," said David Champion, auto testing director at Consumer Reports magazine.
Style and substance do not have to be incompatible. The chic Volkswagen New Beetle had damage totaling only $134 from all four low-speed crashes at the insurance institute.
"The Beetle is the only car the institute has tested that begins to compare with the 1981 Ford Escort," Mr. O'Neill said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Mania of Momentum And the Cost of Trading

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
PHOOEY on the Fed.
Not about to let Tuesday's interest rate increase stop their runaway train, stock traders rode the major indexes back into record territory last week. The Standard & Poor's 500 closed near its high, up 15.68 percent for 1999, while the Nasdaq composite reached yet another record, up 53.65 percent for the year. 
 But if rising interest rates don't seem to faze stock investors, rising volatility should. While stock prices have been rocketing, price swings in shares are now approaching levels seen only during two famous crisis periods: the Russian debt collapse of last summer and the crash of 1987.
High volatility makes it harder for investors to get in and out of trades at reasonable prices and therefore raises trading costs. Although increasing volatility permeates all aspects of the market, price movements among the largest companies are most disturbing because they are the ones that investors believe are the safest and most liquid.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, price swings among the 100 largest stocks in the Russell 1000 index are now averaging 42 percent, annualized, close to the 44 percent during the Russian crisis and the 46.5 percent endured in 1987. "Everyone looks to these companies as being the most liquid," said Keith L. Miller, director of United States quantitative research at Salomon Smith Barney, "but they're experiencing greater volatility."
Behind these swings are high prices -- which leave much room to fall -- and investor concentration in a handful of growth stocks. But the mania for stocks that are rising -- known as momentum investing -- contributes mightily to volatility, too. Online investors made the technique notorious, but now even pension fund managers have succumbed to its lures.
Mr. Miller likens the role of momentum investing in today's volatility to the effect that portfolio insurance had on the market in 1987. That strategy, which increased exposure to the S. & P. 500 as the price rose and lessened it as the price fell, failed because the market could not absorb the selling when everyone wanted out.
Today, instead of zeroing in on an index, many investors focus on a small group of individual stocks. These heavily influence the entire market's volatility, which causes investors to underestimate the risk in their portfolios, Mr. Miller said.
That view is echoed in a recent report from Sanford C. Bernstein, which says that the volatility of the stocks owned by the typical online investor -- a k a momentum players -- is double that of the broad market. These traders turn over their portfolios at six to seven times the rate of the market.
Never mind that excessive trading almost guarantees subpar investment performance. Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California at Davis, studied 78,000 households trading stocks through a large discount broker between 1991 and 1996. Those trading the most earned annual returns of 11.4 percent, compared with 18.5 percent among infrequent traders. Frequent traders also lagged behind the market's return -- 17.9 percent.
So, frequent traders do poorly in their own accounts and raise other investors' costs by increasing volatility. Does anybody else see something wrong with this picture?

Is There a Butler In the House?

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
HEN Mary Ellen Keating became engaged, she decided on a do-it-yourself wedding and immediately descended into six months of detail hell. How many New Yorkers, after all, have the time to fret over seating charts and apple tarts, twice-baked crab and Aunt Rose's taxi? So when Ms. Keating turned 40 two years ago, she did what any self-respecting New Yorker with more money than time would do: She hired a consultant.
"I wasn't going to go through that again," said Ms. Keating, a senior vice president at Barnes & Noble. "So I turned to Tinker Boe." Ms. Boe runs a consulting and catering business called Mood Food, which specializes in concept parties tailored to each client's personality. 
 At Ms. Keating's party, guests were led through rooms decorated and filled with foods and wines "to match my character traits," Ms. Keating said. "Everyone was given a brochure to guide them through the rooms. One was bubbly, one sweet, one bold, one subtle, and so on. It was Tinker's idea, not mine. But it was fabulous."
Party planning has always been big business in New York, but lately it has gotten a lot bigger. Ten years ago, most clients were Park Avenue matrons vying to outdo one another's dinner parties, free-spending corporations celebrating themselves and their money, and big-name charities holding black-tie affairs at Midtown hotels.
All of that continues. But business is also booming at the smaller, less opulent end of the party spectrum. Increasingly, harried New Yorkers with unexpectedly large amounts of cash to burn are hiring consultants to help them wine, dine and impress colleagues, friends and family in the comfort of their own living rooms.
"With this economy, people can't help but spend money on entertaining their friends," said Dennis Wilson, an owner of Wilson & Kreulen, a firm that specializes in flowers, lighting and decor.
Most party consultants began as cooks, caterers, wedding planners, decorators or disc jockeys. During the last decade, many restaurants have got involved, not only with catering, but also with planning entire events at the homes of favorite customers. Florent Morellet, who owns the popular bistro Florent in Lower Manhattan, began planning Christmas parties a few years back for customers in the surrounding meat market district. Now he designs full-scale Victorian Christmas celebrations, replete with roast fowl, glowing candles and evergreen garlands.
There has been a marked movement toward home entertaining in New York in recent years, party planners say. And since "no one has the time to be perfect," as Mr. Wilson of Wilson & Kreulen put it, "they pay someone to make things perfect for them.
"Maybe in the Midwest or something, there's time to hand-press the napkins and make fancy little boxes to put them in," he added. "But in New York, everyone is too busy to be Martha Stewart. Even Martha Stewart is too busy to be Martha Stewart."
Harriette Rose Katz, the owner of Gourmet Advisory Services, says new kinds of clients have begun to seek her services in recent years. "We still have a lot of Park Avenue people who hire us for their big parties," she said, "but we have also started consulting on many small ones for people of more modest means."
Among her new clients are young professionals who want to have a proper party but never quite learned how. "They hire me to teach them how to entertain," she said. "They want lessons in etiquette, wine, food and timing. And I'm an expert in timing. I love timing."
Another growing group of clients are single young men, successful at business but clueless when it comes to entertaining. "They're not in the frat house anymore, and they know it," said Ms. Boe of Mood Food. "A keg of beer and a bag of chips just won't cut it anymore when you work on Wall Street. But what do they know about crab puffs and pate?"
This being New York, the ability to entertain at home, and to do it well, has become a mark of status. "People want to show off their houses, but they need help learning how to entertain," said John Sullivan, owner of a firm called the Butler Did It, which handles everything from providing waiters for an intimate home-cooked dinner to masterminding a cocktail party for hundreds.
"People get nervous about doing everything correctly, so they call one number and we make it all happen," Mr. Sullivan said. "It's so painless for them, because they don't have to think about all the little details, like putting tissue in the bathroom and buying scented candles and turning the air-conditioning way up."
A good planner will provide one-stop shopping, a tried-and-true list of resources covering everything: caterers, decor, lighting, sound, entertainment, invitations, glasses, ice, menu planning, flowers, photography, coat check, bartenders, waiters, valets and cleanup crews.
"If you try doing all that on your own," Mr. Wilson said, "you're just taking a stab at the Yellow Pages. And, he said, a good consultant will always be on top of the very latest party trends and food fashions, which seem to change almost from lunchtime to dinner. "A few years ago, many people had never tried foie gras or sweetbreads or goat cheese," he said. "Now there's a foie gras shortage. People are always looking for the next big thing."
What might that be? "Turkish food and design," Mr. Wilson said. "That, and Latino music. Everyone wants the Ricky Martin thing now. So suddenly, you're going to be at parties with Turkish food and Latino music. It's never been paired before, and it doesn't make much sense; you know, falafel with salsa music, or maybe falafel with salsa on it. That's the party of the future."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
North Korea Opens a Door, but Not Necessarily Its Mind-Set

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
In the two months since it agreed to freeze its long-range missile tests in exchange for the United States lifting economic sanctions, North Korea has been swamped with inquiries from foreign companies, investors and trade groups seeking to do business there.
With a population of 24 million, a low-cost, well-trained work force and close proximity to two important Asian economies, South Korea and Japan, North Korea has its attractions as a site for foreign investment. 
 Though the inquiries have led to several highly publicized trade missions to North Korea, few, if any, foreign firms are expected to actually set up shop there any time soon, because of one obstacle that has not changed: the hermetic country's Stalinist political climate.
Government officials, consultants and people who have done business with North Korea said that unless the reclusive regime of Kim Jong Il simplifies the investment process and makes its dealings more open and businesslike, substantial new foreign investment and trade are unlikely.
"A lot of investors will come to Pyongyang on a trade mission and take one look at the way North Korea operates, and they will never come back," said Anthony Michell, president of Euro-Asian Business Consultancy Ltd., which advises companies with an eye on northeast Asia.
Mr. Michell said that North Korea might be an attractive place to manufacture goods for export to the United States, now that such trade will be legal, but that foreign companies will have to endure a long, convoluted and frustrating negotiation process to get established.
"The biggest turnoff is dealing with an old-style Communist system in which people don't understand the ways of the world," said Michael Breen, a public relations consultant who has advised companies seeking a foothold in North Korea.
"It's a very bureaucratic place, and party politics rule," Mr. Breen said. "It's easy to be misunderstood, and most people who are friendly and supportive of the regime eventually run afoul and get thrown out."
He recalled the case of a Belgian entrepreneur who set up a diamond-cutting business in North Korea that employed several hundred people. The business thrived for a while, and the government often showed off the factory to foreign trade delegations. Then the entrepreneur was forced to leave the country without explanation. "North Korea doesn't see you as an individual, but as part of the agenda of your country," Mr. Breen said. "Something happens at a high level with your country's government that they don't like, and the North Koreans take it out on you."
Still, investors remain interested. A few pioneers, mainly South Korean conglomerates like Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo, have already made major investments in tourism and manufacturing in North Korea. And the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul plans to take a delegation of 10 United States business executives -- chosen from more than 90 applicants -- on a trade mission to North Korea as early as next month.
OBVIOUSLY, nobody who does business in North Korea is going to make a lot of money right out of the starting blocks," said Jeff Jones, president of the chamber. "It's a beginning, and everybody knows that it will be slow and difficult. But over time we believe that North Korea will learn how to deal with U.S. businesses."
Members of the delegation will be seeking assurances from North Korea on remittances, ownership rights and security issues, the chamber said, and will want to see if distribution and transportation facilities, regulatory systems and labor will be adequate.
Mr. Jones said the initial business activities in North Korea are likely to be in areas like infrastructure development, finance, agriculture and telecommunications. For example, Motorola, the mobile telephone company, will join the delegation. Much of North Korea has not been wired for basic telephone service, and it may be faster and more economical for the country to install a national cellular system instead.
The Clinton administration agreed to relax sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act, dating from the Korean War in the 1950's, after North Korea pledged to stop development of a long-range missile that threatened to upset the balance of power in Asia. The country's erratic behavior has long scared off investors; in the last year it has provoked a naval skirmish with the south over fishing rights and held a tourist captive on charges of being rude.
"What's most important to attract investors is the improvement of North-South relations and a reduction of military tensions between the two," said Myoung Gyon Chu, an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry.
If large-scale foreign investment comes to North Korea, most analysts expect it to be on the coattails of the South Korean companies already making headway there. The biggest investor by far is Hyundai Group. A year ago, in the biggest inter-Korean joint venture since the country was partitioned in 1945, Hyundai began running sightseeing cruise tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on North Korea's east coast.
Since 1996, the Daewoo Group has operated a 1,300-employee joint venture in the north to manufacture shirts, jackets and bags for sale in Europe, Latin America and Japan, including items under the Pierre Cardin label. It exports about $25 million of apparel a year.
Ki Hwan Moon, general manager of Daewoo, said it took $5 million and four years of negotiations with North Korea to get the company up and running. "We decided to do it because there was a new market opportunity, the production costs were lower and the workers speak the same language," he said. "Part of the investment is to promote good will and improve relations between the two countries."
BUT even major South Korean companies like Hyundai, which has long been a champion of investing in North Korea, sometimes find it difficult to deal with Pyongyang. Hyundai reached an agreement on Oct. 1 to build a new industrial complex to make a variety of consumer products, but a follow-up delegation twice had to postpone a visit to the country because of a difference over where to build it: the company favors Haeju, a western port city less than 100 miles from Seoul, while the government prefers Sinuiju, far to the north near the Chinese border. The delegation finally began its trip last Monday.
Other companies are closely watching Hyundai's experience in North Korea. Ghil Joon Choi, director of North Korean business projects for Samsung Group, said that he expects similar delays in obtaining approval to build a large consumer electronics factory and set up a fish-importing business there. "There has been no real progress since our last trip to North Korea," around the time of the June naval skirmish, he said.
Asked why foreign companies should consider North Korea worth the frustrations and risks, Mr. Jones, the chamber president, argued that economic integration would help stabilize the country, whose 24 million people will one day offer a lucrative market opportunity, just as South Korea did a generation ago.
"If it doesn't work out, then I guess we will lose a few bucks, but given how hard-working and bright the Koreans are, I suppose it will work," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Steven E. Folker;
Fifth Third Quality Growth Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
EVERY summer, Steven E. Folker treks up to his cabin in the northern Wisconsin woods near Chequamegon Bay to cast his line for smallmouth bass and lake trout. The rest of the year, he seeks bigger fish -- large-capitalization, high-quality growth companies that will end up in the portfolio of the fund he manages, Fifth Third Quality Growth.
"We want companies that historically have been able to consistently grow their earnings at above-average rates," Mr. Folker said from his office at the headquarters of Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati, overlooking the coal and oil barges that dot the Ohio River. "More important, we want companies with strong earnings growth in the next three to five years." 
 He has reeled in some winners. The fund, with $774.8 million in assets, returned 26.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Nov. 12, compared with 21.1 percent for its peer group of large blend funds and 26.1 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
Mr. Folker, 44, looks for leading American companies in growth industries -- generally companies with market capitalizations of more than $10 billion, although he does hold a few midcap companies with market caps of between $5 billion and $10 billion. His goal is annual earnings growth of more than 15 percent.
He also keeps a sharp eye on price. Typically, he aims to pay a price-to-earnings multiple that is less than twice the company's comparable growth rate: for example, a P/E of 35, or so, for a company whose earnings are growing 25 percent a year. But he is willing to pay a bit more for faster growers. "If a company's fundamentals and growth prospects are really strong," he said, "we'll be a little flexible on its valuation."
Mr. Folker said he and the seven analysts working on the fund spend most of their energy on bottom-up, fundamental research. "Mostly, we tear companies apart fundamentally to see whether they have the growth prospects that we're looking for."
To choose the roughly 50 stocks in the fund, he looks for solid balance sheets. And he likes to see plenty of cash being produced -- "enough to generate free cash flow," he said, "or to generate enough cash to fund the company's future growth without diluting earnings."
He also wants relatively modest amounts of debt, generally a ratio of debt to total capitalization of no more than 25 percent.
Mr. Folker likes a high return on equity, too, typically seeking 18 percent or more. "We like to see high and stable profit margins," he added, "ideally improving margins."
Mr. Folker and the analysts devote much time to visiting companies and talking to management. "We want to confirm the growth prospects and understand the company's long-term strategy for achieving above-average growth," he said. When management is focused on increasing shareholder value, he is doubly pleased, especially if the executives' compensation is linked to performance.
He steers clear of companies whose earnings growth is dependent upon the vagaries of the world's economy. So he is unlikely to hold steel, automobile or commodity chemical companies.
MR. FOLKER recently added to his position in Schering-Plough, the pharmaceutical giant that produces Claritin, the allergy medication, and Intron A, used for cancer and hepatitis patients. The company has no debt and generates enough cash flow to finance significant amounts of research and development, Mr. Folker added. Its return on equity is 51 percent. Moreover, "we think there will be ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry," he said, "and this company is a leading acquisition target."
The fund originally bought Schering-Plough shares in 1996, at an average cost of $25. Mr. Folker forecasts 16 percent annual earnings growth for the company over the next three to five years. The stock now trades at $55.4375, or 39.6 times his 1999 earnings forecast of $1.40 a share.
Mr. Folker also likes Marsh & McClellan, the insurance broker that owns Putnam Investments, a money manager, and the Mercer Consulting Group. He expects earnings at Putnam to grow 15 to 20 percent a year because of its "strong reputation and heavy equity orientation." Mercer should grow even faster, he said -- about 20 to 25 percent a year, "because it's well positioned in attractive growth markets, particularly the pension and retirement area, health care and compensation."
Marsh & McClellan's ratio of debt to total capital is 39 percent, he added, very solid for its industry. Its return on equity is 23 percent, and net profit margins -- more than 10 percent over the past three to five years -- should expand as its high-margin money management and consulting businesses grow.
The fund started buying shares in April 1998 at an average cost of $59. On Friday, the stock closed at $79, or 22.6 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $3.50 a share.
He added to his position in another favorite, Texas Instruments, in September. "The company is the world leader in digital signal processors, which is the core product in the telecommunications industry," he said.
Texas Instruments' shift away from commodity products like dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAM's, to proprietary, value-added products, like D.S.P.'s, will ratchet up its growth to about 25 percent a year from just 3 percent over the past five years, Mr. Folker said. Its ratio of debt to total capital is just 12 percent, he said, and its return on equity is 19 percent.
He first bought shares in November 1998, at $32. The stock closed on Friday at $98.375, or 57.9 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $1.70 a share.

HEADLINE: C.E.O ROUND TABLE;
Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
SPEED. Sleep. Greed. Recruiting. Role models like Thomas Edison and Ayn Rand. Losing money, yet turning away capital. New-found wealth and an ensuing change in lifestyle -- or not.
Those were some of the topics on the table when four chief executives from dot.com companies -- Candice Carpenter of iVillage, a women's Web site; Fernando J. Espuelas of StarMedia Network, a Spanish- and Portuguese-language service; Kevin O'Connor of DoubleClick, an on-line advertising network, and Stephan J. Paternot of Theglobe.com, a shopping, news and business information site -- gathered late one afternoon early this month at The New York Times for a wide-ranging discussion about managing in the Internet age. 
 These pioneers from Silicon Alley, an area in the Flatiron district of Manhattan that is populated by many fledgling Internet companies, were joined in the two-hour discussion by Saul Hansell, Patrick J. Lyons and Judith H. Dobrzynski of The Times.
As founders of young companies, each executive had experienced the adrenaline highs and the growing pains that accompany the transformation of an idea into a business and then into a publicly traded company. They don't worry about nonexistent earnings in a topsy-turvy environment where not producing a profit is, for the moment, a virtue. For them, the bigger pressure is to build organizations -- fast -- before opportunities slip away.
Following are excerpts from the conversation. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

Q. What's the difference between running the kind of company you run and running a big company?
 
CARPENTER Speed. Leading in conditions in which speed is a very big factor. It puts a lot of additional pressure on all the systems. And you have a lot of very young people, and you're teaching them to be managers at a very accelerated pace without a lot of formal programs.
 
PATERNOT Tying into that is just the idea of keeping your entrepreneurial spirit. Things are shifting fast enough that you need to be able to jump into any new idea, shift your company into it and move at light speed.
 
ESPUELAS I would say the absence of a road map. Not that any business is particularly easy, but when there's nothing that you can follow except your instincts and the little bit of data you're able to gather in this context of a lot of speed, I think there's a lot of intuition that goes into these kinds of very fast-moving environments.
 
O'CONNOR In large corporations, you need to spend a lot of time quantifying what the market's going to look like and how you're going to go about it and what the expenses are going to be.
And here it's very much speed, it's intuition, it's trying to figure out, "Is this a big market or a small market?" If it's a big market, you go after it. You spend a tremendous amount of money and you go after it quickly.
 
Q. What's the first thing that's sacrificed in the name of speed?
 
O'CONNOR Facts.
 
CARPENTER Sleep. We're trying to really come up with graded solutions to burnout caused by exhaustion. We have people who have been at this for four years in our company and we have to figure out a way to get them to learn how to completely refresh themselves in short increments of time.
I've stood at the elevator with people going on vacation and actually taken the laptop and the cell phone out of their hands and said, "Great, now you can actually have a vacation." The only way to truly regenerate yourself enough to be truly creative and inventive again is to be unwired at times in the year and to be in the other part of the world.
 
Q. Do any of you have programs for dealing with burnout?
 
PATERNOT Sometimes it's frequent rotation of some of your stars. You'll often find that in your company you have a few stars, and if you leave them in the same position too long they'll burn out. And, quite frankly, you don't want to lose them.
 
CARPENTER We're starting a sabbatical program. It's for people who've been there three years who would love to be there 20. We're giving them a month to go and just do whatever they want. Sleep probably will be at the top of most people's list.
 
ESPUELAS Are you going to take it yourself?
 
CARPENTER Yeah, I am. I have to, otherwise no one else will take it.
 
O'CONNOR We have a very strong policy that people can move to wherever they want to move. Any job in the company's open. So we try to force rotation, because doing the same thing, day in and day out, tends to cause burnout.
 
Consciously Reaching Out
 
Q. Tell us a little bit more about how you're managing growth so far.
 
ESPUELAS I travel all the time. And I try to talk to as many people as possible. We do monthly all-hands meetings and we actually Web-cast them simultaneously and have people call in and try to have an ongoing dialogue. And now we're doing things which I never thought we'd ever do. We're going to create an employee newsletter. We're doing a lot of things that I used to scoff at when I worked at other companies.
What I've also found is that things I said two years ago are now on a plaque, and that people are still acting the same way: "But Fernando said that." Yeah, but that was two years ago.
 
Q. Is communication a common problem?
 
PATERNOT Absolutely. We've seen ourselves have to increase the rate of communication dramatically. When we started four or five years ago, it was a group of 20 to 25 people. My partner Todd Krizelman, co-chief executive and I could just make decisions very quickly, hoping everybody can keep up. But eventually it starts to hurt you more when you get to 200, and people in departments don't understand what's going on. And we've had to deal with a lot of organizational changes over the last year, but everybody understands why we're doing stuff.
 
O'CONNOR We start off with a week of training. It's a week of indoctrination for every employee -- whether you answer the telephone in the German office or you're a vice president, it doesn't matter. You sit, you learn what we do, why we do it, what's the core culture of the company, so everybody's got a good, firm foundation.
 
Q. How do managers who have worked at large companies fare in your kinds of companies?
 
O'CONNOR On average, they've fared pretty well. You've got to pre-screen them very carefully. You tend to get people who expect to have two assistants. But our first test is, we make them take a pay cut. If they won't take a massive pay cut, you've pretty much got them pegged.
 
Q. Do they have options, though, on the other end?
 
O'CONNOR Absolutely.
 
CARPENTER The structure that I've seen be the most successful is a solid infrastructure of senior managers from big companies, very seasoned, very good at creating structure. That gives you room to promote people with less management experience, and have someone to go to when wisdom and time around the track is the issue.
 
Mountains of Resumes
 
Q. How hard is it to find employees? Are strangers handing you resumes as soon as they find out who you are?
 
O'CONNOR I probably get 10 resumes myself a day. We probably get, as a company, 100 resumes a day. There's a lot of talent that wants to get in, that absolutely wants to get into the dot-com company. To get great, smart people is always tough. But it's relatively easy for a dot-com company.
 
ESPUELAS We have two realities. One is in the U.S., which mirrors that. But in Latin America, it's totally different: There's no such thing as us. There's a lot of big companies that are owned by families, so the best you can hope for is to work for so and so, as opposed to being one of the owners of the company. So in Latin America we're able to really tap into really great people who don't have an equivalent to go to.
 
PATERNOT Even though we get a hundred resumes a day, we're at a point where we're trying to find the perfect person to fit this type of software development. It's easier for us to find people in marketing and sales, because New York has a lot more of these people and they're easy to train.
But finding the right technical person, whether it's for infrastructure or for software, we still find it tough. These people can command huge salaries from the banks. And finding a seasoned database manager, for instance, can mean that you have to pay huge cash, because some of these people want the options and they want the cash, and they're not going to leave their cushy job at Goldman Sachs unless you throw it all at them. The fact is, if you're a well-known dot-com company, it helps immensely over the unknown dot-com companies and over a lot of the other companies.
 
How to Set Priorities
 
Q. Do you find that your thinking about the way you run your company changes over time?
 
ESPUELAS For the last two years, I've been thinking about, well, what happens in 10 years and what happens in 20 years? Which is kind of a ridiculous thing to think about on the Internet.
 
O'CONNOR Most start-ups go through the struggle of going from an entrepreneurial environment to professionalization. Making that transition from a total entrepreneurial world with no rules to where you've got to have systems; you've got to have order.
 
PATERNOT You have to learn to delegate. Todd and I were completely attached to the product, had to test everything ourselves. We were the chief Q. A. quality assurance guys. Eventually, you have to stop that. As much as I still use the product now, when I have to use it, I want to be able to rely on 50 people who think about this more than I do and who know it better than I do.
 
O'CONNOR On the flip side, I still spend half my time with new products -- because that is the entrepreneurial side and new products are the key to rejuvenating the company, growing the company. We set out to create a big company.
 
Q. Did you, from the beginning, do something differently than other start-ups might have done, because you were planning for growth?
 
O'CONNOR Definitely. I was fortunate because I started my first company right out of college. So I went through the "how you could have done things differently and better." We tried to avoid all the mistakes. I was building the human infrastructure, getting the people who could build their own business and leverage. When I look at DoubleClick, we're actually a collection of about 50 companies: People who were running their own thing, whether it's their own country, and there were 22 countries, or we have a bunch of business units with people running their own businesses. The thing we most tend to look for in people is intelligence and -- I call it -- athleticism: people who love to compete, don't like to lose.
 
ESPUELAS I don't think anybody stumbles onto a big company. You have to visualize where you're going. You don't know the path necessarily, but there's a goal. There's something I always think about and try to get people to think about. I'm not a martial-arts guy, but when you break a board with your hand, what they teach you is that if you were able to project the energy, not on the surface of the board, but behind the board, you will break it. And you can break three boards, then four boards. But if you aim it for the surface, you will break your hand. And that's a little bit of what you dream about. You have to make choices accordingly.
When we were looking for venture funding, and we were out of our money and we got offered by not-so-great V.C.'s venture capital firms who wanted not-so-great terms, we knew we'd never go there. So we held out. And we got good funding.
 
CARPENTER I can think of a number of examples where we turned down advertisers, we turned down money, because to do otherwise would create a precedent which would limit us later. And as a very tiny company, it's very scary to do or have to do it. And once you do it, it inspires everybody.
 
Of Churchill, and Branson
 
Q. Other chief executives want to be Jack Welch of General Electric. Is there any model you think about?
 
ESPUELAS I spent a lot of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor -- not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement -- to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy.
 
CARPENTER I admire two people. Steve Ross, who turned a funeral parlor into one of the great media empires in the world Time Warner . He did it by empowering people tremendously. And he was a bit of a cowboy, but that's the only way you get from a funeral parlor to one of the largest media companies in the world. When you were in the room with him, you would want to just get up and run and help him to fulfill this vision.
And then in the dot-com world, I personally admire Tim Koogle chief executive of Yahoo so much. I think Yahoo has an elegance in the way they do things. They never sacrifice. They're the only portal that never charged money for carriage. And they did it because they only want to have the very best content. They want to invite the best people in. Everything they've done has been for long-term greatness.
There's all these fancy dot-com buildings down in Silicon Valley. And you go to Yahoo and it's so very understated. We send our architects out there to visit it because, we said, this is the model. And the employees love it because they really thought about how the employees could have a great day there.
 
PATERNOT Todd and I have the same idol: Richard Branson founder of the Virgin Group -- just his philosophy of wanting to be a successful businessman and having fun while doing it. And he's one of those guys that's really built up one of the best-recognized brands in the world. And after reading his book, "Losing My Virginity," you can see how he's had a lot of similar experiences to what Todd and I had. Seeing how he started from some inexperienced young guy and turned it into some major media empire. And seeing how this man embodies the brand, Virgin, is extremely inspiring.
Todd and I have always had a philosophy since we started, that we're only doing this as long as we have fun. The day that you're just doing it for the money, that's the day we get out.
 
O'CONNOR Mine's more historical. Edison was a horrible C.E.O. but a hell of an innovator. He pretty much innovated the 21st century. And then Ayn Rand.
 
CARPENTER Yeah. Champion of capitalism.
 
O'CONNOR Her philosophy of capitalism and the individual is just how we pretty much run the company.
 I think Koogle is great. I think Steve Case chairman of America Online is amazing. How many times did people write Case off? And he's always come back. Gates Bill Gates of Microsoft is an incredible entrepreneur that everyone really respects -- an entrepreneur who was successful in transitioning from an entrepreneur to building a phenomenal company.
 
Q. Can you imagine out a couple of years? If you have a 10,000-person organization, is it going to be like every other 10,000-person organization?
 
CARPENTER No.
 
O'CONNOR There's nothing wrong with big companies. We all want to become one. And we all want to create a company that stands the test of time. Look at the great companies: General Electric -- what they do is something to be idolized. Disney -- they keep innovating. I.B.M. -- we all want to be like that. But we all want to stay away from the bureaucracy.
 
ESPUELAS I'm sure that some Internet companies will become stodgy old media companies in the next five years. The challenge is: How do you maintain that freshness and how do you organize yourself and how do you develop a culture that it doesn't matter whether you're 500 or 5,000 or 50,000 people? At Microsoft, they have 30,000, 40,000 employees. They move fast. They have that drive. That's cultural.
 
The Price of Profits
 
Q. How long do you think you can exist without producing profit?
 
O'CONNOR It's clear what the market's telling us. They want to give us a lot of money, so we take it and we invest. Why? We look back, and what was the biggest mistake that we made? We should have invested even more money. We should have lost more money. Why? Because this is the biggest thing that's ever hit. Market share is everything.
But it depends on what stage the company is in. People are going to start expecting profits from us in the next one to two years.
 
PATERNOT The reason we all lost money and all went crazy for this is because we realized how big it could be. And it's worth losing the money for the sake of becoming that much bigger down the long road. And I think that investors traditionally, by default, will say "yes, we'd prefer a profitable company," but not if they know it's at the expense of getting that company to be way bigger a little bit further down the road.
 
ESPUELAS Things have changed. In '96 when we started our company, nobody knew if anybody could make a profit on the Net. And now we look and we see that there are certain models, in our case the advertising model, and the e-commerce models, that actually can be profitable.
The biggest risk is that we under-invest, as Kevin said, because this won't come again. And if we don't own that waterfront before everyone else, somebody else will. We don't want to be in a situation next year having to buy someone for a billion bucks that we could have invested $25 million to build or buy them when they're little.
We have invested over the last two years much more in building our brand than the advertising revenue available in the whole of Latin America. Now we're either very stupid or clever and I'd like to think that we're clever, because it means that we are now capturing more than our fair share of that revenue opportunity.

Q. How much longer will it be before people begin to say "wait a minute"?
 
CARPENTER Off the Internet, media companies take five to seven years to become profitable. Everybody knows that in the media business.AOL took eight years, because they were early. Let's say Yahoo took four and a half. So that kind of defines it.
Part of what's interesting is that many of the investors came out of technology. They don't have models of the dynamics of a media company. They're applying a different model and then wondering, "Gee, this doesn't look like anything I've seen," but it's not like the world has never seen it before. You can look at media models and see exactly where we all are on the curve, because it's a business where you do spend a lot up front to build brand, to build advertising-revenue generation capability, and then your revenue starts scaling past it.
 
O'CONNOR It is starting to happen. The scary thing that's happened is what's coming out public today are companies that have no revenue.
 
Q. How do you pay your employees?
 
ESPUELAS We pay good salaries, but fair salaries within the norm for that kind of job in other industries. And then we try to get people to really think about the stock being their major compensation.

Q. Does everybody have stock?
 
ESPUELAS Yeah, after I believe it's six months -- after your first review -- everyone gets stock options.
 
PATERNOT Same policy exactly.
 
Q. At a couple of your companies, the stock price today is a quarter of where it once was. Does that linger as a question in the hallways?
 
PATERNOT You've got to have open communication with your people. You've got to tell them not to look at your day-to-day stock price, but at the same time they deserve to have an explanation and understanding of where things are going in the long run. Give them enough vision so that it's their decision: "Well, I don't care what the stock's at today, I think that we had a great internal story, and a year from now I think things could be way better; I'm going to stick around."
 
CARPENTER At the time of the I.P.O., we pulled out the stock charts of five companies and we said, "Well, here's what you're in for." The pattern was so ridiculously consistent.
 
Risk vs. Executive Reward
 
Q. Many big-company chief executives think you're overpaid. The whole world thinks they're overpaid. Are you overpaid and are they overpaid?
 
O'CONNOR Am I working a million times, or whatever it may be, smarter than someone else? No. Am I overpaid? No. It is what it is.
 
ESPUELAS We win when the stockholder wins and not otherwise, which is a perfect alignment of value.
 
PATERNOT If those traditional media types all want to complain about it, they can always start their own Internet companies and take a chance, and I think they'll realize what the risk-reward ratio is.
 
CARPENTER It is a little bit like the lottery, because the person brought in to run eBay hit the lottery. She, Meg Whitman, is great, but she would be the first to say she got really lucky. The risk of walking away from what's known and guaranteed and starting over in one room that you're sharing with eight people, in retrospect, looks like no big deal. But when you do it, you're taking a big risk. Our culture happens to reward that behavior, which is one reason it's a great country.
My old media colleagues say, you know, "damn, this is really annoying that you guys went and did this," but there's something in you that allows you to go take that risk. It wasn't guaranteed. In the end, it could have been worth absolutely zero.
 
Q. Do you worry that the Internet economy isn't a fair economy, that you have to be lucky to get rich in it?
 
O'CONNOR No, I think the market's very discriminating, and customers are very discriminating.

PATERNOT In many senses, it's this wealth creation -- even though sometimes I don't like the fact that a lot of people are jumping into this industry to make a buck -- that is driving every single business out there to want to give it a chance. No one disputes that the Internet, in some way -- business to business, business to consumer -- is improving the lives of consumers.
 
Wealth, but No Time
 
Q. What do you tell people who want to be entrepreneurs about your lives and the impact that sudden wealth has had on your lifestyle?
 
O'CONNOR I tell everyone just to pursue what you love. If you pursue what you love, you're either going to put in the effort, and you become the best at it, and then you're going to create a successful company, and lots of money, and do well and have fun, or you're going to die poor and happy because you pursued what you love.
 
ESPUELAS I was just meeting with entrepreneurs talking about this in Argentina and saying: Forget the money. You probably won't go public. You probably won't be able to raise money. You're probably going to die as a company, so you have to focus on the fundamentals. What is it that you're going to do that's going to change the world? And if you pick something that changes the world really well and you do it very well, then you'll make money off of that.
 
CARPENTER You have to have leisure time to change your lifestyle, and no one has leisure time yet, so I don't see people rushing out and capitalizing on the money to change the way they live. Everyone's too busy building a franchise right now.
Obviously, this is going to create huge shifts in wealth. And I think it's going to open up charitable giving in a wave that we haven't seen for 50 years that's going to change this country dramatically.
I did go out and buy a few Versace gowns. It was really therapeutic. And I've just bought a little fur jacket, and all of that's really fun, but at the end of the day, that all takes time, and I basically have to go back to work and keep building.
 
Q. Do you have time to follow politics? What do you want from Washington?
 
O'CONNOR I think the Internet is changing the world like no other system -- in such a short period of time -- that it's causing industries to become entrenched in wanting to limit the Internet. People want to stick their hands on the Internet through regulations, so I think we're all finding ourselves spending a lot more time educating governments and senators and Congress people to make sure that they understand.
 
PATERNOT A coalition has been formed -- Netcoalition.com -- that is specifically for the purpose of having someone there, including the C.E.O.'s of those member companies, going to Washington and speaking with senators, just educating them, so that eventually, when they do make a policy decision they haven't made it completely out of thin air.
 
CARPENTER We're involved in politics on the consumer side. We have each of the presidential candidates coming in to do a town meeting in which the questions are not created by the people of iVillage but are filtered up through the membership. It's just having this fabulous rejuvenating impact on democracy that we haven't even seen the beginning of yet.
 
O'CONNOR Platform for libertarianism worldwide, you're going to see it worldwide. That's my theory.
 
To Change the World
 
Q. Is there a difference in culture between now and the 1980's? Are we just a "greed-is-good.com" culture or is anything different motivating people now?
 
ESPUELAS At least in the first couple of waves of the Internet, you'll find a lot of people who think they're actors in a play to change the world, which is very different than money for money's sake.
We're not investing in glamour and luxury; we're investing in our product and our people and basic business stuff. So I think the culture is very different.
 
PATERNOT If you look at the movie "Wall Street" as the quintessential example of that, nothing really new was being created. We're in positions here where I think the reason there is wealth is because we're doing something completely different than playing with money. We are literally shaping, in some way, the way people are going to live and the way businesses are going to run.
 
CARPENTER I was talking to someone about this whole thing, about why this thing grabs hold of you. And then you feel like you don't have it; it has you.
For some reason, some number of people have been tapped on the shoulder, like 'you're going to be part of this thing that is going to be born.' There is nothing that's going to stop this particular transformation.
It is great sometimes. Other times, it's just so consuming that you wish you could just dial down and have 60 percent of the experience. But that's not available. You're either in, tapped, put to work, on the road crew, or probably you're not in. There is no kind of convenient, "this really works for my life." And I think that's probably when any big transformation happens -- it just sort of puts people to work in the service of itself.
 
Q. Kevin is burning to say something.
 
O'CONNOR It's something I probably shouldn't say, because it's contrarian. I think that without question there's a real temptation for some really bad things to happen. And you start to see signals of it.
We had the highest turnover in our Silicon Valley office. I'll talk to an employee who's leaving the company and saying: "Love the company, love the compensation, love DoubleClick, love everything, but I'm going to go and really throw my hat in the ring with a hot new start-up over here. The guy next door made $20 million. I've got to make my $20 million or I'm a failure."
So you start to see greed. Money creates greed, and greed creates corruption. And you're going to see more and more of this. You're going to see bad companies. Wherever there's an incredible, immense amount of money, there's going to be bad people.
 
CARPENTER As long as the pie keeps rapidly expanding, everybody's going to be really good friends and get along really well. When it starts really getting to be a battle for market share, it'll be a different story.
 
No Fun in the Fishbowl
Q. What do you all really hate about being a chief executive?

ESPUELAS Having to be "on" all the time. Everyone you meet sees you through that optic. So much so that now, unless it's a business context, I never say what I do. I always work for "a Latin American company."
 
PATERNOT That's exactly what I do as well. A nameless company.
 The biggest change I saw to the negative is going from a private company to a public one. All of a sudden you have to be that much more careful with the random people that you meet, because sometimes you'll start off in a perfectly casual conversation and before you know it, you realize that person's just wanting to know where your stock's going next week. That can get annoying.
It's constantly feeling like sometimes you're being taken advantage of by people who do know who you are, and you just want to be anonymous. You don't want to necessarily be a public profile 24 hours a day.
 
Q. Is there anything else you dislike?
 
CARPENTER Travel. Today, being a C.E.O. means an enormous amount of travel. Often, you go somewhere and you talk for an hour and it's critical. You have to do it, but you think, "God, this whole thing took me 12 hours and it was an hour of something that actually happened." We can be more and more productive on planes with computers, but travel takes a huge personal toll.
 
ESPUELAS I arrived this morning in Miami at 5 from Buenos Aires, had a press conference at 8:30, gave a speech at 9:30 and got on a plane at 11 to come to New York .
Something I don't think is at all a positive is that the C.E.O. figure has become a bit of a starlet. Literally, there's probably 30 people or more in our company who could have done that speech today, and done it much better than I, since I was half dazed anyway. But people want to meet you, and that makes a difference. Sometimes it is a bit overwhelming.
 
O'CONNOR To me, it's just family. You just don't get to see them. Wife can understand, but two kids, two young kids, they have a tough time.
 
Q. Will you still be the chief executive of DoubleClick when you're 60?
 
O'CONNOR The board willing. Hopefully, I'll drop dead behind my desk of old age and the board doesn't shoot me. So far they like me, though.
 
Q. You envision that kind of career?
 
O'CONNOR Yeah, if the board thinks I'm the best person for the job, then, yeah, I'd love to keep it.
 
Q. How about the rest of the panel?
 
ESPUELAS Sixty's a long way away. I love what I do. I can't imagine doing anything else, but I've also seen people who've been at the same job for 20 years, and it's not pretty. I'd like to also think that I'm imminently replaceable, that within the 700 people we have in our team are at least 100 that could have my job.
I like to think that anybody can replace me and that that should be everyone's desire at our company, that they should want my job and that they should work for it and get it.

Stock Option Bonanzas Vs. Stagnant Paychecks

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THIS is a story in search of an ending. The unemployment rate has fallen as steadily as a barometer announcing a storm. Employers struggle to find workers. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates in anticipation of inflationary pressures from higher labor costs. But those costs don't show up in the standard statistics. Yet they must be out there, so the search is on.
The Fed itself is a prominent sleuth, and its latest lead is stock options. This popular form of pay for the higher end of the work force is not recorded in the government's tallies of an employer's labor costs, now dominated by wages and benefits. If they were added, then, voila, labor costs would suddenly accelerate, and the story would have a familiar ending: tight labor markets do indeed force up corporate labor costs, and then inflation. 
 "Our calculations suggest that in recent years, stock options have been a not-insignificant part of actual overall compensation growth," four economists at the Federal Reserve concluded in a recent study.
Maybe. The Labor Department is skeptical of the Fed's study, which is based on an analysis of the practices of 125 companies, plus some heroic projections about the rest of America's public companies. Still, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics is sleuthing in the same direction, preparing a survey "to find out if options are as prevalent as some people say they are," said John Ruser, a bureau economist.
All this focus on options as the proper ending reflects a reluctance to embrace an alternative story line: that labor costs are not really rising. Even in these flush times, most workers are accepting modest raises because they are beaten down by global competition, job insecurity, temps, weak unions and corporate migration to lower-wage regions. If this alternative story line is true, and a rising economy will not lift pay by enough for enough workers, the only hope for jacking up incomes may be government intervention, an idea out of favor among both Democrats and Republicans.
The market alone must set labor compensation, most politicians and mainstream economists insist; even the minimum wage should not be restored by Congress to its old buying power. And if the market raises income through stock options, so be it.
But America changes. Workers earning less than $10 an hour make up almost two-fifths of the work force, and they rarely get stock options. More than in the past, they are left out of a rising economy, a blow to equality. Only 6.7 percent of the lower-occupation workers in the Fed study got stock options, compared with 32.8 percent at the upper end.
These lucky ones present a different problem. Their options make them rich, or they feel rich, but only as long as stock prices stay up. When a falling market shrinks their wealth, they pull back on spending faster than they might have if their pay had been in cash, and they had saved some of the cash. Their quick retreat multiplies the blow to the economy from falling stock prices. They also rush to exercise options and sell stock, exacerbating the market decline.
The government has two measures of labor costs. The most popular, the Employment Cost Index, calculates what companies pay out in wages, salaries and benefits. It does not capture stock options or tips or bonuses paid to recruit people or keep them -- all growing categories. The second measure, much broader but rarely publicized, is compensation per hour, which includes the tips and bonuses, and even stock options when they are exercised -- but not the value of unexercised option grants.
Rough estimates put the value of those option grants at $60 billion to more than $100 billion last year. Options, therefore, "ought to be considered as compensation on issue date," the Fed study said.
If they were, then the rise in the Employment Cost Index -- currently recorded as 3.1 to 3.5 percent a year since 1996 -- may turn out to have been understated by three-tenths of a percentage point each year, according to the study. "There is an understatement," said Ken Matheny, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, "but given the sketchy data available, it is hard to know how much cost is really involved."
SAY a company with a $10 stock grants options to employees, giving them the right over several years to buy the stock from the company at that price. If the market price rises to $15, an employee can exercise the options and sell the newly purchased stock at a $5-a-share profit. Whether the company satisfies the options by issuing new shares or by buying existing ones in the market at $15 apiece, a cost is incurred.
It won't show up as a cost on the books, because American accounting practices grant special treatment for stock options. And perhaps the cost is not so much: perhaps the company bought some shares for $10 when the options were granted and set them aside against the day they would be exercised. Or maybe the options will expire unexercised because the stock price has dropped below $10 in a falling market, and won't wind up costing the company a thing.
Options, in sum, are not the inexorable labor cost that a weekly payroll represents. So the search must continue for a better ending. Perhaps a boom economy just doesn't lift enough boats any more, and that is the simple and unfortunate reason that labor costs are not rising all that much.

MoreFired Workers Are Suing for Stock Options

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
WHEN Charles E. Knox was terminated from his job in middle management at Microsoft in 1995, he sued the company, accusing it of breaching his employment contract. He asked for not only the usual lost salary, but also the worth of his options. A court awarded him $650,000 but denied him the value of any options.
But last year, a Washington state appeals court agreed with Mr. Knox's larger claim, ruling that he was entitled to more than just the salary he had left behind. It said Mr. Knox, who had spent more than 10 years at Microsoft, could also claim the value of the stock options he lost when he left. His lawyers contend that those options are worth tens of millions of dollars, an estimate Microsoft disputes. 
 Mr. Knox is not alone among fired American workers. Employment lawyers say a growing number of workers who feel that they have been discriminated against or wrongfully fired are seeking redress not just for lost wages but also for the value of lost stock options. The stakes in employment-related lawsuits are rising rapidly.
These claims pose a particular risk for technology companies. Many of them grant their employees stock options in lieu of large paychecks and have seen the value of their shares soar.
"There's no doubt that the value of options in such cases is rising," said Frank D. Tinari, an economics professor at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. Professor Tinari is often called into employment cases to put a price tag on damages. He estimates that about one-tenth of the 120 employment lawsuits where he has provided analysis in the last two and a half years have involved claims for stock options.
Options typically grant the right to buy stock at a fixed price for a fixed period of time, no matter how high (or low) the shares go. A portion of them usually vest, or become effective, in each of several years after they are granted.
Mr. Knox said he was forced to exercise options, then had to sell 25,000 of those shares to pay his exercise costs and related expenses. He said he also had to give up 17,000 options that had not yet vested. Had he been able to keep all of his options, he said, he would now have 360,000, thanks to subsequent stock splits.
Jerry R. McNaul, a Seattle lawyer who is representing Mr. Knox, said an economist recently valued the lost options at $25 million to $70 million, with the larger number reflecting their possible value if they were held until their latest expiration date, 2003.
"Stock options were a major incentive for coming to Microsoft," Mr. Knox said. "They far outshadowed salary and other benefits."
The Microsoft case is scheduled for a hearing in January. In court papers, Microsoft said Mr. Knox was working under a contract that permitted his dismissal at any time. A Microsoft spokesman said the company also contests Mr. Knox's valuation of his options. "There is a universally recognized method for valuing stock options, and based on that, we think that the value of his options is significantly less than what he is claiming," said the spokesman, Dan Leach.
Mr. McNaul has represented about a dozen former Microsoft employees who have tried to recover the value of lost options. Most of those cases, he said, were settled out of court, with provisions requiring that the outcomes be kept confidential. But, he said, in each case, "the principal damage claim was the loss of stock options."
Such a claim was also made by Nina Bronk Kellner, a former manager involved in business development and strategy at America Online. Last December, Ms. Bronk Kellner filed a claim with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing AOL of wrongful termination and discriminating against her both because of her pregnancy and her gender. Ms. Bronk Kellner joined AOL in 1995, when, she said, the company was an underdog in the race to attract online subscribers. She said she had enough faith in the company's prospects to accept a salary that was low by industry standards, but which was accompanied by an attractive options package.
Ms. Bronk Kellner said that she was forced to exercise her options when she lost her job in June 1998 and that she also had to give up options that had not vested.
She said that since she lost her job, AOL's stock price has quintupled. Debra S. Katz, a Washington lawyer representing Ms. Bronk Kellner, says her client's lost options are now worth $34 million.
As Ms. Bronk Kellner put it, "I took a huge bet with this company, whose stock could just as easily have gone down. I feel like I lost a lot of money."
Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for America Online, said the company had no comment on the claim's specifics. But, he added, "We are confident that we are fully justified in our employment decisions."
Lawyers say companies and employees often appear willing to settle out of court rather than to try a case in a developing area of law -- and the courts are still trying to decide how to compensate employees for lost options. "These are clearly high-risk cases," said Lewis M. Steel, a Manhattan employment discrimination lawyer.
Walter Lucas, a lawyer specializing in wrongful-discharge law in West Orange, N.J., said that while companies are generally willing to grant former employees roughly three-quarters of the value of options that might have vested during the year they were fired, they rarely offer compensation for options that would vest later. The law is unclear on whether employees can recover options that have yet to vest, he said.
It is not even clear how these options should be valued. The formula commonly used by investors and compensation experts is more reliable for companies whose shares have long histories than for companies that have only recently gone public.
"I think these types of cases are going to create a cottage industry of experts for projecting what these options will be worth," Ms. Katz said.
Still, the employment lawyers said the courts have generally supported the right of wrongfully fired employees to recover the value of lost, vested stock options. Ms. Katz said the courts have also decided that, because options represent pay already received, claims for them should not be subject to the limits that the federal Civil Rights Act puts on compensatory damages in employment discrimination suits. These limits range from $50,000 to $300,000, depending on the size of the company.
Last month, employees seeking to recover the value of options scored a victory when a New Jersey state superior court decided to compensate a fired employee even for options he would have received in future years. The court, in Morristown, awarded Alfred Jablonski, a former lawyer for American Home Products, about $1.6 million both for lost earnings and stock options. Mr. Jablonski contended that he had been wrongfully dismissed when he turned 65.
 PROFESSOR TINARI was called into the American Home Products case by Mr. Jablonski's lawyers to determine how much he was entitled to collect. He calculated that Mr. Jablonski deserved not just $765,000 in lost salary and bonuses, but also more than $1 million in lost options, including options he would have received had he worked until he was 70.
The New Jersey court did not say how much of the award was for Mr. Jablonski's options only. Lowell Weiner, a spokesman for the company, refused to comment on the specifics of Mr. Jablonski's options. But he said that the company believes that the discrimination claim is without merit and that it is appealing the decision.

Why the Market Is Neutral On Research Spending

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT 

 BODY:
STUDENTS of the stock market have long worried that it does a poor job of valuing the long-term benefits of corporate research and development.
All things being equal, a company that invests heavily in R. & D. should be more profitable over the long run than one that doesn't. Yet such companies are sometimes shunned by short-term traders seeking a quick buck; they buy companies that reduce their R. & D. budgets in favor of reporting higher earnings immediately. 
 While undervaluing research is worrisome at any time, it is particularly serious in today's technology-driven economy. In the computer software sector, for example, the average R. & D. outlay amounts to 17 percent of a company's total sales and two times its earnings. A failure to value R. & D. correctly can lead to a major mispricing of a company's stock.
But perhaps that isn't happening. According to a new study by Louis K. C. Chan, Josef Lakonishok and Theodore Sougiannis, professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, there seems to be no evidence that the market penalizes companies that invest in R. & D.
For each year from 1975 to 1995, the researchers divided stocks into two groups. The first group consisted of companies that reported R. & D. expenditures that year; the second was composed of those companies that did not. The professors then tracked the subsequent three-year performance of each group.
Through mid-1998, on average, the three-year annualized return of the companies spending money on R. & D. was 19.65 percent, statistically indistinguishable from the 19.50 percent return for the others.
So the professors think that investors, over all, neither overvalue nor undervalue research spending. Of course, some investors may be shunning companies that invest in research because of the stocks' higher price-to-earnings ratios. But the effect is evidently balanced by other investors who look below the surface and see the potential value of companies' research.
Although the professors give the stock market a passing grade on this subject, they found one subset of companies whose R. & D. expenditures seemed to be systematically undervalued: those companies that trade at low price-to-book multiples -- and are therefore often considered value stocks.
In this subset, the professors found that companies that invested heavily in R. & D. outperformed those that didn't by nearly 8 percentage points, annualized, through mid-1998. That is an impressive amount, given that value stocks in general have historically outperformed the market anyway.
EVIDENTLY, the stock market fails to recognize that when the management of such companies spends big amounts on research, it is a bullish signal. After all, such managers are often under intense pressure to reduce their spending on research, thus increasing short-term earnings and helping to raise the stock price. To invest in R. & D. under those conditions speaks of extreme confidence on management's part.
The professors have a hypothesis about why the market does such a poor job valuing such stocks: "R. & D.-intensive firms who are past losers become 'orphaned' stocks with no natural underlying investor clientele," the study said.
Growth investors, for example, tend to shun such market laggards. And because those stocks still look expensive according to the conventional valuation criteria, value-oriented investors aren't likely to buy them, either.
Such stocks fall through the cracks -- the ideal condition for market mispricing.
In short, R. & D. spending alone doesn't tell investors much about a stock's prospects. But examining that spending in conjunction with a stock's price-to-book multiple can yield a powerful indicator of future performance.

HEADLINE: The World;
One Giant Step For Mr. Jiang's China

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
ONLY a few weeks ago, after the uninspired 50th anniversary extravaganza for the People's Republic that equated President Jiang Zemin with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Jiang became a victim of Beijing's merciless joke circuit. In stories told in quiet tea houses and at raucous dinner parties -- the nearest thing here to Jay Leno's monologues as an index of political fortunes -- Mr. Jiang was portrayed as lacking the vision and stature that this foundering country needs.
One of the most repeated jokes imagined the president's thoughts during the anniversary parade. He looks to the north, the story goes, and sees millions of unemployed workers. He looks to the south and sees millions of prostitutes. He looks to the east and sees the vast smuggling of goods and he looks to the west and sees ethnic rebellions. He looks to the sky and sees NATO bombs falling, then he looks down and finds himself surrounded by Falun Gong demonstrators intent on continuing their spiritual movement. 
 Mr. Jiang walks to the Mao mausoleum to ask the Great Helmsman's advice. After hearing all the woes, Mao rises up from his crypt and says, "You'd better lie down here, I'll take charge."
They weren't telling that one any more last week, after Mr. Jiang and his fellow party chiefs signed a trade deal with America that seemed breathtaking in its implications and anything but lacking in vision. After months of speculation that conservative, protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand, China made sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and foreign investment and to accept international rules governing these activities.
Some Chinese experts even compared the agreement, which Americans demanded in return for supporting the country's entry into the World Trade Organization, to Deng Xiaoping's momentous "opening and reform" of the late 1970's, when he cast aside Mao's screwball economics and introduced market incentives.
China's signature Monday showed that Mr. Jiang, and most if not all of the other six Communist Party leaders who make major decisions here, are convinced that radical change is the only hope if China is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these seven men, who serve on the all-powerful politburo standing committee, are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly on power.
"It's a sort of pact with the devil," said Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University. "You compromise on some aspects of social and economic control, and hope you can keep political control."
Some of the risks are obvious. Wringing out the state sector and creating competitive companies, as China hopes to do as a member of the World Trade Organization, should eventually bring about a richer, more efficient country. But the lower agricultural tariffs China agreed to last week will mean a "blood bath" for farmers, as a Western economist said here, forcing more migrants into cities where they will compete with laid-off factory workers for jobs. In urban areas, freer trade and investment will cause temporary dislocations as leaner, technologically advanced foreign companies wipe out bloated domestic ones.
EVEN without foreign competition, angry workers and farmers have protested often enough to put the Government on edge. Leaders and citizens alike know that, at this point in Communist rule, political obedience depends on the party's ability to deliver greater wealth.
For the party, there is also a deeper long-term risk. From President Clinton to eternally hopeful liberals inside China, some openly voiced the thesis last week that an influx of foreign companies, and the enforced discipline of global trade rules, will promote the rule of law and prod along political change.
Many experts think, too, that a growing middle class that owns homes and businesses and pays taxes will demand a greater voice in government, and form interest groups outside party control. In the last two decades, the Mao era's grip over personal decisions like how and where to live and work has greatly weakened.
Fair and predictable enforcement of rules, in business and throughout society, will certainly improve daily life and aid China's development. But this is already a prime goal of the Communist Party leaders, who know that widespread corruption and arbitrary decisions are corroding the last remnants of popular faith. In the battle against corrupt provincial and local officials and in their efforts to build a trimmer, better-educated bureaucracy, the leaders hope to gain efficiency and also bolster the party's rule.
"The Chinese leaders clearly don't embrace the theory that political change is inevitable," said Mr. Nathan. "They intend to keep a monopoly on political power while still opening the economy. They no longer insist on compete control over everything because they realize they don't need it."
The global corporations speak in evangelical terms about their ultimate impact on society, but they are in China for one reason -- to make money. Their greatest need is clear rules, predictability and social stability. It may well be, as American diplomats argue, that, as society becomes more sophisticated and diverse, a political opening will be vital to preserving stability. But it may also be that political change, when it happens, will not come smoothly or peacefully.
In the meantime, the rest of the world might do well to assume that Mr. Jiang and his comrades know more about how to survive as Communist Party leaders.
When all is said and done, common sense suggests that the expanding flow of information -- now aided by the Internet, a true devil with which the Communists feel they must consort -- will create deep and unsettling consequences. Monday's pact should accelerate this subversive exchange of facts and ideas.
But despite the mythical patience of the Chinese, politicians here have to worry a lot more about tomorrow than about the next year, or the next decade. With his bold promise last week to embrace the modern world, Mr. Jiang has given the Chinese people hopes and dreams that may sustain them for a while. If all the contradictions come crashing together one day, well, he is gambling that may be on someone else's watch.

The End Is Nigh: Better Get Some Videos

BYLINE: By DAVID WALLIS 

 BODY:
BEFORE scurrying to their fortified bunkers and underground bomb shelters, America's millennial-minded survivalists have so much to do. Is there still time to top off the water tanks? Stockpile antibiotics? Clean the rifles? Replenish the pantry with plenty of Tang and rations?
For big-time Y2K worriers, there's help, of course: self-reliance publications dedicated to smoothing the way to apocalypse now. 
 Among the leading camouflage-and-khaki Martha Stewarts are the editors and writers of periodicals like American Survival Guide (which boasts an unaudited readership of 60,000) and Backwoods Home Magazine ("practical ideas for self-reliant living"). Both offer tips on what to do when the ball drops and all hell breaks loose -- not to mention a chance to win a one-year supply of dehydrated foodstuffs! Here is a sampling from the genre.
 DAVID WALLIS
 An ad in American Survival Guide peddling hand-cranked flour mills and freeze-dried vittles sets the general tone:
 At the stroke of midnight on 12/ 31/99, millions of computers, including those that run the global economy of money, food and energy, are in danger of crashing! Everything, including the infrastructure for power and food supplies, may very well grind to a halt. You need to be prepared with enough food and supplies for as much as a year! . . . Remember, we ship in 72 hours!! Don't wait! Every day means lost time!
 Under the headline "Millennium Hoarding Creates Scarcity," Alger International offers a $20 gold coin for $ 599:
Many people fear the impending collapse of worldwide markets in the new millennium. Fortunately, this massive gold coin is respected around the world and experts think it will hold its value regardless of international currency crashes. . . . This price is valid for phone orders only within the next 48 hours. This could be your last chance!
 In Delta Force, a sort of L.L. Bean catalog for the militia set, an ad for a video, "Surviving the Year 2000," gets creative with New York history:
In July of 1997 New York City went dark. The blackout lasted from 5 to 25 hours. During that time, over 2,000 stores were looted and hundreds more burned to the ground. At least 3,700 people were arrested. Now, imagine if the blackout lasted 5 to 25 days, even weeks. It is not a pleasant thought.
But just suppose the city does descend into complete and utter mayhem. You'll need "Urban Combat," the video:
Jungles of glass and steel, cities are the most dangerous of all terrains to fight a war -- and the most likely. Here's the info that prepares police, military units and civilians to meet -- and beat -- the threat of urban combat. The book is loaded with illustrations showing the best tactical moves, accompanied by clear, concise directions. Topics include offensive operations, combat support, how to clear buildings, demolitions and much, much more.
As you plan your escape to rural safety, you'll want to look like you're going to the Hamptons rather than going postal, says an article in the "Special Doom and Gloom Issue" of Backwoods Home:
This retreat can be called a summer home, vacation home, hunting cabin or whatever. Calling it a survival retreat immediately brands you as a nut-case radical. Just quietly go about your business, not making waves or attracting attention, and secure your hideaway.
How about an urban outhouse? Jackie Clays, a writer for Backwoods Home, thinks it a wise move:
Yep, even if you live in the city, discreetly dig a hole and build a garden shed over it. Umhmm, I know it's not legal in many localities, but in an emergency you can use it and keep your home much more sanitary and sweet-smelling.
Hungry? You might feel a bit nostalgic as you leaf through "Depression-era gardening," an article by Alice Brantley Yeager in Backwoods Home:
The Depression forced people to save and make the best of what they had. . . . I take the optimistic view that Americans can survive almost anything if we get in touch with the soil and use common sense about other things. . . . To those folks who are apparently married to their computers and not inclined to have rapport with a garden, I can only say that I have yet to see a computer serve a fresh tasty garden salad or some stir-fried veggies.
Self-reliance is even more of a snap when you can rely on the government, writes Kenn Abaygo in "Urban Survival in Extreme Situations," in American Survival Guide:
Begin life on the lam as a bum. Society and its government will care for you in nearly every way by giving you shelter from the storm, food and water, medical attention, clothing and encouragement. They ask for nothing in return and seldom ask your name; almost never do they ask for identification either. They just want to give you a hand and they feel good doing just that.
In the course of reporting, Mr. Abaygo picked up the knack of gourmet foraging:
Some of the best dumpsters in Central Park are behind Tavern on the Green, the famous restaurant. I lifted a lid on one of them, and, lo and behold, it was half full of steaks, seafood, pasta, chicken, pork, salad fixins, vegetables and other goodies. Some of it was still warm, too. Yum.
When the going gets tough, the tough go hunting -- even in Central Park:
Squirrels are tame . . . as are pigeons. Many will come right into your hand for a speck of food, and none are expecting to be trapped, snared or hunted. . . . A squirrel pole snare for those furry critters and a noose stick for birds are two excellent devices for taking game in the park.
Of course, the apocalypse has no dental plan. Good thing there are do it yourself tooth extraction videotapes starring Dr. Dennis Knobeloch, advertised in American Survival Guide:
A preparedness-oriented dentist has set out to help those in the uncertain future by showing them how to take out painful teeth. . . . By mounting a special video camera on a headband, this dentist has recorded the actual removal of teeth from people with severe toothaches. Front teeth, back teeth, top teeth and bottom teeth. Everything is shown in up-close detail. Definitely not for the squeamish but very definitely for the well prepared.
And while you may be a loner, that doesn't mean you have to be lonely. Both Backwoods Home and American Survival Guide publish personal ads for the Y2K-prepared:
Granny with an attitude (a positive one) . . . pro-gun, pro-Constitution, into 4X4s, rural living, camping, fishing . . . would like to hear from any who are trying to survive/thrive/ protect themselves and their families for coming hard times.
Lutheran male, 34 . . . certified security specialist, certified survival instructor, bodyguard . . . Willing to trade skills, provide additional security in exchange for a place of refuge (preferably in WY, CO, NM, TX or OK) for the coming possible turmoil. No racists or Democrats need reply.
SWM, 25, incarcerated survivalist, pro-freedom, pro-gun, seeks white female, 18-30 . . . would like to relocate. Release date is 2000.

HEADLINE: The World;
Triumphant, The Left Asks What Else It Is

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
AS leaders of the center-left parties that govern much of the Western world gather in resplendent Renaissance palaces in Florence this weekend to ponder the course of the fuzzy but resonant political idea some of them call the "third way," sharp differences are evident as to what social democracy in the post-cold-war world should be.
Leaders from Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroder like to declare themselves newfound allies in championing market-friendly governments that still look out for the less fortunate. Out with tax-and-spend, state-heavy irresponsibility -- in with the new culture of fiscal conservatism and opportunity. But this surface accord masks fundamental questions about a "third way" ideology that is part marketing tool, part pragmatism and part the innovative fruit of the left's past failures. 
 The divisions in Europe are particularly profound. Britain, like Bill Clinton's America, is a transformed society, steered to a new entrepreneurial culture first by Margaret Thatcher and now through the pro-market centrism of Tony Blair; France is loudly proclaiming its loyalty to socialism while quietly installing a market-oriented culture; and Germany is struggling to begin reforms that would end what Chancellor Schroder has dismissively called "the nanny state."
Among the center-left, Britain does what it says, France does what it says it will not do and Germany says a lot without proving able to do much. But there is a central dilemma: the left, once unified in Europe around the idea of class struggle, has not yet figured out exactly whom it represents these days and, as a result, what its priorities should be. Is its most important constituency still workers and state employees, or young founders of Internet companies with progressive ideas?
This has been a heady decade for Democrats and Social Democrats. Seldom has so much power accumulated so fast in one political family. Deprived of their old Communist enemy and disoriented by the global economy's erosion of such traditional conservative values as the nation, right-wing political forces have reeled. In their place, leaders like Mr. Blair, Mr. Schroder and Lionel Jospin of France have stepped forward with a new message in which the Clintonian echoes have often been unmistakable.
It is true that the Clinton years have brought America many results of which Europeans can only dream: a budget surplus, the creation of close to 19 million new jobs, sustained growth, virtually full employment and welfare rolls at a 30-year low. But at the meeting in Florence convened to ponder 21st-century "progressive governance," Mr. Clinton will find his ideas challenged by Europeans still struggling to galvanize their economies.
At a fundamental level, globalization has challenged the left by changing the workplace in which socialism evolved. With less than 20 percent of workers in western Europe in factories, the working class has become less relevant. In a way, this has opened new opportunities for the pursuit of equality conceived as something beyond the old vision of class conflict or social leveling, and more as equality of opportunity.
But equality, in the words of Ronald Dworkin, a legal scholar at New York University, "is now thought to be electoral poison in the United States and basically has gone off the screen." America is growing more unequal. And, even in Europe, at least outside France, the idea of "sufficiency" has gained ground as a more important value than "equality": society should provide a bare minimum of social protection and equality of starting positions, but no more than that.
The pressure to move in this ideological direction has come partly from the global economy. Countries including Germany and France have seen their state-heavy economic systems challenged by new demands for competition. Unemployment rates have stayed stubbornly in the 10 percent range, and employers point to comprehensive welfare systems that add heavy social insurance charges to wage costs. Why get a job if benefits plus occasional work off the books provide a better income?
In the grand tradition of Franco-American sparring, the French -- on the surface, at least -- are clearly most resistant to the notion of a third way. The platform of Mr. Jospin's party for the last meeting of the Socialist International said capitalism was "unjust and often irrational." When Mr. Jospin deploys his mantra -- "We reject the market society" -- he leaves little doubt that he is referring to the United States of the super Dow.
Such oratory still has a ring to it. But it is something of a smokescreen, deployed to mask the radical market-oriented changes that Mr. Jospin's socialists have quietly encouraged in recent years: sweeping privatization, encouragement of stock options, support for a nascent share-holding culture inspired by the success of such former state monopolies as France Telecom. It is not for nothing that the Bourse has soared: investors understand that left-leaning theory may be the best buttress for a right-leaning reality.
The opposite has been true in Germany, where the culture is more literal and conservative. Mr. Schroder, for example, emphasizes a centrist stance to the point of calling his political platform "The New Middle." But German society has been slow to change, lagging behind France in flexibility and growth, far exceeding France in wage costs. "Germany is still an example of socialism at work," said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank.
Yet the policy paper on a reinvented left that Mr. Schroder co-signed with Mr. Blair this summer amounted to a remarkably fulsome endorsement of Mr. Clinton's favorite themes. "Too often rights were elevated above responsibilities" by former governments of the left, the two leaders said, adding that the responsibility of the individual "cannot be off-loaded on the state."
Fine words, but Germany and Britain remain far apart in reality. They differ on whether a rampant market should be embraced or reined in; and what, if anything, to do about regulating the Internet-driven zone where human activity seems to lie beyond the control of individual nations.
"We have different words for different traditions, but the fact is we have all reached a new place," said Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to President Clinton. "We are in the new economy, whether we like it or not. What is the alternative? Close your economy? Reflate? Nobody among these center-left leaders is doing that because everybody knows it leads straight to disaster." True, but the cultural gulfs remain striking. The French, for example, remain far more adamant about insuring what Mr. Jospin calls "the precedence of the political over the economic."
A great Florentine political thinker also believed in that precedence. His name was Machiavelli and he wrote: "Above all, a prince strives to gain from all his acts notoriety as a strong man of superior ability." On that, at least, the still ascendant center-left might agree. For if Mr. Clinton, Mr. Blair, Mr. Jospin and Mr. Schroder have one thing in common, it is an intensely pragmatic nose for power that is stronger than any surviving Socialist, Social Democratic or Democratic principle in this post-ideological age.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: After the Baby Boom;
For the Jobless Rate, The Forecast Is Hazy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is hard to walk into a store these days without confronting a help-wanted sign. Software whizzes and hamburger flippers alike can take their pick of jobs, and increasingly can expect not only a fatter paycheck but some kind of sign-on bonus.
This is a good time to be working, by most measures the best in a generation. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate last month was the lowest since January 1970. Joblessness has been below 4.5 percent for a year, and below 5 percent for nearly two-and-a-half years. 
 The big questions now about unemployment are how low it can go -- and whether the improvement can be sustained over the long run as the economy and the population change.
Alan Greenspan, for one, seems to think the unemployment rate should not go much lower. The Federal Reserve chairman raised interest rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point, the third time he has done so this year, in large part because of concern that the economy is literally running out of workers to fill all the jobs being created.
The Fed's fear is that as companies have a harder time finding the workers needed to expand or to replace employees who have left for better jobs, they will bid up wages, and then raise prices to maintain their profit margins, setting off an inflationary spiral that could derail the long economic expansion.
For years, analysts believed that inflation danger signals would start flashing red if unemployment dropped below about 6 percent and the economy continued growing at a robust pace. The experience of the past few years suggests that this so-called "natural" unemployment rate is substantially lower, and that the concept is not precise enough to be used by the Federal Reserve to determine when to hit the economic brakes.
Still, no one knows for sure whether the current jobless rate is too low for the economy's overall good or whether there is room for it to drop further. The answer hinges on the economy's ability to generate increases in the growth rate of productivity -- the amount each worker can produce in an hour.
From the early 1970's until this middle of this decade, productivity appeared to be growing at about 1 percent a year, a lackluster performance that had economists puzzled. But in the last few years, productivity growth has been surging. If the productivity improvement sticks, the result would be more job creation and downward pressure on unemployment rates with less risk of inflation -- what some analysts call the "new economy."
The problem now is that growth and unemployment are straining against the limits of what even the new economy would permit.
"You can have an overheated new economy just like you can have an overheated old economy," said Richard Herd, an economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research group for the world's industrialized countries.
In the long run, one of the biggest influences on the labor market is sure to be the immense demographic shift the United States is undergoing. Population growth is slowing, and as the baby boom generation ages, the nation is getting much older.
One implication is clear: the working age population will be smaller, suggesting at first blush that very low unemployment might be the wave of the future. But predicting the effect of the demographic shifts on issues like unemployment is a hazardous business.
For one thing, slower population growth does not necessarily mean that there will be fewer workers competing for each job. If population growth slows without an offsetting increase in productivity, economic growth could be expected to decline as well, and so would job creation.
Moreover, the economy's cyclical ups and downs have proven more powerful so far in determining unemployment than the size of the labor pool. In Japan, for example, the working age population is beginning to shrink, yet the unemployment rate has been going up as the economy suffers through a long downturn. And while there is no obvious reason why the long economic expansion in the United States should end anytime soon, the business cycle is by no means dead.
UNEMPLOYMENT and the size of the labor pool could also be tremendously influenced by any rise or fall in immigration, or by changes in the age at which workers choose to retire. A long trend toward earlier retirement now seems to be giving way to a willingness or need on the part of many older people to keep working at least part time.
"Simply knowing ahead of time the ratio of workers to non-workers takes you a little way toward answering questions like the implications for unemployment," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "But it doesn't take you terribly far, because that could be determined by other policy choices or some kind of economic shock."

Unemployment is at its lowest level in decades. And as the giant baby boom generation retires, there will likely be fewer workers entering the labor force behind them.

Have a Heart, or Several

 BODY:
What next, a patent on the human heart? No, but a production line for kits so surgeons can build hearts, maybe. William Haseltine, the highflying chief executive of Human Genome Sciences, raised that possibility last week. His company, which aims to develop medical applications for human genes, has already helped produce a drug, now in testing, meant to generate new vessels when injected into the heart. In other words, a bypass without surgery.
Mr. Haseltine has far greater ambitions over the longer run. "I'm part of a 25-year plan to reconstruct a heart," which could then be implanted, he said in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development in New York. He was referring to a group of business people and scholars led by Michael V. Sefton of the University of Toronto. 
 Mr. Haseltine is already deep in a debate over the extent to which gene sequencing research should be freely available or patented by companies like his. No patents on complete organs are likely, he said after his speech, adding, "It won't be like you have a central hospital in Iowa pumping out human hearts."

Russia Pines for a New Savior: Victory

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
JUST for a moment, imagine the corked-up fury of life in a failed superpower, a place where the government seems impotent and scandal-scarred; where the army is demoralized by defeat and incompetence; where the economy seems to rock between inflation and depression. Then imagine that Islamic terrorists from magnifying-glass specks on the map are blowing up your citizens, seemingly with impunity. If you lived there, it might feel good to hit back, too.
That is one way to view, though not to condone, Russia's brutish efforts to subdue its runaway province of Chechnya, a blunt-edged assault that is messily wiping out civilians and soldiers alike, drawing world protest -- and, by Russian estimation, working quite well, thank you. 
 Americans cannot truly imagine Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic collapse. But perhaps they can get a whiff of the emotional release Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt, after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to finally regain their military prowess -- striking back first at Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991.
Think back to that time: The notion that the United States was back, a force not to be messed with, was almost palpable. American approval was tinged with jingoism; "Vietnam syndrome" was declared dead. Now, after President Boris N. Yeltsin's defiant speech to a gathering of Europe's and America's leaders in Istanbul last week and the Russian military's vow to ignore the world's carping about its tactics in Chechnya, it seems conceivable that post-Soviet Russia has reached a similar turning point in its brief history.
Similar, but not identical. Unlike America, the Bear isn't back. And Russia these days is truly reeling, socially and economically, as America never did. In all probability, it is decades away from reclaiming the world stage. Still, a powerful backlash is beginning to coil, a Slavic jingoism born in desperation, fed by resentment of Western might and exploited by even the most liberal Russian politicians.
THIS is the context in which the Kremlin, eyeing the presidential election next June, is casting the war as a Russian wake-up call -- a "don't tread on me" warning to domestic bandits and foreign critics alike, from a people whose faces are black with heel marks.
"Those early signs of being Westernized, they were all superficial," Leonid A. Sedov, an analyst with Moscow's Public Opinion Foundation, said in an interview. "What's happening is that Russia is taking her own special course, and it's very dangerous."
All these themes, and more, are braided in Chechnya. The military was mortified there in 1996 after the Kremlin yanked it out before it could be decimated by urban guerrillas in the streets of Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
The current war offers generals the chance to wipe that slate clean and regain a measure of influence in Mr. Yeltsin's weakened government.
Military policy makers are bristling over America's attempts to fill the power vacuum along the old Soviet Union's shrunken borders. NATO's three-month bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last spring was, in retrospect, a fault line in relations between the two countries. Chechnya provides a chance to reassert Russian military strength in its own backyard, and to show that Moscow will not surrender its old spheres of influence so easily.
Foreign-policy strategists here have abandoned the gauzy notion of a decade ago that Moscow and Washington would together make the world safe for democracy; now they see the West mostly as a rival, if not a threat. Nowhere was that clearer than last week in Istanbul where, as Western leaders condemned Chechnya misdeeds in one hall, President Clinton watched in another as several former Soviet states signed a deal for a new oil pipeline that would circumvent Russian pipelines and their tariffs.
To Russian foreign-policy makers, subduing Chechnya keeps Russia in the pipeline game, since a stable Chechnya is central to building new routes nearby or enlarging pipelines already in the area. And it allows the Kremlin to return the thumb in the eye that it clearly believes has been delivered by America and its allies on issues from pipelines to economic reform.
To the political elite, Chechnya is as much electoral as military strategy. Given a chance to wave Russia's tricolor instead of lamenting its decline, virtually every politician in the nation has closed ranks behind the Kremlin and against its foreign human-rights critics.
Just how little daylight separates them is clear from one remarkable scene: A leading Western-oriented member of parliament, Grigory Yavlinsky, suggested a negotiated Chechen peace earlier this month. And immediately, the man who is perhaps closer to Washington than any politician in Russia, the Kremlin adviser Anatoly Chubais, called it the act of a traitor.
Mr. Chubais, who hopes to elect his own faction to parliament, would not be saying such things if voters did not enthusiastically agree. For whatever the elites now believe, it is the nationalistic backlash among ordinary Russians that is driving them and events in Chechnya.
FOR those Russians, the distinction between human-rights violations and the extermination of terrorists is not so much artificial as nonexistent. True, ordinary Russians opposed the last assault on Chechnya, in 1994, as a cruel waste of lives and money. But now it is an issue of self-defense: Chechen bandits invaded the province of Dagestan last summer, seeking to extend their reach, and Russians widely believe that it was Chechen terrorists who blew up apartment houses and barracks across Russia, killing hundreds of innocents. No one in Russia expects such a war to be played by Hoyle's rules.
For Americans, the irony is that they may have done a lot to set the mood for Russia's current attitude toward Chechnya. Conflict there may have been unavoidable; Islamic militants effectively gave the Kremlin and its armies a choice of fighting or losing both territory and Russia's honor. But both the rules of the battle and the mentality of its leaders have been molded by NATO's relentless bombing of Yugoslavia last spring -- opening an East-West rift that American diplomats then predicted would soon be papered over, but that has only yawned wider in the intervening months.
In Russia, the Kosovo war is remembered as a conflict NATO launched in utter disregard of Moscow's emotional pleas and warnings of disaster. This time around, Moscow has returned the cold shoulder, ignoring Western pleas to mediate and even to closely observe the conflict.
Now, in Russian eyes, Moscow's day-and-night bombardment of Chechen targets mirrors NATO's round-the-clock raids, save the smart bombs and accurate missiles that minimized civilian Yugoslav deaths.
Then, Russia denounced as war crimes the civilian deaths that did occur, from errant NATO missiles or bombs that hit refugee sites. Now those same horrors have become justification for ignoring complaints about Chechen civilian casualties. More than 200,000 Chechens have fled their homes, and Chechen officials say more than 4,000 civilians have been killed.
It is not that Russia is insensitive to those complaints, or at least to their effect on domestic politics. In fact, the Kremlin has tightly manipulated news coverage here, calling the war an "anti-terrorist action," restricting live coverage and playing down stories of civilian suffering. But while Mr. Sedov's own polls show some softening of public backing for the conflict in recent weeks, Russians' thirst for a victory to celebrate seems apparent: whereas half the population supported giving Chechnya independence four years ago, 8 in 10 now support the Kremlin's battle plans.
More revealing, perhaps, is the response to the question of whether Russia must reinstate itself as a "great empire;" 85 percent said yes, and 7 percent no.
"It reminds me of the feelings of an old man who still imagines that he's a young vigorous man again," Mr. Sedov said.

Russia's battering of the autonomous republic of Chechnya echoes in many ways in the Russian psyche, reflecting frustrations at the Soviet breakup and fears that Russia itself could disintegrate.
 
FEARS OF A PRECEDENT
With 21 other ethnically-based semi-autonomous republics left over from the Soviet era within the Russian Federation, authorities in Moscow do not want to appear to be opening the door to demands for independence.
 
LOST OIL AND INFLUENCE
The Caspian Sea is one of world's hottest zones for oil and gas exploration, and many of the promising fields lie in territory that once was part of the Soviet Union but became independent a decade ago. Now, though, the newly independent republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia are planning, with Turkey, to build a pipeline that would completely avoid Russia and instead pump oil toward Western markets via a Turkish port on the Mediterranean. The oil deal is a central element in efforts by these republics to build closer relations with the Kremlin's old rival, the United States.

Heading for a Record Low, Unemployment Rate Drops

BYLINE: By LISA SUHAY 

 BODY:
The state's unemployment rate dropped for the fourth straight month, a decline that some say is likely to continue and result in the state's lowest jobless rate in history.
"What we are seeing here is the largest peacetime expansion of jobs since we've been keeping records," said Carl Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. 
 According to the state Department of Labor, the unemployment rate dropped another O.1 percent in October, bringing it to 4.5 percent. The report, made public last Wednesday, stated that nearly half of the non-government jobs created last month were in the construction industry.
Payroll employment in the state increased last month by 3,200 jobs, for a record 3,880,400, according to the report. New construction jobs accounted for the biggest increase, with 1,400 jobs added to payrolls. Construction employment rose to 138,900, the highest in nine years.
Other strong growth categories included social services, finance and insurance, health care and retail trade. LISA SUHAY

HEADLINE: The Battle Over A.T.M. Fees

 BODY:
Customers are expressing outrage at the surcharges banks impose on them for using automated teller machines owned by banks other than their own. The cities of Santa Monica and San Francisco recently banned these surcharges. The New York City Council is planning to do the same. But before customers get too riled up about paying fees for the privilege of reclaiming their own money, they need to recognize that businesses do, after all, have a right to charge for their services. More important, efforts to ban the surcharges are apt to backfire and cause bank customers more harm than good.
Consider depositors at, say, Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City. Most of them pay no fee if they withdraw money from one of Chase's machines. But if they withdraw money from their Chase accounts by using one of Citibank's machines, they pay two fees. 
 The first goes to Chase, which keeps some of the fee and passes the rest on to the computer network that processes the transfer and to Citibank. The second fee goes directly to Citibank as additional compensation for providing its machines to noncustomers. It is this second fee that particularly angers many consumers and leads to complaints that the banks are charging the noncustomers twice.
But those consumers forget that before A.T.M.'s depositors sometimes had to pay fees to get a bank to cash a check drawn on another bank. But often they could not get cash at all from banks other than their own. Now they can, but for a fee.
Over the past three years, as surcharges have taken hold, banks and other institutions, such as merchants, have installed A.T.M.'s in airports, gas stations and nearly everywhere else. Surcharges make it profitable for merchants to own A.T.M.'s, and the competition from these merchant-owned A.T.M.'s keeps the banks from imposing excessive charges for use of their own machines. If Citibank tried to charge noncustomers excessive fees, nearby merchants would profit by installing their own A.T.M.'s and luring users by setting lower surcharges.
Critics of surcharges argue that they drive depositors from small banks to large banks so that they can take advantage of machines spread all across town that are free, of course, only to the large bank's depositors. There is, however, no evidence that this has happened. In fact, it is the bans on surcharges that most threaten to harm small banks. After Santa Monica passed its ban, two large banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, shut their machines to noncustomers. That, more than modest surcharges, threatens to make customers flock to big banks.
Banning surcharges will have three economic reverberations, none good. Some banks will close down machines in underpopulated regions because, in the absence of surcharges, they will generate too little revenue. Other banks will block depositors from other institutions from using their machines.
But the most common reaction may well be that banks sell their A.T.M.'s to nonfinancial owners, such as individual hotels and restaurants, which remain eligible under most state and local surcharge bans to keep imposing fees. The rationale is that the exemption for nonfinancial owners preserves their incentive to install machines. But the odd result is that bans designed to protect depositors may wind up preserving surcharges even as they make finding A.T.M.'s more difficult.
The banks are challenging local bans on surcharges in the courts. However, neither legislation nor litigation should cloud the central goal of consumer protection. The best policy for consumers is to steer clear of local regulations that will help concentrate business in a few big banks and make it harder for many citizens to obtain cash.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Silent Majorities;
Polling's 'Dirty Secret': No Response

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON is such a devoted student of public opinion polls that his aides say he can recite, from memory, the American people's double-digit tastes on a wide array of issues. Besides using survey data to help shape some of the most important decisions of his presidency, Mr. Clinton has also consulted polls before deciding whether his family should go to the beach or the mountains on their summer vacations.
Most infamously, Dick Morris, his former political adviser, testified that Mr. Clinton asked him to conduct a secret, overnight poll to determine whether Americans were prepared to hear the truth about his affair with a 21-year-old intern inside the White House. Mr. Morris said that after taking the survey, he told the President: "You can't tell them about it. They'll kill you. They're just not ready for it." 
 "Well, we just have to win, then," Mr. Clinton replied. It was Mr. Morris's poll that helped persuade the president to deceive his family, his aides and the public for months.
"So the few hundred people who answered Morris's poll determined a critical presidential decision," wrote Arianna Huffington, the conservative columnist who has crusaded for years against politicians' devotion to polls by urging people to refuse to respond to pollsters' questions. Ms. Huffington described the White House sex scandal as "the first political crisis to be so entirely driven and shaped by polls," asserting that it was the president's consistently high approval ratings that spared him from removal from office by the Senate in February.
This vigilant reliance on poll numbers by the president and most politicians raises an important public policy question: Who actually talks to pollsters and who does not?
The answer, it turns out, is troubling news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just 10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's "dirty little secret," because most polling firms refuse to divulge their surveys' refusal rates.
THE trend is especially important in the current presidential campaign, with a newly front-loaded primary calendar that makes polls more crucial to candidates' fortunes than ever. Already, some candidates have cited their own discouraging poll numbers and the subsequent lack of financial support as reason enough to drop out of the race, months before the first primary ballot is cast.
Thanks to the ever-rising number of opinion polls and telemarketing phone calls -- and no doubt to the increasing disengagement of people from politics article, page 16 -- more and more people simply refuse to be questioned. Lately the trend has raised alarms among pollsters and social scientists, who are starting to question the validity of many surveys conducted for politicians and the media.
And doubts about polls can only increase with the rise of Internet polling (which Mr. Morris, among others, is trying to promote). Internet polling raises obvious questions of methodology, in part because respondents are self-selected and come only from the population subset of computer users.
In traditional polling, falling response rates, as they are called in the trade, are a "terrible, terrible problem," says the pollster Everett Ladd, director of the Roper Center. Even gauging it is a challenge, given the reluctance of polling firms and media organizations to routinely disclose response rates.
Pollsters say response rates have fallen as low as 20 percent in some recent polls, which means that as many as 8 out of 10 people initially asked to participate in a poll refused to be interviewed. Ten years ago, polling response rates were typically at least 50 percent.
ONE media pollster attributes the growing number of refusals to the public's weariness with aggressive telemarketers.
"Everybody is always trying to sell you something on the phone," said the pollster, who insisted on anonymity. "Most refusals come within the first 30 seconds, when people are not certain it is a legitimate poll. They usually assume it is just another attempt to sell them something."
In response to the problem, an International Conference on Survey Non-Response was convened last month in Portland, Oregon. It was attended by 500 pollsters, marketing professionals and academics, who spent several days grappling with the issue.
"If you have money to spend, you can still get quite high response rates," said Robert M. Groves, a professor at the University of Michigan who chaired the conference in Portland. But the national polls conducted for large media outlets with limited budgets often cut too many corners to produce results in just a few days, experts argue.
M OST of the political polls taken by news organizations, including The New York Times/CBS News poll, struggle to persuade people to participate. (The Times doesn't publish its response rates, which vary but generally match the long-term trend. It has provided them on request to journalists from other news organizations.)
Some scholars are concerned that the public's diverse demographics aren't being reflected in poll results.
"The data are pretty clear that you miss people who live alone, especially younger people who are more likely to be out in the evenings," Mr. Groves said. "You tend to over-sample people with young children because they are home. You also tend to over-interview the elderly population because they are at home and are often willing to be polled. You get the unemployed. It's an odd distribution."
The poll with the highest response rate is the monthly unemployment survey conducted by the government. The survey result is a key economic indicator -- last week it prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates -- so it better be reliable. And scholars generally agree that it is, largely because the survey's response rate is between 94 and 96 percent. The survey's pollsters interview 40,000 people across the country over a 10-day period. Studies show that people are much more willing to respond to a poll conducted by the government than by the media or a private firm.
Ms. Huffington and other conservative commentators have asserted that Mr. Clinton's enduring high approval ratings result from a political bias in polls conducted for the national media. In 1996, these critics complained that the polls often overstated Mr. Clinton's lead over the Republican nominee, Bob Dole.
But the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press studied this question and found little evidence of political bias in national political polls. The study also considered the criticism that quick media polls often miss some people.
The center took two surveys -- one that contacted 1,000 adults by phone in a five-day survey, and a more elaborate one over eight weeks, which included advance letters announcing that a poll-taker would be calling and offers of a small monetary gift in return for participation.
Perhaps not surprisingly, 79 percent of the people contacted in the more rigorous survey agreed to be interviewed, while only 65 percent agreed to participate in the five-day telephone survey.
"But as it turned out," the center reported, 'the standard and rigorous surveys produced strikingly similar results."
Thus the Pew Center findings suggest that the non-response issue could be addressed with polls that adhere to rigorous standards and controls.
Increasingly, academics, social scientists and even politicians are becoming more vocal about their distaste for politicians who vote according to polls rather than their consciences.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York recently decried politicians' addiction to poll results, suggesting that it had caused Congress to adopt popular causes, like the line-item veto, that were later found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. "We've lost our sense of ideas that we stand by, principles that are important to us," Mr. Moynihan said in an interview with Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor, which was published in the periodical Civilization. "We've got very near to becoming careless with the Constitution."
Mr. Jennings asked, "Do you think that, in some respect, polls have contributed, as I think I detect on occasion, to a lack of confidence in politicians in their own deliberative thinking process?"
"Yeah," Mr. Moynihan replied, "I think you wouldn't be mistaken, as a citizen, to ask: Are we really necessary?"

HEADLINE: Electoral Setbacks Force German Chancellor to Retreat From Lure of the Free Market

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: FLORENCE, Italy, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Having spoken out vigorously this summer in favor of the free market, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany arrived at a conference here today on the future of Social Democracy saying a leading German company should be protected against a hostile takeover bid from a British concern.
The apparent contradiction between the chancellor's avowed embrace of a freewheeling entrepreneurial culture and his patriotic defense of the mobile phone group Mannesmann suggested yet another zigzag in his attempt to reform his Social Democratic Party and adapt Germany to the pressures of the global economy. Trying to strike a balance between the market and traditional values of social justice is a major difficulty facing center-left leaders who are meeting here to try to define a political course some have called the "third way." 
 President Clinton, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain are among the leaders attending the two-day conference on "progressive governance," where Mr. Clinton will lay out the themes of fiscal discipline, government activism, individual responsibility and broadened opportunity that he believes have buttressed American economic success in recent years.
That success -- while seemingly incontrovertible in numbers like the 19 million jobs created during the Clinton years -- is by no means universally recognized in Europe. On a recent tour of the continent, Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, was struck by the image of the United States in the minds of the European left:
"Top-hatted plutocrats crushing the masses, a place from a Brecht play where crime is so rife you can barely stick your head outside without being shot," he said. "An anti-American imagination is at work that obscures American reality."
In part, of course, such descriptions merely reflect European distaste for American triumphalism. The French now often refer to the United States as a "hyperpower," and the Greeks have dubbed Mr. Clinton a "planetarchis," or planetary ruler.
But the disappearance of the communism against which the moderate left long defined itself and the emergence of a global economy that has transformed the workplace have created pressures and divergences within the family of the moderate left that go far deeper than trans-Atlantic misunderstanding.
Nowhere is the pressure on Social Democracy greater than in Germany, home of "consensus capitalism" and the "social market" model that propelled the postwar miracle. This model, while still enjoying wide support, has proved generally ill-adapted to the speed and competitive demands of a global economy driven by information technology.
Mr. Schroder came to power just over a year ago beneath the electoral slogan "the New Middle," and this summer he co-signed a long paper on the third way that said the European left had too often favored state intervention and excessive economic regulation.
"The weaknesses of markets have been overstated and their strengths underestimated," Mr. Schroder and Mr. Blair wrote then. "We want a society which celebrates successful entrepreneurs."
Since then, however, Mr. Schroder has suffered a series of electoral setbacks, and he has been roundly criticized both by the labor unions that remain a cornerstone of German Social Democracy and the governing Socialists in France.
As a result, in another of the zig-zags that have characterized his government, he has begun to retreat from his embrace of Mr. Blair's New Labor. His unusual intervention today in the British company Vodafone's $123.6 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann illustrates this retreat vividly.
In an interview published in Le Monde today, Mr. Schroder said that "those who mount such operations in Germany underestimate the virtues of co-determination" -- a reference to the German model of having worker representation in the boardroom.
While there is no evidence that Vodafone would undo this model in Mannesmann's operations, there is ample evidence of German unions' and the popular press's uniting in outcry against the British bid.
"Hostile takeover bids destroy the culture of a company," Mr. Schroder said. "They harm the target, and, over the medium term, they also hurt the predator." He added that he was not, as a general rule, against foreign companies taking "stakes" in German companies, but called for "extreme prudence."
German companies have been very active in buying foreign companies in recent years. The automaker BMW bought Rover Britain, and Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler. Other prominent acquisitions include Deutsche Bank's purchase of Banker's Trust and Bertelsmann's acquisition of Random House.
But is is clear that ahead of a Social Democratic Party congress in Berlin next month, Mr. Schroder has become deeply concerned with retaining the support of the left wing of his party. He has taken to scoffing privately at his old political slogan. "The New Middle," he now says, "drives Porsches."
In his latest lurch to the left, Mr. Schroder is certain to find support from French Socialists, who have rejected the third way as a doctrine and are fiercely critical of Mr. Clinton's America. "The United States is too unjust a society for us to admire it, and places too much trust in the market," said Alain Bergounioux, a leading Socialist.
Mr. Jospin and Mr. Blair have taken radically different views on the future of the center-left, with Mr. Jospin emphasizing that Socialism was "born and developed to oppose the capitalism of industrial society" even as he has adopted a pragmatic approach to government.
"Mr. Clinton is no Social Democrat, and cannot judge European socialism," Mr. Bergounioux said. "At best, perhaps Hillary is a Social Democrat, because she tried and failed to borrow some ideas from our welfare state."

HEADLINE: CHOKING ON GROWTH: A special report.;
In Atlanta, Suburban Comforts Thwart Plans to Limit Sprawl

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The builders of Georgia's epic new mall, a vast savanna of shopping on 100 acres, chose a precarious moment in Atlanta's history to open their doors a few months ago.
All summer, the city had been trapped under a hood of smog. Highway information signs begged commuters to eat at their desks. Traffic was so heavy that a single accident caused nine hours of delays one morning. 
 Normally conservative politicians and business leaders had been driven to create an extraordinarily powerful superagency to slow the region's growth machine. Its chairman, a real estate developer, took to quoting Gandhi on greed.
And right in the middle of Atlanta's summer of excess, the Mall of Georgia opened 35 miles northeast of downtown in Gwinnett County. It called itself a new kind of mall, an open-air village for strollers complete with a nature park, but as the largest mall in the state, it quickly became an enormous emblem of sprawl.
The town square out front could not hide the surrounding blacktop with spaces for 8,600 cars, because cars are the only way to get to the Mall of Georgia. There is no public transportation in Gwinnett County, and none will be available for years.
Atlanta, like so many other cities, continues to build malls, office parks and subdivisions, even though the consequences have been made clear on the region's highways and in its air. The national call for smarter, more urban growth has been heeded by the region's leaders, but the packed parking lots around the Mall of Georgia suggest a deep disconnect between the way most Americans live and one of the first official efforts to control their appetite for suburban comforts.
The leadership of the 10-county metropolis that includes Atlanta has known for years that the region's smashing economic success was producing so much congestion that its future was threatened. This year it acted, creating one of the most powerful tools in the country for containing growth, the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, empowered to veto highways, order new rail lines and deny development like subdivisions and malls.
But sprawl is the result of millions of small, individual decisions -- from the building of a giant mall to the decision to shop there -- that have barely changed, despite the public's expressed disgust.
Given years of population growth that was overtly encouraged by government, those decisions have accumulated to make Atlanta the epicenter of the nation's struggle with road congestion, air pollution and overdevelopment. No city has scrambled faster to develop long-range plans that might reduce the effects of growth, but in no city in America do residents continue to spend more time in their cars. That is a direct result of the Atlanta area's low population density, the lowest of the nation's largest metro areas, and its continuing consumption of forest land at the rate of 50 acres a day. The Atlanta region has about 1,370 people per square mile, compared with about 5,400 in the Los Angeles area.
If the region still has any hopes for continued economic growth -- and Atlanta is loathe to turn off the population spigot, which added more people here in the 1990's than to any other metropolitan region -- its residents will have to change their way of life, and they may have started too late.
 
With Car the King, A Lack of Sidewalks
Counties like Gwinnett and Douglas still prefer the tax revenue of a new mall to rejecting a developer's request; three regional malls that rival the Mall of Georgia are being built and another is planned.
Despite a renewed interest in developing vacant sections of downtown and midtown, home buyers still prefer the big lots and low prices of suburban cities like Cumming and Alpharetta to a smaller, more expensive city home. And most commuters, particularly those who work at suburban office parks, still find a single-occupant car more convenient than a train or bus.
For all the prosperous professionals who have moved into the core city of Atlanta to escape traffic, the growth of the suburbs was 100 times greater than that of the city last year. The city, in fact, has grown little while the region around it has swelled. With 427,500 people, Atlanta today accounts for 13.3 percent of the metropolitan area's 3.2 million residents, while it made up 22.4 percent in 1980.
The automobile is so essential here that most neighborhoods lack sidewalks, and the design of the cities has made it difficult for people to find ways to reduce driving. Though a growing number have joined car pools that allow them to use designated faster lanes, vehicle emissions have hit a historic high. Of more concern, the region's residents now drive an average of 35 miles a day, more than anywhere in the country.
Neighborhoods continue to reject public transit lines, in part because they fear that they will bring other races into their midst, or because they dread the foot traffic and development that public transit is designed to concentrate. Counties that do try to restrain growth often face furious opposition in a region with a strong libertarian streak, as longtime landowners insist on the right to sell to the highest-paying developer.
"We're talking about changing human nature here, and especially the independent streak that so many Southerners have," said Lucy Smethurst, director of the region's Clean Air Campaign, a consortium of businesses, government agencies and environmental groups trying to break long-standing regional habits. "We're trying to slow down the Queen Mary, and we've just now seen the rocks in the water ahead."
It is a measure of Atlanta's ambivalence about how to deal with its roaring growth that even the Mall of Georgia, which one environmentalist decried as "the very embodiment of sprawl," is being offered by its supporters as a solution to the problem.
F. Wayne Hill, the chairman of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners, who pushed the mall through the approval process, said it would keep Gwinnett residents from driving to a mall across the county.
"It's not sprawl -- it's actually keeping our people from driving even further," Mr. Hill said. "Do you want everyone on the roads, driving downtown to shop? Gwinnett needs its own malls because people are choosing to live here, which they can still do because this is a free country."
All that freedom, however, lies at the root of Atlanta's crisis. The region's population has grown 70 percent since 1980, spilling into once-rural counties, largely because there was always more farmland to clear for another subdivision, unimpeded by natural barriers. Gwinnett County's population more than tripled, to 523,900 residents.
Until recently, there were few regulatory barriers to growth. The competition for development and the accompanying tax revenue led counties to build hundreds of miles of roads without fear of interference by the state. (The Mall of Georgia will generate nearly $5 million a year in property taxes and $6 million in sales taxes.)
That way of thinking began to change in June 1996, when the Environmental Protection Agency threatened to ban federal money for highway construction in 13 regional counties because of high ozone and smog levels. Last year, when the ban took effect, businesses acted, fearing that government regulations combined with Atlanta's congestion, pollution and worsening image would begin to hurt profits.
One business leader very publicly called the federal action a "train wreck" for the region. Companies began to organize to reduce air pollution, which this year produced 69 smog-alert days, a local record.
"I think the business community realized that we couldn't afford to be paralyzed by the situation, the way other cities are," said the chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, John A. Williams, a real estate developer. "To ensure that Atlanta continued to grow and be prosperous, it became evident that the single most important issue was improving the quality of life. So we had to work with the political and environmental communities to come up with a solution."
Businesses, in fact, have done far more than residents to reduce congestion.
In the last year, ridership on the region's subway increased only 1.4 percent. But BellSouth, the huge regional telecommunications company with headquarters here, announced that it would consolidate 75 offices, with 13,000 employees, into three regional centers, each situated at a subway station.
The Coca-Cola Company plans to bring 2,500 employees from the suburbs to its headquarters downtown. And several real-estate developers are beginning to concentrate on what is called new urbanism projects, in which housing is built around offices and shops, encouraging residents to walk to work.
The hope is to find a way to continue the region's growth -- the lifeblood of corporate profits -- while concentrating it in a way that is less harmful.
"It's what it means to be a good citizen," said BellSouth's chief executive, F. Duane Ackerman. "The congestion and air quality situation has really risen to a crescendo here in Atlanta, and anything that affects the quality of life could affect the growth of the area."
Most important, however, business leaders joined forces with environmental groups to support Gov. Roy E. Barnes's plan for a Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, known as Greta.
The authority, quickly approved by the State Legislature in March, is intended to provide the firm control over growth and transportation planning that local governments, competing with one another, have failed to muster.
The agency will have the power to build (or veto) roads and transit systems. In theory, it could build and operate a rail line through any of several counties that have opposed mass transit. It can also have an effective veto over large subdivisions, office parks and malls by refusing permits to tie into the road system.
The authority's chairman, Joel Cowan, made it clear in a recent interview that new projects like the Mall of Georgia would not be approved unless they had mass transit connections, or at least the population density to justify them.
"We're going to have to reorder the culture in which decisions to build these projects are made," said Mr. Cowan, a developer and advocate of better planning. "A mall like that will be a huge traffic generator, and there's nothing we can do about it now. But in the future, we will need to see a great deal more density before a plan like that is approved, and a corridor for transit. We have to ensure that these projects don't create new trips."
In other words, a mall might be approved if it is integrated with housing and office buildings. This idea of "manufactured density," for which Mr. Cowan is a leading apostle, is fairly radical for Atlanta and the Southeast, which grew up around the historical planning orthodoxy of strictly separating housing and commercial areas. But a consensus is clearly growing among the region's leaders that houses, offices and shops must begin sharing the same space, much as they do in older, Northeast cities.
"That's the way Atlanta is going to have to grow, in true live-work-walk communities, with enough density to support transit," said Mr. Williams, who has bet much of his company on the concept. "It's going to be a lifestyle change, but given the alternative, I think people will take to it."
That consensus, however, is at a fairly elite level, and it is unclear whether it will trickle down to the warring camps of property owners and new residents. A stark example of their conflicting interests occurred recently in Cherokee County, a largely undeveloped area 25 miles north of downtown where the population has grown more than 50 percent since 1990.
Last year, at the urging of newcomers who moved in and then wanted to slow the growth around them, the county commission passed an innovative plan to concentrate development in 13 town centers, leaving most of the county pastoral. Longtime landowners, however, fought the plan bitterly because it meant they might not be able to sell to developers; some zoning meetings erupted in fistfights. In July, the commission dropped the plan.
"I haven't given up," said Emily Lemcke, the chairwoman of the Cherokee commissioners and a leading proponent of careful growth. "I still hope that we can educate people and get them to understand that the whole region is going to have to change. But for now, there are still too many people who don't want to be told how to live their lives or what to do with their land."
That seems quite likely. In September, Greta delayed a new beltway in the far northern suburbs, long the favorite of state highway builders, in favor of more carpool lanes and an expanded transit system. Governor Barnes has also ordered counties to set aside 20 percent of their undeveloped land for parks and green space.
Mr. Cowan, the chairman of the agency, said he planned to interpret its mandate broadly, and would make the decisions that are too tough for local politicians to swallow. Asked, for instance, about the recent refusal by neighborhoods east of downtown in DeKalb County to accept a new rail line, he noted that the agency had the power to build a line over local opposition.
 
Efforts to Revive Dormant Downtown
There are other signs, too, that the region is beginning to look inward for its future. Several major projects are under way to awaken Atlanta's dormant downtown, which until recently had not had the nightlife to attract nearby residential development. In September, Turner Broadcasting opened its new basketball and hockey stadium, Philips Arena, next to its expanding CNN Center, having reversed a decision to build in the suburbs. Two developers plan to build a walker-friendly mini-city of homes, offices and shops on the site of the Atlantic Steel plant, a 144-acre wasteland on the northern edge of downtown.
Neighborhoods near the center of the city have become popular among young couples who have rejected the commuter's life, making houses in such areas far more costly than similar dwellings in the suburbs.
"We're too young to be spending our entire lives in the car," said Kate Folse, an employee-benefits manager who recently moved with her husband, Brian, from suburban Duluth, in Gwinnett County, to the Virginia Highlands area, Atlanta's brick-restaurant and coffee shop district. "It was hard convincing my husband, but when we did the math, we realized we were spending 20 hours a week commuting, and we had no control of our time. Now we love walking everywhere."
The Folses, however, are vastly outnumbered by their suburban counterparts. From April of last year to this year, the 10-county Atlanta region grew by 94,300 people, the second-largest annual population increase in its history. But the city of Atlanta grew by only 900 people.
Those trends show no sign of changing. Last month, local officials proposed a 25-year plan, intended to reduce ozone emissions, that still forecasts the region growing by a million more people by 2025, most of whom will live in suburban areas and continue to drive. Even with all the proposed spending, the average time that Atlantans spend in the car is projected to increase to 90 minutes a day, from 80 minutes now.
Some transportation experts say that as long as a region's economy is growing and creating jobs, there is nothing the city can do about traffic congestion.
"The people who are complaining about congestion really need to get a life," said David T. Hartgen, the head of transportation studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who has studied Atlanta's traffic patterns. "This is a democratic, free society with a lot of wealth, which translates to private mobility. Short of extremely draconian measures which no one wants to take, there's almost nothing that will materially affect traffic congestion."

HEADLINE: U.S. Readies a Major Land-Protection Initiative

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CORTEZ, Colo., Nov. 20

 BODY:
As one of its last major public land initiatives, the Clinton administration is preparing to designate as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the West that federal officials say need protection from future commercial development and recreational overuse.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who came to Colorado this weekend to build support for the action, said the administration had decided to act because, in many cases, Congress had failed to act on proposed legislation that would accomplish the same thing. Delays, he said, had prompted President Clinton to consider invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the president the authority to act by executive order in the case of any lands that have scientific, historic or archaeological significance. 
 Since the law was passed, every president except Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush has designated at least one national monument. There are now more than 100.
Mr. Babbitt said the administration was more than willing to allow Congress to take the lead. But conceding that opposition in some cases might be strong, he said the president was willing to act.
"I certainly hope this is not our last major initiative, but it is a major undertaking," Mr. Babbitt said in an interview on Friday before hiking through part of the 73,000 acres he wants added to the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction. Today he toured Indian ruins here that he wants declared monuments.
"The needs are growing year by year," he said, referring to commercial and recreation pressures. "Congress hasn't responded at all. So rather than leave it all to the 11th hour, the president is ready to consider these on a case-by-case basis."
Besides the two Colorado sites, the other proposed monuments are the Arizona strip, on the north rim of the Grand Canyon; Perry Mesa, near Flagstaff, Ariz.; La Cienega, near Tucson; the Missouri Breaks, along 140 miles of the Missouri River in Montana; Steens Mountain, in southeast Oregon; Soda Mountain, in southern Oregon; the Santa Rosa Mountains, near Palm Springs, Calif.; the Carrizo Plain, in California's central valley; the Otay Mountains, east of San Diego; and thousands of islands and rocks off the California coast.
Having toured them all within the last year, Mr. Babbitt said he had found growing public support for granting monument status, which would provide greater protections through the National Park Service or the Bureau of Land Management. All the lands under consideration are managed by the land bureau, but monument status would add access restrictions and ensure that they cannot be developed or sold.
Preservation groups and environmentalists are applauding the initiative. "It sends a very important signal that these special places deserve more protection than they're getting," said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. "This tells the world that they are very significant sites."
But many opponents view it as little more than a political tactic by Mr. Clinton, a way for him to seal his legacy as an environmentalist and cement environmental groups' support for Vice President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency.
In addition, lawmakers from Western states, like Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah and Wayne Allard of Colorado, object to federal intervention within their borders without sufficient local input. And commercial interests say the initiative is yet another effort by the administration to ignore the economic consequences of environmental policy.
"This certainly smacks of another antimining advocacy effort," said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. "You have to go where the minerals are, and if they continue to withdraw lands where the mines are, it means going elsewhere to develop, which means out of the country and the loss of millions of jobs."
Myra B. Hyde, director of environmental issues for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose members own herds that graze on open lands, said: "Once you take lands out of production, it affects whole communities."
Lawyers for the Interior Department said that some of the lands in question have mineral resources but that none have active mines. They also said grazing rights would probably not be affected.
Representative James V. Hansen of Utah, who is chairman of a House national parks and public lands subcommittee, sponsored legislation two years ago that would require approval of Congress as well as the governor and state legislature to designate a national monument that exceeds 5,000 acres. It passed the House, but a companion Senate bill is still under consideration.
When the most recent national monument -- Grand Staircase-Escalante, a 1.9 million-acre tract in southern Utah -- was designated by Mr. Clinton in 1996, Mr. Hansen called the designation "the biggest land grab in the nation." And in a letter last month to Mr. Babbitt expressing concern over monument designations in their state, three Colorado lawmakers -- Senator Allard, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Representative Scott McInnis -- described it as a "heavy-handed federal action."
Mr. Allard said in an interview this week that Mr. Babbitt had yet to respond to the letter. He criticized administration officials for "storming in and storming out without doing the proper legwork" on the issue.
Mr. McInnis, who attended a public forum led by Mr. Babbitt at the Colorado National Monument on Friday, predicted that Congress would expand the monument, which is in his district, within the administration's timetable. With regard to the other lands, he added: "Executive order is not the way to go. The Antiquities Act was never intended to bypass Congress."
Allen Freemyer, staff director of Mr. Hansen's subcommittee, said that even without Mr. Hansen's bill, the administration already had "hundreds of tools" to manage public lands without drawing on a 93-year-old measure that was passed before agencies like the park service were created to manage and protect federal lands. "This is a big photo-op declaration, which really isn't necessary," he said of Mr. Babbitt's initiative. "They're just doing what Al Gore likes to do best, the champion of the environment warning that if we don't make these places monuments, the bulldozers are waiting."
To administration officials and environmental groups, that prospect is not much of an exaggeration. As the expanding national economy of the 1990's has created more business opportunities and disposable income, they contend, open lands have become more vulnerable to commercial development, recreational use and encroaching sprawl.
At the forum, Mr. Babbitt said that whether it is Congress or Mr. Clinton who makes the designations, monument status would assure that "the next seven generations" have the same opportunity to enjoy the lands that visitors have now.

HEADLINE: A Metropolis Made Great By Greed;
New York Has a Credo, But 'You First' Isn't It

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Most cities have a burnished story of creation, some hoary tale of heroism and principle that swells the chests of their citizens as they strut down historic streets past Starbucks and The Gap. Take Philadelphia; founded on the premise of religious tolerance, its very name evokes fraternal love.
Then there is New York. Crass, uncouth, grubby New York. 
 As the recent PBS documentary "New York" demonstrates, this city was founded largely on the premise of making a buck. While Providence, R.I., proudly remembers the meeting between Roger Williams and the Narragansett Indians that led to its becoming a haven of tolerance, New York recalls how Peter Minuit bought Manhattan island from local Indians for a Dutch song.
Legend has it that Minuit paid $24 in beads and trinkets. Historians say the price was closer to $600. Either way, it was "the operative moment of New York as a real-estate deal, and that hasn't changed," said Peter Quinn, a historian and writer. "Donald Trump would have tried to pay $22."
Children do not re-enact the Minuit moment in school plays, perhaps because it is hard to imagine celebrating a development deal that enshrined capitalism -- some would say "greed" -- as the primary force in the city's growth and identity.
"It's not something that Americans and even New Yorkers are entirely comfortable with," said James Sanders, an architect and author who wrote the documentary with Ric Burns. "It's not really democracy and Mom and apple pie. It's something to be skeptical about, capitalism and greed. It is a funny connection."
But the connection between New York and the pursuit of wealth is as complex as it is odd. Some of the historians featured in the documentary suggest a cause-and-effect link between capitalism and several significant social advances, including the establishment of housing, health and zoning codes. Others say the documentary overstates that connection, and that many factors -- not just the quest for profit -- made New York a pioneer in social reform.
So New York was established as a money-making venture. So it took settlers a few years to erect a church. So what? Boston was founded by English Puritans, but Quakers who thought that meant religious freedom were sometimes hanged for their misinterpretation. And historians generally agree with the documentary's point that New York's commercial roots contributed to a kind of no-nonsense tolerance that continues to this day.
"At some level, everyone is equalized in the sense of: 'What can you do for me? I don't want to be your friend; let's just do business,' " Mr. Sanders said. But that rather cold demeanor can be interpreted another way, he said: "I don't need to be your friend. I don't care what color you are, what your religion is or what your politics are. But if you put up the cash, we'll do some business."
Carol Berkin, a history professor at Baruch College, agreed that New York's crass beginnings oddly worked to its advantage. "If you have the wrong ideology," she said, "it's better to have no ideology at all. Maybe you don't want to write an epic poem about a place where you can make a buck. But given the alternative, it made it more tolerant."
Of course, history is more complicated in real time than when it is poked and analyzed generations later. Beware grand abstractions and theoretical concepts, advised Mike Wallace, the co-author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of New York called "Gotham" (Oxford University Press, 1998) and one of the documentary's prominent figures. "Events on the ground are never so clear and simple."
And so it is with New York. For example, it is true that soon after establishing the village of New Amsterdam -- later called New York -- in the early 17th century, the Dutch founders accepted people from many cultures. And it is true that the community's leader, Peter Stuyvesant, was overruled by superiors in Holland when he proposed banishing Jews from the colony; think of the higher goal of profit, they suggested.
But those days were not all handshakes over piles of guilders. "If you are talking about the Dutch being willing to accept a variety of cultures," Mr. Wallace said, "the Dutch were also perfectly prepared to enslave zillions of people if that were the way to make money."
The British ousted the Dutch in the late 17th century, and American colonists ousted the British after the Revolutionary War. But while the flags overhead changed, the businesses on the ground continued to grow: banking, shipping and manufacturing.
One event was overtaken by the next. Alexander Hamilton struck a deal that solidified New York as the country's financial center. A grid of intersecting streets was built. The Erie Canal was completed, simplifying the movement of goods between the Great Plains and the rest of the world.
By the 1830's, the city saw fit to create a financial district on Wall Street to which people commuted. "It is the first time in human history that a district is devoted to the single purpose of commerce," Mr. Sanders said. "Nobody lives there. And that's a new way of life."
Fortunes were made in bull markets, lost in bear markets, and forgotten by the next bull market. The affluent built town houses and mansions in the ever-expanding uptown, while the poor blacks and Irish immigrants congregated in the Five Points, a foul-smelling sinkhole of a district -- near today's Foley Square -- with unpaved roads, run-down buildings and occasional epidemics.
The documentary's chapter on this period is aptly called "Sunshine and Shadow."
Mr. Quinn, among others, sees the natural tension between these extreme forms of economic life in New York as setting the stage for the social reforms to come. "That's where you have greed and the resistance to greed playing out," he said. "New York was the most economically advanced state in America. That's why you had the labor movement and the social-reform movement existing here, but not existing in other places in the United States."
For example, he said, the political machine known as Tammany Hall converted the anger of poor Irish and German immigrants into votes that allowed it to control and corrupt city government. ("I seen my opportunities and I took 'em," a Tammany leader, George Washington Plunkitt, once said.) In exchange, Tammany's operatives provided jobs and fought anti-Catholic movements. Later, to secure the support of the new wave of Jewish and Italian immigrants, it backed significant social legislation to improve the conditions of working people.
But Mr. Wallace argues that an alternative vision for New York dates back to the early 19th century, when some people contended that the rich came perilously close to resembling the aristocracy that existed under British rule. And the city has always been a haven for radicals and rebels, from Tom Paine to Cuban revolutionaries. That environment, he suggests, played an important role in creating a sense of entitlement.
"It is based on the notion that people are entitled, by virtue of their citizenship, to certain rights," Mr. Wallace said. "They are entitled to decent housing, public health, free education."
A concept emerges from the streets of New York that is somewhat foreign to the rest of the world, historians say. Simply put: With profit there must come social justice.
But reform was often more theory than practice: The arguments of an economic reformer named Henry George failed to persuade the city to elect him mayor in 1886. The city had millionaires by the score, and conditions in tenements that Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, says in the documentary were "as bad as anything ever seen."
Then, as the documentary suggests, seminal moments in the arc of New York fostered institutionalized change. Jacob Riis's stirring photographs of life in Five Points in the late 1880's shamed city elders into developing housing codes for tenements. A fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in 1911 killed 146 women in 15 minutes; the tragedy led to broader powers for the Fire Department to ensure factory safety and bolstered the drive to unionize factory workers.
More than before, the city began to blaze trails in social reform. "New York becomes an example of a liberal democracy," said Mr. Jackson, the editor of The Encyclopedia of New York (Yale University Press, 1995). "It learns that you can't let capitalism run completely amok. You have to take care of the people who get trampled along the way."
Or, as Mr. Sanders put it: "New York is one of the first to realize that capitalism wasn't enough".
The first five parts of the documentary ended last week by focusing on the Great Depression, which historians say taught New York yet again about the dangers of unfettered greed. The sixth and final episode will not be shown until early next year. But Mr. Sanders and others said the last 70 years would continue to reflect a city striving to strike the proper balance between capitalism and the public good.
Several pointed to the demolition of the majestic Pennsylvania Station in 1963 as an example of the city failing to find that balance, of paying the price for wanting everything bigger and better. But in the continuing evolution of its municipal conscience, the city soon created the Landmarks Preservation Commission that led the successful fight, years later, to save Grand Central Terminal from the wrecking ball.
In a sense, the historian John Steele Gordon said, "Penn Station died for our sins."
And so the paradox of New York continues. In Manhattan, the rich rent F. A. O. Schwarz overnight for pajama parties for their children, and the ex-wife of a billionaire, Ronald Perelman, says in divorce court that she spends $3,175 a month on clothing for their 4-year-old daughter. And in Queens, immigrants -- from Guatemala, Eastern Europe, Pakistan -- cram together in illegally subdivided houses. Some subsist by selling flowers on the street, batteries on the subway.
Daniel Czitrom, a historian featured in the documentary, grew up in the Bronx and drove a taxi in the city before earning his doctorate and landing a teaching job at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. A specialist in the city's history, he remembers the service cutbacks during the recession of the 1970's, and marvels at the public improvements during the bull market of today.
"But you still have this super-exploitation of workers in these cockroachlike industries," he said. "And you have people paying a quarter-million for one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan.
"It just blows my mind."

HEADLINE: Democracy in Pakistan: Can a General Be Trusted?

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 18

 BODY:
This country's elite has been notorious for corruption, with some elected officials the most voracious at the trough. So it is tempting for Pakistanis to cheer on Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a coup five weeks ago. His new government has ordered the arrest of dozens of prominent wealthy people who supposedly finagled multimillion-dollar bank loans they had no intention to repay.
A war on the wicked rich is the central reform mandated by the general, who has taken the title of chief executive. He says he is ending "sham" governance and will "pave the way for true democracy" in this country of 150 million people. 
 Military despots have intermittently run impoverished Pakistan for 25 of its 52 years, and each time that democracy was shoved aside a sincere-sounding general explained his assumption of power in roughly the same way. Will this time be any different?
It is far too early to tell, but most Pakistanis are eager to give General Musharraf the benefit of the doubt, agreeing with him that their wobbly and troubled democracy needed to be demolished so it could be rebuilt on a surer foundation.
Others, however, merely hear an all-too-familiar melody sung by yet another crooner with epaulets. "Military rule always begins with the same empty promises," said. I. A. Rehman, director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
In 1958, Field Marshal M. Ayub Khan announced that "our ultimate aim is to restore democracy but of the type that people can understand." In 1969, Gen. A. M. Yahya Khan vowed "that I have no ambition other than the creation of conditions conducive to the establishment of a constitutional government." In 1977, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq said, "The survival of this country lies in democracy and democracy alone."
General Musharraf may indeed be no better with his promises, but at least for now some very able people believe otherwise. They are risking their reputations to join his new government.
In the last month, the general has been making important hires, naming a seven-member National Security Council, a cabinet and provincial governors. The list has more than its fair share of generals, active and retired, but the majority of the appointees are civilians. While most come from the same well-connected families that have always run the country, many are well regarded as independent thinkers with a bent toward reform.
Shaukat Aziz, a Pakistani living in New York, was a highly paid vice president at Citibank. Soon after the coup, he was urged to visit Islamabad by General Musharraf, a man he had never met. The military wanted advice about an economy that is $32 billion in debt and on the brink of bankruptcy.
The general offered the banker the post of finance minister. "I was impressed by the chief executive and his team, their sense of purpose and eagerness to set things right," said Mr. Aziz, a perfectly coifed executive with just the right amount of gray around his temples and a neatly folded handkerchief in the breast pocket of his blue blazer.
"Pakistan has this small window of opportunity here, this chance to fix things with integrity and transparency," he said. "The army wants to do away with the culture of corruption that exists in Pakistan. And I'm totally convinced they mean business, that they really care about improving the lot of the people."
Omar Asghar Khan, an environmentalist who has been working in opposition to the illegal harvesting of timber, was offered a cabinet post to oversee rural development and labor issues.
"These people are talking about the devolution of powers, trying to get average citizens into government," said Mr. Khan, the Cambridge-educated son of an air marshal. "They don't have a time frame for a return to democracy, but I don't blame them for that. The sheer survival of the state is at stake. Things shouldn't be rushed."
Abdul Sattar, an amiable, if pedantic, retired diplomat, was at a conference in Washington when the coup occurred on Oct. 12. He too had never met General Musharraf, but the two hit it off after Mr. Sattar was asked in for consultation.
Both men share a burning distrust of India, Pakistan's neighbor and fellow nuclear power. Indeed, Mr. Sattar, who has twice been ambassador to New Delhi, said the 13 years he spent on Indian-Pakistan relations was a "desert that produced nothing positive."
He accepted the job of foreign minister. "Democracy here was just musical chairs, and what we need are fundamental reforms," Mr. Sattar said.
General Musharraf, once a commando, insists that his government is "entirely civilian." However, he also says the army is needed to monitor everything that goes on. "Only the military, which is all over Pakistan, can act as eyes and ears," he said in an interview.
The United States has been relatively tepid in criticizing the military takeover, but the Commonwealth -- a group of 54 nations, many of them former British colonies -- has suspended Pakistan, demanding "restoration of civilian democratic rule without delay."
For the most part, such condemnations draw sneers in Pakistan's capital, where people are wont to claim that the ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was nothing but a power-hungry conniver, stuffing his already fat pockets while systematically enfeebling the judiciary and the legislature through political foul play.
In General Musharraf's view, the army too had become a victim of this institutional meddling, with the prime minister sowing dissension in the ranks, especially after a humbling military setback in a near all-out war with the Indians in June and July.
An alternative chain of events is offered by the party hierarchy of Mr. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League. In this account, senior officers were plotting against the general, whispering warnings to the prime minister about a Musharraf-led coup.
This goes to the heart of the question of the hour in Islamabad. On Oct. 12, Mr. Sharif fired General Musharraf. Was the prime minister trying to thwart a coming coup? Or was the coup, as the general enjoys describing it, an utterly spontaneous and tellingly loyal response by his officers to the news of his dismissal?
The events of that evening are now part of Pakistani lore. General Musharraf, unaware that he had been fired, was seated aboard a commercial jet, heading to Karachi from Sri Lanka. The air traffic control tower, supposedly under orders from Mr. Sharif, denied the plane permission to land. The runway had been blocked. Fuel was running perilously low.
As the story goes, only the quick reflexes of the general's subordinates saved the day. The army took control of the tower. The plane and all 198 on board, including 60 schoolchildren, were saved. The coup began. Mr. Sharif was quickly placed in custody. He has since been accused of treason, hijacking and conspiracy to commit murder -- all capital crimes.
And that brings up the second question on people's minds, endlessly debated over tea. Mr. Sharif will soon stand trial. Most people assume a verdict of guilty.
So will they or won't they? people wonder. Are they going to hang him?

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Pataki Upstages a Rival Over Cleanup of Hudson

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 20

 BODY:
On Friday, Nov. 12, aides to Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer let reporters know that New York State was about to sue General Electric over the dumping of toxic waste in the Hudson River, a move long demanded by environmentalists. The news conference would be on Monday.
Later that day, an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki called reporters to say that the governor would be making his own announcement about G.E. on Saturday, two days before Mr. Spitzer. 
 The timing was curious. The Pataki administration rarely makes news on a Saturday, an inconvenient day for state officials and reporters alike, and there was no hurry about the governor's announcement, an order that G.E. clean up PCB-contaminated soil at a defunct factory, which had been in the works for months.
It was the latest evidence that for the Republican governor and his aides, the sudden prominence of the Democratic attorney general on environmental issues has become a sore spot. When asked, administration officials did not deny that their Saturday announcement was intended to take a little wind out of the attorney general's sails and keep Mr. Pataki's name in the news.
The governor's office dismisses the suggestion that there is any competition to be the state's leading defender of air and water, fish and fowl. "The governor has a long and distinguished record on environmental protection," said Michael McKeon, his press secretary. "He is very secure in his record."
But there is no denying that the dynamic has changed. For four years, Mr. Pataki was, without question, New York's most prominent conservationist. There were always legislators and advocates who took some positions before he did, or criticized his record, but there were serious limits on what they could accomplish without his cooperation.
Then Mr. Spitzer took office this year, taking control of the state's power to prosecute and litigate. His actions have gained heavy coverage from the news media and rave reviews from environmentalists and editorial writers.
He sued 17 power plants in other states over air pollution that blows across state lines, making New York the first state to try that tactic. He was the first in the state to sue G.E. over the dumping of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, into the river. Specifically, he charged that for years, the contamination has kept the state from dredging a shipping channel, the Champlain Canal.
The danger to Mr. Pataki is not only that he might have to share the stage with Mr. Spitzer, but also that the administration's responses to the situation will seem petty or political. Recently, when the governor announced a major clean-air project, environmentalists who had criticized him were barred from the news conference.
After Mr. Spitzer announced his suit against G.E., administration officials, in some cases, seemed to be reaching for arguments against it. In particular, they insisted that there was no need to dredge the canal because boats could use it with no trouble.
That was news to people who live and work along the 35-mile-long canal, which links Lake Champlain to the Hudson River. "I see boats get stuck in the mud all the time," said Joanne Fuller, tourism promotion administrator for Washington County, who has lived beside the waterway for 19 years, as silt deposits have made it shallower. "Some tour boat companies have given up coming through here. It has hurt the economy of the entire region."
Officials in the village of Fort Edward say the landing there has become inaccessible to most boats, hurting local business. John C. Tobin, a lawyer for a group of barge, tugboat and tanker operators, said: "It's a huge problem. You can't get boats through, and if you try, you can get hung up on the mud."
Even the Thruway Authority, which operates the canal, conceded that getting boats through sometimes meant removing cargo, or using dams to raise the water level.
The funny thing is, environmentalists are happier now with Mr. Pataki than ever before. He recently ordered New York's power plants to meet the toughest air emissions standards in the nation. He made New York the second state, after California, to adopt new emission controls for new cars and trucks. And this month he ordered the strictest rules in the country for cleaning up a gasoline additive that has polluted ground water.
"It looks like there's some competition going on, and that's fine, because they're both doing some good things," said Cara Lee, environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a conservation group. "But whether or not there's competition, I don't understand the administration's reaction. They have been a little touchy."

An Imperiled Muse Weaves Her Spell

BYLINE: By MARGARETT LOKE 

 BODY:
Outside museums and galleries and fine-art publications, black-and-white photographs from the past don't often take center stage. An exception to that observation is "Shooting the Past," a two-part Mobil Masterpiece Theatre drama being shown tonight and next Sunday night at 9 on PBS. Its extraordinary main character is a vast picture library housed in a splendid 19th-century mansion on the edge of London and tended by a small and intensely devoted staff.
As the drama begins, the staff is jolted out of its cocoon by the arrival of Christopher Anderson, an American businessman who is the building's new owner. Mr. Anderson, played by Liam Cunningham, plans to keep the collection's few valuable pictures, dispose of the rest and in four days' time begin turning the mansion into a business school. 
 Marilyn Truman (Lindsay Duncan) is the library's manager, a strong-willed upper-class woman who extracts from Mr. Anderson a week's delay in the renovation to find a buyer for the collection. Joining her in a quixotic attempt to persuade Mr. Anderson to keep the collection intact is her deputy, an eccentric by the name of Oswald Bates (Timothy Spall) who has no need for a computer since he knows which picture is in which box in which room.
That these are not ordinary pictures is obvious. Early on, while Mr. Anderson matter-of-factly informs Ms. Truman of the "economics of the situation" -- that the cost of storing the pictures would be prohibitively expensive -- the protagonist makes its appearance. The screen is filled with one hauntingly beautiful image after another. And as the drama unfolds, more of the library's treasures from the past -- of adults and children at play, of faces and street scenes -- take star turns.
In real life the photographs are from the Hulton Getty Picture Collection, and Stephen Poliakoff, the British dramatist who wrote and directed ' the drama, made them an integral part of his script.
Mr. Poliakoff said in a recent telephone interview that he became interested in the subject in the early 1990's, when Celia Barnett, a friend and an art director for films, found herself frantically searching for a home for a picture collection that EMI studios, which was then her employer in London, wanted to dispose of quickly. Many of the pictures showed details of England in the 1940's, 50's and 60's that would be invaluable to researchers. The collection eventually went to Lucasfilm, which has a large research library at its base in California.
The paradox, Mr. Poliakoff said, is that the BBC, which commissioned "Shooting the Past," was "whacked with a big charge" for the use of pictures it once owned. In 1957, the BBC had bought the original Hulton picture library from its owner, Edward Hulton, a British publisher. Inspired by the archive at his magazine Picture Post, which ceased publication in 1957, Mr. Hulton had acquired a number of choice photo collections.
In 1987, the BBC sold its Radio Times Hulton Picture Library for about 2.5 million. The current owner is Seattle-based Getty Images Inc., one of the world's largest providers of archived photographs. The Hulton Getty commercial picture library itself, with more than 12 million images, is in two converted warehouses in West London.
After writing the script for "Shooting the Past," Mr. Poliakoff discovered other endangered collections. While hunting for a film location, he came across the Mansell Collection in a Georgian house in London. He found the staff "living in a dusty eccentric world" not unlike that in his script. The Mansell's holdings -- half a million rare and important photographs, drawings, paintings, lithographs and engravings -- were was sold to Time Inc.
So potent did Mr. Poliakoff find black-and-white photographs in the picture collections he came across that he has Ms. Truman tell Mr. Anderson two absorbing picture stories in her role as a latter-day Scheherazade. Based partly on photographs in the Hulton Getty, the images she uses to bewitch him are a seamless, computer-manipulated blend of the real and the fictional, and look for all the world as though they were drawn from a real collection.

New York Joblessness Dips Slightly in October

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
New York's unemployment rate was slightly better in October than in September, but joblessness in the state is still worse than the national average, according to State Labor Department analysts.
The state's unemployment rate was 5.2 percent last month, down a tenth of a percentage point from September. The jobless rate in October 1998 was 5.4 percent. 
 By contrast, the national unemployment rate last month was 4.1 percent, also down a tenth of a percentage point from September, and down four-tenths of a percentage point from October 1998.
Labor Department analysts said on Friday that they counted 6,993,800 private-sector jobs in October, an all-time record. The job total grew by 16,000 from September, the 26th consecutive month with an increase.
Joblessness in New York City in October was at 6.9 percent, down from 7.2 percent in September and 8.0 percent in October 1998.

Woodstock '99 Proves Profitable for Rome

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Sales tax numbers show that Woodstock '99 was a big boost to the local economy. From June to August, the City of Rome took in about $560,000 more than it did during the same period in 1998, a 36.5 percent jump, City Treasurer John Nash said, attributing the increase to the summer music festival at the former Griffiss Air Force Base. 
 "We've never had a jump like this in any one quarter," Mr. Nash said. He said he had anticipated a $300,000 windfall in the 1999 budget because of Woodstock, but the added increase was a bonus. The extra money will go into the general fund surplus to stabilize taxes, he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING;
Turning Marriage Into a Political Issue

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
State Representative Mark Anderson of Arizona, a conservative Republican, hears a different legislative drum.
Ever since he was elected to the Arizona House in 1994 from Mesa, a city just east of Phoenix, he has made marriage issues a big priority, his pitch being that a state whose couples are happily married is a happy state and, more important, a strong state. His proposals have not enjoyed a lot of success -- Arizona still has its share of divorces and broken homes -- but he keeps pushing. 
 First, he tried to get the State Legislature to finance a $2 million program to teach single women on welfare the advantages of getting a husband. His bill would have enabled women "interested in pursuing a career track in home management" to learn "positive thinking and attitude adjustment techniques" and would have helped them understand the "economic and personal benefits of marriage."
Next, when a constituent, a divorced single parent, asked him to push the Legislature to provide child care for single parents who are in college, he suggested that her best course of action would be to "revisit the issue of your marriage failure, perhaps take some classes in parenting" and then find a new husband.
Now he has a new proposal.
He wants the state to put up $17 million to finance an array of public school and adult education classes that promote the idea of getting married and staying married. Some of the money would be used to develop a "healthy marriage" handbook and courses in marriage and communication skills, some would be used to underwrite attendance at such courses by poor people and to provide tax breaks for employers who offer marriage courses, and some would be used to underwrite a "marriage is a healthy lifestyle" advertising campaign.
Representative Anderson's goal: to reduce Arizona's divorce rate, now ranked 10th worst in the nation, by 5 percent by 2002.
State educators do not like the proposal. They say they already have trouble enough finding money and time to teach the three R's, let alone taking on a how-to marriage course.
But Mr. Anderson, who has never been divorced, refuses to back off. He argues that relationship skills that work in a marriage will also work in just about any other setting, including the workplace, and he notes that other states, including Florida, Oklahoma and Utah, are beginning to debate the kind of special education programs he is proposing.
"I'd rather have people graduating from school that can communicate and be a good marriage partner and be a good parent than somebody who can add," he declared last week.

HEADLINE: Better Perks Resonate in Boom Times

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
HIS name may not be familiar to anyone but his own employees, but chances are you've heard about what Al Galdi has done: given new BMW's to any employee who has worked at his company for at least a year.
 During the last six months, Mr. Galdi has handed out BMW keys to 34 of his 45 employees. The cars, which are leased, cost him about $9,000 a year each, including insurance. Needless to say, turnover at Arcnet, an architectural engineering firm in Holmdel, N.J., has been virtually nil since Mr. Galdi began offering the perk in June. Employees who leave have to give back the cars. 
 They also lose out on other goodies, like $100 gift certificates on their birthdays, health club memberships and a cash bonus equal to 25 percent of their annual salary on the fifth anniversary of their employment.
 About once a month, Mr. Galdi says, he asks his employees if they would rather have cash. The answer is always no.
 "They seem to really like the programs," he said, "because it helps with their quality of life."
 You could probably count on one hand, and perhaps even one finger, the number of employers in the New York metro area who are handing out keys to BMW's. But with the economy booming and unemployment at record lows, many employers are trying to come up with new and interesting perquisites.
 "It's not so much about rewarding, but retaining," said Michael A. Keane, managing consultant at Watson Worldwide, a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J. "When it comes to employees, it's basically a seller's market, and many companies are having to make extraordinary efforts."
 A recent survey by the outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison found that the top two perks on employees' wish lists were health club memberships (58 percent) and flextime (57 percent). That's not what most employers are providing: A.T.M.'s on premises (25 percent) and travel services (15 percent), according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers conducted by Hewitt Associates, a compensation consulting firm.
 "Employers need to ask themselves how they can make themselves different from everyone else," said Ray Baumruk, who helped conduct the study for Hewitt.
 Perks vary widely from company to company and within particular industries. High-tech firms tend to have the most innovative offerings, like on-site massages, concierge services, even quiet rooms where workers can nap. Blue-chip companies, particularly those on suburban campuses, tend to focus more heavily on time-saving perks like on-site dry-cleaning and film drop-off.
 For example, the 500 employees at Xerox's corporate headquarters at Stamford, Conn., are able to work out at an on-site fitness center, order meals from the company cafeteria for dinner and drop off dry-cleaning when they get to work in the morning; it's usually ready to be picked up the next day. On-site massage therapy -- a perk offered at other Xerox locations, but not in Stamford -- is in the works, said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman.
 One difference from several years ago is that the perks are for a larger pool of workers. At Arcnet, even the receptionist qualified for a BMW. Last month, Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer that has stores in Hicksville, N.Y., and Elizabeth, N.J., pledged cash bonuses amounting to a day's worth of sales, $80 million worldwide, to its employees, from the snack bar staff and stock clerks to the president. Each employee will end up with $2,435 when checks are distributed this month, said Marty Marston, a spokeswoman for Ikea North America. Retailing tends to be among the lowest-paying type of employment, so the one-time bonus could equal a month's pay for some.
 But even companies that can't afford to provide a car or a day's sales have plenty of options. Many perks being offered today cost the employer virtually nothing, but still create plenty of good will. Men's Wearhouse, a large California retailer that operates about 20 stores in the New York metro area, has signed up 120 local employers, including Citibank and New York University, for its V.I.P. program, which gives a company's employees 10 percent off on Men's Wearhouse purchases.
 Transitchek, a program that allows employees of enrolled companies to set aside up to $65 a month before taxes for public transportation commuting costs, also provides savings on corporate taxes. Each month 7,000 to 8,000 employers in the New York area participate in the program, said George Serventi, Transitchek director.
 "A lot of these things are in the interest of the employers who are doing them," said Helen Darling, a consultant at Watson Worldwide's Stamford office.
 Even costly perks often pay off in the end. Lipton Child Care Centers, a Washington company that operates backup child care centers in Manhattan, White Plains and Jersey City, says that employers still save money because parents don't need to miss work when their regular child care provider isn't available. The service has attracted employers like the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, Philip Morris, Pepsico and Texaco, as well as newer, smaller companies like Knight Securities of Jersey City.
 Stephanie Bernstein, director of human resources for Knight, a Nasdaq market maker, said she and several other parents were able to sell Knight's chief executive on the idea of backup care, even though Knight, like many other brokerage firms, mostly employs single men.
 "There were a couple of people here, myself included, who would get into a situation and be jammed," Ms. Bernstein said. Now, for an annual fee of $50, she and other Knight parents have access to the Lipton center in the lobby at Newport Center.
 At Dialogic Corporation, a Parsippany technology company recently bought by Intel, the company's 1,000 employees have access to a corporate concierge, who is able to arrange things like dinner reservations, family vacations and oil changes for cars. Dialogic pays LesConcierges of San Francisco for the service, but employees have to pay for individual requests. Other Dialogic perks include an on-site fitness center, a free coffee and juice bar, and heavily discounted soda.
 "This is all aimed at making it comfortable for people to be here longer than 40 hours a week," said Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits. Though Mr. Cardinal said the company hadn't tried to figure out whether the concierge service and other perks were paying off for the company, he said that turnover had been lower than expected.
 Still, at most companies, benefits are limited to items like health and life insurance and a retirement plan. Mr. Keane, the consultant at Watson Worldwide, estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of all companies offer what he described as nontraditional perks. That could grow if the economy continued to prosper.
 "A lot of companies are being pretty cautious, because once you add it, it becomes hard to take it away," said Alan M. Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consulting firm.
 Many consultants and even the companies that provide the perks wonder what will happen to the programs when the economy takes a turn for the worse. Employees who have grown used to the perks may be unwilling to give them up.
 "We all know it's going to be difficult to take these things away," Mr. Cardinal said. Given the choice of layoffs or reducing perks, most employers would probably reduce the perks, consultants say.
 But not Mr. Galdi. When business slowed down a few months ago, he said he had to lay off several employees. But he has no plans to stop handing out BMW's or cut back on any of the other benefits Arcnet employees receive.
 "I'm in the service business," Mr. Galdi said, "and having employees that are happy and hard-working is good business for me."
 
 Like a Front Desk at the Office
 SO what exactly does a corporate concierge do? Just about anything, as long as it's legal.
 "I never know what each day will bring," said Pam Wildrick, a corporate concierge at Dialogic Corporation, a technology company that was recently acquired by Intel Corporation. "People come in and they drop their problems on my desk."
 In the year and a half since Ms. Wildrick began working at Dialogic's Parsippany headquarters, she's done everything from picking up gifts for spouses who have forgotten a birthday or anniversary to locating a clock that ticks backward to finding a guide to take an engineer through dense jungle in Costa Rica. In a typical month, she fields 230 to 250 requests from Dialogic's 1,000 employees.
 Though Ms. Wildrick works in Parsippany, she's actually an employee of Les Concierges, a 13-year-old San Francisco company that provides concierge services to companies. (In the past, she had worked for several nonprofit groups in Morris County, including a stint as president of the Junior League and director of communications and special events for the Arts Council of the Morristown Area.)
 Though the concierge concept is popular in California, particularly in the Silicon Valley, corporate concierges are still relatively new in the New York area.
 "There's a lot of potential in the New York area," said Phil Wexler, Les Concierges' executive vice president. The company recently reached an agreement with Goldman Sachs to begin providing concierge services to its employees early next year.
 Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits, said the service was popular. One part of Ms. Wildrick's job involves arranging for oil changes and other routine maintenance on employees' personal cars while they are working, saving the employees valuable time on the weekends.
 So is there anything Ms. Wildrick won't do?
 Yes. She won't hire strippers, though she has been asked to.
 Though that's not illegal, Ms. Wildrick said she just didn't feel comfortable arranging that kind of entertainment for Dialogic employees, even if it took place off-site.
 "That one just crosses the line," Ms. Wildrick said.

HEADLINE: Better Perks Resonate in Boom Times

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
HIS name may not be familiar to anyone but his own employees, but chances are you've heard about what Al Galdi has done: given new BMW's to any employee who has worked at his company for at least a year.
 During the last six months, Mr. Galdi has handed out BMW keys to 34 of his 45 employees. The cars, which are leased, cost him about $9,000 a year each, including insurance. Needless to say, turnover at Arcnet, an architectural engineering firm in Holmdel, N.J., has been virtually nil since Mr. Galdi began offering the perk in June. Employees who leave have to give back the cars. 
 They also lose out on other goodies, like $100 gift certificates on their birthdays, health club memberships and a cash bonus equal to 25 percent of their annual salary on the fifth anniversary of their employment.
 About once a month, Mr. Galdi says, he asks his employees if they would rather have cash. The answer is always no.
 "They seem to really like the programs," he said, "because it helps with their quality of life."
 You could probably count on one hand, and perhaps even one finger, the number of employers in the New York metro area who are handing out keys to BMW's. But with the economy booming and unemployment at record lows, many employers are trying to come up with new and interesting perquisites.
 "It's not so much about rewarding, but retaining," said Michael A. Keane, managing consultant at Watson Worldwide, a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J. "When it comes to employees, it's basically a seller's market, and many companies are having to make extraordinary efforts."
 A recent survey by the outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison found that the top two perks on employees' wish lists were health club memberships (58 percent) and flextime (57 percent). That's not what most employers are providing: A.T.M.'s on premises (25 percent) and travel services (15 percent), according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers conducted by Hewitt Associates, a compensation consulting firm.
 "Employers need to ask themselves how they can make themselves different from everyone else," said Ray Baumruk, who helped conduct the study for Hewitt.
 Perks vary widely from company to company and within particular industries. High-tech firms tend to have the most innovative offerings, like on-site massages, concierge services, even quiet rooms where workers can nap. Blue-chip companies, particularly those on suburban campuses, tend to focus more heavily on time-saving perks like on-site dry-cleaning and film drop-off.
 For example, the 500 employees at Xerox's corporate headquarters at Stamford, Conn., are able to work out at an on-site fitness center, order meals from the company cafeteria for dinner and drop off dry-cleaning when they get to work in the morning; it's usually ready to be picked up the next day. On-site massage therapy -- a perk offered at other Xerox locations, but not in Stamford -- is in the works, said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman.
 One difference from several years ago is that the perks are for a larger pool of workers. At Arcnet, even the receptionist qualified for a BMW. Last month, Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer that has stores in Hicksville, N.Y., and Elizabeth, N.J., pledged cash bonuses amounting to a day's worth of sales, $80 million worldwide, to its employees, from the snack bar staff and stock clerks to the president. Each employee will end up with $2,435 when checks are distributed this month, said Marty Marston, a spokeswoman for Ikea North America. Retailing tends to be among the lowest-paying type of employment, so the one-time bonus could equal a month's pay for some.
 But even companies that can't afford to provide a car or a day's sales have plenty of options. Many perks being offered today cost the employer virtually nothing, but still create plenty of good will. Men's Wearhouse, a large California retailer that operates about 20 stores in the New York metro area, has signed up 120 local employers, including Citibank and New York University, for its V.I.P. program, which gives a company's employees 10 percent off on Men's Wearhouse purchases.
 Transitchek, a program that allows employees of enrolled companies to set aside up to $65 a month before taxes for public transportation commuting costs, also provides savings on corporate taxes. Each month 7,000 to 8,000 employers in the New York area participate in the program, said George Serventi, Transitchek director.
 "A lot of these things are in the interest of the employers who are doing them," said Helen Darling, a consultant at Watson Worldwide's Stamford office.
 Even costly perks often pay off in the end. Lipton Child Care Centers, a Washington company that operates backup child care centers in Manhattan, White Plains and Jersey City, says that employers still save money because parents don't need to miss work when their regular child care provider isn't available. The service has attracted employers like the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, Philip Morris, Pepsico and Texaco, as well as newer, smaller companies like Knight Securities of Jersey City.
 Stephanie Bernstein, director of human resources for Knight, a Nasdaq market maker, said she and several other parents were able to sell Knight's chief executive on the idea of backup care, even though Knight, like many other brokerage firms, mostly employs single men.
 "There were a couple of people here, myself included, who would get into a situation and be jammed," Ms. Bernstein said. Now, for an annual fee of $50, she and other Knight parents have access to the Lipton center in the lobby at Newport Center.
 At Dialogic Corporation, a Parsippany technology company recently bought by Intel, the company's 1,000 employees have access to a corporate concierge, who is able to arrange things like dinner reservations, family vacations and oil changes for cars. Dialogic pays LesConcierges of San Francisco for the service, but employees have to pay for individual requests. Other Dialogic perks include an on-site fitness center, a free coffee and juice bar, and heavily discounted soda.
 "This is all aimed at making it comfortable for people to be here longer than 40 hours a week," said Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits. Though Mr. Cardinal said the company hadn't tried to figure out whether the concierge service and other perks were paying off for the company, he said that turnover had been lower than expected.
 Still, at most companies, benefits are limited to items like health and life insurance and a retirement plan. Mr. Keane, the consultant at Watson Worldwide, estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of all companies offer what he described as nontraditional perks. That could grow if the economy continued to prosper.
 "A lot of companies are being pretty cautious, because once you add it, it becomes hard to take it away," said Alan M. Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consulting firm.
 Many consultants and even the companies that provide the perks wonder what will happen to the programs when the economy takes a turn for the worse. Employees who have grown used to the perks may be unwilling to give them up.
 "We all know it's going to be difficult to take these things away," Mr. Cardinal said. Given the choice of layoffs or reducing perks, most employers would probably reduce the perks, consultants say.
 But not Mr. Galdi. When business slowed down a few months ago, he said he had to lay off several employees. But he has no plans to stop handing out BMW's or cut back on any of the other benefits Arcnet employees receive.
 "I'm in the service business," Mr. Galdi said, "and having employees that are happy and hard-working is good business for me."
 
Like a Front Desk at the Office
 SO what exactly does a corporate concierge do? Just about anything, as long as it's legal.
 "I never know what each day will bring," said Pam Wildrick, a corporate concierge at Dialogic Corporation, a technology company recently acquired by Intel Corporation. "People come in and they drop their problems on my desk."
 In the year and a half since Ms. Wildrick began working at Dialogic's Parsippany headquarters, she's done everything from picking up gifts for spouses who have forgotten a birthday or anniversary to locating a clock that ticks backward to finding a guide to take an engineer through dense jungle in Costa Rica. In a typical month, she fields 230 to 250 requests from Dialogic's 1,000 employees.
 Though Ms. Wildrick works in Parsippany, she's actually an employee of Les Concierges, a 13-year-old San Francisco company that provides concierge services to companies. (In the past, she had worked for several nonprofit groups in Morris County, including a stint as president of the Junior League and director of communications and special events for the Arts Council of the Morristown Area.)
 Though the concierge concept is popular in California, particularly in the Silicon Valley, corporate concierges are still relatively new in the New York area.
 "There's a lot of potential in the New York area," said Phil Wexler, Les Concierges' executive vice president. The company recently reached an agreement with Goldman Sachs to begin providing concierge services to its employees early next year.
 Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits, said the service was popular. One part of Ms. Wildrick's job involves arranging for oil changes and other routine maintenance on employees' personal cars while they are working, saving the employees valuable time on the weekends.
 So is there anything Ms. Wildrick won't do?
 Yes. She won't hire strippers, though she has been asked to.
 Though that's not illegal, Ms. Wildrick said she just didn't feel comfortable arranging that kind of entertainment for Dialogic employees, even if it took place off-site.
 "That one just crosses the line," Ms. Wildrick said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Deal on Caspian Oil Still Faces Problems With Bottom Line

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
For both financial and political reasons, the agreement to build a pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil across Turkey, which the Clinton administration views as a strategic victory, is far from being a reality, oil executives and administration officials say.
For years, oil companies have looked at various pipeline routes to get the Caucasus region's vast oil reserves to market. And they have signed similar deals before, though this one looks more solid. 
 For the oil companies, the chosen route must be profitable. But for the Clinton administration, the prime concern has been strategic: guaranteeing that any pipeline would skirt Russia or Iran and deny them a choke-hold over a new energy supply for the West. The administration would also like to use the oil deal to bring several former Soviet republics into a Western-looking bloc, and to enhance the regional power of Turkey, a crucial NATO ally.
But whether the route agreed to this week -- which is strategically advantageous to the United States but costly for the oil companies -- can be made profitable quickly is still a big question. So too is the political fallout with Russia, the loser in the deal.
The major oil company involved in the pipeline project, BP Amoco, said it would seek help from Washington to line up enough oil shipments from producers in the region to make the pipeline commercially viable.
The company, said Michael Townshend, its director of international affairs, has set a deadline of next October for raising financing and commitments to use the pipeline. A new batch of oil from the Caspian will be ready by 2004, and the oil companies will need to decide by October where they are going to build a pipeline to carry it.
"It's not impossible, but it's a stretch," he said.
"The only way this is going to work is to make the pipeline as affordable as possible for shippers to put their oil down it," he added. "We're asking the United States government to attract as much oil as possible and to attract as much financing as possible."
If that money is not in place in time, BP Amoco can try to get the oil out by a different route, by expanding the capacity of an existing pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Supsa, Georgia, near the Black Sea, Mr. Townshend said. From there the oil would be taken by tanker through the Bosporus, a route less to the liking of Washington and the oil companies.
It is also possible that BP Amoco will delay the next phase of oil production in the Caspian Sea if the structure of the pipeline deal is not settled.
The Clinton administration has not pledged any money for the project beyond $500 million in loan guarantees from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank, officials said.
The oil companies had first hoped Washington would allow a shorter route through Iran, with an outlet at the Persian Gulf. But this was blocked by Washington's refusal to lift economic sanctions against Iran.
Beyond strategic considerations, the route through the narrow Bosporus also raises some environmental problems, and as they became more evident, the oil companies leaned more toward the more expensive route through Turkey.
As the oil companies wavered, Turkey tried to make the route to its port of Ceyhan more appealing by announcing it would pay for cost overruns on the estimated $1.4 billion the pipeline is expected to cost the oil companies.
When the deal was announced at a European summit meeting in Istanbul this week, it was, for Turkey, the most substantive part of President Clinton's five-day visit there. The other countries to sign the deal were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
That victory for the Clinton administration may have unseen costs, however. Administration officials acknowledged that Russia has always viewed the pipeline route through Turkey as an implicit threat. While the Russian reaction appeared muted this week, even the prospect of a pipeline deal had led Moscow officials to speculate publicly that Washington was trying to foment chaos on its southern borders.
Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Russia perceived Washington's efforts in the Caspian Sea as the equivalent of NATO expansion on Russia's southern flank.
Russia came to live with NATO's embrace of its former satellites -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- but how it would react to the pipeline that is designed to deprive Moscow of precious income and prestige was an open question.
"They clearly see this as threatening," said a senior administration official. "They see this as the next phase of U.S.-Russian competition. They don't seem to understand that they would be better off with a stable southern flank."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 1999, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about an agreement to build a pipeline across Turkey to carry oil from the Caspian Sea region included one country erroneously among the signers and omitted one. Along with the United States, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkey, the list includes Georgia but not Turkmenistan.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka

 BODY:
In a few days the World Trade Organization will hold a summit in Seattle. Some 150,000 protesters are going to take to the streets to denounce the W.T.O. and globalization as unalloyed evils. The protesters might want to talk to the workers of Sri Lanka first, because what you find here, in this island state located off the southern tip of India, is a rather nuanced view of globalization -- an awareness that it is as much a vehicle for developing countries to escape poverty as it is a vehicle for them to be exploited.
Let's start with Sri Lanka's biggest concern about globalization. At the Ministry of Industrial Development here is a sign that says: "The Year 2005 is only 60 months away. What are you doing to get ready?" The developed nations of the world are terrified about a year 2000 bug that could make all their computers stop. But for poor developing countries, it's 2005 that matters -- the year when their sewing machines could stop. 
 Most Americans don't know that a global Multi-Fiber Agreement sets quotas on exactly how many clothes every developing country can sell in U.S. and E.U. markets. The quotas are the lifeblood of countries like Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. By 2005 all the quotas will be phased out, which is going to trigger a Darwinian free-for-all to sell clothes to the U.S. and Europe.
Sri Lankan textile workers and manufacturers are now gearing up for Y-2005. Their biggest concern? China. "What we worry about with China is the profit motive -- they have state-owned factories that don't need to make a profit, but just keep people employed," said Mahesh Hirdaramani, a Sri Lankan textile maker. "It means they can sell at any price. And once there are no quotas anymore to protect our market share, China could undersell us everywhere."
To deal with the China threat, Sri Lankan textile companies are trying to move up the quality ladder. "We can't be the low-end producers anymore," says Mahesh Amalean, another manufacturer. "Bangladesh and China will run circles around us. So we are focusing on better quality, so retailers will want to stick with us. And we are working to make ourselves more valuable to the retailers by actually designing clothes ourselves. In the past, the retailers designed the garment and we had to show them we could make it. Now we have to design more things ourselves, get the fabrics, and then show the retailers that they can get the whole package from us. We have to become more than just tailors to survive."
I visited Mr. Amalean's factory, which makes underwear for Victoria's Secret. Located in the small tropical village of Pannala, the factory is completely computerized and will soon be linked by Internet to the Victoria's Secret chain to handle e-commerce. About 1,400 employees, mostly women 18 and older, work in this modern, air-conditioned factory on pneumatic sewing machines. The workday is eight hours and is intense. Each woman has to stitch so many garments per minute. Wages are about $80 to $100 a month, the average here, and there is a waiting list for jobs. In terms of working conditions, this factory is world class, and it's not alone here.
"The only way we can survive against China and Bangladesh after 2005 is if we build long-term relationships with the big global brand retailers," explains Mr. Amalean, "and those brand retailers are now demanding not only better prices and quality, but better conditions for workers." And they are demanding that not because they suddenly became socially conscious, but because American consumers are demanding it, thanks to recent anti-sweatshop campaigns.
In other words, working conditions have improved here not because Sri Lanka has put up walls against globalization, but because in today's global economy Sri Lanka must tie itself to Western retailers to survive. And the more it does that, the more its factory standards have to meet the values of Western consumers.
There are still plenty of sweatshops in this region, and the Seattle protesters should go after them -- by targeting the specific retailers who use them, but not by targeting globalization. That is stupid, not only because globalization is inevitable, but also because if managed properly, it can be an effective tool to lift labor standards around the world. The Seattle protesters need to understand that. The people of Sri Lanka already do.

CONVERSATIONS
 WITH WILDER
 By Cameron Crowe.
 Karen Lerner, editorial consultant.
 Illustrated. 373 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $35. 
 Imagine a book written a few years into the future, chronicling the changing tastes of the 20th century. Now imagine a chapter devoted to the topsy-turvy career of Billy Wilder. It would make for a gripping, and rather emblematic, tale. Born in Vienna, Wilder leaves for Hollywood in the mid-1930's and quickly crash-courses himself into a basic command of American pop English. With a partner he begins to churn out scripts, and in order to rescue these scripts from mismanagement he starts directing them himself. A string of brilliant and unforgettable films follows, each astoundingly different in plot and flavor from the one before. To name just a few: "Double Indemnity" (wicked noir, 1944); "Sunset Boulevard" (creepy, eerily beautiful classic of Hollywood decadence, 1950); "Sabrina" (sunny fairy tale, 1954); "Some Like It Hot" (mob-caper, cross-dressing romp, 1959); and "The Apartment" (sublimely subtle look at work, sex and the unseemly intersection thereof, 1960).
Audiences adore Wilder's work, and Oscars accumulate, but throughout his career there are critics, professional and otherwise, who remain on the fence. Reviewing Wilder's rat-a-tat-tat satire of the cold war, "One Two Three" (1961), Pauline Kael harshly concludes that he is a clever, lively director whose work lacks feeling or passion or grace or beauty. And for years this is the running rap on Wilder: that he is detached, at times clinically so; that the ease with which he moves between genres makes his oeuvre less personal than that of auteurs like Ford and Hitchcock and Hawks; that he is a crowd pleaser first and an artist second.
But over the past decade Wilder's stock has seemed to rise and rise. There have been remakes aplenty: Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" extravaganza on Broadway, Sydney Pollack's new version of "Sabrina," an updating of "The Apartment" rumored to be in the works. America's enduring crush on two actress-icons particularly associated with Wilder's work, Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, has ensured that Wilder still enjoys that most coveted of trophies, high name recognition among younger audiences. Spike Lee and Ang Lee and Steven Spielberg, among others, have praised Wilder and quoted his films in their own, and a few years back a panel of best-director nominees could agree on only one man whose example taught them all: Billy Wilder. At the age of 93, Wilder has entered the pantheon. He is the contemporary idea of what a classic should be.
Cameron Crowe's sweetly reverential, beautifully illustrated book of interviews with Wilder makes it easy to see why. Crowe is a very talented writer-director in his own right (his latest film is "Jerry Maguire," source of the two endlessly repeated lines of dialogue, "You complete me" and "Show me the money!" -- but he should be forgiven), as well as a skilled former journalist who knows how to capture personality in print. The Wilder he brings to us is dapper, impatient, proud of his triumphs and freshly mortified by his goofs, a spontaneous comedic genius in private conversation, an art collector with idiosyncratic but exquisite taste, a sports addict in frequent contact with his bookie, a man subject to the unceasing physical stress of old age who nevertheless shuns the elevator because it might get stuck. There is some decent if not mind-blowing gossip here (surprise: Marilyn Monroe was hard to work with) and lively opinions dished out with the appealing, uncensored honesty of the elderly (Wilder loathed "Titanic," while, admirers might be taken aback to learn, his favorite movie of the 90's is "Forrest Gump").
But mostly "Conversations With Wilder" is devoted to fascinating and detailed discussions of the work, with Crowe gamely playing the humble novice, asking how Wilder did this and that, and Wilder dispensing wise little jewels that add up to an inspired manual on how to write and direct a film. On the art of the voice-over, which Wilder used to such famous, daring effect in "Sunset Boulevard," with its opening shot of William Holden floating dead in a pool -- and talking to the audience -- his advice is always to add to what the viewer is seeing. Wilder the writer likes a well-plotted three-act structure, with one final surprise for a strong ending. Crucial plot points should be introduced quickly, even hidden inside a joke so that the audience doesn't know what it swallowed. Music is good, but never for its own sake. He prefers contemporary, realistic lighting to glamorous chiaroscuro, and he finds most close-ups gratuitous -- though to stroke an actor's ego, he was not above setting up an unloaded camera as a kind of placebo, and pretending to shoot one. "If it does not follow the story," Wilder asks with his charming vestigial European syntax, "why?"
What emerges in this conversation tends to confirm Pauline Kael's suspicion that Wilder didn't always pour his heart into the human story in his films. But pour out his heart he clearly did: there is beauty in his caressing of details, and integrity in his decision to be a quiet, unfussy director, not a show-off like Welles or Hitchcock. He picked up an important lesson early on, he says, from a paragon sophisticate, the German director Ernst Lubitsch: if you say two and two, the audience does not have to be told it's four.
Crowe clearly worships Wilder, and his tender familiarity is the strength of this book. Indeed, his more technical questions reveal such intense personal study that it suddenly hit me how closely "Jerry Maguire" was filmed after the style of Wilder. The sendup of cheery corporate culture recalls "The Apartment." You may recall, too, that Tom Cruise's character, a vain and ambitious sports agent, is saved from perdition by a football player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) so loving and upbeat he is almost monstrous. Trade Cruise for Holden and Gooding's benign monster for Gloria Swanson's hell-bound Norma Desmond, and what do you have? "Sunset Boulevard," with a happy twist: had Wilder written and directed the film, Jerry Maguire might have ended up a corpse, dangling from a stadium skybox.
In his adoration, Crowe sometimes claims too much. Wilder was undoubtedly undervalued for most of his career, but Crowe's advocacy does not prevent this reader, at least, from thinking that these days Wilder's reputation is just a tiny bit on the high side. "The Apartment" is a delight -- groundbreakingly frank, and brilliantly executed -- but for all its internal perfections it is hardly the greatest American comedy, as Crowe seems to want to suggest. For all his freshness, Wilder did sometimes descend into formula; his three-time pairing of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau is partly to blame for one maddeningly durable genre, the grumpy-buddy comedy. And if Wilder is rarely flat-out cold, he can, by his own mischievous admission, be calculating: "Some pictures play wonderfully to a room of eight people," he tells Crowe. "I don't go for that. I go for the masses. I go for the end effect."
Wilder's principled opposition to all forms of phoniness may strike a special chord in these world-weary times, but there is always room -- more than that, there is a need -- for the other kind of artist, who chases after unattainable ideals. Still, his particular genius shines throughout this book. After mistrusting Crowe at first, and firmly dismissing the idea of a book-length project, he grows enthusiastic enough to fuss over the tape recorder and make sure it is capturing his every word. When Crowe becomes too earnest, pressing him to admit that his work is all about the theme of masks and disguises, Wilder grabs the rudder and changes course. And when the interviews drag on for over a year, and Crowe is obviously neglecting his own work, Wilder begins to fear the book will meander (it does, a little). "Let it go," he counsels with a detachment that is healthy, affectionate, anything but cold. Such is his commitment to strong, economical storytelling that he even pitches his own death as a possible finale. Now that is devotion to the craft! Further proof, too, that there is indeed such a thing as inspired irony, and cynicism with a higher purpose.
Its -- his -- name is Billy Wilder.

Reflections on a Ravaged Century
 By Robert Conquest.
 317 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95. 
 How will we remember the 20th century? First and foremost, it was the century of the Three T's: total war, totalitarianism and terror. When did it begin? Make that not 1900, but 1861. With 600,000 dead, more than fell in all of America's other conflicts, the Civil War was really the first war of the 20th century -- a guerre l'outrance, sparing neither cities nor civilians. Save for the airplane, the machinery of mayhem that would grind up Europe in the two world wars was already in place between Harpers Ferry and Appomattox: breech-loading rifles and machine guns, ironclads and submarines, railroads and telegraphs, scorched-earth tactics and bombarded cities.
When did the century end? The monster of total war was chained early -- on
V-J Day. But the other two T's -- totalitarianism and terror -- endured. Having outlived Fascism and Nazism, Soviet Communism would fall only with the Berlin Wall in 1989. And genocide, along with its contemporary variant, ethnic cleansing, continues to thrive, most recently in Rwanda and Kosovo. So whatever wondrous things this century has brought -- the Internet, the microwave, Prozac -- it will stand out as the age of annihilation in the name of tribe, nation, race or class. Consider these gruesome numbers. Regular war has killed 30 million, but this figure pales when compared to the 170 million civilians massacred by states and regimes like the Soviet, German or Chinese ones.
What drove this most murderous of centuries? It wasn't just industrialization and technology as exemplified by the Nazi death factories; deliberate starvation in the ways of Stalin and Mao was even more "productive." Which is why the historian Robert Conquest has justly focused on ideas, on the "ideological frenzy" that gripped so much of the century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, enemies were defeated; in the 20th, they were exterminated in Auschwitz or the killing fields of Cambodia.
"Reflections on a Ravaged Century" is a collection of essays addressing one big question: where did this century go wrong? Conquest, who has written more than a dozen books on the Soviet Union, is a traditional conservative. He quotes with approval the great conservative thinker Michael Oakeshott: ideologues regard government as an "instrument of passion"; for them, "the art of politics is to inflame and direct desire." Woe unto the world when they grab power, for the "conjunction of dreaming and ruling generates tyranny." A liberal polity in the Anglo-American way is the very opposite; its mission is to "restrain, to deflate, to pacify and to reconcile; not to stoke the fires of desire, but to damp them down."
Our century has been the era of ideologues and their apologists. The book's most poignant passages quote from a recent interview with the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm. Had he known back in 1934 that "millions of people are dying in the Soviet experiment," would he have renounced Communism? "Probably not," replied Hobsbawn. And why not? Because "the chance of a new world being born in great suffering would still have been worth backing." So it would have been worth the sacrifice of 15 million, 20 million? "Yes."
This is the quintessential answer of the 20th century, stunning in its cruelty and breathtaking in its navete. The most potent message of Communism and Nazism was of course an idealistic one: final victory over "the enemy," hence liberation from all conflicts, followed by economic plenty with equality and justice for all. Yet there is no such thing as a free society without "contradictions," to recall the Marxian vernacular. The dream of salvation will always end in the nightmare of a faceless, atomized mass cowed and controlled by a behemoth state. Evil means will not produce lofty ends but poison them. This elementary insight of both conservatism and liberalism is the leitmotif of Conquest's essays.
Though wrapping themselves in the emancipatory banner of the Enlightenment, the Communists were no better than the Nazis. Conquest asks us to listen to Ilya Ehrenburg, Stalin's poet laureate, when writing about the kulaks, the smallholders doomed to extinction because they resisted collectivization: "Not one of them was guilty of anything; but they belonged to a class that was guilty of everything." Substitute "Jew" for "kulak," and "race" for "class," and you can hear Heinrich Himmler.
The point is that terror was intrinsic to both totalitarianisms, though many in the West still deny the twinship of Stalinism and Hitlerism. But why fight these old battles again? The ogres have been slain, and democracy is on a roll. For Conquest, the fight is a matter of honor as well as pedagogy. So-called right-wing intellectuals like Conquest (a former British soldier, diplomat and journalist) at Stanford's Hoover Institution, or like Richard Pipes at Harvard did not have an easy time in the academy during the 1970's and 80's, when "anti-Communist" became an epithet and moral judgments about the "evil empire" became, well, "judgmental."
Now, a decade after the empire's demise, and with ever widening access to party and state archives, it turns out that those "cold warriors" were right, while many of their opponents look like unregenerate apologists. Yes, Stalin did want control over Europe and was not just reacting to "American imperialism." The repression was every bit as vicious as Solzhenitsyn had described it in "The Gulag Archipelago." "Really-existing socialism," to recall the jargon, was indeed the "private ownership of the state," as Khristian Rakovsky, a Bolshevik critical of his comrades, already complained in the 1920's.
At 82, Conquest might have been forgiven for striking a triumphalist note. But he has not done so. Drawing on a vast wealth of detail, writing with an almost literary flair that is disappearing from the American academy, Conquest has stressed a moral that bears endless repetition. Though the two totalitarianisms are dead, and the liberal polity (where the state is subservient to the individual) seems to have won, the underlying battle will continue to the very end of humanity.
It is the contest between two conceptions of politics that have vied for the minds of men since the pre-Socratics. One is what Oakeshott calls the "myth of rationalist politics" or the "assimilation of politics to engineering." It is based on the frightful idea that some of us (like Lenin's "vanguard") know what is best for the rest. The task of the leaders, as the Hungarian party chief Janos Kadar pontificated in 1957, "is not to put into effect the wishes and will of the masses. The task of the leaders is to accomplish the interests of the masses."
The mildest version is the paternalistic, "caring" state, say Sweden. It relies not on the K.G.B. and the gulag, but on an ever expanding budget and a bureaucratic class that taxes, disburses and regulates in the name of the collective good. Yet as goodness spreads, so does state power, while autonomy shrinks. The worst version, which has splattered this "ravaged century" with the blood of millions, is Jacobinism, with (in Matthew Arnold's words) its "fierceness and its addiction to an abstract system." If you don't fit, you die.
The other conception is liberal democracy, where the wishes and the will of the masses do matter, where conflict is legitimate, where the state's power is limited, where politics is not an exercise in Procrustean bed building -- off with his feet, or worse. There is no final purpose to history, no perfection, no utopia, and therefore no need for a "New Man" forged in the crucible of the re-education camp.
That fight between top-down expansionist and bottom-up limited government puts Plato, Rousseau and the Red Guards in one corner, Locke, Jefferson and Burke in the other. Who shall decide what is good, just and true? Man or the state, the individual or the collective? Is rational thought possible, or is it just a construct that masks the interests of gender, race or class?
Conquest's answers are as plain as they are spirited. Transcending history, this book is a resolutely intelligent contribution to the culture wars that will stretch into the next century. History is learning about (and perhaps from) the disasters of yesteryear, from ideas that became mindtraps rather than pathways to enlightenment. As the bloodiest of all centuries draws to a close, read these essays, not to weep but to learn how to make the word -- and the world -- safe for liberal democracy.

TWILIGHT
 Losing Sight, Gaining Insight.
 By Henry Grunwald.
 130 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $20. 
 Gifted writers -- Helen Keller is their lodestar -- long have illuminated the dark and silent corners of their blindness or deafness. Rather than submit to their loss, they confront it by studying causes and contemplating consequences. With "Twilight," a slim but splendid memoir, Henry Grunwald, former editor in chief of Time Inc. publications, once United States ambassador to his native Austria and author of the acclaimed "One Man's America: A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His Country," joins their ranks.
Pouring water one day in 1992, Grunwald missed the glass. Age-related macular degeneration, the doctor said. In each eye tiny, fragile blood vessels were growing wild and breaking, scarring the macula, an area a quarter of an inch wide at the center of the retina, the eye's projection screen. There is no cure, and palliatives work only temporarily.
Grunwald whisks the reader through a brief history of the eye, beginning with its evolution from light-sensitive spots on the skin of primitive organisms. In the seventh century B.C., Assyrian eyewash employed the gall of a disemboweled yellow frog mixed in curd. Closer to our time, eye disease helped wreck Napoleon's Egyptian campaign and spurred research in Europe. Not until 1885 was macular degeneration identified, and not until 1970 was it understood. It is not complete sightlessness -- it makes the sufferer see everything through an ever thickening haze. Grunwald could still recognize shapes and colors, but reading had become "the visual equivalent of struggling for breath." Good days and bad alternate: "A paragraph read was a triumph; a sentence undeciphered was a blow." Soon he could no longer read, disastrous for a word-driven person.
Audio books help. He hires readers to record magazines and newspapers on tape. He dictates his own words. But "my books are still more than furniture, but less than the living things they used to be."
Grunwald is candid. Near blindness makes him "restless and moody," he admits, and affects his relations with friends and family. And it foreshadows the dreaded event that eventually overtakes most of us: the moment when the child becomes caregiver to the parent.
But he copes. At New York's Lighthouse for the Blind, his fellow "macular degenerates" help him learn to live with the disease. He crosses busy streets next to women with baby carriages, a sight that thwarts the most aggressive traffic.
He compensates. Always a good listener, as every journalist should be, he learns to hear more attentively than ever before. And he contemplates, dredging his memory for indelible sights, "constructing in my mind a kaleidoscope of the past": a rich world of history, myth and art. Recalling Turner's misty canvases of Venice reminds Grunwald how he sees Venice -- and everything else -- through a veil today. Yet, if properly lighted, "many portraits, like the ones by Titian or Memling, seem to burst out of a fog and seize me with sudden power." (Like any true artist, Grunwald sees not only with eyes but also imagination.) He appreciates unexpected moments of humor, too. In a Chinese restaurant the imposing matre d' with whom Grunwald tries to shake hands turns out to be a large statue of a monkey.
To call writing this book a feat of courage would be to patronize its author; after all, what else could he have done? Henry Grunwald simply weds a graceful, economic prose to a lucid vision of his changed world -- exactly what we would expect from such a distinguished journalist -- and produces a lovely book. In losing his sight, he has reached for light.

The Hours That Make A Student an M.D.

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M. D. 

 BODY:
THE young doctor was reminiscing about his first year out of medical school. "I was chronically in a terribly nervous state," he wrote. "Nearly every case disclosed to me more and more plainly the depth of my ignorance, my utter unpreparedness and incompetence."
He could have been any intern who started working at any teaching hospital in the country last July ("It was mortifying to discover that I lacked the knowledge which every nurse possesses.") He could have been me 18 years ago, or any other doctor at almost any time in history. The emotions an obscure Russian named Vikenty Veressayev detailed in his little-known 1916 classic, "Memoirs of a Physician," are a given in medicine: the panic, self-doubt, profound exhaustion and occasional exhilaration of that first year out. 
 For centuries book-smart youngsters with new diplomas have slunk out of medical school knowing, if they have any sense at all, that they are impostors. A few years later they discover they have turned into doctors. And, for all the tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the alchemy of the transformation remains almost as mysterious as ever.
How many hours does it actually take to make a doctor? This is still one of the big mysteries of the process. Is medical care better delivered by a fatigued young doctor who has been at your bedside 36 hours -- or by a succession of fresh young strangers who work shorter shifts, and have heard about you through the medical equivalent of the game of telephone?
This century has seen a dramatic evolution in medical training from long working hours to shorter ones. Up through World War II, interns and residents in the United States were indentured servants in hospitals, available 24 hours a day. Most received little compensation (except for room and board) along with a free-form education that was shaped by whatever sick patients and senior physicians happened by.
Now their dual roles of worker and student are more precisely defined. As workers, interns and residents get days off and a living wage. As students, they attend lectures and conferences that encompass social and economic aspects of medicine long ignored in medical training. And as indentured servants -- for they continue to work many extra hours for the health care system -- they at least have the satisfaction of knowing that their day-to-day welfare is of more concern to their employers than it used to be.
In the days when interns worked every night or every other night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the 1970's and 1980's 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace, and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.
"Working a double?" a nurse once asked me when she noticed one morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my three years of residency.
A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long, unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at all times.
New York remains the only state where these stipulations are law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All internal medicine training programs are now held to similar standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of accreditation.
Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its member countries.
Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep interns and residents from developing the important instincts those awful long nights hammered in -- a sense of the pace of illness and recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?
THESE details are, of course, the easy part of a medical education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of training -- may they never return -- helped teach us one of the harder lessons too.
Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.
Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all. One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.
But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to make a terrible mistake.
With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened -- and with any luck the lesson will stick even after it is all over.

Judge Dismisses Bias Lawsuit Against CNN

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
Four years ago, CNN hired a veteran journalist, Art Browne, as a senior editor in its New York office. What made the move somewhat unusual for CNN was that Mr. Browne was 59 at the time, had been unemployed for four years and suffered from a neurological condition called essential tremor disorder, which caused his voice, hands and head to shake.
Sixteen months later, Mr. Browne, after being told that his work had been unsatisfactory, was fired. He sued CNN last year, contending that he was dismissed because of his age and his disability. 
 But last Tuesday, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit before trial, saying that Mr. Browne had failed to prove discrimination and that CNN should receive credit for hiring him in the first place.
"It would do disservice," wrote Judge John S. Martin Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan, "to the goals that our antidiscrimination laws are designed to foster if we did not give substantial weight to the fact that CNN hired Browne with full knowledge of his age and disability."
Given the lack of evidence of discrimination, the judge added, were he to allow the suit to proceed, "other companies would, in the future, be reluctant to follow CNN's example and hire someone like Browne."
Maureen S. Binetti, a lawyer for Mr. Browne, said he had no comment, but she criticized the decision, saying, "It's dead wrong."
"The judge ignored critical evidence that we believe mandated the denial of" CNN's motion to dismiss the case, she said, "and it's a shame."
"This person was in this business for four decades," she said, "and I find it incomprehensible that as matter of law, a judge would find that he could not do that particular relatively low-level job when he had tremendous jobs in the business in the past."
CNN described the job Mr. Browne took in October 1995 as one with important responsibilities. Mr. Browne had had a long career in television and radio, working as national editor of ABC News in New York from 1977 to 1981 and later in television news operations in New Haven, Chicago and Washington. CNN hired him as senior futures editor, a job that involved planning beyond the day's news for events throughout the Northeast, CNN said in court papers.
 But his superiors became dissatisfied with his performance, giving him warnings, and in one case, removing him from coverage of the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 after he was found to be "an impediment to coverage," Judge Martin noted in his opinion.
To bolster his discrimination case, Mr. Browne said in legal papers that CNN had replaced him with a 26-year-old "who had fewer years on this planet than plaintiff had doing television news," that almost all of CNN's employees in New York were under 40 and that his superior made derogatory comments about his disability.
But in rejecting various arguments by Mr. Browne that he was a victim of discrimination, Judge Martin said "poor work performance is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to discharge an employee."
A CNN spokesman, David J. Bittler, would say only, "We feel the decision speaks for itself." BENJAMIN WEISER

Class-Action Suit Based On Microsoft Antitrust Case
Lawyers say they will file a class-action suit today against Microsoft on behalf of millions of Californians in the first of what could become a flood of lawsuits springing from the antitrust case against the company.
The suit will accuse Microsoft of using its monopoly in operating systems software to overcharge buyers of Windows 95 and Windows 98. The complaint does not estimate the financial effect to Windows users, but the lawyers bringing the case are seeking a triple-damages award if the suit leads to an eventual finding of financial harm.

Tracking Stock for Excite@Home
The board of Excite@Home has agreed to create a division between its cable and content businesses by establishing a separate tracking stock for the media assets, including the Excite Web portal. C2. 

Bias Suit Against CNN Dismissed
A federal judge in Manhattan has dismissed a discrimination suit against CNN before trial. Art Browne, a senior editor in the network's New York office, contended he was fired after 16 months on the job because of his age -- he was 59 when he was hired -- and because of a disability that caused his voice, hands and head to shake. CNN said his work had been unsatisfactory. C17.
 
Telecom Italia to Keep Mobile Unit
Olivetti and Tecnost, the unit through which Olivetti bought Telecom Italia, said that they had abandoned plans to strip Italy's largest telecommunications company of its profitable mobile phone unit. C2.
 
PepsiCo to Raise Concentrate Price
Following a trend set by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo plans to raise the price it charges its bottlers for concentrate by 7 percent next year. The increase means both soft-drink giants are committed to a key shift in strategy that rejects the volume-at-any-cost model in favor of improved profit margins with less volume. C2.
 
Agreement and Snags for Digital TV
Solving a problem that has been an impediment to digital television, the cable television and consumer electronics industries say they have agreed on a way to connect digital cable boxes to digital TV sets. But the two sides are still sniping at each other over details. C17.
 
Incompletes on Year 2000 Grades
The federal government is going to get a respectable report card when the House subcommittee tracking Year 2000 preparations issues what it calls its final grades today. But the subcommittee has decided not to issue grades for more than 40 vital government programs because many programs dependent on the states and private organizations are not completely ready for the transition. C10.
 
Credibility Code Meets Resistance
The Internet's growing lack of credibility among consumers is beginning to draw more attention. Two organizations -- one grass roots, the other representing industry -- have announced their intentions to bring some balance to a debate that has been lopsided toward unfettered growth at any cost. But it seems that the Internet economy is far more willing to risk consumer rejection than to voluntarily adopt a code of conduct or to reveal too much about how it conducts business.

Software Tool Seeks Low Prices
Web users who like to comparison shop no longer have to click to another site to find better prices. Several companies have developed a new breed of agents -- software tools that work with Web browser software, offering shoppers better deals on whatever goods they happen to be viewing on a Web page.

HEADLINE: Hear, Hear, Please! 'Question Time' in Japan

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The prime minister is at the lectern, struggling to field a series of increasingly challenging questions from the leader of the opposition. Jeers are rising in crescendo from the Parliament floor, and the few spectators allowed in are on the edge of their seats, fairly straining for a view.
The scene, known as question time, has been adopted straight from British politics. On the surface, just two weeks into its existence, it still may seem like a jolting innovation to some in the often soporific world of the Japanese Parliament. 
 Of course that was the idea -- arrived at jointly by the government and the opposition -- from the start: that the Parliament of the nation where consensus is so highly valued that trenchant comment had become an endangered species needed some serious reinvigoration. And what better way, it was thought, than a dose of old-fashioned, British style confrontational debate?
From technology to popular culture, Japan is well known for its facility for borrowing from other countries. Its Parliament was modeled on those of Europe, and foreign models inspired most of this country's modern institutions.
What is less widely known abroad is how assiduously Japan reshapes whatever it borrows, molding everything from Chinese food to American words to fit within the nation's rather narrow comfort zones. And as it is already turning out, question time is no different.
So there was Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, standing tall and tugging at his shirt cuffs for dramatic effect demanding an explanation from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi about why policemen have not been arrested in a provincial corruption case.
Was this the most compelling question to begin the second edition of the new, weekly 40-minute debate? Perhaps not, but it was an improvement over Mr. Hatoyama's first try, a week earlier, when the nation's eyes were bracketed on him as he began the new spectacle by asking Mr. Obuchi what he had eaten for breakfast that morning.
Blunt confrontation, it seems, does not come any more easily to Japanese politicians than it does to ordinary Japanese, whose national language is a maze of well-practiced protocols and polite indirection. But to be fair, Mr. Hatoyama eventually warmed to his subject in the 26 minutes accorded him.
Why did Mr. Obuchi temporarily suspend unpopular tax payments for a national nursing care system just as elections are nearing, Mr. Hatoyama asked. And how was it that the conservative governing party, the Liberal Democrats, had gone into coalition recently with a party widely seen as the creature of the country's largest Buddhist organization?
"This is happening because you share a desire to be ruling parties, not because you have agreed on any policies beforehand," Mr. Hatoyama said. "And you should be ashamed of that." Turning up the heat further, the opposition leader handed Mr. Obuchi a three-year-old pamphlet from the prime minister's own party that denounced the Buddhist-affiliated party as unconstitutional.
Leaning heavily on his lectern, Mr. Obuchi replied weakly: "Around that time that was the mainstream view of the party. But after that we have had some twists and turns."
If that exchange furnished a touch of drama, for those taking part it almost certainly involved little surprise. In the incestuous world of Japanese politics -- again, as in the society at large -- few things are avoided so carefully as surprise.
While politicians' staff members in the United States are responsible for trying to prepare their bosses for every possible question in advance, in Japan the opposition has courteously submitted its questions to the governing party two days in advance of question time.
Much the same thing happened to a foreign journalist when he arrived for an appointment with a government minister here recently. A staff member handed him a list of questions that he suggested be used in the interview. He agreed only hesitantly to answer some others.
What is the purpose of holding a debate at all, one might ask? Still, the new system might be seen as an improvement over the traditional parliamentary debates here in which bureaucrats prepared the questions for both opposition and governing parties, and then sat and answered them solemnly in testimony.
Question time here is meant to remove some of the immense power from a bureaucracy discredited by 10 years of economic drift. And it is intended to give elected politicians more of an air of involvement in running the country instead of just counting money and votes.
Although formally democratic, Japan has been a virtual one-party state for decades, with Mr. Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party making few concessions until its monopoly on power was broken in 1993.
Nowadays, few voters feel strong party affiliation. And many of the country's political leaders look longingly toward the West, where stable two-party systems are common and political identities run deeper.
"The old one-party system has collapsed, and the new party system hasn't yet emerged," said Gerald Curtis, a professor of political science at Columbia University who specializes in Japan. "In the meantime, what can differentiate one party from another in a society that isn't rent by deep cleavages, whether class or primordial issues like ethnicity?
"Just by copying the British in organizational terms doesn't mean that you can copy them in terms of free speech and wit and the skills of parliamentary debate, and that is what question time is all about. What we are left with is personalities."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Clinton, a Renaissance Guy, Paints the Globe Bright

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: FLORENCE, Italy, Nov. 21

 BODY:
It was a long wait, particularly long because the bathrooms were placed off limits for security reasons, long enough even for the Champagne and the caviar canapes to run out, but when President Clinton arrived he quickly wowed a glittering audience with visions of a juster world.
The setting was New York University's Florentine retreat, Villa La Pietra, complete with Donatellos. So it was perhaps inevitable that the president should turn to the fruitful ferment of the Renaissance to illustrate his conviction that a similar era of enriching inventiveness is now being driven by the Internet and a global economy. 
It is late in the presidency, a time when history books come to mind. And it was clear throughout a two-day conference on "Progressive Governance" that began on Saturday night at the Villa La Pietra that he sees an important part of his legacy in the reinvention of center-left politics he has called the Third Way.
The central themes of Clintonian Third-Wayism have become familiar: fiscal discipline in the place of tax-and-spend profligacy; investment in education and new technologies; opportunity for all and responsibility from all.
The vindicating American statistics were liberally showered on Europeans still struggling to generate some growth: lowest unemployment in 30 years, lowest poverty rate in 20, first back-to-back budget surpluses for 40.
"We have, in addition, a much greater opportunity to spread the benefits of this renaissance more broadly than it could have been spread 500 years ago," Mr. Clinton said, adding that achieving this "requires us to go beyond the competing models of Industrial Age politics."
Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister who still has a penchant for the socialist ideas that grew out of the Industrial Age, among them the notion that socialism must be critical of capitalism, was not impressed.
Back resolutely turned, he declined even to look at Mr. Clinton, keeping his chair pointed in the other direction, toward the somewhat bemused visage of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who prefers to call his updated social democracy the New Middle.
Whatever you call the reinvented left, the French do not seem to like it much. Such newfangled gatherings as this Florentine get-together tend to be seen by French Socialists as an insidious trans-Atlantic attempt to take over their preferred global forum, the Socialist International, where Mr. Clinton's Democratic Party does not tread.
Roberto Benigni, the Oscar-winning director of "Life is Beautiful," had no such qualms. Celebrities, of course, are part of the new left's vote-winning package, not least in Hollywood, so Mr. Benigni was there to hear about social democracy's new politics of empowerment and opportunity.
To the evident astonishment of Mr. Blair, he leapt into Mr. Clinton's arms, showering the president with kisses. A slightly red-faced Mr. Clinton then introduced the British prime minister, who shook the Italian actor's hand. Life is indeed beautiful when the Third Way leads to Florence.
 
A Reticent First Lady
So beautiful that John Sexton, the dean of the New York University School of Law, could not resist calling the dinner "a quintessentially global moment," before announcing that the "New York University Global Law School Leadership Award" would be presented to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton rose, walked toward the podium, accepted a small plaque, smiled for the cameras -- and said nothing. A few words from the first lady had been anticipated, and in this land of graciousness, her silence did not go unremarked.
"She thought it would be presumptuous to say anything in front of so many world leaders, and also for her to be the only first lady to speak," said Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to the president. But some present suggested that the fracas over her recent meeting in Israel with Mrs. Arafat had inclined Mrs. Clinton to see wisdom in silence.
Among the other first ladies present was Cherie Blair, whose unexpected pregnancy at the age of 45 has inspired the German popular press to urge the Chancellor -- childless despite four marriages -- to follow the Blairs' example. Doris Schroder, who has opted not to move to Berlin from Hanover, was conspicuous by her absence.
At a meeting much concerned with the aging populations of Europe and the United States -- Mr. Clinton pointed out that during the next 30 years the number of people over 65 in America would double -- the Blairs were complimented by the European Union Commission president, Romano Prodi, for their "heroic efforts" to bolster the active population.
But while agreeing that many challenges like aging populations are shared ones, Europeans and Americans opted to differ over their models of society, with Mr. Prodi saying that Europe must reform but also defend "its social model" and what he called the greater justice and equity of the European welfare state.
 
Globalism Is Kicked Around
There is an optimistic view of globalization among center-left leaders and there is a pessimistic one. The optimists, and they include Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair, say that if the opportunities created by a global economy are well managed, they will benefit mankind and eventually advance equality.
"If you give people access to technology, a lot of smart people figure out how to make a lot of money," Mr. Clinton said, adding that this would be just as true in Africa as it has been in the United States.
The pessimistic school, or at least the cautious one, was led here by Mr. Jospin, with some support from Massimo D'Alema, prime minister of Italy, and the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose country suffered a battering from global financial panic too recently to feel confident.
"There are still huge divides within nations and among nations, and we have to meet this challenge of inequality," Mr. Jospin said today, arguing that modern global capitalism engendered more inequality than the capitalism of the early part of this century. "We have to accept a networked world, but not a world dominated by networks, because then it would be dominated by private interests."
It was Mr. Clinton's turn to look skeptical. Private interests, of course, are what make America tick.
The president and Mr. Blair argued passionately that so long as workers' rights, the environment, and ideals of inclusiveness are not forgotten while an open, global economy is promoted, the fruits of wealth will one day be spread wide.
So long, the president insisted, as fiscal conservatism prevails. "Part of the liberal left program is now to balance the budget," Mr. Clinton said. "We are now the parties of fiscal discipline, because that brings interest rates down, creates jobs, lowers interest rates on mortgages and car loans, and so helps ordinary people."
The post-cold-war world of the left really has changed: fiscal tight-fistedness, the argument now goes, actually helps the poor. Turning to Mr. Cardoso, the president added, "If we all run a surplus, that makes it that much cheaper for Enrique to get money in Brazil."
Simple, really. If only everyone on the center-left understood. But, to judge by the meeting here, not everyone gets Clintonomics.

HEADLINE: Colombia Extradites Drug Suspect to U.S.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
A Colombian accused of running a major heroin smuggling ring was bundled aboard an American government plane in Colombia today and flown to the United States. It is the first time in nearly a decade that Colombia has turned over one of its own citizens to stand trial in this country.
The Clinton administration hailed the extradition of the 30-year-old suspect, Jaime Orlando Lara, the first of 42 drug suspects being held in Colombian jails awaiting transfer to the United States. 
 But it almost certainly means new turmoil for Colombia, the source of most of the cocaine sold on American streets and a fast-growing exporter of heroin to the United States as well.
Colombian drug cartels appear to be beginning a new wave of terrorist attacks in protest over the resumption of extraditions of drug trafficking suspects to the United States.
Two weeks ago, a car bomb killed eight people and wounded scores of others in a fashionable shopping district of Bogota, the capital. The police there said it was a final warning against the extradition of Mr. Lara and the others. Similar violence by the drug traffickers led the Colombian government to halt extraditions in 1991; the last one before today's occurred in 1990.
President Andres Pastrana, who has won praise from the Clinton administration as well as large American aid commitments for his willingness to crack down on the drug trade since he took office last year, defiantly signed Mr. Lara's extradition order only hours after the deadly bombing.
"President Pastrana must be commended for his courage and dedication," said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House director of drug control policy. "Actions such as today's extradition to confront the traffickers will send a powerful and helpful signal."
Terry Parham, the chief spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said that Mr. Lara was "a big deal as far as being a major trafficker" but that "the bigger deal is the resumption of the extradition process" by Colombia. "This is very positive for law enforcement," he said.
Mr. Pastrana has formally authorized the extradition of two other suspects wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges: a Cuban, Bravilo Gonzalez, and a Venezuelan, Fernando Jose Flores.
Prosecutors hope that Mr. Flores will prove to be a valuable witness against the leadership of the now-defunct Cali cocaine cartel.
Mr. Lara, who was flown initially from Bogota to Fort Lauderdale on the way to New York, is wanted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan on charges that he conspired to smuggle large amounts of heroin into the United States and distribute it here.
Law enforcement officials have charged that at one point his family-run smuggling ring exported 25 pounds of heroin a week into the United States through distribution points in New York, Houston and Miami, usually by hiding it in commercial airliners, sometimes in passengers' luggage. Mr. Lara's two sisters were arrested in the United States earlier this year.
Colombian police spokesmen were quoted in Bogota as saying Mr. Lara was in handcuffs this morning when he was placed aboard a twin-engine Cessna plane owned by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The spokesmen said the heavily guarded suspect, dressed in jeans and sneakers, had not said a word as he walked the 60 feet across the tarmac to the plane.
Acting on an American request, the Colombian police captured Mr. Lara in Bogota last December.
American law enforcement officials say he fled the United States in July after his sisters were arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Immigration records, the officials say, show that he left Colombia 29 times between August 1991 and July of last year.
The Clinton administration is piecing together a major economic and military aid package for Colombia intended to support Mr. Pastrana's government as it struggles with a thriving drug trade, a leftist guerrilla insurgency, right-wing paramilitary forces fighting the guerrillas and an economic crisis.
But the aid package, worth as much as $1.5 billion over the next three years, is inducing reservations even among some in the administration, who fear that the United States is being drawn too deeply into a civil conflict that has left tens of thousands of Colombians dead in the last four decades.
But administration officials say they are desperate to find a way to stem the flood of Colombia cocaine -- as well as heroin that is transshipped through Colombia -- into the United States. The Central Intelligence Agency estimated last year that Colombia might have produced as much as 188 tons of cocaine from its own crop, up from 88 tons in 1995.

HEADLINE: Thanksgiving Message

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's Thanksgiving Day proclamation:
Thanksgiving 1999
 
By the President of the United States of America
Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound by a common desire for liberty, a small band of Pilgrims sought out a place in the New World where they could worship according to their own beliefs. Surviving their first harsh winter in Massachusetts and grateful to a merciful God for a sustaining harvest, the men and women of Plymouth Colony set aside three days as a time to give thanks for the bounty of their fields, the fruits of their labor, the chance to live in peace with their Native American neighbors and the blessings of a land where they could live and worship freely. 
 We have come far on our American journey since that early Thanksgiving. In the intervening years, we have lived through times of war and peace, years of poverty and plenty, and seasons of social and political upheaval that have shaped and forever changed our national character and experience. As we gather around our Thanksgiving tables again this year, it is a fitting time to reflect on how the events of our rich history have affected those we care about and those who came before us. As we acknowledge the past, we do so knowing that the individual blessings for which we give thanks may have changed, but our gratitude to God and our commitment to our fellow Americans remain constant.
Today we count among our national blessings a time of unprecedented prosperity, with an expanding economy, record low rates of poverty and unemployment among our people, and the limitless opportunities to improve the quality of life that new technologies present to us. We can give thanks today that for the first time in history, more than half the world's people live under governments of their own choosing. And we remain grateful for the peace and freedom America continues to enjoy thanks to the courage and patriotism of our men and women in uniform.
But the spirit of Thanksgiving requires more than just an acknowledgment of our blessings; it calls upon us to reach out and share those blessings with others. We must strive to fulfill the promise of the extraordinary era in which we live and enter the new century with a commitment to widen the circle of opportunity, break down the prejudices that alienate us from one another and build an America of understanding and inclusion, strong in our diversity, responsible in our freedom and generous in sharing our bounty with those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 1999, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of the United States to assemble in their homes, places of worship or community centers to share the spirit of fellowship and prayer and to reinforce the ties of family and community; to express heartfelt thanks to God for the many blessings He has bestowed upon us; and to reach out in true gratitude and friendship to our brothers and sisters in the larger family of humankind.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-fourth.
 WILLIAM J. CLINTON

HEADLINE: Protesting War School for Foreigners

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: FORT BENNING, Ga., Nov. 21

 BODY:
In a small classroom inside a pink building on this historic Army post, Maj. Pablo Friedrich is learning the art of war.
A bearish marine from Colombia, he will spend nine weeks here studying tactical manuals translated into Spanish from the books used by American officers. Then he will return home as deputy commander of a marine battalion in Cartagena, rejoining Colombia's civil war against guerrillas and drug traffickers. 
 Whether he returns as a more professional soldier infused with American military values or as one trained to wage a more efficient war of repression is the question at the heart of a roiling national debate over this training center, the Army's School of the Americas.
Over the weekend, thousands of protesters led by a Roman Catholic priest gathered at Fort Benning's main gate just outside Columbus for the annual protest to demand the closing of the school, the nation's main training center for Latin American military and police officers for more than 50 years.
Today, a funereal procession of 3,100 protesters marched onto the post, led by several dozen dressed in black robes and white masks and carrying wooden coffins they said represented those killed by graduates of the school. In a peaceful, carefully choreographed confrontation, the Army stopped them after nearly a mile, put them on buses and drove them off the post. Sixty-fiveprotesters were detained and given citations barring them from Fort Benning for three years.
"You don't teach democracy anywhere by training the military," said Joe Morton, 63, a professor at Goucher College near Baltimore, moments before he boarded a bus at the post. "Students who come here are going to go back to their countries and shoot people like us."
Last week, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera announced plans to make significant changes to the school's curriculum in hopes of muting growing opposition, especially in Congress, which nearly voted to close the school this fall. But the plans failed to win over the most fervent opponents. "We are not here to transform this school," the Rev. Roy L. Bourgeois, the priest who has organized the opposition, told protesters on Saturday. "We are here -- and we need to make this clear -- to close this school."
A visit to the school and the protests suggest that this has become a debate about how the United States will work with Central and South American militaries after the tumultuous, sometimes violent engagement of the past, when Washington overlooked abuses in the name of fighting leftist insurgencies.
"This place has become an abstraction to the people out there," the school's commandant, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, said on Friday, as the first protesters assembled at the gate.
Mr. Caldera and other officials have strongly defended the school and its mission, which they say is to promote modern, professional militaries that respect democracy and human rights. Mr. Caldera said the changes would enhance that, training Latin American officers to cope with today's problems, including drug trafficking and disasters.
"These are legitimate security interests that they have," Mr. Caldera said in an interview.
He said the school's critics were "willfully ignorant," slurring the reputation of the Army with accusations that the school has encouraged violence against civilians.
"We don't teach American soldiers to violate human rights," Mr. Caldera said, "and we don't teach soldiers of any foreign countries to violate human rights."
The debate has become so polarizing, the oratory so extreme, that it overshadows the teaching that goes on inside the old headquarters of the Army's Infantry School.
Founded in Panama in 1946 and relocated here in 1984, the school still offers purely military courses in skills like basic combat and flying helicopters. But since the end of the cold war, its focus has shifted. Its catalog now includes courses on computers, medical care and more mundane matters of organizing a professional military. Students today spend more time in the classroom than on Fort Benning's firing ranges.
Major Friedrich, whose father was a German U-boat sailor who immigrated to Colombia after World War II, arrived with four captains from his country and another from Mexico for a course on how to plan a defense against a hypothetical invasion. Consulting Army manuals and scrawling with markers on maps and charts tacked to the wall, they plotted each step of the "battle" with occasional nudging from their Army instructor, Maj. Jaime F. Llinet.
Major Friedrich said the course was valuable, exposing him to the latest in American war tactics. "We believe it is the most advanced doctrine in the world," he said.
In its history, the school has trained 61,000 students from 23 countries. Today, only students from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti are ineligible. The State Department pays students' expenses and screens applicants for accusations of abuses. The school trains about 800 students a year in courses that last from two weeks to 12 months.
In noncombat classes, up to a third of the students are civilians, like Maria Gonzalez Vila, a lawyer with Uruguay's defense ministry. She just completed a five-week course called Resource Management. Under Mr. Caldera's plan, the school would increase slots for civilians.
In recent years, the Army has also added training on human rights. The busiest lecturer on the staff of 288 is the erudite Army lawyer who teaches international humanitarian law, Maj. Antonio Raimondo.
Even those who come for as little as two weeks receive eight hours of lessons on human rights. The officers who attend the yearlong "Command and General Staff Course" sit through 40 hours. And there is an annual "Human Rights Week," which in February will include a study of the American massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War and a tour of Andersonville, the Confederate prison camp, whose commander was the only officer hanged for war crimes after the Civil War.
Colonel Weidner said the graduates who went on to commit abuses were the exceptions. By the opponents' own count, he said, only 300 to 500 of the school's 61,000 students have been linked to atrocities, in some cases years after they attended short courses. Those few, he added, are the ones who did not learn the lessons taught here. "We feel betrayed by them," he said.
Critics view the emphasis on human rights, like the proposed changes, as an obfuscation. The school's core is and will be military training, they say, perpetuating the militaries' disproportionate role in Latin American democracies.
"I've heard the reform line before," said Heather A. Dean, a protest organizer. "And while they have made some reforms, the bread and butter is still combat training."
The protests at Fort Benning began 10 years ago with only a handful of opponents, led by Father Bourgeois, a Navy veteran who has been deeply involved in Latin American causes since serving as a missionary in Bolivia in the 1970's. Since then the protests have grown, even as the crimes committed by the school's graduates recede into the past. "It's not for them to say when it is time to forgive," Father Bourgeois said of the Army's insistence that the school has moved on from its cold-war role.
Last year, more than 5,000 people attended the November protest. This year, the Columbus police estimated that there were 8,000, the largest gathering of people in the city since it played host to women's softball in the 1996 Olympics. The protest has become such an event that the city's tourism bureau this year helped arrange hotel accommodations.
To the school's instructors, the placards depicting blood and graves and invariably referring to the "School of the Assassins" have become uncomfortably personal attacks. Several singled out remarks by a leading Congressional critic, Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, who last week dismissed the planned changes as "putting perfume on a toxic dump."
"If this is a trash dump, then I'm the trash," said Major Llinet, the instructor. A 19-year veteran, he pointed defiantly, defensively to a patch on his shoulder that he earned for serving in the Persian Gulf war.
"I am not an assassin," he added. "I'm a good old Army guy."
Major Llinet, who was a military trainer in Venezuela, said he agreed with some of the protesters' underlying concerns. He spoke of "social injustice" in Latin America, particularly the economic disparities that leave the poor mired in hardship and the elite, often including the militaries, in control. But he said the school's training served a valuable purpose by promoting regional stability, encouraging democracy and minimizing the possibility of American military intervention, the very thing the protesters oppose most.
"Maybe we don't have to send American forces to Latin America because of the students who came here," Major Llinet said. "If we close the school, maybe we're going to have to go back to the interventionist policies of Teddy Roosevelt, because when there is a security threat in Latin America, you know we're going to be there."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Faces A Class Action On 'Monopoly'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Lawyers say they will file a class-action suit against Microsoft today on behalf of millions of Californians, in the first of what could become a flood of major lawsuits springing from the Justice Department's antitrust action against the company.
The suit, to be filed by three longtime class-action lawyers, will accuse Microsoft of using its monopoly in operating systems software to overcharge buyers of Windows 95 and Windows 98. The complaint does not estimate the financial impact to Windows users, but the lawyers are seeking triple damages if the suit leads to an eventual finding of financial harm. 
 The suit marks the beginning of what legal experts say could be a wave of private litigation against Microsoft. The prospect could put additional pressure on the company to settle the antitrust case and thereby lessen its financial risks by avoiding a final ruling with its findings of law.
The big software maker's vulnerability to private suits increased sharply earlier this month when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his findings of fact in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft. Judge Jackson concluded that Microsoft is a monopoly whose anticompetitive acts have stifled innovation and harmed consumers.
Unlike conclusions of law, a judge's findings of fact in a federal antitrust case are not generally considered admissible as evidence in private suits. But Judge Jackson's findings agreed so strongly with the case presented by the Justice Department and 19 states that antitrust experts say his final verdict, expected early next year, will almost surely find that Microsoft is a monopoly that violated the law.
Typically, only a final ruling can be used as evidence in other cases. But a judge's fact findings and final ruling are ordinarily issued at the same time. Judge Jackson took the unusual step of separating his findings of fact from his findings of law, which gave his fact findings greater importance.
Still, legal experts say Microsoft will surely challenge any attempt by class-action lawyers to build a case on the findings of fact alone.
The bigger financial threat to Microsoft may come not from corporate suits, in fact, but from class actions on behalf of the millions of users of the company's industry-standard Windows operating system. Such consumer suits, legal experts say, have the potential to cost Microsoft hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even billions, in damage claims.
"This is the start of the race to get to the courthouse," observed Stephen Axinn, a partner in Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider who is an antitrust litigator. "It could be like the tobacco litigation, in the sense that you have lots of plaintiffs' lawyers in different states sharing information."
Reducing the financial risk from such litigation, according to legal experts, should be a powerful incentive for Microsoft to seek an out-of-court settlement in the government case. The chances of a settlement appeared to increase last Friday when Judge Jackson appointed Richard A. Posner, a federal appeals court judge and leading antitrust scholar, as mediator in settlement talks between Microsoft and the Justice Department and the states.
"The prospect of a flood of private follow-on cases -- with their triple damages in private antitrust cases -- are lawsuits with potentials that Microsoft simply cannot ignore," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
Yet, publicly at least, Microsoft insists that its risk from private antitrust suits is exaggerated. "That litigation is something we're prepared to defend and defend aggressively, if necessary," said Tom Burt, a Microsoft lawyer.
In consumer class actions, legal experts say, Microsoft has defenses that will lessen its potential liability and present formidable obstacles for plaintiffs. For example, most computer users do not purchase Windows directly from retail software stores in shrink-wrapped boxes. Generally, the operating system is already loaded on computers when they are purchased. An estimated 90 percent of Windows 98 users got it preloaded on new machines.
The legal significance is that a 1977 Supreme Court ruling -- the Illinois Brick Company v. the State of Illinois -- declared that indirect purchasers of goods could not recover damages in class-action antitrust cases.
Since 1977, however, 18 states including California and New York have passed laws allowing indirect purchasers to qualify for triple damages in antitrust class actions.
And while Judge Jackson's findings do provide a road map for plaintiffs' lawyers, there remains a lot to prove in court. Judge Jackson, for example, found that Microsoft has a monopoly, but he did not say precisely when it achieved monopoly status. He found consumers were harmed by Microsoft, but the class-action lawyers must put a figure on how much users were overcharged.
"The econometrics on damages will be very complex," Mr. Axinn said. "There's no question that Microsoft has some good cards to play on defense."
Still, Judge Jackson provided class-action lawyers with some tantalizing details. In asserting that consumers may have paid more for Windows than they would have in a competitive market, he cited a Microsoft study suggesting possible prices of $49 and $89 for the retail upgrade to Windows 98. Microsoft chose to charge $89, which the study identified as the "revenue maximizing" price.
"That portion of the judge's findings was an invitation to a class-action lawsuit," said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution.
Microsoft replies that the November 1997 study was garden-variety pricing analysis. Trying to estimate an optimal, or revenue maximizing, price is something that every consumer product company routinely does for each of its offerings.
The judge's discussion of the Microsoft pricing study, according to Terry Gross of Gross & Belsky in San Francisco, is "a clear marker." But, he said, it is mainly the overall drift of Judge Jackson's findings that provides a solid starting point for the class-action suit he and his colleagues are filing.
"Throughout the judge's findings," Mr. Gross said, "he makes it clear that all Windows users were harmed by paying too high a price for Windows."
The class action, which the lawyers plan to file in California Superior Court in San Francisco today, does not specify the number of members in the class of both individual and corporate users of Windows. But Mr. Gross estimated that number in California as "at least 10 million," and he said the suit covers Windows users since the introduction of Windows 95. The complaint does not estimate the financial damage to Windows users in California.
Earlier this month, a small New York advertising company that purchased Windows, Seastrom Associates Ltd., sued Microsoft and sought class-action status to represent thousands of similar corporate customers in New York State.
But to take on Microsoft in a class action, legal experts say, will require experience, skill and resources. They note that the three lawyers behind the California suit -- Mr. Gross, Daniel J. Mogin of San Diego, and Francis O. Scarpulla of San Francisco -- are state class-action lawyers who have worked for two decades on antitrust cases involving products ranging from snack foods to tires.
"There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done," Mr. Mogin said. "We have to quantify and prove actual damages that consumers suffered."
The lawyers say they will continue their litigation even if the federal case is settled out of court. Judge Jackson's findings of fact alone, they insist, ease the way for suits like theirs.
"A settlement in the government's case wouldn't make our case go away," Mr. Gross said. "We still have these findings that Microsoft is a monopoly that abused its power by overcharging consumers."

HEADLINE: Neighbors Give Central Park a Wealthy Glow

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
By passing the hat among its neighbors, who happen to be America's most densely packed bunch of rich people, Central Park has harvested the largest haul of private dollars ever raised for a public park.
As is obvious to the 20 million people who enter the park every year, this bumper crop of philanthropy, $233 million so far, has done a world of good. The graffiti-smeared ruin that was an international embarrassment two decades ago has been reborn as a meticulously restored greensward where bronze-preservation specialists each year polish and wax all 50 of the park's statues. 
 What is far less obvious is how this happened.
To exploit the giving habits of New York's elite, the park reinvented itself as an elite cultural charity. It has become a player in the most exclusive social ritual in town, shrewdly capitalizing on unwritten rules about how the rich must give to one another's pet causes or face social ostracism.
Less obvious still is the profound effect that Central Park has had on other urban parks not encircled by multimillionaires. Park advocates across New York admit they resent Central Park's phenomenal success, but nevertheless copy its management and fund-raising methods.
"There is something healthy even in envy," said Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who created the Central Park Conservancy 20 years ago and ran it for 16 years.
The conservancy has become the dominant model, in New York and across the country, for groups trying to revive crumbling urban parks, said Chris Walker, director of community and economic development for the Urban Institute in Washington.
"It is almost impossible to discuss park restoration in the United States without discussing Central Park," he said.
People who live near some of New York City's most troubled parks are imitating the conservancy. Around Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem, neighbors are raising money from local businesses, hospitals and developers. They have recruited volunteers to clean up the park and plant flowers. A gardener trained in Central Park will soon begin working in their park, his salary paid by a private grant.
Those who live near Marcus Garvey say they are painfully aware of the demographic chasm that separates them from the people who live around Central Park. Their October fund-raising dinner raised $7,000. The Central Park Conservancy's Halloween ball raised $805,000.
"We do not have much money, but we are getting organized as a pressure group," said Helen Murray, a retired nurse who lives in a brownstone next to the park. "Central Park is a model that gives us a very high standard to work for."
Neither imitation nor envy, though, can conjure up the fuel that powers Central Park: private money donated in huge chunks. The rebirth of the park, as much as anything, is a story about why the wealthy give in New York.
As major park donors themselves explain, the rich tend to give to what they know and to what gives them personal satisfaction. It is no accident that many of the park's largest benefactors can monitor the fruit of their giving from their apartment windows.
Eighty percent of the nearly quarter-billion dollars that has been donated to the park in the last two decades has come from about 20 percent of the conservancy's donors, according to conservancy officials, who said that hundreds of the largest donors live within a block of the park.
"The park is visible, you can touch it, you can partake of it, you can brag about it, you can see the difference your money makes," said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets. He is a member of the conservancy's board and a major donor, and lives half a block from the park.
Richard Gilder, a stockbroker who grew up playing in Central Park and now lives beside it on Fifth Avenue, has given the park $17 million, which is believed to be the largest gift from any individual to any municipal park.
"It is a natural for people who live near the park," Mr. Gilder said. "It is upbeat. There are so few things you can give money to that aren't in desperate shape."
Social considerations also figure strongly for donors. Although the conservancy is a relative arriviste among the city's charities, it has staked out a status niche that puts it roughly on a par with the Museum of Modern Art or Carnegie Hall, which is to say only slightly less chic than the Metropolitan Museum of Art, several philanthropists said.
The rich say they give to elite charities to advance their social standing, make business contacts and get invitations to charity benefits, according to research done by Francie Ostrower, an associate professor of sociology at Harvard who interviewed 88 New York philanthropists in the 1990's.
The Central Park Conservancy has used its social cachet to leverage donations, said Timothy M. Thompkins, director of Partnership for Parks, which raises money for city parks other than Central Park.
"There is a bit of a herd mentality," he said.
About 1,200 members of that herd gather each spring for Central Park's premier social and fund-raising event: a luncheon in the Conservatory Garden sponsored by the conservancy's women's committee.
"It is really the envy of the world," said Phyllis Cerf Wagner, a founding member of the women's committee, which itself has raised $30 million. "Last year we raised $2 million."
Part of the reason for the luncheon's success is its timing.
"It is in May," Mrs. Wagner said. "Everyone has new spring clothes. They have new hats."
Another reason is Mrs. Wagner herself. As the widow of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner and of Bennett Cerf, the co-founder of Random House, she has friends among the political, publishing and philanthropic elite.
"You don't say no to Phyllis Wagner and end up with that many teeth to talk about it," Mr. Gilder said fondly.
Mrs. Wagner invented the park's adopt-a-bench program, which has led to the endowment of 600 park benches, at $5,000 for a standard bench and $25,000 for a rustic handmade model. Four hundred trees also have been endowed, at $1,000 for a sapling and $25,000 for a "historic tree."
"Pretty soon we will be down to blades of grass," Mrs. Wagner said.
Things were different in the late 1970's, when Central Park was "a disaster zone," in the words of Gordon Davis, then commissioner of parks. The city's fiscal crisis had cut spending on parks by nearly two-thirds, and Central Park had lost about half its work force. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan called Commissioner Davis, told him that the park was a "national disgrace" and threatened a federal takeover.
Casting about for a way to rescue the park, Mr. Davis concluded that the only way to revive it was to find one person to run it. He settled on Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who had written a book on Frederick Law Olmsted, the principal designer of Central Park.
"When I named Betsy administrator of Central Park, she had no money and no power," Mr. Davis said.
She did, however, have a simple and, as it turned out, profoundly powerful idea. She decided the park should be a cultural institution, rather like the Metropolitan Museum. "The trees and the monuments and the gardens are our collection," she said.
It was an easy sell. The park was bordered by many thousands of the country's richest people, many of whom had strong emotional and financial reasons for resuscitating it. Dr. Ostrower's research found that New York's philanthropic elite gave most of its money to colleges and arts institutions. "With striking frequency, these gifts went to precisely the kinds of educational and cultural organizations that are used by, and have prestige among, the elites," Dr. Ostrower wrote in "Why the Wealthy Give: The Culture of Elite Philanthropy" (Princeton University Press, 1995).
A stumbling block for the conservancy, though, was getting to corporate executives. The park needed a rainmaker, someone whose calls would always be returned. Such a man, William S. Beinecke, happened to live in a penthouse apartment on 79th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, with a splendid view of the park.
Mr. Beinecke, who had just retired as chairman and chief executive at Sperry & Hutchinson Company, remembers he was "shocked" by the park's appearance and agreed to be the conservancy's first board chairman.
His C.E.O. credentials worked like a passkey, Mr. Beinecke recalled, and he had no trouble gaining access to top executives at corporations like Morgan Stanley and American Express. He found that the closer executives lived to Central Park, the more closely they listened.
"I didn't make a pitch for money," said Mr. Beinecke, who merely recruited members for the conservancy's board. But board members were later urged to give to the park and to pressure their peers to do likewise.
The philanthropic money machine shifted into high gear in the mid-1980's when the conservancy recruited Henry R. Kravis, the billionaire leveraged-buyout specialist. He was the principal mover as the conservancy raked in $65 million during the 1980's.
Requests for money from Mr. Kravis, who has given tens of millions of dollars to New York charities, could not be ignored, several donors said.
"If he helps your charity, then you must help his," said Howard J. Rubenstein, a multimillionaire who heads a public relations firm, serves on the conservancy board and lives on Fifth Avenue. "In the upper echelons of millionaire's row, it is almost like a trade."
The conservancy's Halloween ball was held this year in a vast tent in Central Park and attended by 615 masked and costumed revelers. Among them was Ian Smith, the new chairman of the conservancy board and chief executive of Marsh & McClennan Companies.
Before dinner, as guests watched young actors sheathed in black fabrics perform as creatures of the night, Mr. Smith explained that "a lot of the people who care about Central Park have unlimited ambition for it. They would like to see everything perfect."
The morning after the party that raised $805,000, Elizabeth Cook, the executive director of the Park Council, a 90-year-old nonprofit that is critical of the city's reliance on private money for the parks, said that she was impressed that the conservancy had raised so much money but was concerned that all of it went to just one park.
"I wish that the wealthy who give so generously to Central Park would give equally to the rest of the park system," said Ms. Cook, who did not attend the party. "We are concerned that this is creating a two-tiered park system in New York City; one rich, one not. The city's growing dependence on private money makes it very difficult for communities that don't have strong leadership to compete and raise private funds for their parks."
Ms. Cook also complained about the citywide implications of the management contract that the conservancy signed last year with the city. The contract guarantees that the city will provide $1 million a year for Central Park, if the conservancy raises $5 million. If it raises more, the city must match half, up to a maximum city contribution of $2 million a year.
"It gives Central Park protection against city budget cuts; as long as the conservancy meets its fund-raising obligations under the contract, it is protected from reductions in city support," she said. "Other parks are not similarly protected."
City parks officials heatedly dismiss Ms. Cook's criticism, saying the city can cancel the contract whenever it wants. They also say Central Park is a model of professional management that other parks can imitate.
"A rising tide lifts all boats," said Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner. "If one park in New York City is world class, it creates pressure for other parks to improve their standards."
Other New York parks are improving in part because of the Central Park model, but they are limited by the fact that they are not surrounded by so many rich people. The Prospect Park Alliance in Brooklyn raises about $2 million a year from private donors. Still, it lags far behind the Central Park Conservancy, which raises about $15 million a year.
"There is resentment," said a parks department official at Prospect Park who did not want to be identified by name. "It is mostly about the rich people in Manhattan and how they can afford to make their park beautiful, and why won't the city put in the money to make our park nice, too."
The city's record of support this decade for parks other than Central Park is mixed.
It has cut the number of park employees by more than half, from 4,507 in 1990 to 2,190 this year. Central Park has been relatively insulated from the city cuts because the conservancy pays about 80 percent of the park's employees.
Across the city, though, the impact of these cuts has been largely mitigated by the assignment of nearly 5,000 workfare employees to work in parks. There is widespread agreement that the parks are cleaner and in better repair than they have been in decades.
As for Central Park itself, a few restive members on the board of the conservancy believe that since the park is almost completely refurbished, the conservancy should take its act on the road.
"We should have a loftier goal for ourselves," said Mr. Gilder, who has been lobbying the conservancy board to shift some of its expertise and fund-raising ability to Morningside Park in Harlem.
The idea of spreading the wealth, however, is not yet popular among most conservancy donors, who as a rule do not give to charities that support other city parks.
Besides, with Central Park having been elevated to such a rarefied standard, donors are worried about the soaring cost of maintenance. Next year, the cost of the nearly complete restoration work at the North Meadow will by itself add $450,000 to the conservancy's annual budget.
"How are we going to meet our ongoing costs?" asked Karen Putnam, the conservancy's president. "We are not to the point where we can put our feet on the desk and take on another park. We have our hands full."

HEADLINE: A Homeless Man Challenges New York City Crackdowns

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Even before New York's police commissioner pledged last week to arrest homeless people who persist in sleeping on sidewalks, a homeless Army veteran who has improvised a bed on the city's streets for a decade was quietly trying to stop him through the courts.
In some ways the veteran, Augustine Betancourt, 33, is an unlikely legal adversary. But nobody knows better that the announced police tactic is not new. Nobody more clearly illustrates its mixed results. 
 Almost three years ago, on the cold night of Feb. 27, 1997, Mr. Betancourt tucked himself into cardboard and fell asleep on a bench in a small park across the street from the Criminal Courts building in Lower Manhattan. About 1:30 a.m., he was awakened by two police officers. And for the first time in his life, he was arrested.
"Direct order from Giuliani," an officer told Mr. Betancourt before taking him to jail, according to court affidavits. "You're not supposed to be sleeping here."
Mr. Betancourt, a slight, soft-spoken man who has shunned most social interaction since his honorable discharge in 1987, was strip-searched, held for 27 hours and handed a summons. The ticket, on an obscure sanitation code violation -- one of several ordinances typically used by the police to arrest or ticket the homeless -- turned out to be invalid.
But in Betancourt v. Giuliani, a little-noticed 1997 federal class-action lawsuit now nearing a conclusion, Mr. Betancourt and the lawyer he found in a soup kitchen's legal clinic have mounted a small but significant challenge to police crackdowns on the homeless.
The lawsuit contends that he and all 25 others in the park area the same night were falsely arrested in a police sweep for violating a sanitation ordinance that was impermissibly vague, and only a pretext for punishing the homeless. It asks that the police be barred from using the ordinance as a tool for making targets of the homeless.
The city argues that the arrests were legitimate and necessary to reclaim the area near the Criminal Courts building from debris left by homeless people who had rejected earlier offers of shelter.
Mr. Betancourt is still homeless. But now he sleeps in an alley not far from the park, hidden in a cardboard box. And since he was dropped from the welfare rolls three years ago for failing to appear for a work assignment, he will not qualify for a shelter bed if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani succeeds in his other effort to tackle homelessness: enforcing state regulations that make work and all other welfare rules conditions of shelter.
"The years I spent out in the street, people watch me collect cans or kids laugh when they see me at night getting into a cardboard box, I've never felt insulted or less than human," Mr. Betancourt, who won a merit award as a soldier, said in a deposition. "But incarcerated, I felt deprived of humanity."
Even if it was a mistake to arrest Mr. Betancourt under a sanitation statute that makes it unlawful to leave "any box, barrel, bale of merchandise or other movable property" in a public place -- the district attorney declined to prosecute the case -- the city contends that he still could have been legitimately arrested for other reasons.
A 1996 police manual for carrying out such sweeps, "Quality of Life Enforcement Options: A Police Reference Guide," lists 35 offenses that can prompt an arrest, including camping in the park without a permit and being present after the official 1 a.m. closing time.
Last week, after a Midtown office worker was left in critical condition by a random attack that may have been committed by a homeless man, Mayor Giuliani promised to renew such crackdowns. He dismissed any civil liberties opposition to his plan as romanticism that did the homeless no favors.
"Streets do not exist in civilized societies for the purpose of people sleeping there," the mayor said. "Bedrooms are for sleeping."
Police Commissioner Howard Safir seconded his remarks, declaring that if homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks refuse help from the police and then "don't obey, we're going to arrest them."
For city lawyers defending against the Betancourt suit, the remarks came at an awkward moment. Mr. Betancourt's lawyer Doug Lasdon, who directs the nonprofit Urban Justice Center, with lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who are donating their time, have argued that the Giuliani administration has transformed administrative ordinances into anti-vagrancy laws in a bid to outlaw homelessness.
The city has responded in legal papers that there is no police policy aimed at the homeless. In September 1997, the city successfully opposed the plaintiffs' demand for a preliminary injunction that would have temporarily barred such enforcement of the sanitation ordinance, arguing in part that Mr. Betancourt and his fellows had not established that they were at risk of being arrested again.
Last week, the plaintiffs asked the court to bar the city immediately from such enforcement of the ordinance. Judge John S. Martin of Federal District Court in Manhattan could rule early next year.
Police depositions in the case open a rare window on the broad discretion an ordinance can afford. One officer testified that a person sitting on a park bench with a coat around the shoulders would be in violation of the section, but would not be in violation if the coat were zipped.
Another testified that a person sitting beside a newspaper that was "touching their body" would not violate the code, but the person could be arrested if the same newspaper was "one inch away."
Throughout the city's history, officials have periodically enforced vagrancy laws that blurred the line between poverty and criminality. In "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898" (Oxford University Press, 1999), Mike Wallace and Edwin G. Burrows describe how early in the 19th century, vagrancy laws were used for street roundups "at the behest of merchants and shopkeepers determined to improve New York's business climate by scouring away peddlers, scavengers, beggars and potential criminals."
In the 1870's and again in the 1890's, an increase in street begging and pauperism that historians attribute to economic dislocations led reformers to discontinue or tighten municipal poor relief, and to step up enforcement of vagrancy statutes, arresting and locking up "tramps" and sending them to workhouses.
A series of high court rulings from the 1950's through the 1970's invalidated the old vagrancy laws. In a recent case, in 1995, the United States District court in Manhattan ruled that people arrested or ejected from Pennsylvania Station by the Amtrak police for "hanging out" there had been deprived of their constitutional rights.
Like people in cities around the country, many New Yorkers went from compassion to exasperation about the homeless in the 1980's. Despite the city's uniquely far-reaching right to shelter, established by advocates through court rulings in 1981, there seemed to be disheveled figures huddling on every Manhattan sidewalk grate in 1987, when Mr. Betancourt returned to New York after three years in the Army.
He soon stopped contact with his elderly immigrant parents, who were unaware, he said, of the deep depression and anxiety attacks that had overwhelmed him in adolescence. His jobs as kitchen helper or stock clerk grew scarcer after the stock market crash, and in 1988 he lost his room in a cheap hotel.
Turning to the city's shelter system, he was placed in the Franklin Armory in the Bronx, where about 600 men, many mentally ill or addicted to drugs, slept on a drill floor. He found the street less frightening. Someone helped him obtain public assistance in 1992, about $100 every two weeks. But he was one of thousands dropped from the rolls when the city instituted a strict workfare requirement in August 1996.
In a sense, Mr. Betancourt did become more self-reliant, though not as city welfare officials had envisioned: he dug himself deeper into a solitary groove of life bound by the schedules of soup kitchens and shower programs, coping with his constant anxiety by killing time in libraries and bookstores, paring down his needs to what would fit in a small book bag, and hunting nightly for cardboard to make his bed.
"It's the people that you don't see that are actually most vulnerable to these anti-homeless laws and ordinances, because they're most reluctant to seek help," Mr. Betancourt, who does not smoke or drink, said in a recent interview, unobtrusive in his plain black baseball cap, white T-shirt, checked shirt and khakis.
The mayor's first round of sweeps in 1996 were welcomed by many New Yorkers. But though they broke up major encampments of homeless people and offered services, their limitations quickly became apparent. In monthly spread sheets laid out by location, internal reports by the Department of Homeless Services reflect that homeless people routed from one place showed up somewhere else, or ebbed back to the old spot over time.
Issued summonses, many homeless people failed to show up in court, resulting in bench warrants later used to arrest them. Many spent time in jail on Rikers Island, where mental health unit beds cost $91,000 a year, compared with $20,000 for a city shelter bed and $12,000 for the supervised apartments that have been the greatest success for the mentally ill homeless, but remain in short supply. Annual admissions at the jail reached an all-time high of 133,300 in 1997, up from 106,000 in 1993. Admissions are now about 127,000 a year.
The Franklin Avenue shelter that frightened away Mr. Betancourt in 1988 was cut to 200 beds through lawsuits brought by advocates for the homeless. More than 70 percent of the shelter system is now run by private nonprofit agencies.
But through shelter regulations Mr. Giuliani himself sought from the state, the legal right to shelter underpinning this improved system is now under challenge as never before.
On a recent Friday night, no one was sleeping in the park where Mr. Betancourt was arrested. But about 11 p.m., homeless people began slipping out from the chilly shadows of the surrounding streets one by one, until more than a dozen stood in the dim light of a street lamp as a small yellow truck pulled up.
Soon a small caravan of volunteers from a New Jersey group called Bridges was distributing hot soup, toiletries and blankets to the men. Mr. Betancourt withdrew to his cardboard box, set in the shadows between lofts and sweatshops. When he was most fearful of being arrested again, he said, he never slept in the same place twice. He sought out recessed crannies in the financial district and moved on before the rumble of garbage trucks at dawn.
"My motivation in this lawsuit doesn't have anything to do with money or some kind of vendetta against the city,' he said. "My motivation is to avoid any further disruption and living like a fugitive."

HEADLINE: Town With Fabled Past Facing Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By EMILY YELLIN 

DATELINE: PRINCEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
When a group of newly freed slaves here wanted to form a community of their own just after the Civil War, they had to take whatever land they could get. In 1865, that was a snake-infested, mosquito-ridden swamp in a flood plain along the southern side of the Tar River in eastern North Carolina. It was land that the white people in nearby Tarboro, on the northern side of the river, did not want.
Twenty years later, those former slaves had built a town so viable that they petitioned the state to recognize it as a legal entity. In 1885, Princeville became the first town in the United States to be chartered and governed solely by blacks. 
 Now the more than 2,000 residents of Princeville, many of whom are direct descendants of its founders, face a dilemma more extreme than any other this town has ever faced.
Their storied community was washed away in September by the worst flooding in North Carolina's history, and they must choose whether to return and rebuild or abandon forever the place where their ancestors first experienced full United States citizenship. The impending decision has those who would accept a federal buyout of the town at odds with the many who believe that doing so would betray the cherished legacy of their forebears.
"The challenge we are facing in Princeville," said Representative Eva Clayton, the Democrat whose district includes the town, "is how to keep its legacy and make it viable in the future."
A handful of places similarly devastated by floods in recent years have accepted government buyouts of all or part of their towns. Grand Forks, N.D., was one, along with Valmeyer, Ill., and Kinston, N.C. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have already received word from at least 45 city or county governments affected by the floods in eastern North Carolina that they intend to apply for federal buyouts.
In all, officials estimate, the flooding caused $1.2 billion worth of structural damage across the state. Of the 6,000 buildings that the federal agency estimates were damaged beyond repair statewide, about 600 are in Princeville.
Last Friday, Princeville officials reported that only 92 people had signed up for the buyout so far. The town has given its residents, about 40 of whom are white, a Dec. 16 deadline to submit applications. After that, city leaders will decide whether there is enough interest to apply for the buyout. The town government must make a formal application before any individual applications are considered. If the town decides against a buyout, no residents will be eligible.
For Glennie Matthewson II, 55, a lawyer and former Princeville mayor, leaving is not an option. His great-grandmother was a slave and one of the first residents of Princeville.
"When our ancestors built this town, they were seen as uppity blacks, with the audacity to talk about incorporating their own town," Mr. Matthewson said. "That is a hell of a legacy. The deeper the roots the harder the fight, and the more resistance you're going to get to taking the town from us."
The mayor of Princeville, Delia Perkins, 57, lost her home in the flood, but she, too, remains firm about returning. She works full time as a teacher's assistant in the Edgecombe County School system and receives $250 a month to serve as mayor.
"If I had my druthers," she said, "I would have said from Day 1 that we will rebuild, no doubt about it." But she added that she thought the town government must consider all its options.
Some question the wisdom of rebuilding. Marcia Wheeler, 43, a mother of two, says she has no plans to return -- ever. "I wouldn't want to go through this again," she said.
Under the buyout, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would buy property for what appraisers estimate was the market value the day before the flood. The buildings would be removed and the open space deeded back to the town, but it could never be built on again.
If the town decides to rebuild, money from a federal buyout will not be available and the town will seek money from other government agencies and private sources. The mayor estimates the cost of rebuilding to be at least $80 million. Central to the effort would be reconstruction of a dike that controls the Tar River. That cost is estimated at $300,000 and would be paid for by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
The levee was built in 1965, a century after the area was settled. It was designed to protect the town against the kind of flood estimated to happen only every 300 years. That levee afforded enough protection to negate the flood-plain status of the town in official terms. And it is what allows the town even to consider the option of returning to the same site.
Todd Davison, Southeastern mitigation director of the emergency management agency, noted that the United States Geological Survey had issued a report this month saying the recent flood was well in excess of a 500-year event.
"That is a biblical kind of flood," Mr. Davison said. "The risk is so remote that we don't regulate against it, just as we don't protect against meteors."
The Tar River began its rampage in Princeville on Sept. 16, as a result of the 20 inches of rain dumped on the state by Hurricane Floyd. When it spilled over the dike, it had reached 48.5 feet above sea level. Early the next morning the town was evacuated. The river crested at 53 feet above sea level, and the town remained under about 14 feet of water for several weeks.
When residents were allowed to return, they were shocked to see houses that had floated off their foundations and landed on top of cars. Precious family photographs, keepsakes and heirlooms were lost. Many houses had been condemned. More than 200 coffins dislodged from the town cemetery were found floating around the town. None of the original slaves' graves were disturbed -- perhaps because they had been dug deeper than more recent graves.
And even today, two months after the deluge, the damage is strikingly evident in the deserted town. Mud-caked clothes hang from trees. The water has gone and most of the facades of houses are still intact, but their insides have been stripped bare to remove destroyed furniture and rotted drywall.
That is the case at Linda Whitest's home on Walston Street in the heart of Princeville. Her year-old house was destroyed by flood waters. Across the street, her grandmother's house, where Ms. Whitest, 49, grew up, was destroyed. Next door to her grandmother's house, her mother's house was also ruined. The homes are all situated on land handed down from Ms. Whitest's great-grandfather, Frank Walston, a son of slaves and the man for whom the street was named.
"A month ago I said there is no way I'm going back, I was so devastated," Ms. Whitest said. "But then I thought about it, and I said, why should I give up what my ancestors had worked so hard to leave us? It would be like Princeville never existed, like it had just been erased away."
Mr. Matthewson said moving the town even a few blocks away was unacceptable to most residents.
"My ancestors' energies and efforts and resources went into that specific property in Princeville," he said. "Those are the streets I played in, the trees I climbed. You take the town and move it anywhere else, then you've severed me from my actual roots."
Soon after the flooding, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton both visited the town, as did President Clinton.
"If this was Valley Forge," Mr. Sharpton said, "imagine what America would be doing. We preach black pride. Here's an example of a city that has faced a major disaster. I think it's incumbent upon black America to use its economic and political resources to try to restore that city."
Along with other flood victims, the displaced residents of Princeville are living either with friends and relatives or in the temporary trailer park set up by the emergency management agency in nearby Rocky Mount. The trailer park, just around the corner from a women's prison, is officially named New Life Fountain Park. Residents call it FEMA City.
Lee Black, 35, a construction worker, has been living at the temporary site since it was opened two months ago. He said he planned to return to the Princeville property passed down to him by his ancestors.
"My people took that swampland and made a town out of it," Mr. Black said. "It would make us look real bad to let it go now."

HEADLINE: Israel's Leader Highly Praises Hillary Clinton

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel offered an unprompted defense of Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday, telling a group of American Jewish leaders in New York that her recent trip to the Middle East had been "highly successful" and had advanced the peace process.
Mrs. Clinton had been criticized by some Jewish groups in the United States for her handling of the trip, particularly for sitting silently during a visit to the West Bank while Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, accused Israel of using toxic gas in the region. 
 Mr. Barak's comments came as he answered questions after a speech at the Helmsley Park Lane Hotel to an audience at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the largest umbrella organization of American Jewish groups. Mr. Barak volunteered that he had read "a lot of criticism" about Mrs. Clinton in the aftermath of her visit to the West Bank. He wanted to make clear, he said, that her trip to the Middle East was "a highly successful, highly moving visit."
"I believe the first lady's visit to Israel contributed to the peace process in spite of this incident," he said, and added, "May I tell you frankly as prime minister of Israel that myself and all my successors will always wish to have two such friends as the Clintons in the White House."
Mrs. Clinton, who has sometimes had disputes with American Jewish voters over her views, was roundly criticized by some Jewish groups in America for not immediately denouncing Mrs. Arafat's remarks about poison gas. The first lady did so later, but her delayed reaction prompted criticism, and a Republican Jewish group is planning to begin running a television advertisement this week criticizing Mrs. Clinton over the visit.
While Mr. Barak's statement of support yesterday was not surprising -- he has close ties to the Clintons and has shared campaign consultants, including James Carville, with them -- it came at an important period for Mrs. Clinton in her expected race for United States Senate against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the prospective Republican candidate, who has enjoyed popularity among Jewish voters.
Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory Senate campaign committee, said yesterday that he was gratified by Mr. Barak's statement. "We appreciate the prime minister's comments," he said. "It speaks volumes about the first lady's commitment to a safe and secure Israel."
Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of the mayor's Senate exploratory committee, declined last night to comment on Mr. Barak's remarks.
Mr. Barak is popular among New York Jews, and his speech, the second to Jewish leaders this weekend, was warmly received. As expected, he extensively discussed the peace process, reiterating his commitment to moving forward with negotiating a "final status" agreement with Israel's neighbors.
"Everything must be put on the table," he said. "Settlements, borders, refugees, the nature of the Palestinian entity, economic relations, security relations, everything."
But he said such an agreement could not be founded on documents alone, but "should be based on the military might of the Israeli Defense Force, our strategic capability, a unique alliance with the United States and a growing economy."
Apparently in an effort to broaden the dialogue with American Jews beyond the peace process, Mr. Barak dwelt at length on the need to strengthen Israel's economy, and on the country's socioeconomic stresses. Recent statistics revealed record unemployment in Israel, and a gap between the rich and poor second only to that in the United States in the developed world.
Noting that Israel had just been through a deep recession, Mr. Barak said that it needed to develop its high-technology sector to increase jobs. The country, he said, had to pursue both deregulation and privatization to allow economic growth and had to deal with "very urgent" social needs.
Mr. Barak also paid a visit to Cardinal John O'Connor at his residence yesterday afternoon, traveling eight blocks down Fifth Avenue in a security-laden motorcade that attracted several hundred onlookers.
The two met for about 45 minutes at the prime minister's request, according to a spokesman for the archdiocese, who declined to discuss their conversation. An Israeli official said the cardinal expressed support for the peace process, and that the two discussed the pope's planned visit to the Middle East next spring. The official said that a dispute in Nazareth, where the Israeli government recently gave permission to Muslim leaders to build a mosque next to the city's main Roman Catholic shrine, did not come up explicitly, but that the two did discuss ways to "minimize tensions."
The Prime Minister met with Gov. George E. Pataki as well, following on a meeting he had with Mayor Giuliani on his last trip to New York.
Mr. Pataki said they discussed the peace process and economic ties between New York and Israel. But if Mr. Barak began the day by defending Hillary Clinton, Mr. Pataki ended it by attacking her. "Someone who has never lived here, never worked here, looking to represent us -- it's very difficult," he said. "I feel very optimistic about the mayor's prospects."

HEADLINE: A Labor Shortage?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Apparently the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates out of concern "that the nation is literally running out of workers and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion" (Business Day, Nov. 17). 
 I don't get it: There are millions of qualified people all over the world who would be glad to immigrate to the United States and relieve the labor shortage. Rather than recklessly jeopardizing the economy's momentum and healthy business climate by raising interest rates, why not encourage the Clinton administration and Congress to take a positive approach and direct the Immigration and Naturalization Service to drastically raise its immigration quotas instead? That would help both the United States and ambitious potential immigrants who happen to live in countries with high unemployment.

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged 3.6 percent, to $27 a barrel, the highest since the Persian Gulf war, after reports that Iraq halted oil shipments and rejected a United Nations plan to extend an export agreement for two weeks.
Iraq, which normally exports about 3 percent of the world's oil, is seeking an end to economic sanctions, including United Nations control over its oil exports. The United Nations plan to extend the program temporarily came after Russia and the United States were unable to agree on terms of a new six-month plan. 
 "Thirty-dollar oil looks real if this suspension continues," said Nauman Barakat, vice president for global energy trading at ABN Amro Inc. in New York. He added that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, probably is not "going to agree to the extension of the present oil-for-food sales without any changes, so my assumption is that the suspension is going to be here for a while."
Crude oil for January delivery rose 93 cents, to $27.07 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price since January 1991.
Baghdad has halted exports from its pipeline through Turkey and is expected to complete tanker loadings at its own port tomorrow, after refusing over the weekend to sign the two-week extension, according to the United Nations.
Iraqi oil exports were put under an international embargo after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The United Nations, since late 1996, has allowed Iraq to export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medical supplies, and to pay war reparations.
Amer Mohammed Rasheed, Iraq's oil minister, said the extension "is absolutely meaningless, since nothing can be done in a period of two weeks, hence Iraq will not deal with this resolution," the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
The current six-month round of the United Nations-sponsored program was to have expired last Saturday, but was extended Friday for two weeks to allow the Security Council more time to discuss its renewal and longer-term policy regarding sanctions and weapons inspections.
Oil prices rallied this year after members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several other producers cut world supply by about 7 percent from February 1998 levels in a bid to eliminate a glut and raise prices.
An extended halt in Iraqi exports would also come amid rising demand for winter fuel in the Northern hemisphere and with inventories of crude oil in the United States near their lowest level in two years.

HEADLINE: Stari Trg Journal;
A Battered Kosovo Village the West Forgot to Help

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: STARI TRG, Kosovo

 BODY:
Bairam Bala stood on the concrete foundations of what was once his house, surrounded by ragged edges of shelled and collapsed walls, near the burned and rusted remnants of his belongings gathered neatly in a pile, for some Westerner, who will never come, to inventory and make good his losses.
Myftar Haxha has his own wretched pile of post-tragedy trash, and so does Behram Mernica. They walk forlornly around the twisted remains of washing machines and ovens, television sets and tool kits, lamps and bedsprings, as Kosovo's winter closes in. 
They've lost everything, they say, and that is indisputable. Their ultimately victorious fight with the Serbs here in this utterly devastated little village began in the summer and autumn of 1998 when the Serbs began to attack the Kosovo Liberation Army in earnest.
This Albanian village -- the name means "old market" -- overlooks part of the Trepca mines, one of the few economically important sites in Kosovo. So it became strategic territory, and it was badly shelled.
What survived the fighting in 1998 was obliterated last April, after another Serbian offensive prompted a 78-day bombing war from NATO on behalf of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. These men and their families fled to the surrounding hills -- only a few left Kosovo -- and returned in July to this blasted landscape, where their fathers had lived before them.
President Clinton is to visit Kosovo on Nov. 23 to celebrate Thanksgiving with American soldiers at their huge, fortified base at Camp Bondsteel. But having won the war to save people like those in Stari Trg, the West is moving slowly to consolidate the peace and to help them rebuild their lives.
"We lost everything and we have nowhere else to go," said Mr. Haxha, rubbing his long stubble on a face that looks 70, not 58. "Look down there," he said pointing at a shattered wall marked by smoke. "This was my land and my house. I had a good house. I had 100,000 marks invested here," some $55,500 at today's exchange rate.
There were 30 houses here; all of them are destroyed. Only five families live here now, Mr. Bala said. The rest, for the moment, are scattered in other villages, or they are imprisoned or dead. Of the approximately 250 people who lived here two years ago, at least 12 have been killed, Mr. Bala said, and 2 were arrested by the Serbian forces and have not returned.
In July, aid workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees came by and provided a few nice tents, about 13 feet square, to keep off the rain, and people moved in. But the tents cannot be heated.
And now it is too cold, and there has been no other visitor to provide the single warm room that the world has promised them, let alone a winterized tent, so they have gone to squat in an office building across the way. Now the Serbs don't frighten them so much, Mr. Bala said, as the thought of eviction.
"I'd be happier here in a better tent than in the office," Mr. Bala said. "I'm afraid every day they will throw us out. It is an official place. It's not for family living -- it's all concrete."
He, like the others, says he will rebuild here, nowhere else, and would have liked to have started by now. "If those foreign organizations had helped us we could have rebuilt this year," he said. "We thought they would help with timber and roof tiles. But now they say they will help us in the spring."
No one offered them much after July, Mr. Haxha said.
"They said everyone would have one warm room for the winter, and we don't have one," Mr. Haxha said. He has six children, two here and four in Germany. "They can't send me money because there is no bank," he said. "I'm waiting for them to come. But Germany wants to throw them out." Now that the war is over, Berlin and other European capitals are eager to send the ethnic Albanian refugees home.
In Pristina, senior United Nations refugee officials were upset to hear that no one had revisited Stari Trg, and promised to do so. They were relieved that the families had found their own shelter, however uncomfortable, and said that no one would turn them out.
The officials pointed to the progress they had made in providing emergency shelter for so many thousands, and all the obstacles they had overcome, from clogged borders and production delays to late financing from governments. Some 80 percent of the United Nations refugee agency's 16,000 emergency kits, mostly roof-quality plastic sheeting and stoves, has been delivered, they said, though other organizations were slower.
"This will be a hard winter," said the refugee agency's director here, Dennis McNamara, but he promised that no one in Kosovo would freeze to death. But many thousands, like the people of Stari Trg, will have to fend for themselves.
Here, Mr. Bala displays his pile of rusted rubbish. "Everything I had I put here," he said, showing the broken plates, melted pipes, charred alarm clock and the tool box, with his ruined tools, which he used when he worked as an electrician at the mine.
"I heard we should write down what we lost," Mr. Bala said forlornly, idly picking up the rusted runner of what had been a child's sled. "But I thought it's better for someone to see it." He paused, then said: "Of course, all the wooden furniture is lost. And I think they stole the television -- I couldn't find any parts of it."
He paused again. "But no one came to see. They gave us a paper in July to write down damage, but nothing happened."
He sobbed once, briefly, then recovered. "I couldn't even save the spoons."
Mr. Bala, who has four children, then gestured to some nearby ruins. "From this house, only one woman survived," he said. "Her husband, son and daughter were killed. So we should be happy we are alive."
Xheme Maksuti, nearly 70, was killed in the shelling. His son Ilaz, 35, and his daughter, Saba, 22, were shot to death by the Serbs as they tried to run away, Mr. Bala said. Only Naile Maksuti, 64, survived, he said, but he does not know where she is.
Workers from a local charity, the Mother Teresa Society, bring the people of Stari Trg packets of food from time to time, with beans, pasta and other proteins, originally donated by Western and United Nations agencies. And they have promised to provide a stove for the office.
Mr. Haxha walked in a tight circle, rubbing the moisture from his stubble. "How many promises did they make us before we returned?" he asked bitterly. "If they piled them all up it would make us four-story houses."

HEADLINE: A Virtual Oasis For Morocco Stocks;
Trading Going on Here? Shocking!

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: CASABLANCA, Morocco

 BODY:
The trading floor of the Casablanca Stock Exchange, with just 30 traders working in little computer cubicles, is as quiet as a church. And it is about to get even quieter.
Early next year, the trading floor is shutting down, exchange officials say, thrusting Casablanca's small, young, but technologically hip stock market into the growing ranks of virtual exchanges around the world.
As in London, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and a rising number of other places, brokers here will be trading directly from their own offices in a kind of miniature Nasdaq. 
 "We'll be cruising on the electronic highway," said Zouheir Bensaid, the immediate past president of the exchange and now a senior executive at one of the country's biggest financial companies, Group BMCE.
The conversion will add efficiency to domestic trading and make it technically possible for brokers anywhere to trade directly in the Moroccan market. It is an impressive step, and one that several other Middle East stock markets are expected to emulate in the coming year.
After long, sleepy histories, this region's stock exchanges have caught the attention of government officials as vital tools for selling state-owned companies and attracting foreign investors as they move from centrally planned economies to free enterprise.
And like the exchange here, in a mirror-paneled office block in downtown Casablanca, many are being revitalized with advanced systems and are attracting platoons of young Arab financial whizzes with M.B.A.'s and job experience in New York, London and Paris.
Casablanca's shift to decentralized, computerized operation comes as the New York Stock Exchange, one of the remaining great halls of hubbub and clanging bells, is debating a move toward greater automation. And it comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with its shouting and hand-waving traders, has introduced the same French-designed system the Moroccans are using.
But even if the countries in this region are in the technological vanguard, financial experts say, they will have to overcome significant impediments before they can expect the kind of foreign investment that has poured into the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Central Europe.
One problem for Morocco and neighbors like Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordan is size. Their markets are minuscule. There are 55 companies traded on the Casablanca exchange, with daily volume of about $6 million; in New York and London, many individual trades surpass that figure. Tunisia has about 40 listings; Lebanon has nearly a dozen. Jordan has more than 150 companies listed, but its daily trading volume is only about $3 million. Although the Cairo Stock Exchange lists more than 1,000 companies, daily volume there is only about $31 million.
Angus Blair, head of equity research on the Middle East and North Africa at the London office of ABN Amro, the Dutch investment bank and securities firm, said it was difficult for big international investors even to consider putting money into a market as small as Casablanca's. Mutual fund and pension fund managers routinely put $500,000 to $5 million in a single emerging-market stock. A daily volume of $6 million would not give them much room to maneuver. "You need to have high daily volumes so you can get in and out of a stock easily," Mr. Blair said. "The last thing you want is for it to be difficult to sell while the price is moving against you."
Another problem in Morocco is that share prices are higher than in the rest of the region -- more than twice the level, for example, of those in Egypt. That is because, in an attempt to husband foreign exchange, the government officially prohibits Moroccans from investing abroad. Having no place else to go, the insurance companies and the roughly 100 mutual funds that have sprung up here in the last few years compete for the few stocks traded here, pushing prices up.
Morocco, like some of its neighbors, has signed an agreement with the European Union that will eliminate tariffs and, experts say, probably lead to a loosening of foreign exchange and investing restrictions. But, they say, the changes will take years.
After soaring for several years, the market here has gone into a long slump, starting toward the end of summer last year. Foreign investors, who held about 6 percent of the market's shares, began taking their gains, financial experts say, to offset losses in Asia and the former Soviet Union. Local investors were scared and began withdrawing their money. From September to the end of December, the market lost 12 percent, but it still closed the year with a gain of 20 percent. This year, with the economy depressed by one of the country's periodic droughts, the market has been mainly flat.
But Rachid Ouali Alami, chairman of the Casablanca Stock Exchange, and many of his colleagues see better days ahead. In the coming year, he said, the Government is expected to offer, for the first time, a large number of shares in Royal Air Maroc, the national airline, as well as in the national telephone company. And one banker said work was under way on at least a dozen initial public offerings of private companies. One sign of confidence: Two new brokerage firms have just taken seats on the Casablanca exchange.
The big job for the financial community is to persuade more of Morocco's privately owned businesses to go public, enabling the exchange to grow. But, the financial experts say, that is not going to be easy. Karim El Fekkak, director general of ABN Amro in Casablanca, estimates that there are more than 500 companies with more than $1 million in capital that would be candidates for the exchange. But, like most businesses in Morocco, they are family owned and so far have shown little interest in sharing ownership.
One thing that makes them reluctant, said Eric Stoclet, head of Citibank in Casablanca, is that the family-owned companies "don't want to open their books." In Tunis the government has given tax breaks to companies that go public, and there has been talk of that here. But here, as in many emerging markets, financial experts say, the privately held businesses are believed to be enjoying substantial tax breaks already, and these would be hard for the government to top.
As free trade with the European Union develops, Mr. Fekkak said, competition from European imports is likely to push some private companies into the market in search of financing to expand and create economies of scale.
Like others in the region, the government here has been criticized for dragging out the process of selling off state-owned companies, which began in 1993. After decades of foreign domination before independence in the 1950's and 1960's, all the governments fear being accused of permitting foreigners to gain control of important segments of the economy. That is one reason governments in the region have put only minority shares of many companies on the market.
But in late summer the government here scored a big success. It auctioned off a license for a mobile phone company for $1.1 billion, about three times what was expected. And the winning bidders, a consortium of Europeans and Moroccans, said they expected to invest $800 million in equipment. The government, in effect, gave up a piece of paper -- the license -- in return for lots of money and, almost certainly, a huge improvement in telephone service in Morocco.
Eventually, the mobile phone company is expected to be traded on the stock exchange. (Such a company is a star of the Egyptian market.) But one of many government regulations that frustrate Morocco's young, aggressive financiers prohibits any company -- no matter how strong and stable it seems -- from selling shares until it has done business in the country for at least three years.
In another drag on the stock market, the government this summer introduced a capital gains tax of 10 percent, in response to pressures from real estate brokers who said investment money that once flowed to them was going into the stock market because of the tax advantages. Foreign investors were exempt, but the tax was an unsettling reminder of how terms of business can change overnight in Morocco and other emerging markets. Early next year, the United States Commerce Department plans to hold a conference in the United Arab Emirates to encourage Middle East governments to work on consistency in government administration and judicial procedures.
"On paper, the procedures here are clear," said Mr. Bensaid, who studied at Cornell University and received a degree in business at the University of Nevada. "But in practice, things are not that clear. Once you get involved in a problem in the courts, it can go on for 10 years."
Tension with Algeria over Western Sahara, which in 1975 Morocco claimed as an extension of its territory and where it still has troops, remains a lingering uncertainty. But for Morocco's financiers, the political picture brightened this summer with the ascension to power of King Mohammed VI after the death of his father, Hassan II, who had reigned for 38 years. Mohammed VI, 36, has permitted the return from exile of political opponents of his father and says he wants to reduce poverty and illiteracy. Illiteracy is more than 40 percent, among the highest levels in the Middle East.
The young people giving the Casablanca Stock Exchange its spark say that government officials, while cordial, have little training or experience in finance. By contrast, the financiers felt an instant rapport with the new king, they say, because of his youth and his professed interest in bringing change to Morocco. He is clearly different from the ministers and other men of his father's generation who have been running the government.
"Our king," Mr. Bensaid said, "is going to force those people to let us do our work."

HEADLINE: A Grateful Clinton Offers Encouragement to Bulgaria

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Nov. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton thanked Bulgaria today for supporting the NATO campaign against Slobodan Milosevic in nearby Yugoslavia and urged the struggling nation to stay the course of economic reform.
More than 10,000 people packed the central square under the glittering Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky -- the same spot where mass rallies 10 years earlier led to the overthrow of the Communist government -- and celebrated the visit with music and fireworks. 
 "I am very proud to be the first American president to visit Bulgaria -- a free Bulgaria," Mr. Clinton told the crowd in a 45-minute speech at dusk. "I am proud to stand in this place where voices were silenced for too long."
He arrived late on Sunday, a week into his European tour, which will end with a trip to Kosovo on Tuesday. The visit here was intended to reward Bulgaria for letting NATO planes use its air space in the Kosovo campaign last spring, to offer some encouragement, and to send a message to the Serbs only 30 miles away.
"I am told that during the recent war you could actually hear some of the bombs falling in Serbia from this square," Mr. Clinton said. "Tonight, I hope the people of Serbia can hear our voices when we say if you choose as Bulgaria has chosen, you will regain the rightful place in Europe Mr. Milosevic has stolen from you, and America will support you too."
The crowd of people -- most of whom were taught at an early age of the evils of America's imperialist ways -- roared with approval and shouted Mr. Clinton's name.
"It used to be dangerous to talk to foreigners," said Kiril Manov, 70, a retired lawyer who was bundled up against the chilly evening air. "We used to learn about the evils of America. Never did we think an American president would stand here."
During his visit today, Mr. Clinton laid a wreath at a soldiers' memorial, spoke with a small group of college students over a lunch of tabbouleh and skewered chicken, and slipped out to a jazz club with President Petar Stoyanov.
During his visit to Kosovo, his first trip there, Mr. Clinton is to meet military commanders, opposition leaders and American troops, and is expected to urge the Albanians of Kosovo to set aside revenge as they rebuild after the war.
"I think it's very important that Kosovo, in effect, not become the mirror image of Serbia," he told the Bulgarians.
During his speech, the president held out the possibility of NATO membership for Bulgaria in the coming years and thanked the nation for allowing the alliance's jets to streak over Sofia during the air campaign in Kosovo. "You stood with NATO," he said. "I know it was very hard for you to do."
But most of all, Mr. Clinton's visit was intended to leave a measure of hope to a country still struggling with the difficult transition from dictatorship to democracy.
"I ask you to remember what you left behind," he said. "A police state with no room for disappointment, because there was no hope for improvement. When nobody felt left behind because no one was allowed to get ahead. When there were no dreams and some Bulgarians were even robbed of their very identities, forced to change their names."
The border with Serbia lies just 30 miles to the east of Sofia, the Bulgaria capital, so close that a handful of NATO bombs that veered off course actually landed here. The sanctions against Yugoslavia, a onetime trading partner, have had a crippling effect on Bulgaria's economy, which already suffered from a steep drop in living standards and high inflation that followed the Soviet era, a period when Bulgaria was one of the most Stalinist of the East Bloc countries.
American support is considered important to the people here, where jobs are difficult to come by, salaries are low, and gray concrete-block architecture stands as a reminder of a Communist system that left little room for initiative. Mr. Clinton arrived without bringing any big offers of aid, but he talked of a continued partnership with Bulgaria.
"Most of the people living here are desperate with the economic situation," said Ognyan Minchev, the director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia. "This visit is a sign of hope."
That is how Snezhana Popova saw it. She stood in the back of the crowd with two tiny flags in her hand, one from the United States and one from Bulgaria. Mr. Clinton's visit, she said, just had to help make things better.
"It's very difficult to get a well-paying job here," she said.
The remark that most encouraged her came midway through Mr. Clinton's speech when he talked of plans to encourage more United States companies to do business in Bulgaria.
Bulgaria is making a push for entry into the European Union, which Mr. Clinton said ought to happen one day. In closed meetings with President Stoyanov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, he discussed Bulgaria's effort to reduce and modernize its Soviet-era military, among other issues.
As he encouraged Bulgarians to continue their reform efforts, the president reminded them that democracy has been a long road for the United States. He said it has taken America more than two centuries "to overcome slavery and civil war, depressions and world wars, discrimination against women and ethnic and religious minorities."
Bulgaria was allied with the Germans in both world wars, but it came to the aid of its Jews when the Nazis sought to send them to concentration camps. Today, the country has a legacy of religious and ethnic tolerance that Mr. Clinton praised.
"We must help all of southeastern Europe choose freedom and tolerance and community," he said. "We must give all the people in this region a unifying magnet that is stronger than the pull of old hatreds that has threatened to tear them apart over and over again."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Issues Continue to Help Nasdaq Index Climb

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Technology stocks continued their rapid ascent yesterday, carrying the Nasdaq composite index to its 14th record in the last 17 sessions. Gains in Internet stocks and big companies like Microsoft and Intel helped to fuel the advance.
Despite the gains in Nasdaq stocks, the other main stock gauges were mixed. 
 "It is a surprise to a lot of us to continue to see the market act the way it is acting," said Ned Collins, head stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. "It continues to beat all expectations."
At the close, the Nasdaq composite index was up 23.31 points, to 3,392.56. Since the start of the month, the index has gained more than 14 percent.
Big gains in several old-line blue chips, including Coca-Cola, AT&T and I.B.M., helped to push the Dow Jones industrial average up 85.63 points, to 11,089.52.
But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.06 points, to 1,420.94. And the Russell 2000 index of small companies dipped half a point, to 460.77.
Microsoft, a component of all three main market gauges, was the biggest positive influence in yesterday's session, traders said. The stock jumped 4 3/16, to 90 3/16, after Federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the government's antitrust case against the company, named a mediator last week to try to help reach an out-of-court settlement.
"The news from Microsoft is probably the most positive corporate news out there," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in Boston.
Trading was brisk yesterday, but is likely to slow as the Thanksgiving holiday nears. The stock market will be closed on Thursday and will be open for a half-day on Friday.
More than 873 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq market, 1.2 billion shares changed hands.
Coca-Cola was among the best-performing Dow stocks. The company jumped 4 7/8 a share, to 65 3/8, after a Merrill Lynch analyst issued a positive report on the company's prospects next year and raised his rating on Coke shares.
AT&T was also a big winner, rising 5 7/16, to 52. And I.B.M. gained 4 1/16, to 108.
Among Internet stocks, Exodus Communications jumped 17 3/16 a share, to 118 3/16, after the company, which manages Internet sites for other companies, announced a two-for-one stock split effective Dec. 14. It is the third time the company has split its shares this year.
Electronic Arts rose 14 9/16, to 106 9/16, after the video-game publisher said it had signed a deal to provide all content to America Online's games site.
A rise in long-term interest rates, prompted by a jump in spot oil prices, did not help financial service stocks.
Shares of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell 1 9/16, to 122 13/16. Citigroup dropped 1, to 55 1/2. And Chase Manhattan fell 1 1/8 a share, to 81 7/8.
The rise in oil prices, though, did little to help big oil company stocks. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an S.& P. component, fell 5/8 a share, to 62 3/4. Mobil declined 1 1/16, to 103 7/8. And BP Amoco lost 1, to 59 7/16.
"The immediate effect of a sharply spiking oil price is negative for the majors," Mr. Hogan said, "because they hedge their positions for a long ways into the future. Also, these companies are much more diversified than they used to be. So it doesn't go hand in glove that a spike in oil prices is good for the majors."

Treasury Yields Jump
 By Bloomberg News
 Treasury bond yields rose yesterday to their highest level this month, as surging oil prices and a drop in the dollar raised concern about quickening inflation.
Bond prices fell for the fourth time in five sessions, as investors became increasingly concerned that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again in coming months to curb inflation. It raised rates last week, the third time in five months, and said that risks to sustainable growth persist.
"With the resurgence in world growth and higher oil prices, we have higher rates to look forward to," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer of the United Nations Federal Credit Union.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32, to 99 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.19 percent from 6.16 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Judges Make Their Case For a Raise

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 22

 BODY:
State judges need a raise, the chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court told a special legislative panel today.
Appearing at a hearing of the Public Officers Salary Review Commission at the governor's office here, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz said that judges' low pay, relative to their counterparts in other states and to arbitrators in private practice, had damaged morale and threatened the state's ability to keep strong judges. 
 "I wanted to emphasize, on my part, that judges in the state have had only one salary increase in 10 years, and they work under enormous pressure, with one of the highest workloads of any state," she said. "I think I can say to you, without hesitation, that morale is very low."
The salary commission was created in March by a joint resolution of the State Senate and Assembly to review the salaries of judges in the Office of Administrative Law, which now start at $81,900, up through the salary of the chief justice herself, who makes $138,000 a year, $5,750 more than her associates on the State Supreme Court. Superior Court trial judges, the most common variety of state judge, make $115,000 a year. Trial judges received a 15 percent raise in 1996, their first increase since 1986.
Judge Barbara A. Harned, director and chief judge in the Office of Administrative Law, asked the commission to peg her judges' salaries to those of Superior Court trial judges to ensure that the administrative judges' pay does not continue to fall behind that of their trial court counterparts.
Workers' compensation judges, by formula, make 90 percent of what trial judges make. Nonetheless, Judge Paul Kapalko, director and chief judge of the Division of Workers' Compensation, also appeared before the commission asking for a raise. Judge Kapalko said first-year associates at some law firms earn more than the judges they face.
No members of the general public attended the hearing, and no one spoke against raises. The salary commission is also charged with reviewing the pay of state legislators, who make $35,000 a year; cabinet members and county prosecutors, who each make $115,000, and the governor, whose salary is set at $130,000, although Gov. Christine Todd Whitman accepts only $85,000.
It will be up to legislators and the governor to act on the commission's recommendations, although increases will not apply to them in their current terms. The commission chairman, James A. DiEleuterio Jr., a former state treasurer who is now president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said there was no schedule for completing the review. A hearing on legislative salaries is scheduled for Monday.
Asked after the hearing for his impression, Mr. DiEleuterio said, "Certainly, if you take a look at the statistical information, it looks as if the judges in New Jersey are underpaid compared with other states."
Trial court judges in New Jersey have the seventh-highest salary in the nation, behind judges in New York ($136,700), Illinois, Alabama, Delaware, Virginia and Florida. But New Jersey drops to 28th, just behind Utah, when the figure is adjusted for cost of living. Inflation has also eroded judges' real wages, said Chief Justice Poritz. In 1970, for instance, trial judges made $37,000 a year, translating to $158,776 in 1999 dollars, according to figures submitted to the commission.
Chief Justice Poritz said raises for judges had lagged behind raises for many other state employees. She said that while judges' salaries rose 15 percent, some state salaries went up 98 percent, including automatic increases for seniority and merit-based pay raises.
Commission members said that paying enough to attract and keep outstanding people was difficult in all branches of government, particularly for elected lawmakers reluctant to anger taxpaying voters.
"It's a political problem," said a commission member, Samuel F. Crane, who was state treasurer under Gov. Jim Florio. "If this were a $20 billion corporation," Mr. Crane said, using figures for the state budget and the treasurer's salary, "could you find a chief financial officer who would work for $115,000?"

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
In Trash Fight, Aiming Pebbles at Goliath

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., Nov. 22

 BODY:
What to make of this mayor who started the garbage war against New York City?
J. Christian Bollwage (the J stands for James and the surname is pronounced BOWL-wage) has quite publicly battled the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on its real-estate-management practices and its jet-noise proclivities. Before that, Mr. Bollwage, as a fifth-ward Democratic councilman in 1992, picked off then-Mayor Thomas G. Dunn, who had held City Hall firmly in his grasp for 28 years. 
 And today he was wholly unrepentant here in the fastness of his rebel base at City Hall. "It's a David and Goliath situation," said the mayor, leaning forward intently in his studded red-leather chair and transfixing a visitor with his abrupt blue eyes. "The largest city in the country is imposing its will on this small municipality. Well, like David, we have a few pebbles in our basket. And we're going to throw them."
Mayor Bollwage brought the undersized but enthusiastic might of Elizabeth to bear against an armada of New York City sanitation trucks, under orders to schlep an estimated 1,200 tons of garbage daily from Staten Island to waste-transfer stations in this city of 110,000.
In response, the 44-year-old Mayor has commanded his police skirmishers to issue summonses to New York trash vehicles intruding on this ordinarily hospitable 10.6-square-mile blue-collar enclave. Such harassment "is a fight to make trash moving economically not feasible for New York City," he said.
An adjunct professor at Kean College who has a fondness for military metaphors, the mayor likens the tussle to a war, in which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is "Rommel, the Desert Fox," Mr. Bollwage said, adding, "Elizabeth isn't Patton, we don't have the force to crush our opponent, but I liken us to George Washington, who husbanded resources and carefully chose his shots."
On Friday, George Washington suffered a setback when a Superior Court judge in Union County denied Elizabeth's bid for a temporary restraining order preventing transfer stations from receiving Staten Island waste. The judge set a hearing for Jan. 31. "We don't see this as a defeat," Mr. Bollwage said. "Now we have a chance to make our case."
Mayor Bollwage's, um, trashy little war began in September when New York City let it be known that all of Staten Island's residential garbage would be sent to private waste stations in Elizabeth before being shipped to out-of-state landfills.
Mr. Bollwage charged that noisy New York sanitation trucks would disrupt the tranquillity of Elizabeth, polluting its air, damaging its streets and their 100-year-old sewers and menacing an elementary school.
Beyond this is the image-insult problem, since "New York is trying to say that we are still a town that can be dumped on," the mayor contended. "But we've changed over the last few years," he added, proffering statistics showing a decline in unemployment to 7 percent from 14 percent in 1993, and a 30 percent crime reduction over the last three years.
Not to take this personally or anything, but exactly what's so leper-colony about the garbage of New York? "Unlike New Jersey's solid waste, New York's trash has a high content of unrecycled cans and bottles," Mayor Bollwage said. "It's filled with dangerous things like unrecycled batteries."
BUT doesn't messy, trash-rich New York have any right not to be overwhelmed by waste? "In 1987, New Jersey began creating a network of transfer stations and incinerators and made recycling a priority," the mayor said. New York City's "only solution," he said, "was to impose their problem on others."
The two-term mayor's stand against alien garbage has defanged even some of his harshest detractors. "At this time the people of Elizabeth are behind him," said third-ward Councilman Bob Jaspan, a frequent mayoral critic. That said, Mr. Jaspan contended that "part of the mayor's stance is for publicity," adding, "It would have been much better if the mayor of Elizabeth and the mayor of New York had called each other on the phone instead of having press conferences." Mayor Bollwage countered that "no one in New York has ever called us, and therefore the only dealings we have with New York City are through the press."
Such dealings make his day. In his own words, There is "no better job than being mayor of the town you grew up in." He was born on Bellevue Street, one of five children of Frank and Jeanne, a letter carrier and a homemaker. He graduated from St. Mary's High School in 1972, and worked his way through Kean College in Union over nine years, winning a subsequent master's degree in public administration. The mayor and his wife, Nancy, are expecting their first child in May.
The triumph of the Bollwage years, according to the mayor, is the newly opened $360 million Jersey Gardens Outlet Mall in Elizabeth. But Mr. Jaspan said he was worried that thanks to the mayor's borrowing and debt restructuring, Elizabeth was "up to our limit and over our head in borrowing capacity."
The mayor countered by pointing with pride to the fact that last month Moody's Investors Service upgraded Elizabeth's bonds from Baa to A. Could that rating improve if, trashwise, Elizabeth were a New York-free zone? "David took his time in facing Goliath," the Mayor answered. "Only time will tell whether Goliath will win."

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Race-Relations Gap In Armed Services, Despite Gains

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Despite a decades-long effort to promote equal opportunity and good race relations in the armed forces, the Pentagon has found that wide gaps remain between how whites and minority uniformed personnel perceive how they are treated.
In a survey of more than 40,000 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard, the Pentagon also found that a large proportion had experienced what they considered to be a racially offensive encounter, often from a superior, in the 12 months before the survey was taken. 
 The survey, the largest and most detailed effort to discern racial attitudes ever undertaken by any institution, military or civilian, generally painted an encouraging picture of race relations, indicating that large numbers of military personnel felt comfortable living and working around people of another race and formed close friendships across racial lines.
Even so, the survey found that when military personnel filed complaints about particularly bothersome incidents, 51 percent said nothing was done.
And the survey found that 34 percent of white, 47 percent of Hispanic and 48 percent of black personnel said that some of these incidents caused them to lose trust or have negative feelings about their colleagues, a finding that could be particularly troubling to a military that strives to promote cohesiveness and teamwork.
The survey's findings were a bit of a disappointment to current and former Pentagon officials. The military, especially the Army, has prided itself on doing more than perhaps any institution in the country to foster a good racial climate and promote equal opportunities.
The Defense Department's efforts have drawn acclaim from some academics and politicians, including President Clinton, who has praised efforts in the area of race relations and affirmative action.
"This tells us that even the military, which we still believe is ahead of the rest of society, still has some racial tensions," said Edwin Dorn, former under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, who commissioned the survey and has been briefed on its findings. "The results of this survey are not nearly as wonderful as we might have liked. It gives a good sense of the kinds of things that need to be worked on."
Many of the survey's findings indicate that the military has created a much more tolerant racial climate than most other institutions in American society, and that in many ways racial attitudes in the armed forces are more tolerant than they are in the civilian world.
For example, 82 percent of white members of the armed forces who responded said they had a close personal friend who is black. In a comprehensive poll of Americans taken in 1997 by the Gallup Organization, only 59 percent of whites reported having a close black friend.
At the same time, however, the survey also found that members of minorities, especially African-Americans, tended to hold a more pessimistic view than whites of race relations in the military.
Minority service personnel also are much more likely to say they have received a poor evaluation because of their race or ethnicity, compared with whites, and are more likely to believe that the armed forces have paid "too little" attention to discrimination based on race or ethnicity, according to the survey.
Particularly telling was the fact that 17 percent of whites who responded felt the military did not pay enough attention to the problem of race discrimination. In contrast, 38 percent of Hispanic personnel and 62 percent of black personnel said they felt that way.
Pentagon officials cautioned that further study of the survey's findings was required before any solid conclusions or policy recommendations were proposed.
"This gave us initial answers," said William E. Leftwich 3rd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for equal opportunity. "I have to say these initial answers are not enough."
To conduct the study, the Defense Manpower Data Center, a Defense Department agency, sent out a 16-page form to 76,754 soldiers, sailors and aviators from September 1996 to February 1997.
The confidential forms were mailed to enlisted personnel and officers up to the rank of captain in the Navy and Coast Guard and its equivalent rank, colonel, in the Army, Air Force and Marines. About 53 percent of the questionnaires were returned in usable form, a relatively high percentage for surveys returned by mail.
The exercise was mandated by legislation pushed by Ronald V. Dellums, a former Democratic representative from Berkeley, Calif., who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The survey is the first of a series of comprehensive studies on race relations in the military. Pentagon researchers say they will be conducting another next year.
Even as the survey suggested that the military must still grapple with racial issues, another report by the Pentagon indicated that the armed forces had a mixed record when it came to promoting minorities.
The report, "Career Progression of Minority and Women Officers," indicated that in 1997 minorities made up 15.3 percent of all officers, and women 14.1 percent, up from 7 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, in 1977.
But the report said that while the promotion rates for white men and white women were about the same, African-American men and women were being promoted at a much lower rate.
Pentagon officials attribute the discrepancy in the promotion rates to factors that were not necessarily related to race. For example, members of minorities and women tended to be more heavily clustered in administrative and support units in the military. These areas tend not to provide the faster track for promotion that combat units do. Also, Pentagon officials acknowledge that the military does not do a good job of mentoring women and minority personnel who show potential to become officers or move up the officer ranks.

HEADLINE: Republican Governors, Wanting One of Their Own, Decided Early on Bush

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: CARLSBAD, Calif., Nov. 20

 BODY:
More than one Republican governor looked at making a presidential run this year, and there was a touch of envy directed at the one who ultimately did. When Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin decided against a campaign, he observed that his Texas counterpart had a more famous name and more money, was better-looking and came from a much bigger state.
"Other than those few little things," Mr. Thompson said, "I'd have been the front-runner." 
 As Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah puts it now, "It became pretty clear pretty early that the one among us on whom fate seemed to be settling was George W. Bush."
Even before Mr. Bush emerged, the nation's Republican governors, eager for a greater say in the affairs of the national party in 2000 and privately irritated with what they regarded as Congressional Republicans' bungling of public sentiment, had largely concluded that the time had come to nominate one of their own for president.
Now Mr. Bush has assembled a remarkably unified team from the ranks of the Republican governors -- the chief executives of 31 states, and of 8 of the 9 most populous -- with whom he frequently consults for both campaign advice and policy ideas. Many of them endorsed him long before he officially jumped into the race in June, and led fund-raising drives that helped him amass more campaign money than any other presidential candidate in history.
The Republican governors are united behind Mr. Bush not so much by any firm ideological ties as by the concerns that all governors share and by a common hope among the Republicans that, as Gov. John Engler of Michigan put it, "a Republican president in Washington would be enormously helpful" in reducing the power of the federal government and granting more to the states.
Indeed, the governors' own ideologies range from the moderate stances of Northeasterners like George E. Pataki of New York and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey to the staunchly conservative views of some Westerners and Southerners like Mike Foster of Louisiana.
But any such differences are clearly being shelved, at least for now, and a visitor to the recent meeting of the Republican Governors' Association in this Southern California community might well have confused the event with a Bush-for-President strategy session. It was here that the governors gathered not only to discuss campaign themes but also to vote their support for Mr. Bush, the first such endorsement with a primary battle still under way in the organization's 36-year history.
The governors hold regular conference calls with Mr. Bush, and he often refers to them as some of his closest friends in politics or singles them out for praise in campaign speeches. One of them, of course -- Jeb Bush of Florida -- is his younger brother.
That the governors could wind up playing so large a role says a great deal about their popularity among the public. While a recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that just 37 percent of respondents approved of the way the Republican-controlled Congress was handling its job, many Republican governors boast approval ratings that are nearly twice as high. The governors are reaping the benefits of a strong national economy, which has allowed them to cut taxes and increase spending on popular programs at the same time. They also seem to fare better than their Congressional counterparts because the public does not associate them with the drive to impeach President Clinton.
In interviews at the meeting here, many governors said Mr. Bush had brought a fresh political attitude to the party.
"He basically adopts the strategy that you concede no issue, you concede no voter, you concede no region," said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. "Every voter's an opportunity. For too long, there's been a notion that maybe we can win nationally if we can put together the least common denominator: 'Let's figure out how we can get just enough to win.' And George's approach, my approach, the approach of a lot of governors, is, 'Hey, how do we put our arms around this whole thing and get as many votes as we possibly can?' "
Governor Engler, a vigorous Bush backer, said that as early as last year he and his colleagues were holding informal talks about advancing a governor as the party's next candidate for the White House.
"Certainly there was discussion among the governors about the advisability of leading with our strength in the next presidential election," he said, in the kind of comment that reflects continuing tensions between Republicans in the governors' offices and Republicans in Congress.
And Mr. Bush, for all the reasons that Governor Thompson well knew, quickly emerged as the informal consensus choice.
"We didn't all go out and do our secret handshake and do a vote," Governor Engler said. "That didn't happen. But there was just a clear sense that George W. Bush would be a very good president and a feeling, 'Hey, let's go out and do it.' "
Their shared outlook and familiarity with the man they have now endorsed only enhance the prospect of payoffs for the governors: cabinet posts, perhaps, should he win election, or maybe a spot on the national ticket as his running mate.
Nearly all the governors say it is far too early to speculate on the makeup of a ticket, and Mr. Bush, should he gain the nomination, might well get advice to pick a running mate with Congressional experience.
But at least a few of the governors are willing to promote the idea of a vice-presidential nominee from among their own ranks.
" 'Outside of Washington' works," said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut. "A governor would be perfect," he added, before suggesting his colleague from Pennsylvania: "Tommy Ridge would be great."
And Ms. Whitman, who has been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate, said a Congressional career was not so vital a prerequisite as it used to be for a running mate of a governor seeking the presidency: "balance" of that kind is simply no longer deemed so crucial.
"Frankly, I don't think the public is particularly enamored of D.C. experience these days," she said. "I think it is very important to have had executive experience."
As a rule, the governors promote themselves as more moderate and more pragmatic than many Congressional Republicans. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, departing chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, calls the states "hothouses of experimentation" in which the governors are leading a "solution revolution."
Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, echoes the thought, noting for instance that it was the states that took the lead in promoting the vast welfare overhaul ultimately adopted by Congress.
"They feel they had to virtually go out and get welfare reform done," Mr. Beyle said of the Republican governors. "They do not want another U.S. senator or a national figure from the Republican Party to be the leader in 2000. They want someone who has felt the fire of being in the governor's chair."
The concerted effort on Mr. Bush's part was led by several governors, including Mr. Engler, Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Marc Racicot of Montana, who, beginning early this year, called colleagues around the country urging them to endorse him, even as he was saying he would not make up his mind about running until after the Texas legislative session ended in May.
Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio remembers getting a call from Mr. Engler but replying that he would hold off since an Ohioan, Representative John R. Kasich, was in the race. "Then the day after John dropped out" in July, "Marc Racicot was on the phone," Mr. Taft recalled. "And it was, 'O.K., can you do it now?' "
An earlier Bush boomlet occurred in February at a meeting of the National Governors' Association, where several other governors announced for Mr. Bush. "It was the only spontaneous thing I've seen happen in R.G.A./N.G.A. politics in five years," Governor Rowland said with a laugh.
Others who had held off on shelving their national ambitions eventually saw the light.
"I watched George Bush come out of the blocks so fast," Mr. Thompson said. "And as he did, I thought, 'I better get on that horse.' " Mr. Thompson, who calls Mr. Bush a "wonderful candidate," endorsed him this summer.
Another factor in Mr. Bush's favor was that many of the governors had long links with the Bush family, dating from his father's run for the White House starting in 1979. Mr. Ridge, for instance, led that Bush campaign's effort in Erie County, Pa., and as vice president, George Bush returned the favor with campaign help during Mr. Ridge's successful run for Congress in 1982.
For his part, Governor Bush has done nothing to dampen speculation that he might just tap a fellow governor to run with him if he wins the nomination. He has even registered BushEngler, BushPataki, BushRidge and BushWhitman as names for Web sites, though his campaign says that it has reserved many other such names and that no preferences should be read into the move.
Indeed, though naturally parrying questions about a vice-presidential selection, Mr. Bush certainly does nothing to rule anybody out. During a two-day fund-raising tour of Pennsylvania in June, when he and Governor Ridge took a break to go for a run along the Susquehanna River, he jokingly referred to Mr. Ridge as his "jogging mate."
And in Iowa in August, he ran into Governor Thompson, who was helping to promote his successful bid to win a straw poll there.
"It's Tommy T.!" said Mr. Bush, throwing his arms around the man who had wanted to run for the presidency himself but declined in the face of the Bush juggernaut. "Tommy T.," Mr. Bush said, "he's the best. I know how lucky I am to have him with me."

HEADLINE: Tiffany's Owns the Building Once Again

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Fifteen years after Tiffany & Company sold its flagship store on Fifth Avenue, the jewelry maker has repurchased the property, which was the setting for Truman Capote's novel "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
The luxury jeweler, whose robin's-egg-blue gift boxes are an international status symbol, paid $94 million for the 10-story building at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Just as there are few bargains in Tiffany's bejeweled showcases, the building did not come cheap: Tiffany paid $29 million more than it got for the building in 1984. 
 "That location became known as the Tiffany corner," said Scott Latham, managing director with CB Richard Ellis, a real estate brokerage. "It's a good defensive move. Their lease comes up for renewal soon, and I think they were going to get clobbered. Of course, $94 million is a major league commitment to lock up that location."
It was business as usual yesterday beneath the soaring first-floor ceiling of Tiffany's.
"The building serves as a tangible symbol of our retailing and merchandise initiatives throughout the world," Michael J. Kowalski, president of Tiffany, said in a statement last night. "In financial terms, the tradeoff between the cost of leasing and the cost of ownership is not expected to have any effect upon earnings."
Whatever its symbolic value for Tiffany, the property was something of a loser for the Japanese company, Daiichi Real Estate Company, that sold it. Daiichi bought the building for $94.35 million at the height of the real estate boom in the 1980's. But when the recession hit in 1991, property values dropped by 50 percent or more, leaving Japanese buyers like Daiichi with grossly overpriced investments. The once eager buyers have been sellers ever since.
"The Japanese banks and insurance companies are trying to clean up their balance sheets," said Jack Rodman, the director of Asian-Pacific operations for Ernst & Young. "None of these investments was a home run."
In a sign of the times last year, Ernst & Young changed the name of its annual report "Asian Investment in United States Real Estate" to "United States Investment in Asian Real Estate."
From 1987 to 1989, the Japanese went on a $7.4 billion shopping spree in New York, buying trophy properties like Rockefeller Center. That spawned a xenophobic reaction from critics who decried the sell-off of American landmarks. But New York trophies lost their luster when the recession hit Japan and New York real estate almost simultaneously.
"For the most part, it was not a profitable shopping trip," said Richard Baxter, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG Capital Advisers. "The Germans are now the largest buyers of real estate, but unlike the 1980's, everything trading today has some economic justification."
Mitsubishi Estates walked away from its billion-dollar investment in Rockefeller Center when rents failed to cover the mortgage payments. Mitsubishi, however, still owns a couple of adjoining skyscrapers on the Avenue of the Americas.
Shuwa Investments recently sold the 41-story ITT Building, at 1330 Avenue of the Americas and 53rd Street, for almost $200 million to a German investment fund. Last year, Shuwa sold a building at 551 Madison Avenue. Japanese owners also sold the Essex House on Central Park South and the Four Seasons hotel.
Sumitomo Realty, which paid $488.6 million 11 years ago for the Tishman Building, at 666 Fifth Avenue, accepted bids last week for the 39-story skyscraper that were expected to exceed the original purchase price.
For Daiichi, the art deco Tiffany building qualified as a trophy more because of its tenant than its architecture. The famed jeweler had first moved there in 1940, from its original landmark palace on Fifth Avenue at 37th Street. The building is the largest column-free retail store on Fifth Avenue and the corner of 57th Street soon became synonymous with luxury. After an expensive management buyout of Tiffany & Company from Avon Products, Avon sold the land and the building in 1984 to an investment group from Texas for $66.5 million. Tiffany then leased the space. With a real estate market in a frenzy, the investors sold the property a year later to Daiichi for a fast $27.85 million profit. Despite the jump, the Japanese landlord never got a rent increase.
According to real estate executives, Daiichi, which was represented by Kennedy-Wilson International in the Tiffany sale, will also sell its building at 1 East 57th Street, home to the Warner Brothers Studio Store.

HEADLINE: Denouncing U.N., Iraq Cuts Oil Sales Used to Buy Food

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Iraq today unexpectedly began to cut off the oil it is allowed to export in exchange for food and other basic supplies, after the Security Council extended the program for only two weeks.
Fred Eckhard, the United Nations spokesman, said independent experts reported this morning that Iraq had cut the flow of oil to the Turkish port of Ceyhan and was preparing to stop shipments from the Iraqi port of Mina al Bakr on Tuesday. Those ports are Iraq's main export points. 
 The Iraqis said the cuts were ordered to protest the Security Council's failure last week to extend the program for six months, as in the past. After Russia tried to improve the terms of the oil-for-food program for Iraq, the council chose to extend the program for only two weeks.
The United Nations permits Iraq to export controlled amounts of oil in exchange for basic supplies, to mitigate the effects of long-term sanctions ordered against the government of President Saddam Hussein. The sanctions were imposed because of the government's failure to demonstrate that it had eliminated production of weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq exported more than $7 billion worth of oil over the last six months, an amount that equals about 5 percent of the oil sold worldwide.
After the Iraqi cutbacks, crude oil prices rose in the New York market by almost a dollar, to more than $27 a barrel, a nine-year high.
Iraq's rationale for cutting its exports was not immediately evident to diplomats here.
In the past, Iraq has repeatedly generated crises to pressure its adversaries, and some diplomats thought that President Hussein would use any cutoff of food to claim that the economic sanctions were causing ordinary people to suffer. The initial speculation was that the cutoff of oil exports was temporary.
If Iraq fails to carry out the program, "it will be thumbing its nose at the international community again," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
"Every time that Iraq shows its contempt for the world, and its contempt for the world's concern about the people of Iraq, it only makes it harder for Iraq's positions to be taken seriously in the Security Council," he said.
The Security Council debate has focused on reaching an agreement among the five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, each of which can veto an agreement -- to send disarmament inspectors back into Iraq after a year's absence.
The efforts have been focused on finding a formula that Russia, Iraq's main ally on the council, would not reject.
Some diplomats say the Iraqis may have been stunned by reports that the Russians might be willing to drop their strong advocacy for Iraq. Reports last week suggested that Moscow had informally offered the United States a deal to soften Russian opposition to a Western resolution on Iraq, in return for American restraint in criticizing Moscow's war in Chechnya.
The Russians deny that such an offer was made.
France, which at times has argued on Iraq's side, is now considered part of the consensus behind a tougher resolution demanding that Iraq accept and cooperate with arms inspectors. In return, Baghdad would get a suspension of sanctions -- but not a total removal of sanctions, and only for renewable periods.
The French say they are concerned that Iraq, with a record of secret prohibited arms programs, is not being monitored. France is now expected to back the new inspection system being discussed.
Iraq has said repeatedly that it will not accept any inspection system that does not remove sanctions first. The government, which has long chafed under the close monitoring and tight financial controls of the oil-for-food program, may be trying to hold the program hostage at a critical moment to win concessions on both plans.
Diplomats and officials here say Iraq may be concerned that the oil plan and inspections may be dealt with as a package in the council, leaving little room for them to maneuver. The Russians have consistently rejected this linkage, but they made it more likely by putting off a normal extension last week after their delegation failed to change the terms in Iraq's favor.
The Security Council's permanent members are sharply divided on several parts of the arms-inspection plan. These include how long to wait before Iraq would qualify for a suspension of sanctions after demonstrating cooperation; how long the suspensions would run before being reviewed, and how independent a new inspection commission would be.
The danger for the United Nations is that by shutting down oil flows and continuing to oppose a new disarmament plan, Iraq might effectively free itself of foreign supervision.
That would raise the question of military action to enforce Security Council resolutions. The United States has been silent about such a possibility, in contrast to last year's bellicose policy, which led to the bombing of Iraq in December and the effective end of the old United Nations arms control system there.
United Nations officials were taking a wait-and-see attitude and were leaving the administrator of the program and his staff in place in Iraq, and civilian goods ordered earlier were continuing to flow to the country, said Mr. Eckhard, the United Nations spokesman.
"There are an awful lot of supplies in the pipeline, so our work doesn't need to stop just because the oil stopped flowing," he said. "Our hope is that this can eventually be worked out and they will continue the oil-for-food program."
The program -- which Baghdad has never liked because of the controls and monitoring of sales and purchases that came with it -- is intended to relieve the hardships of ordinary citizens.
Sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By late 1991, it was becoming apparent to the Security Council that the disarming of Iraq by the United Nations Special Commission would take considerably longer than expected and that the sanctions were beginning to take a toll on Iraqi civilians. The council offered President Hussein the first oil-for-food program, which was rejected by Iraq. Four years later, a second plan was presented to the Iraqis, who finally accepted it in 1996 after months of stalling, and goods began to arrive in 1997.
The current plan, as amended, allowed Iraq to export $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months. That amount has increased, in part because of the recent climb in oil prices.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about Iraq's move to cut off the oil it is allowed to export in exchange for food and other basic supplies misstated the reason United Nations sanctions were imposed on Iraq. They were imposed, in 1990, because of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The reason was not the Iraqi government's failure to demonstrate that it has eliminated production of weapons of mass destruction; that is a reason they have not been lifted.

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK;
Sleeping With the Competition

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. Lisa Belkin's e-mail address is Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I realized I would never marry my college boyfriend the day that he was chosen for a summer internship at The Washington Post and I wasn't. He did nothing so boorish as gloat; in fact, he barely dared to celebrate. But I ended things anyway. Perhaps I'm revealing more about my ego than is wise in a national publication, but I knew even then that I was too competitive to go through life with someone who did the same work as I.
A look at any workplace shows that the economy might cease to function if everyone felt this way. 
 "Where else do you meet people?" asked Fran Rodgers, chief executive of WFD, a consulting company in Boston that specializes in personnel issues. (Not coincidentally, her husband is second-in-command at WFD.) People spend more of their time at work, she says, and women are doing jobs once done mostly by men. The result? Corporate courtship.
One of Ms. Rodgers's clients found that 30 percent of employees who went through its training program married somebody else in the program. Add to that the spate of entrepreneurial start-ups begun by couples, and you have a good chunk of the population sharing work while sharing life -- navigating the territory that I ran away from all those years ago.
Talk to them and they start with the advantages. "We're both creating the marriage, and we're both creating the business," said Jeff Multz, who met his wife, Susan, when she was a client of his computer consulting company, Emerging Market Technologies, in Atlanta. She is now the company's president, and he, as vice president for sales and marketing, reports to her.
That sense of partnership is a common refrain. "We speak the same language," said Linda Safran, a medieval art historian who heads the department of Greek and Latin at the Catholic University of America in Washington. Her husband, Adam Cohen, is also a medieval art historian, and last year he took over her courses for three months when she was ordered to bed during a complicated pregnancy.
Even so, these work-love mergers can take some negotiating. When Susan Multz joined her husband's company, she remembers that every week "I was grabbing my keys and quitting." Why? Because, her husband answers drily, "I was the president and she wasn't." Instead of calling a marriage counselor, they brought in a management consultant who suggested that Susan take on the day-to-day operations of the company -- and the title of president.
The Cohen-Safran partnership is under a strain that would challenge even the savviest consultant. There are only half a dozen slots for medieval art professors in the Washington area, and all are filled, one by Professor Safran. As a result, Dr. Cohen can't find a job. Moving isn't an option; how many universities would have two openings for their esoteric specialty? So Dr. Cohen stays home, writes manuscripts, cares for 1-year-old Josiah and wonders if he should abandon his field.
He says he does not resent his wife as she leaves each day to do the work he is also trained to do.
"I'm angry all the time," he said, forcing a laugh, "but never at Linda."
I don't think I could be as selfless as all that. I'd be more like a dear friend of mine, a screenwriter out in California, whose husband just landed his dream job as a staff writer for a hit TV show. Unfortunately, it is also her dream job, and she is not taking it well.
"Sure, I'm happy for him," she said morosely. "But then I have to go back to my little office to write my pathetic little scripts." She finds herself reminding people, loudly and often, that at age 35 she is much, much younger than her 40-year-old husband. In other words, he had a head start.
My own 40-year-old husband and I have a different sort of buffering distance between us. Bruce is a physician who also runs a genetic research lab, and he writes in a language I can only pretend to understand. Yes, sometimes I miss the easy shorthand of couples who do the same things, but I'm pleased to trade that for the complete absence of competition. I am freed to be the best writer in the house, just as he is the best doctor.
That he will never scoop me on a story is hardly the reason that I married this remarkable man. But it sure is a relief to know that he won't.

HEADLINE: When to Hold, When to Fold (a k a Retire)

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Seven days a week, for 9 or 10 hours each day, Merritt W. Huntington is on the job, negotiating deals and supervising a small staff. But he is no striving young investment banker or 20-something consultant on the make. He is a 73-year-old orchid grower.
Why does he keep at it? "It's a passion, I guess," said Mr. Huntington, owner of Kensington Orchids in Kensington, Md., the biggest orchid producers in the mid-Atlantic states. But something else prompts him to shake off his periodic reveries about living a life of ease: the belief that hard work will prolong his life. 
 Retirement is not for him.
"I saw too many people my age who lived another six months or two years and then they were gone," he said. So he is staying put, helped by his wife, Helen, 71, the company's bookkeeper.
Again and again, you hear the stories: People who keep working live longer. Sociologists say it is a little more complicated than that. To some extent, they say, old people who are healthy keep working simply because they enjoy working.
Still, they add, it is beyond dispute that active use of both one's mental and physical capacities promotes longevity. Inactivity can be hazardous to health. And you're more likely to use your mind and your muscle in an office or a factory than in a hammock. "Job conditions offering a challenge and the opportunity to do self-directed, substantively complex work increase intellectual flexibility," a study at the National Institute of Mental Health concluded. The effect, in fact, is "significantly greater" for older workers than younger ones.
It helps if people like what they are doing. Take Jean Sharp, who will turn 80 on Sunday and who sews seams in hosiery and leotards at Alsace Textile in Reading, Pa. She sees her work as a vital social connection as well as a source of money to pay off her mortgage, which has three years to go. She said she could not imagine what it would be like to retire.
"It's like family," said Mrs. Sharp, a widow whose son died at the age of 48. "We girls get along good. I think that's what keeps me going."
Mrs. Sharp is especially pleased that she is allowed to set her own hours, which average about 30 a week. "When I get there, I get there," she said, "and when I feel like leaving, I leave."
Such control over working conditions enhances job satisfaction and thus promotes health, social scientists say. It is probably for that reason, they add, that a study of British civil servants in the early 1990's found that those in higher-status positions with more control over their daily routines were healthier than those in low-status jobs.
"The higher you are, the better your health and the longer you live, even controlling for initial health-risk factors," said Dr. Richard M. Suzman, an associate director of the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
Russell S. Bickel, 88, puts in more than 40 hours a week as a stockbroker for Prudential Securities in Wyomissing, Pa. Work for him these days is a comfortable routine in a business he has been part of since he dropped out of high school in 1928 and that gives structure to his life.
He has thought on occasion about retirement but decided he would be doing much the same thing at home -- "fooling around with investments" -- and that as long as he felt good and had enough customers, most of them with long-term horizons, he would just stay on.
But he says old people should either love their jobs or leave them.
"I can imagine myself in certain types of monotonous or repetitious jobs that I would be itching to get out of," he said. "I'd have my hand on the doorknob."
To be sure, the vast majority of Americans retire as soon as they can. The proportion of American men still working at 65 plummeted to 30.5 percent in 1985 from 71.7 percent in 1950, though it has since edged up to 33.7 percent.
Even those who are still toiling away recognize that at some point they will have to throw in the towel.
"I've told my bride that if she sees me slipping my marbles to not let me come to the office anymore," Mr. Bickel said. "I don't want to be the judge of that."
Moreover, there is the cause and effect question: Do people stay healthy because they keep working, or do they keep working because they are staying healthy?
"There's real problems of causation here," said Joseph F. Quinn, a dean and economics professor at Boston College with long experience in the field. "It's really important not to generalize about what's good or not good for your health."
Conclusive proof that work benefits health is very hard to find, because it is mostly people who are already in good health who choose to keep on working.
Statistical analysis has not solved the riddle, either. Specialists note, for example, that women who have never been in the labor force outlive men by the same margin as those who have worked for decades.
If older workers need a role model, it might well be Mary W. Walker, 85, a trust department administrator at First Union Bank in Philadelphia.
Ms. Walker was forced to retire at the age of 70, before Congress passed a law restricting such involuntary departures. But she didn't miss a beat; she linked up with a "temporary" employment agency and was assigned the very same job. Since then, the bank has gone through three mergers and today, a new temp agency, Manpower Inc., cuts her checks. But she is still there, doing what she always did.
In spring and summer, she loves to cap her day by walking seven miles from the First Union office in downtown Philadelphia to her home in the Germantown section. Because of an injury in a fall, she may have to forgo those strolls next year, but she will keep the job.
"I love office work," Ms. Walker said. "My doctor told me, 'Keep on working.' "

HEADLINE: Failures of Peace in Kosovo

 BODY:
President Clinton went to Kosovo yesterday primarily to pay a pre-Thanksgiving call on American troops and encourage ethnic reconciliation. His pleas for forgiveness toward the Serbs drew a predictably chilly reception. But his visit will be valuable if it draws broader attention to the serious problems bedeviling international rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. Last spring NATO used its military power to uphold humanitarian principle and allow hundreds of thousands of brutally uprooted ethnic Albanians to return to their homes. That precious victory must not now be allowed to degenerate into an unstable, unworkable peace.
More than five months after the withdrawal of Serbian forces, Kosovo still lacks basic water, electricity and sanitation services. With police scarce and courts nonexistent, criminals control the streets while non-ethnic-Albanian residents, whether Serbs, Gypsies or Bosnian Muslims, are being burned out of their homes. European donors have been slow in following through on their pledges of financial help and many countries have lagged in providing volunteers for the short-staffed international police. Officials from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe spend too much time and money building up their rival bureaucratic empires and not enough helping Kosovars create their own institutions. 
 Through the hard work of local inhabitants, Kosovo's private economy is starting to revive. But the international organizations have not been much help. They have failed to rebuild the power plants and waterworks sabotaged by the departing Serbs or the roads and bridges bombed by NATO. They have not moved fast enough to put the old Serb-run state companies into private local hands.
The U.N. and the O.S.C.E. seem intent on erecting bureaucratic structures for long-term international administration rather than encouraging eventual self-government. Able to offer much higher salaries than local employers, they have drawn educated Kosovars to their payrolls at the expense of schools, law offices and other professions. They have poured disproportionate resources into building competing official broadcast networks, siphoning money and talent that should be going to strengthen independent media.
NATO must also take responsibility for its failure to protect Serbs and Gypsies and preserve the possibility of a multi-ethnic Kosovo. Instead, most Serbs have either fled to Serbia or regrouped in the northernmost part of Kosovo. There French NATO commanders have wrongly tolerated a kind of unofficial partition, marked off by road barricades, that has left one of the province's most valuable economic resources, a lead and zinc mining and smelting complex, under Serbian control.
The peace in Kosovo is hardly lost, and Mr. Clinton was right to urge local civilians to be patient. Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator, has shown an admirable willingness to listen to critics and occasionally change direction. But unless there is a significant reining in of the international bureaucracy and greater efforts to involve the Kosovars more directly in the economy and administration, the outlook is disheartening.

HEADLINE: Earthquake Helped to Lower October Durable Goods Orders

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Supply disruptions for computer and electronics makers after an earthquake in Taiwan led to a drop in orders for durable goods in October, government figures showed today. Demand for most other items increased.
Orders fell 1.3 percent last month after declining 1.9 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. A 15.3 percent drop in orders for electronics more than offset gains for military aircraft and heavy machinery. 
 "The outlook for U.S. manufacturing is really quite good," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist at KeyCorp in Cleveland. "Strong domestic demand, a lean inventory situation, and recovering foreign economies will cause durable goods orders to rebound strongly." Analysts had expected orders to rise four-tenths of 1 percent.
Excluding the electronics category -- which includes semiconductors, communications equipment and household appliances -- orders rose 2 percent. Compared with figures in the month a year earlier, October's durables orders were 6.1 percent higher.
The drop in electronic equipment orders was the largest since a 16.6 percent decline in July 1997. The most recent drop was partly attributable to disruptions in the computer parts industry after a September earthquake in Taiwan, which "might have resulted in some firms putting off orders, if there was an interruption in some components deliveries to U.S. manufacturers," said Henry Willmore, an economist at Barclays Capital Group in New York.
The earthquake closed plants where computer chips, circuit boards and other parts for personal computers are made. That may have hindered production of chips at the Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices and curtailed orders.
About two million chip orders for Intel were canceled after the earthquake, Dan Niles, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, said in September.
Orders for transportation equipment rose 3.4 percent in October after falling 4.7 percent the month before. The increase was probably a result of a rise in orders for military aircraft, as orders for civilian aircraft fell 3.1 percent.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders fell 2.6 percent -- the biggest drop since October 1998 -- after a 1.1 percent slip in September.
Orders for personal and business computers and other industrial machinery rose 2.8 percent in October after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in September.
The drop in demand for civilian aircraft came after an 18.4 percent decrease in September. The Boeing Company, the world's largest aircraft maker, reported only 3 orders in October, down from 20 in September, according to the company's Internet site. Boeing's orders numbers do not follow the government's statistics in lock step.
Manufacturing has recovered after suffering a drop in export demand caused by economic troubles in Asia and Latin America last year, analysts said. That should spur the economy to its longest-running expansion early next year, they added.
While domestic demand is staying strong, it is slowing from earlier this year. In the third quarter, personal spending rose at a 4.3 percent annual rate, down from 5.1 percent in the previous three months. As a result, order growth could start to slow.

HEADLINE: In a Nonstop Economy, Truckers Keep Rolling

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: FRANKLIN, Ohio

 BODY:
Terry Wheat cherishes his new International Eagle 18-wheeler loaded with Budweiser beer, soon to be loaded with whatever the dispatcher assigns him next. "My truck is built strictly for comfort," he said. "My seats swivel and kick back." Behind the seats is his sleeper, with double decker beds, a television, a VCR, a refrigerator and his Nintendo games.
This is Mr. Wheat's cocoon, his home 341 days a year. Breaking off from the herd of hog-nosed gorillas thundering along Interstate 75 here, he said he drove 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for eight weeks straight. Then he gets four days off, a total of 24 days a year. He spends those days at home in Franklinton, La., with his wife and 6-year-old son. 
 "The reason I'm out here is my kid," said Mr. Wheat, who is 36 and earns 33 cents a mile driving more than 120,000 miles a year, or around $40,000. "He's got more than I ever had."
Mr. Wheat is proud of the work. "Anything that goes in a store, we carry," he said. And he likes the solitude. "You get your whole life in perspective," he said.
These are busy, good-money times for the nation's nearly 600,000 drivers of large trucks, those weighing more than 10,000 pounds. High employment, easy credit and free-spending consumers may be prosperity's engines, but these men -- nearly all are men -- are its mules. Truckers lug 81 percent of the value of all the nation's freight, and 60 percent of the tonnage.
Trucking is more hectic than ever, in part because the economy of the 1990's has assigned trucks a new function. They have become warehouses on wheels. Stores and factories, many tied to the Internet, have found they can cut costs by shrinking the warehouses where they store the materials they use in production or the goods they sell later to consumers. Instead, they rely on trucks to deliver the goods the moment they need them.
Propelled by this "just in time" method of inventory control, trucking company revenue is up more than 60 percent in this decade, to more than $400 billion, according to the American Trucking Associations, and the number of big trucks has risen 18 percent, to 1.7 million.
In April, the Department of Transportation toughened its fines for rule violations, like driving too long and ducking safety measures. And for the first time in 60 years, said Julie Cirillo, acting director of the Office of Motor Carrier Safety at the department, the Clinton administration is preparing new rules governing the hours that drivers work and sleep. "Twenty to 25 percent of the drivers," she said, "are not responsible."
The drivers here represent a subset of the American culture most akin to those who work the seas. They play havoc with the cycles of the sun and the moon. Required by law to rest for 8 hours after driving for 10, they can start driving on Monday at 8 a.m., stop at 6 p.m. and start on Tuesday at 2 a.m.
On a run early in November, Don Maxwell, 58, and his son Wayne, 34, both of Bremen, Ohio, order their main meal of the day, the popular Plaza Special for $7.40. It includes coffee, two slices of white toast and a plate stacked with three scrambled eggs, two round slabs of ham and a mound of hash brown potatoes.
The Maxwells, unlike most other drivers, are a team. They own a 445-horsepower, 1994 bunk-bedded Kenworth tractor that they bought used a year and a half ago for $56,000, about half what it would cost new. Taking alternating five-hour driving and sleeping turns, they can work 24 hours straight, with time out for showers and meals at truck stops.
Married, they get home to Bremen most Saturdays at noon and set off again just before midnight on Sundays. Currently, they haul groceries to Aldi discount food stores in Ohio, Kentucky and the Carolinas.
"We average about $1 a mile, loaded or empty," Mr. Maxwell said, three times the earnings of most other truckers, who do not own their tractors and earn nothing when moving empty.
But the Maxwells share the complaint of most other drivers. Starting out 23 years ago, the elder Mr. Maxwell said, "You didn't have to work as hard -- you run now." Company dispatchers get on the phone to them.
"Everything is 'on time,' 'on time,' " he said.
As yet, little real evidence shows whether tight scheduling endangers the highways. The fatality rate in accidents involving trucks last year was 2.33 for every 100 million miles, a record low. Alcohol is rarely a factor. Still, the absolute number of fatalities involving trucks has rarely dropped below 5,000 in two decades.
And some drivers here say they routinely break rules. They fudge their log books. Like passenger car drivers, they routinely speed. Unlike most passenger car drivers, they have citizen band radios to warn one another of lurking "smokies."
A 28-year-old Indianan, who would not give his name, said, "I can't drive totally legal and make good money. If I drove legally, do you know how much freight would still be sitting in a warehouse?"
In this driver-short, fast-moving economy, truckers who have a gripe with their dispatchers can quit and be driving another truck within a week, and many do.
"The average trucking company has a turnover rate of 100 percent annually," said Bob Costello, an economist at the American Trucking Associations.
Help-wanted advertisements for truck drivers filled an entire page of The Cincinnati Enquirer's classified ads on a recent Sunday. Company recruiters linger at truck stops. Typically, to induce drivers to switch, companies keep a tractor just three years, down from five a few years ago, so they can offer recruits something new.
Some truckers fashion a way of life that allows them to thrive through booms and busts. Torvey McAllister Jr. of Cadiz, Ky., 65, was hauling Toyota Corollas to the Budget Car Rental office at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago for H & H Transport of Murray, Ky.
Approaching his 1993 Peterbilt cab, his blue-eyed, pointy-eared, driving companion with savage incisors peers from the driver's seat. The companion is a usually docile, playful, year-old female timberwolf who is a terror to the thieves and prostitutes who cruise around ill-tended truck stops.
"I guess you can be a truckaholic," Mr. McAllister said. "I've hauled everything but furniture and gasoline. I sleep every night. I don't have to wear glasses. I've got a clean record. No accidents, knock on wood. I've had the same wife since January the sixth, 1959," the year he started trucking.
He said he felt little of many other drivers' pressure to hurry. "Nobody pushes anybody," he said. "I don't run illegal."
Drivers like Mr. McAllister exploit their freedom on the road in many ways, like changing course to reach a customer or stopping when they get the urge to stop.
More of that freedom is at risk today. To keep trucks running on time, many companies are fitting dashboards with satellite-linked computers that can tell when the truck is running or idle, or where it is within a block or two.
Cosmo A. Lippolis, a 60-year-old trucker from Baltimore who is hauling Serta mattresses from Indiana to Orlando, Fla., said the computer saved log-keeping paperwork and made it faster to get help after a breakdown or an accident.
Still, he said, "they're watching now."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Hold Steady As Inflation Concerns Grow

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Reacting to investor fears that the economy will continue to race and that the Federal Reserve will be forced to respond by raising short-term interest rates again, bond prices fell slightly yesterday, leaving yields at their highest level in a month.
The price of the 30-year Treasury slipped 1/32, to 99 4/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was unchanged at 6.19 percent. 
 In addition, the Government sold $15 billion of new two-year notes yesterday, and the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, making dollar-denominated invesments like government securities less attractive to some foreign investors.
Kim Rupert, an economist for Standard & Poor's MMM, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said that "as expected, the auction results didn't offer much inspiration for Treasuries.
"There is not a lot to look forward to tomorrow, but at least it's a shortened session," she added yesterday.
The bond market will close at 2 p.m. today in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday.
"You have an investment community fixated on equities," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla. "Other investors, however, are mandated to buy fixed-income products. Trading is thin, with not a whole lot of conviction either way."
The two-year notes were awarded at 5.946 percent as expected, with the bid-to-cover ratio of 2.46 to 1 a little less than last month's ratio but better than average. "Today's two-year note was not auctioned in the most favorable environments and produced rather lackluster results," Ms. Rupert said.
The decline in the dollar also meant that imports were more expensive, and that will likely put upward pressure on consumer prices. Inflation fears are also being fueled by higher oil prices, and that is a negative for bonds.
Prices were briefly buoyed in the morning by a government report that showed an unexpected drop in orders for durable goods last month. But some analysts see the drop as evidence that companies are merely postponing purchases until the new year.
"This market is nervous," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management. "Indeed, another round of Fed tightening during the first quarter of next year has already been priced into the Treasury market, judging from the spread between the two-year note and the Federal funds rate, and this will likely remain a fixture of the yield curve until evidence suggesting the economy is slowing to a noninflationary pace begins to accumulate."
Even though the "economy is in a full-tilt boogie," Mr. Pugliese said, the Fed will need time to reassess its options and nothing is expected to happen until the first quarter.
The drop in durable good orders yesterday was a result of an outsized 15.3 percent decline in new orders for electronic equipment, which was attributed in part to an earthquake in Taiwan that closed plants that make computer chips. Many market participants think that some of this decline was also related to concerns about the Year 2000 computer problem, which would imply that orders would most likely be replenished in the future.
"In any event," Mr. Fine said, "new orders for durable goods at the current time are considerably stronger than at the same point last year, which bodes well for future production and implies that rising interest rates have not yet suppressed demand in this interest-sensitive sector of the economy."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:
