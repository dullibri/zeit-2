HEADLINE: Criticism Of G.O.P. Is Growing

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The boasts of Congressional Republicans about their cost-cutting victories are ringing hollow to some well-known economists, financial analysts and corporate leaders, including some Republicans, who are expressing increasing alarm over Washington's new austerity and antitax orthodoxy.
Their critiques have grown sharper since last week, when President Obama signed his deficit reduction deal with Republicans and, a few days later, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the United States.
But even before that, macroeconomists and private sector forecasters were warning that the direction in which the new House Republican majority had pushed the White House and Congress this year -- for immediate spending cuts, no further stimulus measures and no tax increases, ever -- was wrong for addressing the nation's two main ills, a weak economy now and projections of unsustainably high federal debt in coming years.
Instead, these critics say, Washington should be focusing on stimulating the economy in the near term to induce people to spend money and create jobs, while settling on a long-term plan for spending cuts and tax increases to take effect only after the economy recovers. 
But Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail refuse to back down.
Economists disagree about the proper balance between spending cuts and tax increases in reducing a government's debts. Some studies by both liberal and conservative economists suggest that emphasizing spending cuts is better for long-term growth. But there are few if any precedents for paying down such a large debt solely through spending cuts.
Among those calling for a mix of cuts and revenue are onetime standard-bearers of Republican economic philosophy like Martin Feldstein, an adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary to President George W. Bush, underscoring the deepening divide between party establishment figures and the Tea Party-inspired Republicans in Congress and running for the White House.
''I think the U.S. has every chance of having a good year next year, but the politicians are doing their damnedest to prevent it from happening -- the Republicans are -- and the Democrats to my eternal bafflement have not stood their ground,'' Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a research firm, said in an interview.
As for the longer term, Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America, wrote this week that ''Given the scale of the debt problem, a credible plan requires both revenue enhancement measures and entitlement reform. Washington's recent debt deal did not include either.''
That is a common assessment, which may explain why Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, was defensive about Republicans' antitax absolutism in a memo to his colleagues on Monday.
''Over the next several months, there will be tremendous pressure on Congress to prove that S.& P.'s analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong. In short, there will be pressure to compromise on tax increases,'' Mr. Cantor wrote.
But, he added, ''We were not elected to raise taxes or take more money out of the pockets of hardworking families and business people.''
Republican candidates share that fervor: in their Iowa debate Thursday night, all eight participants raised their hands when asked who would reject a long-term debt reduction package that had $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in revenue increases.
Although many forecasters criticize S.& P. for downgrading the United States, they share the company's disappointment that the budget deal fell short of the ''grand bargain'' Mr. Obama tried to negotiate with House Speaker John A. Boehner to provide stimulus and cut annual deficits up to $4 trillion over 10 years.
Along with annual caps on discretionary spending for domestic and military programs that ended up in the final deal, Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner were also exploring short-term stimulus measures and, for the long term, revenue increases and future savings from Social Security and from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, whose growing costs are stoking projections of mounting debt. But Mr. Boehner quit the talks over taxes. And until Republicans budge on revenue, Democrats refuse to consider entitlement cuts.
Of course, Republicans can point to support among some conservative economists. John B. Taylor, a professor at Stanford and an adviser to Republican presidents and presidential candidates, said in an interview that temporary stimulus measures were counterproductive, and for long-term debt reduction, ''I would try very hard to make it work without revenues.''
But Mr. Feldstein, who was chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, was among the first in 2008 to call for stimulus spending and recently has advocated raising revenue. He would do so by limiting ''tax expenditures,'' the costly tax breaks for corporations and individuals that include the mortgage-interest deduction -- an idea recommended in December by a majority of Mr. Obama's fiscal commission and lately by the president.
''I think Republicans should recognize that is a way of raising revenue without hurting incentives by higher marginal tax rates,'' Mr. Feldstein said.
S.& P. based its downgrade and its negative outlook for America's credit rating partly on the assumption that Bush-era tax cuts for high incomes would be extended past their 2012 expiration, ''because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues.'' S.& P. said it could change its outlook to stable if the tax cuts ended.
Yet Republicans insist that taxes will not be on the table for the bipartisan Congressional committee created by the deficit deal. The panel must propose additional savings by Nov. 23 to fulfill the deal's promise of up to $2.4 trillion in savings over 10 years.
Assuming Democrats then refuse to consider entitlement savings, only discretionary spending would be left -- less than 40 percent of the budget, encompassing education, research, military, infrastructure and more. Last winter House Republicans forced Mr. Obama to agree to cut such spending by $183 billion over a decade. The deficit deal would cut nearly $1 trillion more.
The prospect of further reductions worries forecasters. Jerry Webman, chief economist of OppenheimerFunds, wrote in an analysis that while the cuts were not huge this year or next, ''they are nonetheless contrary to what would be expected in a fragile economic environment.''
In separate interviews, Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, and Laurence H. Meyer, its co-founder and a former Federal Reserve governor, called the reductions ''job-killing spending cuts'' -- playing on Republicans' mantra against ''job-killing tax increases.''
Mr. Prakken said tighter spending would ''slow economic growth unless it was offset with lower interest rates through the Fed.'' But with interest rates already near zero, the best the Fed could do this week was signal that rates would remain ultralow well into 2013.
Low borrowing costs, analysts say, are more reason to bolster the economy now.
''At the very least,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, Congress should renew for another year two measures that expire after 2011 -- payroll tax relief for employees and extended unemployment compensation -- as Mr. Obama has proposed. If either expired, Mr. Zandi said, that could shave roughly a half-percentage point from economic growth next year.
Republicans are resistant. And Democrats are too cowed to counter much, given polls that show many Americans believe Mr. Obama's 2009-10 stimulus package did not work, despite studies to the contrary.
A Democratic Congressional adviser, granted anonymity to discuss party deliberations, said: ''We're at a loss to figure out a way to articulate the argument in a way that doesn't get us pegged as tax-and-spenders.''
In a column in The Washington Post on Friday, Bill Gross, who runs the giant bond-trading firm Pimco, lashed out at Republicans and ''co-opted Democrats'' for setting aside widely accepted economic theory.
''An anti-Keynesian, budget-balancing immediacy imparts a constrictive noose around whatever demand remains alive and kicking,'' he wrote. ''Washington hassles over debt ceilings instead of job creation in the mistaken belief that a balanced budget will produce a balanced economy. It will not.''

HEADLINE: The Roots of the Unrest in Britain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Shaken, Britain Debates Riots and Fears They Set a Pattern'' (front page, Aug. 11):
The current conflagrations in several of England's cities might seem to an American audience to have emerged out of thin air. For someone like me, who lived in London for 15 years (1973-1988) and experienced the riots of 1985, these events are neither surprising nor inexplicable. 
However, Prime Minister David Cameron's knee-jerk reactions and much of the reporting on the disturbances leave the impression that the events are random, that the participants are mere ''thugs'' and that there is no real connection between the uprisings and the political-social context.
In fact, while it would be hard to ignore the nihilism implicit in some of the participants' actions, the areas in which the flames burn highest are those in which decades of deprivation, ''benign neglect'' and political cynicism are most obvious.
We celebrated the events that we have labeled the ''Arab spring'' as demonstrations for freedom, while recoiling from those in England of the past week. The latter events have been ugly and disturbing, but could it be that they are no less a symbol of a populace clamoring for some kind of relief?
JON McGILL Baltimore, Aug. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
During the rioting that gripped England, a bit of telling irony was seen at a shopping mall, in which widespread looting had struck.
Rampaging mobs had broken into virtually every shop there, stealing everything from designer clothing to electronics. One store stood alone, however, its windows intact and its goods untouched.
It was a bookstore, wherein perhaps the best hope for a better future lay ignored.
ARNOLD GROSSMAN Denver, Aug. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
Having grown up in Margaret Thatcher's Britain and emigrated to the United States, I sympathize with much of what Richard Sennett and Saskia Sassen say in ''Cameron's Broken Windows'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 11), including some of their fears about possible violence in impoverished areas of America.
But I think they are wrong about the ''desire of many politicians to solve economic and social ills by reducing the power of the state.'' The increase on both sides of the Atlantic in state surveillance and extraordinary security measures suggests no reduction in state power. What we are seeing is a reduction in state responsibility to help ensure healthy and sustainable societies.

HEADLINE: Magical Unrealism: In the Iowa debate, Republicans fled from the truth about the damage caused by their party

 BODY:
There was nothing particularly surprising about the shrill skirmishing at the ideological edges of Thursday night's Republican presidential debate in Iowa. What was shocking were the antics in the center. 
In full public view, the party's mainstream jumped the tracks of reality on issues of spending and taxes, brightly illustrating the ruinous magical thinking that has led to a downgrade of the nation's credit and invited a double-dip recession. When asked if they would reject a deal to cut the deficit that had 10 times the amount of spending cuts as it had tax increases, the hands of all eight candidates went up. Even a tincture of new revenue, though mixed with huge cuts in government spending, would be too much for the modern Republican Party.
The raised hands included those of Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney, two former governors who have proved that they know better. Mr. Huntsman was the only one on the stage who said he would have accepted last week's budget deal and the only one to point out that Washington should never even consider defaulting.
Saying as much is already Tea Party heresy, so why not take the next logical step and admit that the nation's finances are unsustainable in the long term without some tax increases? Even Mr. Huntsman was unwilling to take the slightest risk of offending the rigid and unforgiving Republican Party primary electorate.
Mr. Romney derided the budget deal as ''Mr. Obama's dog food'' and said he would not eat it, perhaps hoping the public has already forgotten that it was really the deal demanded by the Congressional leaders of his party. (Speaker John Boehner said last week the deal was ''98 percent of what I wanted.'' We'd love to know what the remaining 2 percent is.)
Rejecting compromise was not the way Mr. Romney governed. He balanced the Massachusetts budget with new income from $269 million in closed tax loopholes, and $271 million in increased fees. He has claimed unconvincingly that those were not taxes, but it turns out that his administration boasted about them to the bond rating agencies in 2004 and 2005, and his state won an upgrade by demonstrating fiscal prudence. Now he is repudiating that approach at the federal level.
That has been the nature of every Republican debate this cycle: deny the truth or tell an outrageous lie with such bellicosity that no one dares to challenge it.
Representative Michele Bachmann, for example, said the credit downgrade was because the government could not pay its debt. Standard and Poor's actually said it was because lawmakers like her did not take a default seriously. Representative Ron Paul ridiculously claimed that the United States is bankrupt. Tim Pawlenty said President Obama had no plan to reduce social insurance spending, conveniently forgetting that Mr. Boehner walked away from the president's overly generous offer to reduce that spending in exchange for revenue increases.
The Republican Party has been led into its current cul-de-sac by manipulative officials who would not tell voters the truth about the government's finances. It will remain there if even its ''moderate'' leaders refuse to break the pattern.

HEADLINE: Health Law Is Dealt Blow By a Court On Mandate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Kevin Sack contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The provision in President Obama's health care law requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face tax penalties was ruled unconstitutional on Friday by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta.
It was the first appellate review to find the provision unconstitutional -- a previous federal appeals court upheld the law -- and some lawyers said that the decision made it more likely that the fate of the health care law would ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The court found that Congress exceeded its powers to regulate commerce when it decided to require people to buy health insurance, a provision of the health care law known as the ''individual mandate.'' But the court held that while that provision was unconstitutional, the rest of the wide-ranging law could stand. 
A 2-to-1 majority ruled that the mandate was beyond Congress's power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, writing that ''what Congress cannot do under the Commerce Clause is mandate that individuals enter into contracts with private insurance companies for the purchase of an expensive product from the time they are born until the time they die.''
The 11th Circuit case may have been the most closely watched of the health law cases wending their ways through the courts, in part because its plaintiffs included Republican governors and attorneys general from 26 states. But it was just the second of at least three appellate reviews. The Obama administration prevailed in the first round in June, when the individual mandate was found to be constitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. The next opinion is expected shortly from the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va.
Supporters and opponents of the law, known as the Affordable Care Act, expect that the Supreme Court will eventually decide the issue. Some lawyers said the fact that the Atlanta court created a conflict among courts of appeals made it more likely that the Supreme Court would hear the case as early as its next term, which starts in October.
The health care law -- passed in 2010 after more than a year of wrangling, and frequently criticized by Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress -- is intended to insure 32 million Americans by mandating that most people obtain health insurance, subsidizing policies for the poor and requiring insurers to accept people with pre-existing health problems.
Supporters of those provisions, which take effect in 2014, argue that without the insurance mandate, which brings more people into the insurance pool, it is unreasonable to require insurers to cover all applicants regardless of their health status.
The Cincinnati court ruled that the mandate was constitutional. The Atlanta court disagreed, in a majority opinion written by Chief Judge Joel F. Dubina, who was appointed by the first President George Bush, and Judge Frank M. Hull, who was named by President Bill Clinton. Judge Stanley Marcus, another Clinton appointee, wrote a dissent.
The majority opinion said, ''This economic mandate represents a wholly novel and potentially unbounded assertion of Congressional authority: the ability to compel Americans to purchase an expensive health insurance product they have elected not to buy, and to make them re-purchase that insurance product every month for their entire lives.''
Their opinion overturned the part of a lower court ruling that would have thrown out the entire health care law: they ruled that while the individual mandate was unconstitutional, the rest of the law could stand.
The White House and the Department of Justice said they were confident that the law was constitutional.

HEADLINE: As Dizzying Week Ends On Wall St., Dangers Linger

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julie Creswell and Ron Lieber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
One of the most tumultuous weeks on Wall Street ended on Friday with the markets not that far from where they started, but with worries about the United States economy and the threat of a financial crisis in Europe undiminished.
The main American stock indexes finished the week down less than 2 percent after a second consecutive day of gains on Friday. Although there was a sense of relief that the economy had not fallen off a cliff -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index started the week plunging nearly 6.7 percent -- there was little to celebrate as new data showed consumer sentiment had sunk below levels seen during the financial crisis three years ago.
The week ended on a quiet note, but many think that the Wall Street roller coaster ride is likely to continue -- and that there may be more stomach-churning drops before the cars return to the platform.
''Heightened volatility is here to stay,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's equity research. 
''The markets are much more interconnected than they have ever been, and new players are exacerbating the swings,'' he added. Investors' memories of 2008 are ''very fresh and will cause them to sell first and ask questions later.''
Further undermining investor confidence is the fact that nearly all of the Western markets appear to be moving in lockstep, undergoing disruptive episodes simultaneously. That makes it difficult for investors to find a safe place to park their money -- hence the rush to cash and other havens like United States bonds and gold -- and stirs even more anxiety about interconnected risks between the European and American debt crises.
''This has been an unbelievable week. You just had fear totally take over,'' said Scott Wren, the senior equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors. ''And the problems have not been solved. European sovereign debt issues are not going to go away. The debt and deficit situation is not going to go away.''
On both sides of the Atlantic, investors had been bracing for a sell-off on Monday, after Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its top credit rating. The S.& P. plunged 6.66 percent. Tuesday, the Federal Reserve provided investors with a whiff of relief when it pledged to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years. The S.& P. leaped 4.7 percent on the news.
The European Central Bank also moved to steady the markets, buying Italian and Spanish bonds to calm investor concerns that those countries would not be able to pay their debts.
The rally did not last long. By Wednesday morning, American and European bank stocks were under attack as investors feared a repeat of the crisis or another recession. The S.& P. lost 4.4 percent.
On Thursday, upbeat earnings news and reports of a ban on short-selling by several European countries, provided relief. The S.& P. jumped 4.6 percent. Friday, upbeat retail sales helped break the up and down cycle and the S.& P. was up half a percent, ending the week 1.7 percent lower.
''The markets are having a lot of trouble assessing the full extent of this,'' said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief United States equity strategist. ''We are used to volatility, but these intraday swings are just remarkable.''
Analysts and others on Wall Street who were doing a postmortem on the turbulence had plenty to choose from. New data suggested the United States economy was worsening and could even slip back into a recession, forcing investors to scale back their growth expectations. The downgrade of government bonds by Standard & Poor's further rattled confidence among consumers and businesses. On Friday, despite the rising retail sales, preliminary data for one of the leading barometers of consumer confidence fell in August to its lowest levels since May 1980.
In addition, there are growing concerns about the solvency of European governments and fears that troubles in its financial system could spread to American shores.
Still, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of large companies on the Continent, fell 2.9 percent last week and is down nearly 12 percent this year. That is nearly double the 6.3 percent decline of the S.& P. 500 since January.
Gold, which hit new nominal highs above $1,800 this week, was down 0.85 percent, to $1,733.90 an ounce on Friday, an indication that investors felt like taking on a bit more risk for the time being.
They kept buying Treasuries on signs of the spreading debt crisis in Europe and the Fed's plan to leave interest rates at their current low levels. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was lower, to 2.24 percent from 2.34 percent on Thursday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index swung alternately up and down more than 4 percent each day from Monday through Thursday. Never before in the history of the S.& P. index, which goes back to 1928, have there been alternating gains and losses of more than 4 percent in four days. In most years, there were no such days at all.
The broad swings have occurred amid heavy trading volumes. Before this month, an average of 7.5 billion shares traded each day across all United States equities. This month, however, trading volumes have climbed as high as 18 billion shares.
A big portion of the market volume this month, analysts said, was driven by institutional investors including pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and mutual funds that use complex risk models and algorithmic analysis in trading. Selling was initiated by those firms as they recalibrated their portfolios to respond to fluctuations in global currency markets, said Tim Quast, the founder of ModernNetworks IR, a consulting firm that advises companies about market trading.
Analysts also pointed to high-frequency trading firms, which employ computerized, lightning-fast buying and selling, as contributing to the surging volumes.
''The biggest firms probably do over 1 billion shares a day -- that would be Getco and Tradebot -- and in this volatility they could be doing double or triple that,'' said Larry Tabb, chief executive of the Tabb Group, a financial services consulting firm. ''If their models are right, they're probably making lots of money, but I'm not sure if they're the ones to blame for the increased volatility.''
Others pointed at leveraged exchange-traded funds as a potential source for the increased volatility. Those funds, which try to achieve a daily return that is double or triple that of a particular market index, often need to trade heavily at the end of each day to account for new money coming or going from individual investors.
Josh Lukeman, who heads E.T.F. and index swap trading at Credit Suisse in the Americas, discounted that theory, noting that the leveraged funds did not trade enough to have any outsize impact. He did note that short-term traders would often buy or sell indexes around 3 p.m., hoping to get in front of the trades that leveraged E.T.F.'s have to make before the close of trading that day. But he said he doubted that that alone could explain the increased volatility in recent weeks.
Brian M. Youngberg, an analyst for Edward Jones, said, ''It was a Jekyll and Hyde week.''
''The global economy is so uncertain right now investors are changing how they feel about the outlook,'' he said. And as markets drop, ''some investors view that as an opportunity to buy some stocks at a cheap price. The level of volatility was extraordinary.''

HEADLINE: Boycott Campaign Donations!

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, has always been the kind of boss who wears his heart on his sleeve. So it came as no surprise to Starbucks employees when, on Monday, he sent out a long, passionate, companywide e-mail entitled ''Leading Through Uncertain Times.''
In it, he wrote about his frustration over ''the lack of cooperation and irresponsibility among elected officials as they have put partisan agendas before the people's agenda'' -- creating an enormous crisis of confidence in the process. He said that Starbucks had a responsibility ''to act in ways that can ease the collective anxiety inside and outside the company.'' It needed to continue creating jobs. It had to maintain its generous package of employee benefits. And it was critical, Schultz wrote, for employees ''to earn our customers' trust by being respectful of their own life situations -- whatever it may be.'' 
No, the surprise wasn't the e-mail; it was what happened next. Although he has made his share of campaign contributions -- ''to candidates in both parties,'' he told me on Friday -- Schultz is hardly a political activist. Yet the response to his e-mail -- not only from within the company but among a group of some 50 business leaders he shared it with -- was so overwhelming that it galvanized him.
Even before sending out the e-mail, an idea had begun forming in his mind about how to force the country's dysfunctional politicians to stop putting party over country and act like the leaders they are supposed to be. By Friday morning, when we spoke, Schultz was not only ready to unveil his idea, but to spearhead a movement, if that's what it took.
In effect, Schultz thinks the country should go on strike against its politicians. ''The fundamental problem,'' he said, ''is that the lens through which Congress approaches issues is re-election. The lifeblood of their re-election campaigns is political contributions.'' Schultz wants his countrymen -- big donors and small; corporations and unions -- to stop making political contributions in presidential and Congressional campaigns. Simple as that. Economists like to talk about how incentives change behavior. Schultz is proposing that Americans give Washington an incentive to begin acting responsibly on their behalf. It's a beautiful idea.
To Schultz, the debt-ceiling crisis -- so destructive to the country, yet entirely manufactured for political gain -- was merely the final straw. ''The debt crisis is really the symbol of a larger problem, which is that our leaders are not leading,'' he said. The real crisis, he believes, is a crisis of leadership, both in the White House and in Congress, which is draining confidence. ''America's leaders need to put their feet in the shoes of working Americans,'' he said. '' Instead, all they think about is their own political self-interest.''
Schultz began doing some research. In 2000, he said, total campaign contributions, to all politicians, amounted to $3 billion. Four years later, it was $4 billion. In the 2008 election year, he said, ''it went up another billion, to $5 billion. I was astonished.'' He soon began to connect those numbers to a question he'd been asking himself: ''What is it going to take for Washington to listen to us?'' The answer now seemed obvious: money. ''It is a sad state of affairs that the only thing they'll listen to is money,'' he acknowledged. But if that is what it takes, so be it.
The contribution boycott, as Schultz envisions it, would be completely bipartisan; indeed, it would have to be for it to work. Schultz isn't calling on Washington to come up with solutions that are aligned with his political leanings (which are Democratic). Rather, he wants solutions, agreed to by both parties, that will help get the country back on its feet.
He believes Congress needs to come back from the August recess now, instead of waiting until September. Then, he says, the president and Congress should hammer out a debt deal, which will restore confidence. And finally, and most importantly, they should start focusing ''maniacally'' on the nation's most pressing concern: job creation. Once they've done that, the boycott would be lifted.
What I particularly like about Schultz's idea is that it is not just another plea for compromise and civility, which does nothing to affect political behavior. It is hardheaded and practical, the kind of idea you would expect from a good businessman. Although it would require contributors from both the left and right to join arms, it seems to me that there are enough people in both parties who are fed up enough to give this a try. He's already lined up one organization, Democracy 21, to support the idea; he's searching for more.
Is Schultz's idea a long shot? Yes. Is it worth trying? You bet it is.
I made a math error in my column a few weeks ago about the Federal Reserve's settlement with Wells Fargo over mortgage fraud. I calculated the maximum amount Wells Fargo would spend compensating defrauded borrowers at $20 million. It's actually $200 million.

HIGHLIGHT: Japan then, the world now.

 BODY:
Matt Rognlie has been doing a series of posts on how the academic literature on liquidity traps relates to recent Fed actions, and why some kind of credible commitment to expansion after the liquidity trap ends is necessary to gain traction. He cites fine work by Eggertsson and Woodford, Svensson, and more.
However, I think it might worth pointing out that this whole line of thought began with this paper (pdf), which declares early on that 
a liquidity trap fundamentally involves a credibility problem-but it is the inverse of the usual one, in which central bankers have difficulty convincing private agents of their commitment to price stability. In a liquidity trap, the problem is that the markets believe that the central bank will target price stability, given the chance, and hence that any current monetary expansion is merely transitory. The traditional view that monetary policy is ineffective in a liquidity trap, and that fiscal expansion is the only way out, must therefore be qualified: monetary policy will in fact be effective if the central bank can credibly promise to be irresponsible, to seek a higher future price level. 
By the way, it's worth reading Ken Rogoff's discussion at the end, in part for his confident assertion that raising the rate of growth of the monetary base would be enough to increase inflation. Actually, Japan tried that a few years later, without success; nor has the surge in the US monetary base since 2008 been either inflationary or indeed effective. All of which is exactly as the model predicted.

HIGHLIGHT: In this edition: debt ceiling deals, debt downgrades and recall elections. 

 BODY:
Reactions
It's been pretty busy here at FiveThirtyEight, and it's been a while since we last wandered around the Web to get a sense of how FiveThirtyEight has fit into the larger conversation. So, first let's take a stroll all the way back to the debt ceiling fracas.
After the deal was struck, and Democratic supporters came close to mutiny, FiveThirtyEight highlighted some details in the deal that may make it somewhat more palatable to the left. For instance, a chunk of the spending cuts may come from defense. 
The New Republic's Jonathan Chait agreed with this analysis. Mr. Chait also pointed out that Democrats' biggest disappointment with the deal - the lack of new revenues - should be mollified by the fact that taxes are scheduled to go up anyway. The Hill's Sam Youngman also had a good rundown of the White House's view of the deal.
The Atlantic's Joshua Green, however, threw some cold water on the expectation that significant cuts in defense spending will ever really materialize. And in a helpful roundup of reactions to the defense-trimming parts of the deal, our colleague James Dao found even more skeptics. 
After the debt ceiling was raised, the next big story was Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the country's credit rating, indicating that the rating agency felt it was less safe to invest in U.S. debt. FiveThirtyEight pointed out that Standard & Poor's track record in predicting such things isn't exactly stellar. 
In an illuminating article that explains why it was S. & P. that pulled the trigger on the downgrade and not Moody's, Reuters's Felix Salmon disagreed with some of FiveThirtyEight's criticisms of S. & P. Mr. Salmon writes:
"Silver's main thesis seems to be that the markets are a better guide to the markets than the credit rating agencies are. Which is true as far as it goes, but misses what it is that the ratings agencies in general, and S&P in particular, actually do. They're a datapoint, not a financial advisor: ratings are more of a constant, in contrast to bond prices, which are highly variable. If you want a guide to bond prices, look at bond prices. If you want a guide to default probabilities, however, then the ratings agencies are still a good place to start."
The blog Modeled Behavior published an interview Adam Ozimek did with David Levey, the former director of sovereign ratings for Moody's. In that interview, Mr. Levey disagreed with Mr. Salmon's characterization of Standard & Poor's. The interview gets fairly technical, but is worth a read.
After the downgrade came the recall elections in Wisconsin, where Democrats won two of the six seats they contested and came up one seat short of taking over the majority in Wisconsin's State Senate. FiveThirtyEight tried to game out what the recall results portend if Democrats there try to recall Gov. Scott Walker. Nate's conclusion: a gubernatorial recall election would probably be very close.
Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post looked at how the Democrats' failure to take the Wisconsin Senate affects the labor movement, which was one of the main groups pushing the recall effort.
And finally, our comment-of-the-half-month award (which hasn't been given out in far longer than a half month) goes to Larry Eisenberg from New York City for his poetic contribution to FiveThirtyEight. My favorite of Mr. Eisenberg's collected works (almost 10 limericks on this blog alone and a few volumes worth of verse elsewhere at nytimes.com) was in response to "What the White House Left on the Table," FiveThirtyEight's post suggesting that President Obama could have gotten a better deal in the debt ceiling debate. Here's Mr. Eisenberg:
O set up a Maginot line,
Unbreachable by his design,
But it did not withstand
The Tea Party demand,
For it lacked a provision for spine.
More of Mr. Eisenberg's limericks can be found here, here, here, here, here and here.

HEADLINE: The General Theory of Anti-Mulliganism

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And what it says about Rick Perry.

 BODY:
One of the odder sideshows of the Lesser Depression has been the ongoing crusade of Chicago's Casey Mulligan, who has repeatedly tried to convince everyone via his blog that contrary to all appearances, we are not suffering from an overall lack of demand. One of his arguments was that since employment of teenagers continues to expand in the summer, when those teenagers are in fact able to work, supply must be the constraining factor. Another was that the growth in Texas employment similarly shows that demand can't be the factor limiting national employment. The latter argument, of course, has new relevance now that Rick Perry is going to run on his alleged economic miracle.
So this seems like a good time to lay out something I've been thinking about for a while: the general theory of anti-Mulliganism.
Here's the question: why do patterns of employment over time that are, in fact, normally supply-driven continue to be visible even during a demand-side slump? And here's the answer: businesses make long-term decisions that influence hiring patterns over time, and those decisions continue to shape their behavior even when there is a surplus of labor.
Start with seasonal employment: there are a lot of businesses that base their whole seasonal structure on the normal availability of cheap young workers in the summer. Seaside resorts, for example, are designed to function with college kids waiting tables in the summer; they'll continue to offer student-suitable jobs in the summer, and only in the summer, even if we're in the middle of a recession that has lots of middle-aged men also unemployed in August.
And now Texas: there has been a long-term process of employment shifting to Sunbelt states, Texas included, largely because of the availability of cheap labor, which in turn has a lot to do with a low cost of housing. On a long-term basis, people have been willing to move to Texas despite relatively low nominal wages because housing is cheap and the cost of living relatively low. Businesses, in turn, have been steadily moving to cheap-housing states to take advantage of those low wages. 
And decisions about moving facilities, or where to open new facilities, have a long lead time. That is, there's a lot of momentum in the process, which keeps employment shifting to Texas and away from the Northeast even in the midst of a slump that depresses employment everywhere. So it's not surprising that Texas would have positive job growth at a time when overall employment is flat - it's just the underlying trend on which the cycle is overlaid.
Wait: there's more. Given this long-term supply-driven trend, the fact of positive job growth does not at all mean that Texas has been recession-proof. Since the jobs are in effect following the labor force rather than the other way around, Texas needs job creation at a faster pace than the Northeast to achieve similar labor market outcomes. That's why the "Texas miracle" hasn't prevented a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, smaller than the rise in California or Florida - which had huge housing bubbles - but if anything less than the rise in New York and Massachusetts.
There's more to the Texas story, especially the role of the oil sector. But in general, you want to think of the regional impacts of the recession as a demand shock overlaid on supply-driven trends. And neither the continued existence of summer jobs nor relatively rapid job growth in the same states that had rapid job growth before the recession are at all surprising.

HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry enters the presidential race on Saturday with one important strength: his ability to fund-raise.

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
When Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announces his presidential bid on Saturday, he'll have one important advantage: his formidable fund-raising skills. Nicholas Confessore reports on the prowess he showed in raising millions for his gubernatorial runs and the efforts already in motion to woo uncommitted donors.

        
Even as many economists warn the spending cuts and lack of tax increases and stimulus funding Washington is pursuing to reduce the deficit are the wrong answer, Republicans are steadfastly defending their austerity measures, Jackie Calmes says.

        
Mitt Romneyis worth between $85 million and $264 million, according to disclosure reports filed on Friday. Nicholas Confessore reports that it's unclear how Mr. Romney - who contributed his own money to his 2008 presidential campaign but has not yet given to this campaign - fared financially amidst market flux in recent years.

        
Following a debate filled with unmasked animosity, Republican hopefuls competed for attention in Iowa on Friday ahead of Saturday's straw poll, Jeff Zeleny and Michael D. Shear report. The candidates greeted voters and rallied supporters, and even Sarah Palin stopped by the Iowa State Fair to join in the spectacle.
Weekly Address:

        
President Obama blamed partisan gridlock for Washington's continued inability to address the nation's economic troubles in his weekly address, calling for getting construction workers back on the job, finalizing deals to export American goods and extending the payroll tax cut. With lawmakers back in their districts for the August recess, Mr. Obama continued his refrain of urging Americans to share their frustrations with their representatives.
Around the Web:

        
A group that paid $40,000 for an ad supporting Mr. Perry for president doesn't like the teasing it's taking from the Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert and his super PAC, Politico reports. The group, Jobs for Iowa, challenged Mr. Colbert to a tractor pull at Saturday's straw poll.
Washington Happenings:

        
With Congress in recess, the city has hit a lull, and the focus is on Ames, Iowa, where the presidential straw poll will be held on Saturday.

When Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announces his presidential bid on Saturday, he'll have one important advantage: his formidable fund-raising skills. Nicholas Confessore reports on the prowess he showed in raising millions for his gubernatorial runs and the efforts already in motion to woo uncommitted donors.

        
Even as many economists warn the spending cuts and lack of tax increases and stimulus funding Washington is pursuing to reduce the deficit are the wrong answer, Republicans are steadfastly defending their austerity measures, Jackie Calmes says.

        
Mitt Romneyis worth between $85 million and $264 million, according to disclosure reports filed on Friday. Nicholas Confessore reports that it's unclear how Mr. Romney - who contributed his own money to his 2008 presidential campaign but has not yet given to this campaign - fared financially amidst market flux in recent years.

        
Following a debate filled with unmasked animosity, Republican hopefuls competed for attention in Iowa on Friday ahead of Saturday's straw poll, Jeff Zeleny and Michael D. Shear report. The candidates greeted voters and rallied supporters, and even Sarah Palin stopped by the Iowa State Fair to join in the spectacle.
Weekly Address:

        
President Obama blamed partisan gridlock for Washington's continued inability to address the nation's economic troubles in his weekly address, calling for getting construction workers back on the job, finalizing deals to export American goods and extending the payroll tax cut. With lawmakers back in their districts for the August recess, Mr. Obama continued his refrain of urging Americans to share their frustrations with their representatives.
Around the Web:

        
A group that paid $40,000 for an ad supporting Mr. Perry for president doesn't like the teasing it's taking from the Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert and his super PAC, Politico reports. The group, Jobs for Iowa, challenged Mr. Colbert to a tractor pull at Saturday's straw poll.
Washington Happenings:

        
With Congress in recess, the city has hit a lull, and the focus is on Ames, Iowa, where the presidential straw poll will be held on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Internal Strife Threatens Cause Of Libyan Rebels

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and C. J. CHIVERS; David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Tripoli, and C. J. Chivers from Zintan, Libya.

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- Saddled with infighting and undermined by the occasionally ruthless and undisciplined behavior of its fighters, the six-month-old rebel uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi is showing signs of sliding from a struggle to overthrow an autocrat into a murkier contest between factions and tribes.
The increase in discord and factionalism is undermining the effort to overthrow Colonel Qaddafi, and it comes immediately after recognition of the rebel government by the Western powers, including the United States, potentially giving the rebels access to billions of dollars in frozen Libyan assets, and the chance to purchase more modern weaponry.
The infighting could also erode support for the rebels among members of the NATO alliance, which faces a September deadline for renewing its air campaign amid growing unease about the war's costs and direction. That air support has been a factor in every significant rebel military goal, including fighting on Saturday in which rebel forces were challenging pro-Qaddafi forces in or near three critical towns: Brega, an oil port in the east, Zawiya, on the outskirts of Tripoli, and Gharyan, an important gateway to southern Libya. There were also clashes a few miles from the main border crossing into neighboring Tunisia, residents told Reuters. 
While the rebels have sought to maintain a clean image and to portray themselves as fighting to establish a secular democracy, several recent acts of revenge have cast their ranks in a less favorable light. They have also raised the possibility that any rebel victory over Colonel Qaddafi could disintegrate into the sort of tribal tensions that have plagued Libya for centuries.
In recent weeks, rebel fighters in Libya's western mountains and around the coastal city of Misurata have lashed out at civilians because their tribes supported Colonel Qaddafi, looting mountain villages and emptying a civilian neighborhood. In the rebels' provisional capital, Benghazi, renegade fighters assassinated their top military commander, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes, apparently in revenge for his previous role as Colonel Qaddafi's security chief.
In response, the chief of General Younes's powerful tribe threatened to retaliate against those responsible, setting off a crisis in the rebels' governing council, whose members were dismissed en masse last week.
The rebels' Western backers have become alarmed at the growing rift between supporters of a group of rebels who have coalesced into a relatively unified army and the others who effectively remain a civilian band of militia fighters.
In the short term, the retaliation can serve to fortify Colonel Qaddafi's power by reinforcing the fear that a rebel victory would bring reprisals against the many who participated in the colonel's political machine and enjoyed his patronage. More broadly, the moral clarity of six months ago, when Colonel Qaddafi's forces were bearing down on Benghazi and he was threatening to wipe out anyone who dared oppose him there, has been muddied.
In an interview, Jeffrey D. Feltman, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, said that concerns about the rebels might be overblown. He acknowledged that there were some ''disturbing reports'' from Benghazi and the rebel front lines but credited the rebels' governing Transitional National Council with swift steps to address the concerns. He noted that the rebel leadership -- itself a heterodox mix of recent defectors and their former longtime foes -- had ordered an end to abuses against loyalist tribes in the mountains, and he characterized the shake-up of the council as a move to establish a level of transparency and accountability without precedent in Libya.
After some initial gunfire by fighters from the family of General Younes, the council appeared to have persuaded his tribe, the Obeidi, to put their faith in an investigation by the rebel authorities, Mr. Feltman said. ''They were able to avert a real cycle of violence,'' he said. ''I would give them a passing grade, given where they are starting from.'' He added, ''They have made commitments to us that you would never get out of Qaddafi.''
Still, questions remain about the rebel leadership's control over its fighters. ''I think that is a question they are asking themselves,'' Mr. Feltman said, noting recent moves by the council to rein in various freewheeling rebel militias, which often are formed along town, neighborhood or tribal lines.
But an Obama administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, acknowledged some doubts. ''I think the jury is out on how unified the command will be,'' the official said.
Just two weeks before the mysterious assassination of General Younes raised those questions, the United States formally recognized the rebels' Transitional National Council as Libya's legitimate government, potentially allowing it to tap about $3.5 billion in liquid assets and, over the long term, the rest of the $30 billion of the Qaddafi government's frozen investments.
United States officials say that rebel leaders have pledged to allocate the money in a way that is ''transparent'' and ''inclusive,'' and that the United States is encouraging its use for health care, electricity and other services in rebel-held territory. But some funds could also be used to buy weapons for the poorly trained and equipped rebel forces.
Libya before the revolt was in many ways a social tinderbox. The country, a former Italian colony long dominated by rural Bedouin tribes, had little experience of national unity before Colonel Qaddafi came to power 42 years ago. Many Libyans relied on tribal connections more than civil law for justice and security.
Colonel Qaddafi's centralized state and oil economy deepened many divisions, rewarding or punishing both individuals and tribes primarily on the basis of their loyalty to the government.
The uprising initially broke out across the country, even driving the police from the streets of the capital, Tripoli. But Colonel Qaddafi and one of his sons, Seif al-Islam, immediately vowed to stamp out the ''rats'' they held responsible, predicting from the first nights that the rebellion would become ''a civil war.'' Then militias commanded by two other Qaddafi sons, Muatassim and Khamis, re-established control of the capital by firing live ammunition into unarmed crowds, as the International Criminal Court attested, the first steps toward fulfilling the Qaddafis' prophecy of a civil war pitting east against west.
Many supporters of the rebels now speak of exacting their own revenge against Colonel Qaddafi's clan.
Outside Tripoli, the Qaddafi stronghold, about 500 civilian refugees from the rebel advance have gathered in a makeshift camp that formerly housed Chinese construction workers. ''If you love Qaddafi in Yafran, they will kill you,'' said Abdel Kareem Omar, 25, a dental student from a village of the Mashaashia tribe near that rebel city in the western mountains.
''The rebels stole our furniture, our food, our animals and burned our homes,'' he said, vowing that he, too, would take up arms. ''To protect my people,'' he said.
In a recent conversation with two journalists, one man in the western mountains said his neighbors often spoke of capturing Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi alive, so they could chop off his fingers. And low-level rebel leaders talk openly of forbidding Colonel Qaddafi's supporters from returning to their homes in rebel-held ground.
Bands of rebel fighters hunted people suspected of being Qaddafi loyalists around Benghazi for months before the killing of General Younes. And on the front lines, rebels in the coastal city of Misurata have vowed to take revenge on the black-skinned Libyans from Tawergha, accusing them of committing atrocities and driving them out of their neighborhood.
In the mountains in western Libya, local men have ransacked and burned homes in at least five villages or cities where residents had supported Colonel Qaddafi or his troops. Many of the victims were members of the pro-Qaddafi Mashaashia tribe, which the rebels openly loathe.
The fear holding together the pro-Qaddafi side is palpable. Asked in an unguarded moment about his plans, Musa Ibrahim, a member of Colonel Qaddafi's tribe and a spokesman for his government, blurted out, ''If I am alive, you mean?''
The rebel leadership in Benghazi continues to insist that it can reconcile the differences among Libyan factions and tribes. The governing council calls itself ''transitional,'' and it has pledged to form a new broadly representative unity government based in Tripoli if Colonel Qaddafi leaves power.
Part of the challenge facing the rebels is the pervasive reach of the Qaddafi political machine.
''In a dictatorship that lasts 42 years, it is almost inevitable that almost everyone to some extent needed to participate in the 'revolution' -- how else could you raise a family, have a job, etc.?'' Diederik Vandewalle, a Libya expert at Dartmouth College wrote in an e-mail. ''That in a sense is the real tragedy of the way the Qaddafi system implicated everyone. And so it leaves virtually everyone open to retribution.''
Members of the tribes close to Colonel Qaddafi -- like his own tribe, the Qaddafa, or the larger Maghraha, and small tribes associated with them -- may face the greatest danger from ''tribal revenge,'' George Joffe, a Libya expert at the University of Cambridge, wrote in another e-mail. ''And, of course, the longer this struggle continues, the more likely and bitter that will become.''

HEADLINE: For Pier 70, Tech Offices and Restored Shipyard Buildings

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
From the Dogpatch neighborhood where she has lived for 30 years, Janet Carpinelli has an up-close view of San Francisco's past and future.
On the waterfront, Ms. Carpinelli has watched the brick, stone and steel buildings that once housed a booming shipbuilding industry deteriorate into graffiti-covered urban ruins.
Looking toward downtown, Ms. Carpinelli has witnessed the advance of the shiny, boxlike structures of the Mission Bay biotechnology hub on her neighborhood.
Now the Port of San Francisco is embarking on an ambitious development plan for the massive Pier 70 that involves restoring the old shipyard buildings and constructing 2.5 million square feet of new office space. 
But as San Francisco officials court tech companies for what they call the ''innovation corridor,'' extending from Mission Bay to Pier 70 and beyond, neighbors and urban planners are asking how the architectural sensibilities -- or lack thereof -- of Silicon Valley will weave themselves into the urban fabric.
''The suburban tech campuses, they seem to be designed by engineers and not architects,'' said Ms. Carpinelli, a graphic designer who heads up the Dogpatch neighborhood association. ''I think the pressure is on to come up with something interesting for Pier 70.''
The city has thrown in with Forest City Development California, the firm behind the Westfield Center mall and the continuing transformation of the San Francisco Chronicle building, to meet that challenge. Forest City was recently chosen to plan and develop a 25-acre chunk of the 65-acre Pier 70, and envisions ''a new model of innovation campus'' alongside the restored historic buildings and a waterfront park.
With construction starting in 2015 at the earliest, the plans are short on detail. But the concept is a place featuring a mix of tech companies and arts organizations, public places that encourage the intermingling of people and ideas, and building designs that draw on the industrial history of the neighborhood.
Alexa Arena, a local Forest City executive, said the key was to think ''beyond the physical buildings'' to the tenants who could bring the space to life. That includes allowing development on the site to occur more organically and less through heavy-handed, top-down planning. It also means designing buildings that interact with their surroundings. ''It's a development that's contextual,'' Ms. Arena said.
Although vague, the ideas appear to be aimed at avoiding what everyone, from city officials to neighbors, does not want: a repeat of Mission Bay. That 303-acre development, anchored by the new hospital and research complex of the University of California, San Francisco, stretches from AT&T Park to the edge of Pier 70. Formerly an industrial railyard, Mission Bay grew up quickly over the last decade, with offices for biotech companies, parking structures and condos in the sanitized, suburban look and feel that dominates Silicon Valley.
While Mission Bay has been a success from a real estate and economic standpoint, its architectural style strikes many as out of place.
''It's a great economic base and it's great for San Francisco, but it doesn't look like San Francisco,'' said Lou Vasquez, a longtime San Francisco developer. ''If the Bay Bridge wasn't there, I'd completely lose my bearings.''
Indeed, tech-company architecture developed explicitly as a counterpoint to the urban-industrial fabric that San Francisco wants to preserve, said Alan Hess, a prominent California architecture critic.
''There are many good reasons why Hewlett Packard settled in suburbia,'' said Mr. Hess, a California architecture critic. ''It was a new concept of the factory with lawns and recreation areas, which was the exact opposite of the dirty, smelly factories with their belching smokestacks from the industrial era.''
Mr. Hess said that the tech campuses evolved to include more amenities but maintained a focus on functionality. Open spaces were meant to spur informal meetings and new ideas. Isolated campuses and in-house cafeterias were meant to keep employees hard at work.
''I can't think of many buildings in Silicon Valley that would be put up there with the Guggenheim or the Chrysler Building,'' Mr. Hess said. ''It is a practical, functional architecture that doesn't have any pretensions.''
Dean Macris, a former head of the San Francisco planning department, said that Mission Bay might someday take on a more urban feeling if more were done between the buildings.
''The free-standing buildings on a campus are not exactly cozy,'' Mr. Macris said. ''At the same time, it's a great research center that needs specialized buildings. If you accept it on its own terms, maybe it's O.K.''
Last fall, Salesforce.com bought the last piece of Mission Bay. Plans for its 14-acre campus, which were drawn up by Legorreta and Legorreta of Mexico City and are now circulating, would be a bold, colorful departure for the area, Mr. Macris said.
On Pier 70, the old shipyard buildings could serve the same purpose.
''While financially those older buildings make the project more difficult, they are a real important feature,'' Mr. Macris said. ''They can give an older patina so it doesn't look like 'projectitis' that you see in Mission Bay.''
The Port is hoping that Forest City's development becomes the economic engine that can pay for infrastructure and to restore the historic buildings. Forest City will be making a ''substantial investment'' in the Pier 70 project, according Kathleen Diohep, development project manager at the Port of San Francisco. The Port, she said, is planning to help pay for the restoration through the use of special financing mechanisms that will capture the increase in property, payroll and hotel taxes the project is expected to generate. One of the most impressive old buildings is the Union Iron Works machine shop. Built in 1885, the unreinforced brick structure with a spacious, lofty interior was where metal ship parts were forged. Five 5-ton to 30-ton cranes still hang from the steel trusses that were used to lift giant engines and propellers. Parts for ships used in the Spanish-American War, including Admiral George Dewey's flagship, the Olympia, were built here, according to the Port.
The Union Iron Works building, which survived the 1906 earthquake with minimal damage as did most of the neighborhood, was last used for ship repair in 2001 and is now derelict. The Port has said that a market hall or a museum could fill the restored machine shop and that it is currently choosing among developers interested in restoring this and other nearby buildings.
''It's one of the most historical resources in San Francisco,'' said Chris VerPlanck of Knapp & VerPlanck Preservation Architects. ''People forget that San Francisco was an industrial powerhouse, and it had the most important shipyard on the West Coast and this was the heart of it.''
Neighbors and historians say they are eager to see the buildings restored along with a lively new development, although perhaps not as lively as it was at the turn of the last century. Mr. VerPlanck, who has done extensive historic research on the area, said the shipyard workers all lived in little neighborhoods that stretched up Potrero Hill and were not all that welcoming to family types.
''Dogpatch, or Dutchman's flat, as it was known,'' he said, ''was slightly better than Irish Hill, which was basically single male laborers who would spend their day off drinking and bare-knuckle boxing.''

HEADLINE: Inside the List

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
WONDERFUL TOWN: Amor Towles, whose first novel, ''Rules of Civility,'' hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 16, arrived in New York in 1989 with diplomas from Yale and Stanford and dreams of becoming a writer. But he quickly noticed that all his friends who were waiting tables and pursuing art on the side looked just as tired as the office drones they were serving. So he joined an investment firm instead and took seven years off from writing. Towles, today a principal in a money management concern, says the novel's success, though wonderful, has been less important than simply finishing something he thought was good. ''I would've sold it for a penny, just to be able to say 'O.K., I did it,' '' he said in a telephone interview. ''I always thought I was a writer on the inside, but after a few years of not writing you can't make that claim anymore.'' 
''Rules of Civility'' (reviewed on Page 20) is a fizzy, finely observed tale of an ambitious young secretary from Brooklyn who falls in with a crowd of upper-/class bright young things in late 1930s Manhattan. It's also a retro-/imaginary Zagat's guide of sorts, a loving evocation of the chance social alchemy of Village jazz joints, Wall Street coffee shops, Midtown Champagne palaces, and Lower East Side former speakeasies packed with radical emigres, disputatious painters and slumming uptowners.
Towles, who grew up outside Boston, says his own sentimental New York geography centers on the area between Houston and 20th Streets, where he has lived for most of his adult life, first in an illegal sublet on Third Street in the East Village (''next to the Hells Angels'') and then for 13 years at Bleecker and the Bowery, across from CBGB. Fanelli's in SoHo, the 19th-century tavern turned art world hangout where he and his sister have a tradition of lunching after Christmas shopping, is still there, as is the Old Town Bar on East 18th Street, the old Tammany Hall redoubt where he and his wife ended up on their first date. (The Old Town threw a 100th birthday party for its urinals last November, complete with a Champagne toast and a congratulatory letter from Mayor Bloomberg. It also claims to have the city's oldest active dumbwaiters.) But CBGB is gone, along with the four Italian cafes facing off on one memorable Greenwich Village corner and the Grange Hall on Commerce Street, a former gin mill reborn as a self-/consciously retro-1930s hotspot around the time Towles arrived in the city. (''My friends and I always ate there when it snowed,'' he recalled.) Towles, who now lives near Gramercy Park, sees surviving pockets of the old downtown spirit, even if today's starry-/eyed new arrivals tend to land in less expensive precincts. He recalled a recent trip to Brooklyn, where he watched a young woman nurse a cup of coffee as long as possible. ''I totally remember that,'' Towles said, ''being 25 and unemployed and trying to stretch each cappuccino for 60 minutes.''
NICE WORK: The young freelancers scribbling in Brooklyn coffee shops may find inspiration in Towles's unabashedly romantic novel, not to mention his Cinderella literary success. For the rest of us, there's ''Dumbemployed: Hilariously Dumb and Sadly True Stories About Jobs Like Yours,'' a spinoff volume from the guys behind the popular Web site dumbemployed.com. Sample: ''At work today, I received a gift certificate from H.R. as a 'reward for friendliness.' It wasn't a real gift certificate, though, just a 20 percent off coupon for Office Depot. I think they might have just found it in the mail. I'm dumbemployed.'' Um, where are LOLcats when you need them?

HEADLINE: American Kidnapped By Gunmen In Pakistan

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD; Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and Lisa Schwartz contributed research from New York.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A group of armed men broke into the home of an American development expert in Lahore on Saturday and abducted him, Pakistani and American officials said.
American officials identified the man as Warren Weinstein, 70, the Pakistan director for J. E. Austin Associates, an international development consulting company based in Arlington, Va.
Mr. Weinstein has been based in Lahore for seven years, according to his profile on the LinkedIn networking Web site. A Pakistani police official said that he lived alone in Model Town, an old, affluent neighborhood, since 2006, and that he had been planning to leave Pakistan within the week. 
According to J. E. Austin's Web site, Mr. Weinstein had been working on the company's Pakistan initiative for strategic development and competitiveness. He has 25 years of experience in international development projects, speaks six foreign languages and earned a Ph.D. in international law and economics from Columbia, said a company biography that was removed from the Web site on Saturday.
In a statement, the company said that Mr. Weinstein was known for ''his commitment to Pakistan's economic development and poverty reduction.''
''His efforts to help make Pakistani industries more competitive have resulted in many hundreds of well-paying jobs for Pakistani citizens and contributed to raising the standard of living in the communities where these businesses are located,'' the statement added.
Over the past several years, Mr. Weinstein has worked on projects with the United States Agency for International Development and corporations in Pakistan to increase exports in a number of Pakistani industries, including dairy, furniture and medical instruments. According to several Pakistani news accounts, Mr. Weinstein has recently been involved in an effort to strengthen Pakistan's leather industry by training more skilled workers and bolstering exports.
A Pakistani friend of his said he was advising the provincial livestock department and the Industries Ministry, and was working on a development project financed by the American government in the tribal regions, a largely lawless area where militants operate along the border with Afghanistan.
''He was a very experienced man and said he had worked in many countries in difficult circumstances,'' said the Pakistani acquaintance, who asked not to be identified. People who know him said he tried to assimilate into the local culture, wearing the Pakistani national dress, baggy trousers and a long tunic known as a shalwar kameez, and speaking functional Urdu.
The police said at least seven or eight men broke into Mr. Weinstein's home between 3 and 4 a.m. on Saturday.
American and Pakistani officials have not speculated on a motive, and by Saturday night there had been no claim of responsibility or ransom demand. Mr. Weinstein's driver and three security guards have been taken into custody for questioning by Pakistani intelligence agents.
Although relations between the United States and Pakistan have been strained recently, the State Department said it was working with the Pakistanis on the case.
The Pakistani ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said that ''Pakistani police and intelligence officials'' were investigating. ''We will ensure U.S. officials are fully informed of the investigations,'' he said.
Relations between Pakistan and the United States have sharply deteriorated since January, when a security contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency shot and killed two Pakistanis in Lahore, and worsened after American commandos flew into Pakistan in May to kill Osama bin Laden without notifying Pakistan.
The State Department issued an alert this month warning Americans of the risk of traveling to Pakistan. ''U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan have also been kidnapped for ransom or for personal reasons,'' the alert stated, noting the June kidnapping of an American in Lahore, the 2010 kidnapping of an American child in Karachi and the 2009 abduction of an American official working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Baluchistan.
''The kidnapping of Pakistani citizens and other foreign nationals, usually for ransom, continues to increase dramatically nationwide,'' the alert said.
In July, the Pakistani Taliban, linked to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for kidnapping a Swiss couple in Baluchistan a restive southwestern province.
A Pakistani journalist who knows Mr. Weinstein condemned the abduction.
''I had met the guy on several occasions,'' said the journalist, Raza Rumi, a columnist and consulting editor at The Friday Times, a liberal weekly published in Lahore. ''He loved Pakistan. He was a development consultant, working on various assignments with the federal and Punjab governments.''
''It is shocking,'' Mr. Rumi added. ''How will aid workers come and serve in Pakistan if such incidents continue to happen? Pakistan needs aid and development, and perhaps the criminal gangs and jihadi militants want to keep Pakistan underdeveloped.''
Mr. Weinstein and his wife maintain a split-level home in a middle-class neighborhood in Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington. No one was home Sunday evening. Neighbors, who did not want to be identified, said Mrs. Weinstein had left to be with her children and had asked that no information be released to the press.
The couple has lived in the neighborhood for about 35 years. In recent years, Mrs. Weinstein has remained at home, the neighbors said, while her husband worked overseas. He would return home intermittently, they said, and his wife sometimes accompanied him on trips.

HEADLINE: The Poetry of Parenthood

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
THE poet Erika Meitner was a waddling nine months' pregnant in March 2007, negotiating the particulars of a job as a poetry professor at Virginia Tech, and watching an episode of ''24'' at home in Washington, when her water broke.
Landing a job teaching poetry is to poets what winning the lottery is to everybody else. With her baby dropping by the minute, she grabbed her computer and typed an e-mail to the head of Virginia Tech's English department, laying out what her salary and sundry other needs were. She sent it off, made it to the hospital, gave birth to a son, and got the job. ''I guess I won brownie points for working while in labor,'' she said. 
Ms. Meitner, 36, now an assistant professor of English, and her husband, Steven Trost, 38, now an instructor and the principles of economics coordinator at Virginia Tech, named their son Oz for the Hebrew word for strength. A Jewish boy being raised in the Bible Belt of rural southwest Virginia was probably going to need it. When the couple moved to Blacksburg, Ms. Meitner said, her aunt asked, '' 'Why don't you buy a house in the Jewish neighborhood?' '' to which Ms. Meitner answered, '' 'Aunt Mary, we are the Jewish neighborhood.' ''
The couple married on April 22, 2006, when Ms. Meitner was a doctoral student in religion at the University of Virginia, after maintaining a relationship that saw her pursuing academic opportunities at the University of Wisconsin, the University of California-Santa Cruz, Virginia, and then Virginia Tech.
''It's rare that academic couples get to be in the same geographic location where one isn't severely underemployed,'' she said. ''Almost every day we wake up and know we are very lucky.''
On April 16, 2007, three days after the couple signed employment contracts with Virginia Tech, a student shot and killed 32 people on campus, the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in the nation's history. It was a jolt to the couple, who landed on a campus in mourning.
''Blacksburg is the safest place either of us have ever lived,'' said Ms. Meitner, who grew up in Queens and on Long Island. ''This could have happened anywhere.''
At the time, Ms. Meitner was struggling to recover from a Caesarean section and a bacterial infection. Mr. Trost, steady and calm, took over. ''The realization that babies don't know how to make themselves happy; the difficulty of going back to sleep after a feeding; the effort and emotional strength of learning patience was tricky,'' said Mr. Trost, who gave up a job as an economist for the United States International Trade Commission in Washington to join his wife in Blacksburg.
They have created a working family, in which each encourages the other's pursuits.
Mr. Trost, a self-described creature of the moment, plays electric bass in the local Stumpy Creek Band, works in the garden, and fights off his fear of bugs so Oz won't be afraid of them, too. Ms. Meitner organizes social events, hiking outings, and kayak and bike rides. ''She's really good at the bigger picture kind of stuff,'' Mr. Trost said.
He and Ms. Meitner marvel at how friendly and precocious their son is, traits neither of them possessed as children, and at his obsession with jellyfish and volcanoes.
The couple settled in on campus and transcended the social strictures of academia to buy a 46-inch flat-screen television, and their home quickly became the spot where their friends could (covertly) watch sporting events. (''Academics will say they only watch foreign documentaries on Netflix,'' Ms. Meitner explained.)
But the irrepressibly energetic Ms. Meitner is also often on the road promoting her work, and takes off for a week or two each year to go to the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts to create poems. Mr. Trost is adamant about putting Ms. Meitner's work first, even if she does not, an attribute that she pays tribute to in her second book of poems, ''Ideal Cities'' (Harper Perennial, 2010). Her newest work is ''Makeshift Instructions for Vigilant Girls'' ( Anhinga Press, 2011).
She said: ''The fact that I get to do that and not have to worry, that everyone is O.K. here, that's incredible. And that he would give up a pretty high-ranking government job because I got this job. ... '' Her voice trailed off, then rebounded. ''He's the nicest person I've ever met.''
Like an astronomer entranced by the night sky, Mr. Trost is in awe of his wife's gifts. ''Erika is incredibly successful,'' he said. ''I feel that she is, others see it, I don't know that she sees it yet. She amazes me all the time, and for her, that's where I still am. I stand back and say: 'Wow, this is an amazing person. I'm really lucky to have caught on to this comet.' ''

HEADLINE: The Age Of Outrage

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
Paris
AUGUST was once a time for dreaming, wandering the empty streets of this city, reading silly-season newspaper stories after a leisurely lunch washed down with Sancerre, gazing at squares where fountains plashed and the pregnant or the old chatted on benches at dusk. Then something happened.
The world speeded up. Stress levels soared. Idle moments evaporated. Egos expanded. Devices became hand-held. Money outpaced politics. Rage surged. As Leonard Cohen put it: ''The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows.'' 
Except that everybody is at a loss. When David Cameron rushes back from Tuscany (a k a Chiantishire) to riot-ravaged London, and Nicolas Sarkozy hustles home from the Riviera to a Paris debt crisis, and the summer vacation void vanishes in Europe (once so long the Germans coined a word for ''free-time angst''), all bets are off.
August aborted this year. It morphed into the serious season. The beach lost out to the barricades. A time of outrage is upon us.
The fury in British cities follows huge social protests this year in Greece, where violence also flared, and in Spain, where tens of thousands have camped out from Madrid to Barcelona. Other nations, including Portugal, have seen a diffuse anger rooted in a shared conviction: things can't go on like this. This European malaise is no stranger to a United States of high unemployment, economic bafflement, ideological radicalization and political pettiness.
Numbers tell part of the story. Youth unemployment in the 27-nation European Union stands at just over 20 percent, ranging as high as 45.7 percent in Spain. In Britain youth unemployment has risen from 14 percent in the first quarter of 2008 to 20 percent. About one in every five young Europeans and young Americans is wondering how to get any sort of working life on track. Britain's NEETS (not in education, employment or training) meet U.S. boomerang kids in the anxiety of waiting.
The anxiety grows when governments are slashing benefits and pushing back retirement ages in an attempt to deal with spiraling deficits. A working gerontocracy hardly helps the young. Brits from Tottenham to Teesside have watched the most patrician cabinet since Macmillan cutting everything from libraries to youth counseling services. Theirs is a ''No Future'' revolt.
A feeling has grown in Western societies that uncontrollable forces are at work shrinking possibility. History has never seen a global power shift as radical as the current one that managed to be peaceful.
The united Europe of today is built on the ashes of successive empires -- from the Roman to the British -- that ended in one form or other of violent convulsion. Now the American quasi-imperium, and more generally the dominion of the West, is ending, not rapidly but steadily.
Growth, jobs, expansion, excitement -- and, yes, possibility -- lie in the great non-Western arc from China through India to South Africa and Brazil. Go South! Go East! That's the dictum of the age but not always practicable in Peckham or Peoria. The world has been turned upside-down. What we are witnessing is how shaken Western societies are by such inversion.
As new powers emerge, globalization has altered the relationship between capital and labor in the former's favor. Many more cheap workers have become available outside the West as technology has eliminated distance. Returns on capital have proved higher relative to wages. That's the story of the post-cold-war period. The gap between rich and poor has become a gulf.
The only people who walked away unscathed from the great financial binge that preceded this mess were its main architects and greatest beneficiaries: bankers, financiers and hedge-fund honchos.
This, too, is fueling a time of outrage that has left Western politicians chasing shadows.
Perhaps the society dealing best with these dilemmas is Germany. It has invested in a highly educated work force. It has matched workers' skills to jobs. It has continued to make precision machinery others can't make. It has fostered cooperation between labor unions and employers and between industrialists and the government in defense of German jobs. The youth unemployment rate is under 10 percent.
It has not tried to race to the bottom to compete with China, or imagined that financial and other services could sustain a society, or shirked on training, or tried to dismember unions, or believed that markets held all the answers. Past cataclysm has contributed to Germany's ability to see past ego to the common good needed for stability.
Alas, Germany is also involved in a fit of navel-gazing. It is tired of others' problems. It is sick of bailing out the Greeks. Surveys suggest 50 percent of Germans now have little or no faith in the European Union, the country's postwar route to rehabilitation. German leadership has become an oxymoron just when needed.
The United States and Western Europe saved Germany. Perhaps it's time to return a little of the favor -- not with money alone, but ideas.

HEADLINE: The Elusive Big Idea

BYLINE: By NEAL GABLER

 BODY:
Neal Gabler is a senior fellow at the Annenberg Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California and the author of ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination.''
THE July/August issue of The Atlantic trumpets the ''14 Biggest Ideas of the Year.'' Take a deep breath. The ideas include ''The Players Own the Game'' (No. 12), ''Wall Street: Same as it Ever Was'' (No. 6), ''Nothing Stays Secret'' (No. 2), and the very biggest idea of the year, ''The Rise of the Middle Class -- Just Not Ours,'' which refers to growing economies in Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Now exhale. It may strike you that none of these ideas seem particularly breathtaking. In fact, none of them are ideas. They are more on the order of observations. But one can't really fault The Atlantic for mistaking commonplaces for intellectual vision. Ideas just aren't what they used to be. Once upon a time, they could ignite fires of debate, stimulate other thoughts, incite revolutions and fundamentally change the ways we look at and think about the world. 
They could penetrate the general culture and make celebrities out of thinkers -- notably Albert Einstein, but also Reinhold Niebuhr, Daniel Bell, Betty Friedan, Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould, to name a few. The ideas themselves could even be made famous: for instance, for ''the end of ideology,'' ''the medium is the message,'' ''the feminine mystique,'' ''the Big Bang theory,'' ''the end of history.'' A big idea could capture the cover of Time -- ''Is God Dead?'' -- and intellectuals like Norman Mailer, William F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal would even occasionally be invited to the couches of late-night talk shows. How long ago that was.
If our ideas seem smaller nowadays, it's not because we are dumber than our forebears but because we just don't care as much about ideas as they did. In effect, we are living in an increasingly post-idea world -- a world in which big, thought-provoking ideas that can't instantly be monetized are of so little intrinsic value that fewer people are generating them and fewer outlets are disseminating them, the Internet notwithstanding. Bold ideas are almost passe.
It is no secret, especially here in America, that we live in a post-Enlightenment age in which rationality, science, evidence, logical argument and debate have lost the battle in many sectors, and perhaps even in society generally, to superstition, faith, opinion and orthodoxy. While we continue to make giant technological advances, we may be the first generation to have turned back the epochal clock -- to have gone backward intellectually from advanced modes of thinking into old modes of belief. But post-Enlightenment and post-idea, while related, are not exactly the same.
Post-Enlightenment refers to a style of thinking that no longer deploys the techniques of rational thought. Post-idea refers to thinking that is no longer done, regardless of the style.
The post-idea world has been a long time coming, and many factors have contributed to it. There is the retreat in universities from the real world, and an encouragement of and reward for the narrowest specialization rather than for daring -- for tending potted plants rather than planting forests.
There is the eclipse of the public intellectual in the general media by the pundit who substitutes outrageousness for thoughtfulness, and the concomitant decline of the essay in general-interest magazines. And there is the rise of an increasingly visual culture, especially among the young -- a form in which ideas are more difficult to express.
But these factors, which began decades ago, were more likely harbingers of an approaching post-idea world than the chief causes of it. The real cause may be information itself. It may seem counterintuitive that at a time when we know more than we have ever known, we think about it less.
We live in the much vaunted Age of Information. Courtesy of the Internet, we seem to have immediate access to anything that anyone could ever want to know. We are certainly the most informed generation in history, at least quantitatively. There are trillions upon trillions of bytes out there in the ether -- so much to gather and to think about.
And that's just the point. In the past, we collected information not simply to know things. That was only the beginning. We also collected information to convert it into something larger than facts and ultimately more useful -- into ideas that made sense of the information. We sought not just to apprehend the world but to truly comprehend it, which is the primary function of ideas. Great ideas explain the world and one another to us.
Marx pointed out the relationship between the means of production and our social and political systems. Freud taught us to explore our minds as a way of understanding our emotions and behaviors. Einstein rewrote physics. More recently, McLuhan theorized about the nature of modern communication and its effect on modern life. These ideas enabled us to get our minds around our existence and attempt to answer the big, daunting questions of our lives.
But if information was once grist for ideas, over the last decade it has become competition for them. We are like the farmer who has too much wheat to make flour. We are inundated with so much information that we wouldn't have time to process it even if we wanted to, and most of us don't want to.
The collection itself is exhausting: what each of our friends is doing at that particular moment and then the next moment and the next one; who Jennifer Aniston is dating right now; which video is going viral on YouTube this hour; what Princess Letizia or Kate Middleton is wearing that day. In effect, we are living within the nimbus of an informational Gresham's law in which trivial information pushes out significant information, but it is also an ideational Gresham's law in which information, trivial or not, pushes out ideas.
We prefer knowing to thinking because knowing has more immediate value. It keeps us in the loop, keeps us connected to our friends and our cohort. Ideas are too airy, too impractical, too much work for too little reward. Few talk ideas. Everyone talks information, usually personal information. Where are you going? What are you doing? Whom are you seeing? These are today's big questions.
It is certainly no accident that the post-idea world has sprung up alongside the social networking world. Even though there are sites and blogs dedicated to ideas, Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, Flickr, etc., the most popular sites on the Web, are basically information exchanges, designed to feed the insatiable information hunger, though this is hardly the kind of information that generates ideas. It is largely useless except insofar as it makes the possessor of the information feel, well, informed. Of course, one could argue that these sites are no different than conversation was for previous generations, and that conversation seldom generated big ideas either, and one would be right.
BUT the analogy isn't perfect. For one thing, social networking sites are the primary form of communication among young people, and they are supplanting print, which is where ideas have typically gestated. For another, social networking sites engender habits of mind that are inimical to the kind of deliberate discourse that gives rise to ideas. Instead of theories, hypotheses and grand arguments, we get instant 140-character tweets about eating a sandwich or watching a TV show. While social networking may enlarge one's circle and even introduce one to strangers, this is not the same thing as enlarging one's intellectual universe. Indeed, the gab of social networking tends to shrink one's universe to oneself and one's friends, while thoughts organized in words, whether online or on the page, enlarge one's focus.
To paraphrase the famous dictum, often attributed to Yogi Berra, that you can't think and hit at the same time, you can't think and tweet at the same time either, not because it is impossible to multitask but because tweeting, which is largely a burst of either brief, unsupported opinions or brief descriptions of your own prosaic activities, is a form of distraction or anti-thinking.
The implications of a society that no longer thinks big are enormous. Ideas aren't just intellectual playthings. They have practical effects.
An artist friend of mine recently lamented that he felt the art world was adrift because there were no longer great critics like Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg to provide theories of art that could fructify the art and energize it. Another friend made a similar argument about politics. While the parties debate how much to cut the budget, he wondered where were the John Rawlses and Robert Nozicks who could elevate our politics.
One could certainly make the same argument about economics, where John Maynard Keynes remains the center of debate nearly 80 years after propounding his theory of government pump priming. This isn't to say that the successors of Rosenberg, Rawls and Keynes don't exist, only that if they do, they are not likely to get traction in a culture that has so little use for ideas, especially big, exciting, dangerous ones, and that's true whether the ideas come from academics or others who are not part of elite organizations and who challenge the conventional wisdom. All thinkers are victims of information glut, and the ideas of today's thinkers are also victims of that glut.
But it is especially true of big thinkers in the social sciences like the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, who has theorized on everything from the source of language to the role of genetics in human nature, or the biologist Richard Dawkins, who has had big and controversial ideas on everything from selfishness to God, or the psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who has been analyzing different moral systems and drawing fascinating conclusions about the relationship of morality to political beliefs. But because they are scientists and empiricists rather than generalists in the humanities, the place from which ideas were customarily popularized, they suffer a double whammy: not only the whammy against ideas generally but the whammy against science, which is typically regarded in the media as mystifying at best, incomprehensible at worst. A generation ago, these men would have made their way into popular magazines and onto television screens. Now they are crowded out by informational effluvium.
No doubt there will be those who say that the big ideas have migrated to the marketplace, but there is a vast difference between profit-making inventions and intellectually challenging thoughts. Entrepreneurs have plenty of ideas, and some, like Steven P. Jobs of Apple, have come up with some brilliant ideas in the ''inventional'' sense of the word.
Still, while these ideas may change the way we live, they rarely transform the way we think. They are material, not ideational. It is thinkers who are in short supply, and the situation probably isn't going to change anytime soon.
We have become information narcissists, so uninterested in anything outside ourselves and our friendship circles or in any tidbit we cannot share with those friends that if a Marx or a Nietzsche were suddenly to appear, blasting his ideas, no one would pay the slightest attention, certainly not the general media, which have learned to service our narcissism.
What the future portends is more and more information -- Everests of it. There won't be anything we won't know. But there will be no one thinking about it.
Think about that.

HEADLINE: Used-Car Prices to Remain High

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
With used-car prices at historic highs, customers hoping for those prices to decline may have to wait years for a reprieve.
Prices for used cars are likely to stay high for the next two to three years, according to a report released Thursday by Kelley Blue Book, which tracks new- and used-car prices. 
The service attributes the sustained strength of used-car prices to a gradual decline in new-car sales dating to 2008, as well as a drop in the number of leased cars becoming available at the end of their contract terms.
The report said that the price of the average one- to three-year-old used vehicle was rising 15.8 percent per year. In 2008, the average cost of a one- to three-year-old vehicle was $15,042, but now the average is $23,353, according to the report.
Many in the industry, Kelley Blue Book included, had claimed that used-car prices peaked late this spring. Forecasters had said that healthier new-car inventories, aided by the recovery of production capacity in Japan after the March earthquake and tsunami, as well as lower fuel prices, would lead to a sales uptick in showrooms and, subsequently, more trade-ins and private sales of used cars.
But showroom sales remain sluggish, and analysts now are concerned that volatility in the financial markets and sustained high unemployment may encourage potential buyers to hang on to their vehicles rather than buy new ones.
Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, expressed skepticism earlier this week that total new-car sales, across brands, in the United States this year would reach the company's forecast of 13 million vehicles. July sales suggested an annual selling rate of about 12.2 million units.
For those who can afford to part with their cars, particularly compact and midsize models, the selling environment is optimal.
Manheim Consulting, which follows used-car sales, says the average price of a small carrose 16.7 percent in July compared with the same period a year ago, while the average price of a midsize car was up nearly 12 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: British Reporters, Not Ad Men, In '50s, Not '60s

BYLINE: By MARGY ROCHLIN

 BODY:
London -- ONE surprising notion that might strike you while watching ''The Hour'' -- BBC America's six-part series about a hard-hitting television news program in 1956 Britain and the men and women who work for it -- is that Peggy Olson didn't have it so bad. At least on ''Mad Men,'' the midcentury-period AMC drama, one gets the impression that Peggy -- the peep-voiced, wide-eyed advertising copywriter struggling to establish herself in a man's world -- has a few equally ambitious girlfriends to gripe with about the boy's club. On ''The Hour,'' however, the shoulder that the head producer Bel Rowley (Romola Garai) ends up crying on is that of Freddie (Ben Whishaw), a tenacious reporter who is also in love with her. 
When ''The Hour'' had its premiere here on BBC2 last month (it has its BBC America premiere Wednesday at 10 p.m.), ''Mad Men'' comparisons abounded despite some crucial differences. For all the shadowy after-hours nightclubs and tight sheath dresses, the show's backdrop isn't as shiny as the Manhattan of ''Mad Men,'' set less than a decade later. It's cold, wet London two years after the end of rationing, a city still struggling to regain its footing after the bombings of World War II.
Yet ''The Hour'' may remind American viewers of nothing so much as our own age. Several scenes seem to anticipate the News of the World phone hacking scandal, like when Freddie bribes a policeman to let him examine a body at the morgue, and the phones of reporters are tapped by government agents (even though it was journalists doing the listening-in at News of the World).
The recent revelations about News of the World and the hacking of cellphones owned by, among others, a murder victim hadn't yet surfaced by the time ''The Hour'' went into production. But one of its executive producers, Derek Wax, acknowledged that the current scandal had given the show a sense of immediacy.
''It does seem very pertinent now,'' Mr. Wax said last month at a Television Critics Association gathering, noting that the show touches on current issues like the collusion between politicians and journalists, and ''who you have lunch with one day and how stories are leaked.'' He added, ''We are very much in 1956, but at times you feel that nothing's really changed.'' (A second season, if approved, would address the Notting Hill race riot of 1958.)
Of course times have changed dramatically for women. Abi Morgan, who wrote and created ''The Hour,'' said that while researching the project she discovered that if you were one of the few women employed by the BBC in postwar London, you were most likely a telephone-answering, tea-carrying secretary. ''I think America was a bit ahead of us in that regard,'' Ms. Morgan said. ''There were a lot more women in the workplace in America than in Britain.'' Throughout most of the series Bel is so outnumbered that when men unapologetically disparage women in front of her, nothing -- no resentment, no frustration -- ever registers on her pale face.
When asked if this was an acting choice, Ms. Garai, speaking in her agent's office in central London, said that her Bel wouldn't have expected to be treated as an equal. ''I mean, misogyny would not have been misogyny at that time. It wouldn't have been exceptional. It would have been life.''
To prepare for the role Ms. Garai studied up on Grace Wyndham Goldie, a British news pioneer. Ms. Goldie, a radio critic who didn't begin her television career until her late 40s, was the producer most famously associated with the success of BBC programs like ''Tonight'' and ''Panorama,'' which broke ground by covering current affairs as they happened, thus ignoring the ''14-day rule,'' which dictated that the BBC not report on issues that were to be debated in Parliament within two weeks.
''She was absolutely at the forefront of that movement, and she was totally alone,'' Ms. Garai said. ''She was like any woman who had to operate in that climate. She was intimidating, formidable. Definitely a woman with the emphasis on 'man.' '' (In ''The Hour'' Bel is a woman in her 20s who wears figure-hugging dresses, bright-red lipstick and smokes cigarettes as elegantly as Myrna Loy in a ''Thin Man'' movie.)
Before it was broadcast, some British news outlets had positioned the series as the country's glossy answer to ''Mad Men.'' But when the executive producer Jane Featherstone, president of Kudos Film and Television (''MI5,'' ''Life on Mars''), first commissioned Ms. Morgan to create a series about a time when the BBC stopped broadcasting government-sanctioned newsreels and focused on investigative news, Ms. Featherstone was thinking of a political thriller involving television reporters and the Suez Canal crisis of 1956.
''In British terms that was the end of our empire, the moment that Britain really gave up its position as a global player,'' Ms. Featherstone explained, adding that only 12 hours passed before Ms. Morgan returned with an outline for a series that included espionage, lots of drinking and the mysterious suicide of a beautiful socialite who Freddie insists has been murdered. When Bel falls for her lead anchor, a smooth-voiced beefcake named Hector Madden (Dominic West), viewers will instantly know that Ms. Morgan also took a page from ''Broadcast News,'' James L. Brooks's 1987 romantic comedy about love, longing and unchecked journalistic ambition. What? No ''Mad Men''?
''What they share is some fashion and some lampshades,'' Ms. Featherstone said, trying to hide the ''Can we drop the 'Mad Men' comparisons?'' weariness in her voice. Then she confessed to her own micro-campaign to distinguish the two by ''going around slightly smugly correcting everybody: 'It's not the same decade! This is 1956, and those are the '60s!' '' She added, ''In terms of pace and tone you can see they're miles and miles apart.''
There are those, of course, who will tune in thinking they might get their Jimmy McNulty fix, that is, the boozing, authority-defying police detective that Mr. West played on the HBO series ''The Wire,'' which ended in 2008 Stateside and was a huge hit in Britain. Speaking by phone, Mr. West wondered about what this segment of the viewing public would think of him as the posh Hector Madden, wearing hand-tailored suits, sporting a dapper side part in his curly hair and enunciating every British-inflected syllable. '' 'Wire' fans, they're hoping for hard-bitten Baltimore, and they get very received-pronunciation English,'' said Mr. West, who seems unable to get the word out that he was educated at Eton. ''There's always a sense of deflation in a room when I go in and they hear me speak.''
Here in Britain there is one viewer excited that Mr. West has dropped his disheveled cop routine and inhabited the character of an anchorman who rivals James Bond when it comes to careful grooming. ''My wife was just in heaven,'' Mr. West said. ''I always say: 'There's nothing I can do about it. I'm at the mercy of whatever job I'm doing.' And she said: 'Finally. You get a decent haircut.' ''

BYLINE: By CARLO ROTELLA

 BODY:
Sitting in a Panera in Boston's financial district in early July with Jeremy Grantham, I suddenly found myself considering how I might safeguard my children's and notional grandchildren's future by somehow engineering the U.S. annexation of Morocco. Grantham, the founder and chief strategist of the asset-management firm GMO, was reading aloud from a rough draft of his next quarterly letter to investors, in which he ranks some long-term crises of resource limitation along a scale from ''merely serious'' to ''dangerous.''
Energy ''will give us serious and sustained problems'' over the next 50 years as we make the transition from hydrocarbons -- oil, coal, gas -- to solar, wind, nuclear and other sources, but we'll muddle through to a solution to Peak Oil and related challenges. Peak Everything Else will prove more intractable for humanity. Metals, for instance, ''are entropy at work . . . from wonderful metal ores to scattered waste,'' and scarcity and higher prices ''will slowly increase forever,'' but if we scrimp and recycle, we can make do for another century before tight constraint kicks in. 
Agriculture is more worrisome. Local water shortages will cause ''persistent irritation'' -- wars, famines. Of the three essential macro nutrient fertilizers, nitrogen is relatively plentiful and recoverable, but we're running out of potassium and phosphorus, finite mined resources that are ''necessary for all life.'' Canada has large reserves of potash (the source of potassium), which is good news for Americans, but 50 to 75 percent of the known reserves of phosphate (the source of phosphorus) are located in Morocco and the western Sahara. Assuming a 2 percent annual increase in phosphorus consumption, Grantham believes the rest of the world's reserves won't last more than 50 years, so he expects ''gamesmanship'' from the phosphate-rich.
And he rates soil erosion as the biggest threat of all. The world's population could reach 10 billion within half a century -- perhaps twice as many human beings as the planet's overtaxed resources can sustainably support, perhaps six times too many.
Grantham, who is 72 and has what's left of a British accent after living in Boston for more than four decades, outlined this wildly distressing assessment against a bland backdrop of chain decor and piped-in smooth jazz. He marked up his draft with a pen as he went along, departing from the text at times to emphasize a point. ''Phosphorus makes up 1 percent of your body weight,'' he said, looking up from the page to catch my eye. ''It's a basic element, the residue of exploded stars. You can't just make more.'' He also pointed out that most economists see global trade as a win-win proposition, but resource limitation turns it into a win-lose, zero-sum contest. ''The faster China grows, the higher grain prices go, the more people in China or India who upgrade to meat, the higher the tendency for Africa to starve,'' he said.
Grantham argues that the late-18th-century doomsayer Thomas Malthus pretty much got it right but just had the bad timing to make his predictions about unsustainable population growth on the eve of the hydrocarbon-fueled Industrial Revolution, which ''partially removed the barriers to rapid population growth, wealth and scientific progress.'' That put off the inevitable for a couple of centuries, but now, ready or not, the age of cheap hydrocarbons is ending. Grantham's July letter concludes: ''We humans have the brains and the means to reach real planetary sustainability. The problem is with us and our focus on short-term growth and profits, which is likely to cause suffering on a vast scale. With foresight and thoughtful planning, this suffering is completely avoidable.''
Grantham's quarterly letters, which command a cult following of readers within and beyond the financial industry, inspire even the most short-term profit-minded investors to do a little fate-of-the-world-scale thinking. I find that they have the opposite, equally mind-stretching effect on a passive investor like me. Although I'm normally happy to turn over my paychecks to the missus and not inquire into what happens to them, my encounters with Grantham tend to whip me into a state of alarm that has me thinking about acquiring tracts of arable timbered high ground, preferably defensible ones well inland from the rising seas.
Doomsayers are always plentiful, and the economic and environmental news has encouraged even more doomsaying than usual of late, but Grantham compels attention, in part because he's not simply prophesying doom. While it may be too late to ''gracefully'' deal with depleted resources/, climate change and related crises, it's never too late to mitigate the damage. And, crucially, the consequences will be unevenly distributed, creating angles for you to make money and look out for your interests, however you define them.
''I never think of him as one of the doom-and-gloomers running around like chickens with their heads cut off,'' says Barry Ritholtz, the head of the quantitative research firm FusionIQ and a widely read commentator on the financial world. ''He's not telling people to stockpile water and dehydrated food. He's saying this asset class will underperform or not.'' Distinguishing Grantham from other notable big-picture pessimists like Nouriel Roubini and industry skeptics like James Grant, Ritholtz says: ''Keep in mind that he has run a lot of money. He's like a mechanic who's telling you, 'Fix this, or you'll have trouble down the road.' Then there are all the kibitzers standing around watching the mechanic and offering advice.'' Ritholtz likens Grantham to Warren Buffett, another mechanic with advanced rhetorical skills -- ''only Buffett's buying companies and Grantham's looking at asset classes: 'For the next 10 years, buy commodities.' ''
Grantham has a long track record. He was right about indexing, an investment strategy he took a lead role in inventing, when everyone else assumed that you should try to beat the market rather than join it, and about the long rally in small-cap stocks in the early 1970s, the bond rebound in 1981 and the resurgence of large-cap growth stocks in the early 1990s. He was also, well in advance, right about one bubble after another: Japan in 1989, tech stocks in 2000, the U.S. housing market and financial markets and global equities in 2008 (in the wake of which, when investors were still reeling, he made a celebrated and early bullish call in a letter titled, ''Reinvesting When Terrified'').
Grantham wasn't the only one making those calls -- although he grew famous by making them more persuasively than others -- nor has he been infallible. As a stock picker, he made his share of losing bets. Jack Meyer, who runs Convexity Capital Management and is the former head of Harvard Management Company, told me a story about Grantham speaking at a conference in the 1990s: ''Jeremy had seen a tough patch, underperforming for a couple of years. He gets up and says, 'Ladies, gentlemen, clients, former clients. . . . ' Everybody laughed, but it tells you three things: he's in it for the long term, he's not shy about pointing out when he's off and he's supremely confident.'' Grantham, who has largely turned over the task of handling GMO's clients' money to younger colleagues, has become a kind of in-house intellectual -- ''chief of propaganda,'' as he puts it -- a role eminently suited to his gifts for big-picture thinking and storytelling. Meyer said, ''There's no doubt in my mind that he's one of the best thinkers in the business.''
Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who noted that Grantham ''ran money for Vanguard for a while, and it didn't work out that well,'' says of him: ''He's been very, very good in his forecasts. In times of great bullishness, he's the skunk at the garden party, and in times of bearishness, he's saying, 'Don't give up.' ''
Grantham's quarterly letters often do make predictions about how the market will perform in the near future and recommend moves investors can make right now, but there are plenty of other authoritative voices telling us whether the recovery will continue or how the S&P will do this year. What sets him apart is what Ritholtz calls ''the view from 40,000 feet up.'' Grantham, the public face of a company that manages more than $100 billion in assets, the very embodiment of a high-finance insider in blue blazer and yellow tie, has serious doubts about capitalism's ability to address the biggest problems facing humanity. When he reminds us that modern capitalism isn't equipped to handle long-range problems or tragedies of the commons (situations like overfishing or global warming, in which acting rationally in your own self-interest only deepens the harm to all), when he urges us to outgrow our touching faith in the efficiency of markets and boundless human ingenuity, and especially when he says that a wise investor can prosper in the coming hard times, his bad news and its silver lining come with a built-in answer to the skeptical question that Americans traditionally pose to egghead Cassandras: If you're so smart, how come you're not rich?
The first time we met, in May, Grantham said, ''The rather burdensome thought is that people won't listen to environmentalists, but they will sometimes listen to people like me.'' We were in his office at GMO, on Boston's downtown waterfront. Leaning forward in his chair by the windows, he rested his left hand in a confiding gesture on the forearm of a stone Buddha from the eighth-century temple complex at Borobudur in Indonesia. The statue was too pricey when he first saw it at an auction house, but after the Asian financial crisis devalued the asset class of regional antiquities, he made a lowball offer that was immediately accepted, which means, he said, he could have had it for even less. Behind Grantham and the semi-discount Buddha, jets climbed away from Logan Airport. Docked at Rowes Wharf, just below his windows, were yachts worthy of James Bond villains.
Grantham leads what he calls ''a reasonable fat-cat existence'' -- 10-year-old Volvo station wagon, 40-year-old 12-foot Boston Whaler, a country place near the ocean. ''But it's very important to me to make a lot of money now, much more than when I was 40 or 50. Other than what I need for living, it all goes into the foundation.'' The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment tries to raise public awareness of environmental issues and to promote collaboration within the environmental movement. It supports the Environmental Defense Fund, the World Wildlife Fund and other such organizations, institutes for the study of climate change that Grantham helped establish at Imperial College London and the London School of Economics and the Metcalf Institute, which awards the $75,000 Grantham Prize for Excellence in Environmental Journalism.
''We're all involved in environmental causes,'' Grantham said of his family. ''We can't recall some single moment of conversion. We found our separate ways to it.'' His wife, Hanne, sits on the board of the E.D.F. One son, Oliver, buys forests for Harvard Management Company; another, Rupert, manages forests in Massachusetts; his daughter, Isabel, helps run an E.D.F. program that recruits summer interns from top business schools to improve companies' energy efficiency.
Grantham put his own influence and money behind the climate-change bill passed by the House in 2009. ''But even $100 million wouldn't have gotten it through the Senate,'' he said. ''The recession more or less ruled it out. It pushed anything having to do with the environment down 10 points, across the board. Unemployment and interest in environmental issues move inversely.''
Having missed a once-in-a-generation legislative opportunity to address climate change, American environmentalists are looking for new strategies. Grantham believes that the best approach may be to recast global warming, which depresses crop yields and worsens soil erosion, as a factor contributing to resource depletion. ''People are naturally much more responsive to finite resources than they are to climate change,'' he said. ''Global warming is bad news. Finite resources is investment advice.'' He believes this shift in emphasis plays to Americans' strength. ''Americans are just about the worst at dealing with long-term problems, down there with Uzbekistan,'' he said, ''but they respond to a market signal better than almost anyone. They roll the dice bigger and quicker than most.''
Not that it's always easy to derive usable market signals from Grantham's letters. Ben Inker, GMO's head of asset allocation, told me: ''Just because he's right and we know something's going to happen doesn't mean that we have a brilliant way to make money on it right now. In this industry people want to be right this quarter. Often, they read the letter, and they're wondering, What would we do about that?''
But among the ways investors might respond to limited resources, beyond simply trying to grab up a lot of what Grantham calls ''stuff in the ground,'' are many that also address climate change: for instance, investing in farms and forests managed for the long haul, or in companies that retrofit buildings for energy efficiency, build ultralight vehicles or develop non-hydrocarbon-based power.
''There's an 80-20 overlap between sensible behavior on resource limitation and sensible behavior on climate change,'' Ramsay Ravenel, the executive director of the Grantham Foundation, says. ''A lot of his audience isn't that receptive to messaging on the world's environment going to hell, but they are receptive to resource limitation.''
Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, says: ''E.D.F. is educating people that dealing with climate change will be good for the economy and job creation. One of Jeremy's insights is that we can make headway on the market side because higher commodity prices will enforce greater efficiency.''
Grantham says that corporations respond well to this message because they are ''persuaded by data,'' but American public opinion is harder to move, and contemporary American political culture is practically dataproof. ''The politicians are the worst,'' he said. ''An Indian economist once said to me, 'We have 28 political parties, and they all think climate change is important.' '' Whatever the precise number of parties in India, and it depends on how you count, his point was that the U.S. has just two that matter, one that dismisses global warming as a hoax and one that now avoids the subject.
Grantham describes himself as ''an Americanized Englishman with an ancient green card'': he was raised partly by his grandparents, a Quaker shopkeeper and a former housemaid, in Doncaster, a coal-mining town in South Yorkshire. He attended the University of Sheffield and then Harvard Business School. ''I was brought up to esteem value,'' Grantham said. ''I had a burst of euphoria, after which I returned to my upbringing.''
That ''burst of euphoria'' refers to a formative experience. In the summer of 1968, two years out of business school, he invested in American Raceways, a big-talking company that owned a single racetrack. ''There was a bubble in '68-'69 in tiny little companies,'' he said. ''It was $7 a share in June. When I came back from vacation, it was $21, so I sold everything else and bought 600 more shares. By Christmas the price was at $100. I jumped off when it fell to around $40,'' but he plowed all the money directly into another exciting little company, which tanked, cleaning him out. ''It was the double whammy that taught me the lesson,'' he said.
Grantham, who says that ''this time it's different are the four most dangerous words in the English language,'' has become a connoisseur of bubbles. His historical study of more than 300 of them shows the same pattern occurring again and again. A bump in sales or some other impressive development causes people to get excited. When they do, the price of that asset class -- South Sea company shares, dot-coms -- goes up, and human nature and the financial industry conspire to push it higher. People want to hear good news; they tend to be bad with numbers and uncertainty, and to assume that present conditions will persist. In the financial industry, the imperative to minimize career risk produces herd behavior. As John Maynard Keynes, one of Grantham's heroes, put it, ''A sound banker, alas! is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.'' All these factors contribute to a surge of what Keynes called ''animal spirits,'' which encourages people to convince themselves that this time prices will just rise and rise.
So it's news when Grantham, who has built his career on the conviction that peaks and troughs will even out as prices inevitably revert to their historical mean, says that this time it really is different, and not in a good way. In his April letter, ''Time to Wake Up: Days of Abundant Resources and Falling Prices Are Over Forever,'' he argued that ''we are in the midst of one of the giant inflection points in economic history.'' The market is ''sending us the Mother of all price signals,'' warning us that ''if we maintain our desperate focus on growth, we will run out of everything and crash.''
The letter is 19 pages long and dense with figures, but here's the short version: ''The prices of all important commodities except oil declined for 100 years until 2002, by an average of 70 percent. From 2002 until now, this entire decline was erased by a bigger price surge than occurred during World War II. Statistically, most commodities are now so far away from their former downward trend that it makes it very probable that the old trend has changed -- that there is in fact a Paradigm Shift -- perhaps the most important economic event since the Industrial Revolution.''
When prices go up and stay up, it's not a bubble. Prices may always revert to the mean, but the mean can change; that's a paradigm shift. As Grantham tells it, oil went first. For a century it steadily returned to about $16 a barrel in today's currency, then in 1974 the mean shifted to about $35, and Grantham believes it has recently doubled again. Metals and nearly everything else -- coal, corn, palm oil, soybeans, sugar, cotton -- appear to be following suit. ''From now on, price pressure and shortages of resources will be a permanent feature of our lives,'' he argues. ''The world is using up its natural resources at an alarming rate, and this has caused a permanent shift in their value. We all need to adjust our behavior to this new environment. It would help if we did it quickly.''
Grantham is taking the Malthusian side in an ongoing debate about growth and commodity prices/. The argument often circles back to the bet made in 1980 between the biologist Paul Ehrlich, who foretold catastrophic scarcity caused by overpopulation, and the economist Julian Simon, who argued that any short-term increase in resource prices caused by population growth will stimulate inventors and entrepreneurs to find new ways to exploit those resources, lowering prices in the long run. The two men picked five commodities and wagered on whether their prices, taken as an indicator of scarcity, would be higher or lower in 1990. Simon won, 5-0, even though the world's population grew by 800 million during that decade.
Malthusians have been trying to live down that defeat ever since, but, as Grantham points out in his July letter, if we extend the original bet past its arbitrary 10-year limit to the present day, Ehrlich wins the five-commodity bet 4-1, and he wins big if the bet is further extended to all important commodities. Grantham concludes that the longer-run story of the bet ''proves, in fact, both that man is mortal and must make short-term bets, and, more importantly, that Ehrlich's argument was right (so far).'' That final parenthesis, a nod to uncertainty, leaves open the remote possibility that the apparent paradigm shift might still turn out to be just a bubble in commodity prices.
Grantham has often been early, the besetting sin of the value investor. Sounding the alarm and bailing out well before the peak of one bubble after another has cost him profits and clients. But if he's right again and early again in identifying rising commodity prices/ as not just another bubble but as a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences, then he's giving us a little more time to come up with thoughtful, humane responses -- not that he expects us to.
''But it's never absolutely too late,'' Grantham said. ''It's never too late to do what we can,'' which includes making a lot of money you can use to try to protect whatever and whoever matters to you -- biodiversity, family, nation, everybody.
He's an impassioned environmentalist not only for the usual reasons but also because he believes humanity's vexed relationship with the planet is the great economic story of our time. ''This commodities thing may turn out to be the most interesting call of my career,'' he told me. ''I have no doubt we're going to have a bad hundred years. We have the resources to gracefully handle the transition, but we won't. We apparently can't.''
The stakes couldn't be higher. Grantham doesn't dwell on the potential for disaster on an unimaginable scale, but it looms behind his measured language. The world's population is seven billion and counting. ''Whether the stable population will be 1.5 billion or 5 billion,'' he said to me, ''the question is: How do we get there?''

HEADLINE: Trucks That Are Bigger and Badder, but Perhaps Not Better

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
HEAVY-DUTY pickup trucks are the supercars of the truck world. They have more power than drivers are likely ever to exploit, and bragging rights depend on statistics that are, in practical terms, theoretical.
Like a Lamborghini Aventador's top speed, a GMC Sierra HD's maximum tow rating (21,700 pounds) is more of a chest-thumping point than a practical consideration. In some versions of the Sierra 2500, you could theoretically carry a Corvette Z06 (3,175 pounds) in the bed.
Of course, if that's not enough capability, there's always the 3500 model, which can carry even heavier things.
While you can't buy a diesel engine in a mainstream light-duty pickup, heavy-duty pickups now offer propulsion suitable for a tandem-axle dump truck. 
I'm not exaggerating. Ford's 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8 packs 400 horsepower and 800 pound-feet of torque; the base engine in a Peterbilt 348 dump truck offers a mere 260 horsepower and 660 pound feet. Does your pickup really need more power than a Peterbilt?
I drove three new heavy-duty models that represent distinct points on the monster-pickup spectrum.
The GMC Sierra Denali 2500HD ($62,124 as tested) is aimed at people who'd rather drive a Mercedes S-Class, if only it could tow 10 tons.
The Ford F-350 Super Duty Power Stroke ($56,390) is a towering confluence of old-school truck design (hello, solid front axle) and up-to-the-minute diesel technology. And the Ram 2500 Power Wagon ($50,310) is an outlier, a heavy-duty truck that's optimized for off-road adventure, provided you can find a trail wide enough to use it. It's kind of like a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with a thyroid condition.
The GMC and Ford that I drove were diesel V-8s, while the Ram was powered by a 5.7-liter, 383-horsepower Hemi V-8.
(The Ram HD is also available with a 6.7-liter Cummins diesel in-line 6 that's rated at 350 horsepower and up to 800 pound-feet. But diesel propulsion isn't available in the Power Wagon.)
The diesel trucks hold a nominal edge in horsepower and a huge advantage in torque, but the rev-happy gas-powered Ram felt the friskiest of the three.
What the diesels lack in outright speed, they make up for with a certain relentlessness. In testing by Popular Mechanics, the GMC's 0-to-60 acceleration took 7.8 seconds. That's not a head-turning number in the context of gasoline-powered trucks, but the Sierra felt as if it would clock the same time even if it were hitched to the Pacific Plate.
I used the GMC to tow a 3,500-pound boat, and the Denali seemed ready to yank the trailer out from beneath the boat, like a magician pulling a tablecloth from under a dinner setting.
Nonetheless, I get the idea that the manufacturers' fixation on power numbers (the Ford got a power bump midway through the model year, just so it would have three more horsepower than General Motors' trucks) created unrealistic expectations. While I was driving the F-350, a guy in a white Econoline van pulled alongside and asked, ''That's got the new 6.7, right? Is it fast?'' Well, I'm sure the Great White Whale looked pretty fast to Ahab, in the manner of all huge things that move with anything other than ponderous deliberation.
Perhaps a better question would be, ''Do you have to take the whole cab off to gain access to the turbocharger?'' No you do not, and that's a new development. If the pre-2011 model needed a new turbo, it was as if the dentist were to say: ''O.K., we're going to fill that cavity. Just keep your mouth closed while we get the skull saw.''
Your local Super Duty mechanic might not need a cab hoist, but he'll want a sturdy stepladder. To give you an idea of how tall the F-350 is, the tailgate includes a fold-down step and a vertical grab handle. You know you've got a tall truck when it has its own staircase and newel post.
The Ford is wide, too. In fact, the outside rearview mirrors telescope and fold to aid parking. One observer, upon watching me navigate into a parking spot and retract the mirrors, burst out in laughter. Now I know how Dumbo felt.
The word ''handling'' doesn't really apply to any of these vehicles, but the Ram was the best at impersonating a car. An enormous, awful car -- maybe a 1978 Caprice that's been fitted with wooden wagon wheels -- but a car. Perhaps that's because the Power Wagon's off-road preoccupations result in sportier suspension tuning than you get in a truck that's optimized to haul a pallet of granite.
The Power Wagon is one of the few vehicles with locking front and rear differentials. The front bumper houses a Warn winch. And you can electronically disconnect the stabilizer bars, turning the axles into terrain-hugging contortionists. If you manage to get stuck in a Power Wagon, you've done something very foolish indeed.
The Denali, with its remote starter and air-conditioned leather seats, can temporarily fool you into thinking it's a nice luxury car. That is, until you round a corner and realize you're manning the crow's nest on the SS High Center of Gravity. The Sierra at least has an independent front suspension, which is still a mildly heretical feature among diehard truckers. The F-350, true to tradition, uses a solid front axle the diameter of a redwood stump. It looks sturdy. If there's nuclear war, all we'll have left are cockroaches and F-350 axles.
Besides the obvious area of fuel economy -- good luck coaxing a number that begins with a ''2'' -- these trucks pose day-to-day challenges. Drive-through automatic-teller machines are a problem, as your cash will probably come out on the same plane as the Power Wagon's floorboards. Many parking garages will be off limits, the architects having failed to anticipate the citizenry's taste for two-story transportation. And your trips to the service station will be frequent and painful. You know how gas pumps shut off automatically when your tab reaches $100? No? Well, you'll find out.
Here's my question for the potential heavy-duty truck buyer: When an F-150 with the EcoBoost V-6 can tow 11,300 pounds, how badly do you really need the F-250, let alone the F-350?
If you're a contractor or someone who regularly tows and hauls heavy payloads, then perhaps the heavy-duty trucks make sense. If you're a guy who tows a 24-foot boat a couple of times a year, the half-ton model will be more than sufficient.
I'm not the only one making this calculation. I met with a contractor recently, and he showed up driving a Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid. I commented on his choice of pickup, and he explained that he had owned a heavy-duty 2500 model until he pondered his driving habits and realized he didn't need mammoth hauling capacity as much as he needed better fuel economy.
I'd recommend a similar bout of introspection for anyone considering a heavy-duty truck. The modern crop of light-duty trucks might not tow that theoretical 10-ton trailer, but relative to their heavy-duty counterparts, they're faster, they ride better and they get better mileage.
But if you do require a heavy-duty truck, I suggest you cover all your bases and test-drive them all. I hear the new Peterbilts are sweet.

HEADLINE: A Long, Cold Summer at Mount Rainier

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, Wash. -- The calendar says summer, but the conditions are more like winter.
Usually by August, most of the snow on Mount Rainier, the sleeping volcanic giant here, has long since melted. The meadows of wildflowers are abloom, and hikers galore are tramping along the trails.
But this year, temperatures have been colder than usual, keeping record mounds of old snow lying around. This has discouraged everyone, from the most rigorous climbers to backpackers, hikers and Sunday drivers.
Total visitors to Mount Rainier National Park from January through July were down more than 30 percent, to 601,877, compared with the same period last year, when 868,681 people came. 
''We've had terrible weather all year,'' said Debbie Hannevig, the park's fee operations manager.
The colder temperatures have wreaked havoc with Mother Nature's schedule here and throughout the West and the Northwest, altering people's expectations of what they could and could not do this summer. In some areas, visitors were skiing in their bathing suits on the Fourth of July. In other cases, the unseasonable weather may have contributed to various accidents and deaths.
Here, at one of the jewels in the crown of the national park system, hikers have met closed roads and trails too dangerous to try. Rangers are advising hikers to use ice axes and crampons, equipment they normally do not need.
''There has never been this amount of snow, and it stopped us from doing things we would usually do,'' Carol Larkin, 66, of Richland said the other day as she and her husband, Dave, 67, changed out of their hiking boots at a rest stop beneath towering Douglas firs near the mountain's base.
They have hiked here every year since 1990 and wanted to keep up their ritual, even if it was curtailed. They said they encountered some people along the trail who turned back after seeing the snow and others who were unprepared but nonetheless forged ahead.
''I was amazed at some of the people we saw on the trail,'' Mrs. Larkin said. ''They didn't have poles. One person was in flip-flops.''
People can be caught off guard here because the weather on this glacier-capped mountain, which sits just 100 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, is so changeable. The location, the park service says, means that Rainier ''makes its own weather.''
It also acts as its own billboard advertisement, because it is so big and can be seen from so far away. ''If the weather is poor and you can't see the mountain, you don't come,'' Ms. Hannevig said.
The amount of snow still on the ground, as measured at Paradise, the park's main visitor area, is setting records. Last Sunday, it set a record of 44 inches, said Stefan Lofgren, the park's mountaineering district ranger. The previous record for Aug. 7 was 40 inches, set in 1974.
Another record was set Tuesday, when 43 inches remained on the ground. Mr. Lofgren said he expected records for another couple of weeks. At this elevation (5,400 feet), Paradise normally gets about 630 inches of snow a year, but this year it received a whopping 907 inches.
This is not the most snow ever for what rangers call ''one of the snowiest places on Earth,'' but it is close. The difference this year was the extended low temperatures in the spring and summer, which brought some of the coldest months on record in more than 100 years, preventing the snow from melting.
''It will probably be the third week of August until subalpine meadows in Washington State will be free of snow,'' Mr. Lofgren said.
For mountain climbers, the persistent snow has extended the climbing season, often creating firm-enough bridges over weak spots that might otherwise collapse into deep crevasses and swallow up even an experienced climber.
Moore Phillips, 24, a student who lives in Chapel Hill, N.C., was preparing to climb Rainier's summit the other day via Liberty Ridge, one of the mountain's most exposed and challenging routes.
When the snow is gone, he said, ''the rock fall is like a bowling alley,'' and that, combined with weak bridges, normally makes this climb too perilous so late in the season. ''If there wasn't this snow,'' he said, ''we couldn't do Liberty.''
Liberty Ridge is where an experienced climber, Rob Plankers, 50, of Olympia, apparently slid to his death in June. Despite having proper gear, he got hypothermia and frostbite, park spokesmen said, and others in his party left him to seek help. Mr. Plankers then apparently slid to his death 2,000 feet down a steep and icy slope. Foul weather and ferocious winds hampered recovery efforts.
Rob Reuter, 49, an environmental engineer in Seattle, climbed to the summit last weekend with friends. The sun was strong during the day, and some of the snow started to melt, making for an unexpectedly slushy and slippery descent. ''Coming down was more treacherous than normal,'' he said. ''The snow bridges were starting to collapse and it was a little scary at times. It took an extra hour and a half.''
While conditions are still good for climbers, Mr. Lofgren, the ranger, said, 1,200 fewer climbers tried to reach the summit this year compared with last year. (Generally, about 10,500 climbers a year try and about half make it.) ''Ironically,'' he said, ''the foggy, cold, snowy, windy weather that has preserved favorable climbing conditions often make it impossible to climb.''
But in his view, the bad weather is only part of the story. Another factor, he said, is the economy. Not only is climbing expensive -- equipment alone can cost $2,500 -- but gas prices have been high. And then the stock market began its wild gyrations, creating new anxiety. (Studies show that those who climb Rainier make an average of $90,000 a year, so it would not be surprising if many were invested in the market.)
''The number of climbers on the mountain has just as much to do with the Dow Jones and the Consumer Price Index as it has to do with weather conditions,'' Mr. Lofgren said.
''If the stock market hadn't just crashed,'' he said, ''we would have had a whole lot more people coming to the park.''

HEADLINE: Maybe It's Time for Plan C

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
RONA ECONOMOU was a lawyer at a large Manhattan law firm, making a comfortable salary and enjoying nights on the town when she was laid off in 2009, another victim of the recession. At first, she cried. ''Then it hit me,'' said Ms. Economou, now 33. ''This is my one chance'' to pursue a dream.
Six months later, feeling hopeful, she opened Boubouki, a tiny Greek food stall at the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side, where she bakes spinach pies and baklava every morning. This was supposed to be her Plan B: her chance to indulge a passion, lead a healthier life and downshift professionally -- at least by a gear. Instead, Ms. Economou finds herself in overdrive.
Six days a week, she wakes up at 5:30 a.m. (''before most lawyers'') to start baking. Instead of pushing paper, she hoists 20-pound bags of flour, gets burned and occasionally slices open a finger. On Mondays, when the shop is closed, she does bookkeeping and other administrative tasks. 
So much for a healthier life. ''The second I feel a cold coming on, I'm taking Cold-Eeze, eating raw garlic,'' she said. ''I can't afford to shut the shop down.''
Plan B, it turns out, is a lot harder than it seems. But that hasn't stopped cubicle captives from fantasizing. In recent years, a wave of white-collar professionals has seized on a moribund job market, a swelling enthusiasm for all things artisanal and the growing sense that work should have meaning to cut ties with the corporate grind and chase second careers as chocolatiers, bed-and-breakfast proprietors and organic farmers.
Indeed, since the dawn of the Great Recession, more Americans have started businesses (565,000 of them a month in 2010) than at any period in the last decade and a half, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which tracks statistics on entrepreneurship in the United States.
The lures are obvious: freedom, fulfillment. The highs can be high. But career switchers have found that going solo comes with its own pitfalls: a steep learning curve, no security, physical exhaustion and emotional meltdowns. The dream job is a ''job'' as much as it is a ''dream.''
''The decision to become an entrepreneur should not be made lightly,'' said Paul Bernard, an executive coach in New York who has advised professionals on starting small businesses. The press, he said, has made heroes out of former investment bankers and lawyers who transformed themselves into successful dog-jewelry designers and cupcake kings. ''But the reality is that, even during boom times, most new businesses fail.''
Many are surprised to find the hours and work grueling.
That was a rude awakening for Mary Lee Herrington, a 32-year-old St. Louis native who worked at a white-shoe law firm in London. Two years ago she ditched her job as a fourth-year associate, making $250,000 and working 60-hour weeks, to pursue a new life as a wedding planner. Her experience? She enjoyed organizing galas as a law student at the University of Pennsylvania. ''It was really creative, it was fun, I loved all the details: the party favors, the programs,'' she said.
But soon after starting her one-woman business, Forever & Ever Events, she quickly found it wasn't a 9-to-5 gig. Working out of the Primrose Hill apartment she shared with her husband, she often found herself glued to the computer past midnight, doing spreadsheet analyses of her new business, or writing copy for her Web site. Whenever a wedding date approached, she found herself pulling 17-hour days.
For her first client, a work colleague of a friend, she was so eager to prove herself that she charged $2,000 for a job that took five months. For another wedding, ''the clients were very demanding of my time, so much so that when I broke down the fee by the number of hours, I was making close to $:1 an hour,'' Ms. Herrington said. (By comparison, her rate as a lawyer was $450 an hour.)
The arithmetic doesn't account for the loss of free time. When you're the boss, the workday never really ends.
Charan Sachar, 37, a former software engineer who lives near Seattle, used to spend his downtime perusing Etsy, the D.I.Y. crafts site. He daydreamed of an unfettered life at his kiln, creating Bollywood-inspired teapots and butter dishes.
In January, after 12 years in software, he quit to devote himself full time to his online store, Creative With Clay, which sells stoneware he designs and makes. (Last May, he told his story on Etsy's ''Quit Your Day Job'' blog.)
Now, instead of spending his free time absorbed in visions of clay, he spends as much as 70 percent of his day on administration. He is not only his own boss, he is his own accountant, sales director, marketing manager and shipping clerk. That leaves little time to enjoy the hobby he loves.
''There are some days that I don't make anything in my studio, mostly because I am doing everything else,'' he said.
Former white-collar workers are also surprised by the demands of manual labor.
Last year, Jennifer Phelan, 27, left a marketing job at a large law firm to become a private Pilates instructor in Boston. She had envisioned a life of ''workouts, getting lots of sleep and blogging every day about health and fitness,'' she said. Instead, her classes start as early as 6 a.m. and she feels wiped out by day's end, which can be 14 hours later.
''I preach to my students to make time for themselves, to treat their bodies as vital instruments,'' Ms. Phelan said. ''Now, I'm lucky if I get that in a few times a month.''
Matthew Kang, 26, a former commercial bank analyst in Los Angeles, has it worse. Last year, he quit his prestigious job to open Scoops Westside, an ice cream shop in Culver City. ''I feel like a janitor sometimes,'' he said.
At least janitors have a steady paycheck. Plan B might entail more freedom, but that often comes at the expense of financial security.
After Anne McInnis, 52, was laid off as a textiles design director at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, she and her live-in partner, David Zadeh, opened an antiques and jewelry shop in Hudson, N.Y., called 12: Modern Antiquities. As a retailer with no retail experience, she had trouble getting used to the uncertainty. On any given day, there's no telling if 5 people or 50 will come through the door.
''With the shop, you do all your prep work, buying, merchandising and designing,'' she said. ''And it is a continuous process. And then you wait. And wait.''
Even when business is steady, the sacrifices are never far from mind. Is being your own boss worth the trade-off in medical benefits, gas allowances and paid vacations? AnnaBelle LaRoque, 28, a former pharmaceutical representative in Columbia, S.C., still wonders. ''There have been many times when I have had oatmeal for dinner and Grey Goose for dessert, contemplating these questions,'' said Ms. LaRoque, who gave up those perks to start a dress line, LaRoque.
Sometimes, keeping a dream job alive also means getting a second job. Before Ms. Herrington, the wedding planner, landed on her feet, she took a part-time job at the London Business School, coordinating a counseling program, that paid $18 an hour.
''It was a drag, but it was necessary because I had bills to pay and student loan payments every month,'' she said.
For some career switchers, the toughest challenges aren't the financial or physical hazards, but the emotional ones.
The risk of isolation is ever-present without co-workers to lean on. There are no bosses to take the heat in moments of crisis, no team to share the triumphs -- or the blame when things go wrong. And as Beth Conroy found out, rejection feels more personal when it's a one-person shop.
Last April Ms. Conroy, 35, quit public relations to become a licensed acupuncturist, opening a practice in Manhattan. She worries whenever a client doesn't return. Was the ailment cured? Or ''is it something I've done,'' she said. ''There's a lot of uncertainty if I let it become a reflection of me.''
Self-esteem comes up in another way. Leaving behind white-collar security can mean losing your identity as a breadwinner -- a ''loss of control,'' as Jackie Alpers of Tucson put it.
After being laid off from a luxury spa as its media relations coordinator, Ms. Alpers, 43, started a career as a food photographer for cookbooks and magazines. She loves the creativity, but dreads not knowing about the next gig and possibly failing to keep up her ''end of the bargain'' in maintaining a household with her husband.
''Women have worked hard for equality,'' Ms. Alpers added. ''I sometimes felt that I was taking a step backwards.''
For some, the unexpected pitfalls can be so treacherous that they no longer consider Plan B a dream job, but a nightmare. That was the unfortunate lesson for Anne-Laure Vibert, 31, who gave up a marketing job in New York, planning glamorous parties for Audemars Piguet, the watchmaker, to become a chocolatier.
A few years ago, she moved to Paris to apprentice with a master chocolatier. Visions of decadent bonbons swirled in her head. Instead, she felt like a modern-day Lucy in the candy factory, hunched over in a chocolate lab packing chocolates and scrubbing pots. If she wasn't doing that, she was sweeping floors, wrapping gifts, answering telephones or shipping orders.
After four months, she had had enough and called it quits. Her Plan C? She returned to New York and took a job with her old boss, doing marketing for another luxury brand. ''It got very lonely, to be honest,'' she said.
THIS is not to say that success is unattainable. Martha Stewart, after all, became Martha Stewart as a Plan B after abandoning a career as a stockbroker. And with the exception of Ms. Vibert, everyone interviewed said that despite the unforeseen bumps, they would not trade their new lives for their old jobs.
''I no longer walk with a slight depressed hunch,'' said Ms. Herrington, the wedding planner, who is now enjoying steady work and glowing write-ups in wedding blogs like 100 Layer Cake. Her friends, she added, said they noticed an instant improvement in her appearance, too. ''I no longer see chunks of hair falling out due to stress.''
''Before, I never wanted to talk about work, other than to complain,'' she added. ''Now I like talking about my work so much that my husband has to actually ask me not to talk about it all the time.''
Ms. Economou, the Greek baker, says she feels spiritually transformed. ''I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary, and I love it,'' she said. ''I love being a part of the neighborhood. I didn't realize how you become friends with your customers.''
And Ms. Alpers, the cookbook photographer, said the hard work and anxiety are starting to pay off, creatively and financially. Lately, she has shot covers for a crime novel and a nonfiction book about ghosts, and took photos for an Angry Birds tie-in cookbook.
''Even though I hate taking on all the responsibility myself and I'm often crazed,'' she said, ''the moment that I hold a book I've completed, it makes up for all the uncertainty of getting there.''

HEADLINE: Puck Drops Again, Far From the Ice

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
IT may seem a bit odd to take a summer stroll down the boardwalk in Rockaway Beach, Queens, and suddenly come upon a squad of armored hockey players gliding around as if on some frozen pond.
They move on wheels instead of blades. Their rink is a strip of asphalt painted blue. And their pastime -- roller hockey -- is finding a new popularity in Rockaway, one of many places around New York City where a quarter-century ago it was an indispensable street game, like stickball and handball.
''This town was built on roller hockey,'' said Rich Pontieri, 43, who plays in the Rockaway Rockies league, one of several in the city. ''We watched the pros play ice hockey on TV and we emulated them, and then the younger kids watched us. That's how everybody learned.'' 
Today, he and his teammates head to an outdoor rink tucked between the beach and the bungalows on Shore Front Parkway at Beach 108th Street. Some players skate up, straight from home. Others arrive by car and hop out in flip-flops to pull on pads, jerseys and in-line skates. They haul two heavy iron goals out of a storage locker and into place at opposite ends of a space about the size of a regulation ice hockey rink, but topped with a special asphalt textured like rough sandpaper.
About three years ago, the league raised money to help upgrade this Parks Department rink, resurfacing the playing area and painting over graffiti. It has been reborn as the center of roller hockey in Rockaway -- the home rink for the Rockies league.
The league's summer games, in July and August, draw mostly local teams: the Metro Moose from Brooklyn and the Juice Monkeys from Glendale, Queens. Then there are the Rockaway Possums -- so named because ''Rockaway is filled with possums,'' explained the league commissioner, Bobby Keane, at a recent game between the Moose and a group of Rockaway players who are new to the league. Their team, of course, is called the New Guys.
Most of the players are working-class Rockaway men ages 20 to 50. ''It's mostly firemen and cops,'' said Mr. Keane, 33. ''Half of these guys are related. It's Rockaway -- we're all related.''
In the modest aluminum bleachers were a few girlfriends and wives and children of players, plus a few beachgoers. The hockey is good to watch, with deft puck-handling, sharp passing and shooting, and experienced goalies.
There is also musical accompaniment. A bagpiper favors a grassy area next to the rink as a nightly rehearsal spot; when she showed up in the middle of the Moose/New Guys game, Mr. Keane shrugged and said, ''She's always here -- it's an Irish neighborhood.''
The Rockies, which run larger leagues in the spring and fall, break their 80-member summer league into two four-team parts: The A Division is for more competitive players, including some current and former members of college ice hockey teams, and the winning team gets $1,000. Play in the B Division is less competitive.
The Rockies formed in the 1980s as one big traveling team, playing mostly in Queens-wide leagues. It was a boom time for organized roller hockey in New York, and the team expanded into a league, with 300 players. The 108th Street rink opened in the mid-1990s, but as years went by, many players left for ice hockey. That trend is now reversing, said Mike Leahy, the league president.
''The recession has made it tougher for players to afford renting ice time, so they're seeing us as a more affordable alternative,'' said Mr. Leahy, 46, who runs the Rockies' youth program, which includes Saturday summer clinics.
The adult league plays in a style similar to professional ice hockey. Body-checking is prohibited, but contact and collisions are inevitable. Players are sent to penalty boxes with high chain-link fences. Squads of players rotate onto the rink in shifts.
They wear a less bulky version of typical ice hockey armor: helmets, elbow and shin guards and hockey gloves. Face masks are optional, and many players opt out. Participants must sign waivers acknowledging that they play at their own risk.
''Guys get broken noses, broken ankles, you name it,'' Mr. Keane said.
While most players wear in-line skates, which allow them to maneuver much as ice skates do, a few holdouts insist on sticking with ''quads,'' the old-fashioned skates with four wheels.
One holdout is Mr. Pontieri, known to younger players as Quadzilla. Yes, he says, in-line skates are faster and allow ice-skating moves, but quads offer better stability and better stopping power.
Mr. Pontieri speaks glowingly of roller hockey's glory days, about Joey and Brian Mullen, who grew up playing roller hockey on West 49th Street, then transferred those street skills to the ice. They became college stars and went on to heralded professional careers.
Rockaway was one of those places where the sport was more like a religion. When you grew old enough, you laced up your quads, bought a roll of electrical tape -- better than any store-bought puck -- and deployed garbage cans as goals in the street, tennis courts or playgrounds. One street would play the other street, and the best teams would carry their nets on their shoulders and skate over the Cross Bay Bridge to Broad Channel, just north of Rockaway, to play their best team.
''We played for bragging rights and there were big rivalries,'' Mr. Pontieri said. ''There was heavy competition and plenty of brawls.'' Games became more organized as the players reached adulthood, and afterward, they would go to bars like the Irish Circle and Tubridy's.
The tradition seems to be continuing. Mr. Leahy said all three of his young children play roller hockey, including his 2-year-old son, James. Mr. Keane said his son, Bobby, is only 17 months old but fully outfitted in tiny pads and skates. His first words included ''Shoot, score!'' and he has already begun skating at the 108th Street rink.
''We start them young here,'' Mr. Keane said.

HEADLINE: The Hope That Flows From History

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
AFTER the grim economic developments of the last few weeks, it's easy to lose hope. Could the Great Recession of 2008 drag on for years, just as the Great Depression did in the 1930s? Adding to the despair is the oft-repeated notion that it took World War II to end the economic nightmare of the '30s: If a global war was needed to return the economy to full employment then, what is going to save us today?
Look more closely at history and you'll see that the truth is much more complicated -- and less gloomy. While the war helped the recovery from the Depression, the economy was improving long before military spending increased. More fundamentally, the wrenching wartime experience provides a message of hope for our troubled economy today: we have the tools to deal with our problems, if only policy makers will use them.
As I showed in an academic paper years ago, the war first affected the economy through monetary developments. Starting in the mid-1930s, Hitler's aggression caused capital flight from Europe. People wanted to invest somewhere safer -- particularly in the United States. Under the gold standard of that time, the flight to safety caused large gold flows to America. The Treasury Department under President Franklin D. Roosevelt used that inflow to increase the money supply. 
The result was an aggressive monetary expansion that effectively ended deflation. Real borrowing costs decreased and interest-sensitive spending rose rapidly. The economy responded strongly. From 1933 to 1937, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of almost 10 percent, and unemployment fell from 25 percent to 14. To put that in perspective, G.D.P. growth has averaged just 2.5 percent in the current recovery, and unemployment has barely budged.
There is clearly a lesson for modern policy makers. Monetary expansion was very effective in the mid-1930s, even though nominal interest rates were near zero, as they are today. The Federal Reserve's policy statement last week provided tantalizing hints that it may be taking this lesson to heart and using its available tools more aggressively in coming months.
One reason the Depression dragged on so long was that the rapid recovery of the mid-1930s was interrupted by a second severe recession in late 1937. Though many factors had a role in the ''recession within a recession,'' monetary and fiscal policy retrenchment were central. In monetary policy, the Fed doubled bank reserve requirements and the Treasury stopped monetizing the gold inflow. In fiscal policy, the federal budget swung sharply, from a stimulative deficit of 3.8 percent of G.D.P. in 1936 to a small surplus in 1937.
The lesson here is to beware of withdrawing policy support too soon. A switch to contractionary policy before the economy is fully recovered can cause the economy to decline again. Such a downturn may be particularly large when an economy is still traumatized from an earlier crisis.
The recent downgrade of American government debt by Standard & Poor's makes this point especially crucial. It would be a mistake to respond by reducing the deficit more sharply in the near term. That would almost surely condemn us to a repeat of the 1937 downturn. And higher unemployment would make it all that much harder to get the deficit under control.
Military spending didn't begin to rise substantially until late 1940. Once it did, fiscal policy had an expansionary impact. Some economists argue that the effect wasn't very large, as real government purchases (in 2005 dollars) rose by $1.4 billion from 1940 to 1944, while real G.D.P. rose only $0.9 billion.
But this calculation misses two crucial facts: Taxes increased sharply, and the government took many actions to decrease private consumption, like instituting rationing and admonishing people to save. That output soared despite these factors suggests that increases in government spending had a powerful stimulative effect. Consistent with that, private nonfarm employment -- which excludes active military personnel -- rose by almost eight million from 1940 to 1944.
The lesson here is that fiscal stimulus can help a depressed economy recover -- an idea supported by new studies of the 2009 stimulus package. Additional short-run tax cuts or increases in government investment would help deal with our unemployment crisis.
What of the idea that monetary and fiscal policy can do little if unemployment is caused by structural factors, like a mismatch between workers' skills and available jobs? As I discussed in a previous column, such factors are probably small today.
But World War II has something to tell us here, too. Because nearly 10 million men of prime working age were drafted into the military, there was a huge skills gap between the jobs that needed to be done on the home front and the remaining work force. Yet businesses and workers found a way to get the job done. Factories simplified production methods and housewives learned to rivet.
Here the lesson is that demand is crucial -- and that jobs don't go unfilled for long. If jobs were widely available today, unemployed workers would quickly find a way to acquire needed skills or move to where the jobs were located.
Finally, what about the national debt? Given the recent debt downgrade, it might seem impossible for the United States to embark on fiscal stimulus that would increase its ratio of debt to G.D.P.
Well, at the end of World War II, that ratio hit 109 percent -- one and a half times as high as it is now. Yet this had no obvious adverse consequences for growth or our ability to borrow.
This isn't hard to explain. Everyone understood then why the nation was racking up so much debt: we were fighting for survival, and for the survival of our allies. No one doubted that we would repay our debts. We had done it after every other war, and raising taxes even before the attack on Pearl Harbor showed our leaders' fiscal resolve.
Today, we can do much more to aid recovery, including a near-term increase in our debt. But we need to make the reasons clear and make concrete our commitment to deal with the debt over time.
In place of the tepid budget agreement now in place, we could pass a bold plan with more short-run spending increases and tax cuts, coupled with much more serious, phased-in deficit reduction. By necessity, the plan would tackle entitlement reform and gradually raise tax revenue. This would be the World War II approach to our problems.
Equally important, someone needs to explain to the nation and to world markets just why we must increase the debt in the short run. Unemployment of roughly 9 percent for 28 months and counting is a national emergency. We must fight it with the same passion and commitment we have brought to military emergencies in our past.

HEADLINE: Scandal Rattles A Reformer

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
For E. Gordon Gee, the athletic scandal that humbled the mighty Ohio State football program overshadowed an otherwise normal, productive January, a month bookended by the Buckeyes' Sugar Bowl victory and a business trip overseas. Still, Gee boarded the flight home from China firmly behind his football coach.
He had no idea what awaited him -- the most difficult stretch, he would later say, in three decades spent running some of the country's largest, most prestigious universities.
On a layover in Chicago, Gee settled into the American Airlines Admirals Club and called his office to check in. Herb Asher, counselor to the president, dispensed with the usual pleasantries. ''You won't be happy with this,'' Asher started. Then he delivered the bad news.
The football program Gee often referred to as the ''university's budget running up and down the field'' would soon be under N.C.A.A. investigation for apparent rules violations that included players selling memorabilia for cash and tattoos. Worse yet, e-mails that shattered Coach Jim Tressel's earlier explanation of ignorance had been uncovered in Gee's absence. 
He scheduled a series of meetings for the next day, knowing this threatened to undermine the progress the university had made on other fronts. For all the ways Ohio State could be measured -- its importance to the state's economy, the $1 billion medical center under construction, its half million living alumni -- Gee believes that even if football revenue represents only one-half of one percent of the total budget, it also garners 90 percent of the attention, an imbalance for which he has spent years trying to exploit and correct.
Until that month, Gee, 67, enjoyed his reputation as an outspoken critic of Division I athletics, as a grand reformer, bespectacled and bow-tied, who once ''declared war'' on the culture of college sports. He knew this reputation would collide with the transgressions of the football program, his pleas for change marked hypocritical in the wake of the investigation.
Even if he disagreed, he knew how the whole thing looked. ''Because here he was, the iconic leader, out there beating the drums for college reform, and he's got a scandal on his hands,'' Gee said. ''He's just like everyone else.''
The events of the past week -- a retreat among university presidents to discuss reform in college athletics and then Ohio State's meeting with the N.C.A.A.'s infractions committee -- have further exposed Gee's predicament. Namely, what power, if any, college presidents hold over their athletic departments and whether anyone, Gee included, can actually enact change in major college sports.
Yet Gee views the scandal in opportunistic terms. He is beating the same drum, using what happened at Ohio State as proof.
''We're in the middle of this firestorm, and everyone will be looking to us,'' Gee said. ''I've always said I wouldn't like to have myself judged by the vicissitudes of an 18-year-old running a football. But this is the system. College athletics has gotten beyond itself. Do I think it's broken? Yes.''
Even, apparently, under his expansive roof.
Dress Shoe in Mouth
On Aug. 5, as Gee made the presidential rounds in Cleveland, what associates had described as his caricature of a college president emerged. He shook so many hands he applied sanitizer between bursts. He ate cucumbers from a local garden and spoke to civic leaders over meatloaf while wearing one of his 2,000 bow ties. The chi of Gee, one friend called it.
Gee (pronounced with a hard G) describes himself as ''nerdy,'' but his following, especially in Columbus, is closer to that of a rock star. This is largely because ''he works the room as well as anyone I know,'' said Bill Funk, a consultant who has conducted more than 350 president or chancellor searches. The ability to schmooze, to bend perception, made Gee the ultimate fund-raiser, which afforded him the highest of presidential profiles, and a Time magazine profile two years ago lauded Gee as among the country's leading college presidents.
In three stops on Aug. 5, Gee took three questions about football, the scarlet-and-gray elephant that hung over an otherwise normal summer day. No one mentioned the players or tattoos.
Gee summoned Tressel to his home the afternoon after he returned from the overseas trip and questioned him for three and a half hours. Tressel was normally ''ultracommunicative,'' Gee said, ''a guy who would communicate what shoes he was wearing in the morning.'' That, combined with Tressel's track record, sold Gee on Tressel's explanation that he knew nothing of the violations. (Tressel, through his lawyer, declined to comment.)
The men were close, perhaps too close in hindsight. Gee described their relationship as ''wonderful.'' When his daughter, Rebekah, sustained broken bones in a motor-scooter accident that killed her first husband, Tressel dispatched players to visit her in the hospital and placed decals on their helmets in remembrance.
Such trust later proved embarrassing, even for a president who keeps a fluid list of the 10 dumbest comments he ever made in public in his briefcase. Because Gee, whose charisma is built on self-deprecation, on selling himself as an ordinary guy with outsize ambitions, stepped behind a microphone on March 8 and made a joke he later described as a ''disaster'' and ''my dumbest statement yet.''
He said: ''I'm just hoping the coach doesn't dismiss me.''
Those who know Gee say he has long inserted dress shoe into mouth. He once said he wanted to milk a cow in every county in Ohio, until he found out there were 88. Over the years, Gee apologized for insulting Southwest Missouri State, the Montana School of Massage and, most famously, the Little Sisters of the Poor, all attempts at humor gone awry, he said.
''Nobody is better at the strategic apology than Gordon,'' said Michael Schoenfeld, a vice president at Duke who worked with Gee at Vanderbilt. ''He has turned the mea culpa into an art form.''
But Gee's joke about the university president being subordinate to the football coach -- given the subject matter, their salaries, the fact that Tressel did know about the violations and that the university later forced him to resign -- prompted a national outcry. It played worse than all the others, because it inadvertently hinted at a larger truth.
''The low point was that years and years of hard work kind of goes up in smoke,'' Gee said. ''And that it had done real damage to the institution beyond what I would like to admit. I'm recovering from it now. We're on the upside of the downside. But we have sustained a body blow that will take a long time to recover from.''
'Thrives on Stimuli'
Gee grew up in Vernal, Utah, the descendant of Mormon pioneers. He graduated from law school at Columbia University and clerked for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. At 37, he plunged permanently into academia, becoming the president of West Virginia University, and he has held the same post, at five universities, including twice at Ohio State, ever since.
Funk cannot recall another president who returned to the same university, let alone ran five. This speaks to Gee's longevity and nature. He never stayed until the end of the movie, because, his former wife Constance said: ''He thrives on stimuli. He derives energy from walking through a room of 500 people. He needs that constant stimulation. He loves the attention and adoration that comes with newness.''
At each stop, Gee created his presidential persona. He slept in dormitories, ordering pizza, and showed up unannounced at birthdays or campus bars. He sent hundreds of handwritten notes. He organized theme parties, like the recent Art Party, in which he invited every student named Art and served artichoke dip. He calls his students ''my kids.''
Gee holds few hobbies outside academia. He enjoys watching movies, especially Harry Potter films, with a bowl of popcorn, and shopping for bow ties. Rebekah said she often urged her father toward more balance.
''I always say I was in a polygamous marriage,'' Gee said. ''Married to my wife. Married to the university. Even though I'm Mormon, I can't do that.''
Gee had never seen a football game upon his arrival at West Virginia, but he soon came to understand the sport's importance. John Cooper, a former Ohio State football coach, said Gee poured his celebrated energy into recruiting players and always stopped by the locker room after games.
Gee saw the benefits of merging the academic and athletic worlds. When he recruited one provost to Ohio State in the 1990s, Gee walked the candidate into the stadium, where his picture flashed across the scoreboard and the speakers boomed an introduction -- ''the next provost at The Ohio State University'' -- that echoed across the empty stands.
For years, Gee flirted with political ambitions, but ultimately decided he could effect more change as a university president. Few of his changes reaped more attention than his athletic reforms at Vanderbilt. But those changes also called into question whether Gee was more schmooze than substance.
''He was somewhat of a caricature,'' said Todd Turner, the athletic director Gee fired at Vanderbilt. ''He was really an image-conscious perception shaper. He's a master at that. He loved the interaction with people far more than he did the details of growing a university.''
In 2003, Gee said he felt college athletics had ''become increasingly separated and arrogant, apart from the institution.'' Gee wrote then that ''athletic departments exist as separate, almost semiautonomous fiefdoms.''
In theory, he integrated the Vanderbilt athletic department back into the university. He also fired Turner and other staff members. David Williams, whom Gee took with him from Ohio State, assumed control of the department but held responsibilities beyond it.
The reform took on mythical proportions, for which Gee largely received credit for challenging an athletic system run amok. Revenge of the nerds, he called it. Other universities seized the opportunity in recruiting, selling the notion that Vanderbilt had turned a Division I athletic program into an intramural one.
In practice, the changes proved largely symbolic, highlighting an approach Vanderbilt had for the most part already taken. Williams said Vanderbilt increased its athletics budget by $16 million after the change, and admitted he functioned then and now as a de facto athletic director. ''We could have done a better job of communicating exactly what we were doing,'' he said.
The reform tag stuck. Then Gee came under criticism in 2006 for a Wall Street Journal article that described his $6 million in renovations to the university mansion. Constance Gee argued that the couple attracted billions in donations there, and reconnected with the music community in Nashville, even keeping a guitar in the dining room from the country star Jack Clement, known as Cowboy, that guests put to regular use.
Gee returned to Ohio State in 2007, to the university where students rallied at his home before he left, wearing T-shirts, holding signs, begging him to stay, to the community that surrounded him when his first wife died of cancer. It felt like a return home.
But there is, Turner noted, ''a great danger in selling yourself as a reformer,'' and when Gee returned to Ohio State, his personality and influence ran smack into the huge entity that is major college sports in the Big Ten. His predecessor, Karen Holbrook, said the changes at Vanderbilt ''would not have made sense at Ohio State.''
So Gee hitched his reputation to Tressel, a popular football coach with the pristine reputation.
Tricky Balancing Act
As the president of one of the largest universities in the country, Gee oversees a $5 billion budget, $800 million in annual research expenditures, and more than 64,000 students and 42,000 employees. Ohio State, he believes, is an elephant that must move like a ballerina. To that end, Gee starts his day at 4:30 a.m. and skips lunch.
His mentor, Gene Budig, who served as president at three universities and for Major League Baseball's American League, said Gee must balance these competing interests -- students, faculty, alumni, the governor, the legislature, among others. Yet athletics, especially at a university like Ohio State, loom large, and few, if any, presidents have embraced that department the way Gee has.
This presents a tricky balancing act. While at Vanderbilt, Gee met regularly with his counterparts in the Southeastern Conference, and they would, he said, ''hold hands and sing kumbaya,'' and ultimately, nothing changed. In fact, a 2009 survey of college presidents from the Knight Commission found that ''presidents believe they have limited power to effect change on their own campuses regarding athletics financing and the larger problems it has created.''
For Gee, the events of the past six months have underscored that notion.
''To have somebody as smart as him, as powerful as him, get caught up in something like this, you see how little power a president has,'' said David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University and a member of the Drake Group, a network of professors who lobby for academic integrity in college sports. ''It was sad for me to see him at that press conference, making that joke.''
Gee said the tendency for presidents at colleges caught in an athletic scandal was to go into hiding, and early in his career, he shared that sentiment. He felt he needed to defend his myriad responsibilities, to shout: ''I don't need to know everything. And I don't. I run this complex organization. How would I know Terrelle Pryor is out getting tattoos?''
Yet Gee now calls that thinking -- engaging with the athletic department at arm's length -- a ''fool's paradox'' for those in his position. As the head of Ohio State, he took ''direct responsibility'' for the scandal; he hired the key members of the athletic department, he set the expectations. Still, when asked why this incident produced so much attention, Gee answered simply, ''Because it's Ohio State.''
In Cleveland, Gee told one audience that the university's investigation uncovered a ''level of integrity we can all take pride in.'' He urged attendees to lay blame not with the athletes, or with the school, but with the culture of N.C.A.A. athletics. This, of course, is a familiar refrain.
As the investigation unfolded, as Ohio State examined e-mails, phone logs and text messages, and hired former C.I.A. agents for assistance, Gee said he never feared for his job.
''It's absolutely preposterous to speculate that way,'' said Timothy Gerber, a professor of music and former chairman of the university's faculty council. ''The faculty understands his range of responsibilities. We have 4,000 research projects going on, and all people want to talk about is what kind of car a football player might be driving.''
After its investigation, Ohio State vacated each of its wins from the 2010 season, including the Sugar Bowl triumph and forfeited its share of the Big Ten's payment for having played in the game ($338,811). It also put the football team on probation for two years and, Gee said, made changes to the compliance department, adding additional layers of reporting. Gene Smith, the Ohio State athletic director, confirmed that the investigation had cost the athletic department $800,000 so far.
The N.C.A.A. could issue additional penalties in the coming months. Gee declined to speculate about the hearing, but said he felt confident Ohio State had uncovered all violations. He said he ''would be surprised'' if additional misdeeds were revealed.
In Cleveland, Gee attempted to lighten the mood with humor typical of his tenure, his crutch for extreme discomfort. A woman told Gee her father had been a water boy for the football team years ago. ''I'll probably be one next year,'' he said. Nervous laughter followed.

HEADLINE: A Theory of Everything (Sort of)

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
LONDON burns. The Arab Spring triggers popular rebellions against autocrats across the Arab world. The Israeli Summer brings 250,000 Israelis into the streets, protesting the lack of affordable housing and the way their country is now dominated by an oligopoly of crony capitalists. From Athens to Barcelona, European town squares are being taken over by young people railing against unemployment and the injustice of yawning income gaps, while the angry Tea Party emerges from nowhere and sets American politics on its head.
What's going on here? 
There are multiple and different reasons for these explosions, but to the extent they might have a common denominator I think it can be found in one of the slogans of Israel's middle-class uprising: ''We are fighting for an accessible future.'' Across the world, a lot of middle- and lower-middle-class people now feel that the ''future'' is out of their grasp, and they are letting their leaders know it.
Why now? It starts with the fact that globalization and the information technology revolution have gone to a whole new level. Thanks to cloud computing, robotics, 3G wireless connectivity, Skype, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, the iPad, and cheap Internet-enabled smartphones, the world has gone from connected to hyper-connected.
This is the single most important trend in the world today. And it is a critical reason why, to get into the middle class now, you have to study harder, work smarter and adapt quicker than ever before. All this technology and globalization are eliminating more and more ''routine'' work -- the sort of work that once sustained a lot of middle-class lifestyles.
The merger of globalization and I.T. is driving huge productivity gains, especially in recessionary times, where employers are finding it easier, cheaper and more necessary than ever to replace labor with machines, computers, robots and talented foreign workers. It used to be that only cheap foreign manual labor was easily available; now cheap foreign genius is easily available. This explains why corporations are getting richer and middle-skilled workers poorer. Good jobs do exist, but they require more education or technical skills. Unemployment today still remains relatively low for people with college degrees. But to get one of those degrees and to leverage it for a good job requires everyone to raise their game. It's hard.
Think of what The Times reported last February: At little Grinnell College in rural Iowa, with 1,600 students, ''nearly one of every 10 applicants being considered for the class of 2015 is from China.'' The article noted that dozens of other American colleges and universities are seeing a similar surge as well. And the article added this fact: Half the ''applicants from China this year have perfect scores of 800 on the math portion of the SAT.''
Not only does it take more skill to get a good job, but for those who are unable to raise their games, governments no longer can afford generous welfare support or cheap credit to be used to buy a home for nothing down -- which created a lot of manual labor in construction and retail. Alas, for the 50 years after World War II, to be a president, mayor, governor or university president meant, more often than not, giving things away to people. Today, it means taking things away from people.
All of this is happening at a time when this same globalization/I.T. revolution enables the globalization of anger, with all of these demonstrations now inspiring each other. Some Israeli protestors carried a sign: ''Walk Like an Egyptian.'' While these social protests -- and their flash-mob, criminal mutations like those in London -- are not caused by new technologies per se, they are fueled by them.
This globalization/I.T. revolution is also ''super-empowering'' individuals, enabling them to challenge hierarchies and traditional authority figures -- from business to science to government. It is also enabling the creation of powerful minorities and making governing harder and minority rule easier than ever. See dictionary for: ''Tea Party.''
Surely one of the iconic images of this time is the picture of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak -- for three decades a modern pharaoh -- being hauled into court, held in a cage with his two sons and tried for attempting to crush his people's peaceful demonstrations. Every leader and C.E.O. should reflect on that photo. ''The power pyramid is being turned upside down,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, an Israeli political theorist.
So let's review: We are increasingly taking easy credit, routine work and government jobs and entitlements away from the middle class -- at a time when it takes more skill to get and hold a decent job, at a time when citizens have more access to media to organize, protest and challenge authority and at a time when this same merger of globalization and I.T. is creating huge wages for people with global skills (or for those who learn to game the system and get access to money, monopolies or government contracts by being close to those in power) -- thus widening income gaps and fueling resentments even more.
Put it all together and you have today's front-page news.

HEADLINE: Their Mission: To Build a Better Toilet

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG

 BODY:
NO wonder they are called conveniences. Flush toilets swirl human waste down the drain quickly and neatly. But the convenience comes with a rising price for all that follows the flush -- a cost that is often paid by municipal water and sewage treatment systems.
Now some groups are rethinking the venerable technology of the flush toilet, particularly for regions that lack such systems or for places where waste water treatment plants, many of them aging, are overburdened by the demands of fast-growing populations. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has begun a ''Reinvent the Toilet'' competition and awarded $3 million to researchers at eight universities, challenging them to use recent technology to create models that needn't be connected to sewers, or to water and electricity lines, and that cost less than pennies per person a day to use. Later prizes will include financing for one or more winning prototypes to be tested and produced commercially.
''The present toilet is a 19th-century device that does not meet the needs of a vast part of the world's population,'' said Frank Rijsberman, an executive at the foundation. Instead, he said, about 2.6 billion people without access to sewer-linked systems must use simple latrines, holes in the ground or just the nearest available spot -- a situation that can lead to many health problems, like acute childhood diarrhea.
One of the new toilets being financed by the foundation is a compact chamber that runs on solar power from a roof panel and uses built-in electrochemical technology to process waste.
''We can clean the waste water up to the same level as would come out of a treatment plant,'' said Michael R. Hoffmann, a professor of environmental science at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who received $400,000 to develop this solar toilet. It uses the sun's energy to power an electrode system in the waste water; the electrodes drive a series of cleansing chemical reactions, converting organic waste in the water into carbon dioxide and producing hydrogen that can be stored in a fuel cell for night operation.
The cost of each unit, which can be used up to 500 times a day, may initially be as high as $5,000 for a prototype but would drop with commercial production. Operational costs will be only a few cents a day, Dr. Hoffmann said.
Dr. Rijsberman said chemical engineering might provide the route to inventing many future toilets. Rather than composting waste for six months, as many waterless composting toilets do, the new versions could heat the waste quickly, killing pathogens, he said.
One of the funded projects taking this approach is a design for waste disposal at community bathrooms in South Africa, said Katherine Foxon, a member of the team that is working on the technology. Dr. Foxon is a chemical engineer and senior lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban. ''We'll process the waste chemically, combusting the feces and using that energy to drive the evaporation of urine,'' she said.
Even in countries with extensive sewer systems, researchers are testing toilets that still flush but will divert urine before it gets into the sewer.
''Most nutrients from human metabolism are excreted in urine and must be degraded at treatment plants,'' said Tove A. Larsen, a senior scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, or Eawag, in Dubendorf.
Dealing with urine separately, by siphoning it off to local storage tanks, simplifies waste water management. The urine can then be collected, treated and recycled as fertilizer. Dr. Larsen was a leader of a six-year project at Eawag on urine separation, known as No Mix technology.
The toilets at Eawag's office buildings are No Mix models. Each has a built-in urinal at the front that drains into storage. The back compartment works like a conventional toilet as waste is flushed into the sewer.
The technology is in its infancy and has drawbacks, Dr. Larsen said. Children have difficulty aiming correctly between the compartments, for instance. And the toilets can cost twice as much as conventional models and require steady maintenance to prevent the build-up of pipe-clogging scale that is deposited by urine.
Dr. Larsen, who is also one of the Gates Foundation winners, will lead an interdisciplinary team in developing a nonflush toilet. It will have separate compartments for urine and feces, she said, along with a third compartment for water that is used to keep the toilet clean. After filtering, this water can be reused in the cleaning process.
Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard who has long researched water and energy resources, applauded the efforts of the foundation but said the problems that the competition is addressing are monumental.
''You need toilets that are inexpensive and can be used by more than two billion poor people,'' he said. There are many potentially good solutions, he said, though, they have not yet been economically feasible.
''But it is worthwhile to pursue solutions,'' he said. ''Life would be so much better for a lot of people.''

HEADLINE: A Second Home For Affluent Chinese

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
WEALTHY buyers from mainland China, a rapidly expanding economy of 1.3 billion people, are increasingly turning to Manhattan for their luxury real estate purchases, brokers say.
In about two years, what was at first a trickle of inquiries has grown to a stream of freshly minted high-net-worth Chinese businesspeople hunting for condominiums for $500,000 to $10 million and up. The average purchase is a one-bedroom apartment for about $1.45 million, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group.
Most of these buyers are seeking apartments for personal use, either as pieds-a-terre or as housing for children studying in New York. The majority of the sales fall at the lower end of the luxury spectrum, but in one case a parent spent $20 million on an apartment for a daughter at college in Manhattan, Ms. Liebman said. 
In general, Chinese buyers prefer condos to co-ops. ''It's a fair challenge getting them to understand the co-op system,'' said Neil Palmer, the chief executive of Christie's International Real Estate, which last month opened an office in Hong Kong, adjacent to its auction house.
Most new buyers are not interested in properties as trophies, he said. ''They focus on yes, I might want it for my own occupation, but they always ask where the investment rationale is for buying the property,'' Mr. Palmer said.
Prices in New York are a draw, especially when compared with those in other cities where wealthy Asians might otherwise have invested. Luxury properties here are about $1,500 per square foot, while a comparable London flat is more than twice that, $3,600 per square foot, according to the Knight Frank/Citi Private Bank 2010 Wealth Report. Comparable real estate in Hong Kong costs $2,000 per square foot; in Monaco, $4,300. Current exchange rates also work in favor of Chinese buyers. China's rapid development means there is more money than ever to invest in the United States. And newly relaxed banking regulations in mainland China make it easier for investors to move money out of the country, Mr. Palmer said.
''Foreign exchange restrictions have not been entirely lifted but loosened,'' he said. ''There is more ability to move funds offshore effectively and perfectly legally.''
The new Chinese buyers tend to prefer sleek glass boxes, like the Time Warner Center, that remind them of the gleaming new cities from which many of them come. Shlomi Reuveni, a senior managing director of Brown Harris Stevens Select, markets two such properties to Chinese buyers: the Laureate on the Upper West Side, and 15 Union Square West. A new building, 57 Reade, at Broadway and Reade Street in Lower Manhattan, will be pitched to the same customers when it goes on the market this fall.
According to Mr. Reuveni, these buildings have the amenities that wealthy Chinese are looking for, like swimming pools, fitness centers, concierge services, parking, pet spas and music rooms, along with high design and high-end finishes. The Laureate also has a 421A tax abatement that keeps common charges reasonable and enhances the perceived value.
''They gravitate toward high-end quality,'' Mr. Reuveni said, ''and the collective attributes of the buildings, aesthetics, design and the commitment to quality, give an image of everlasting value.''
Cash is the coin of the realm. Brokers estimate that 50 percent to 75 percent of transactions by Chinese in New York do not involve mortgages. Culturally, Asians are loan-averse, thinking that coming to the table with less than the asking price will reflect negatively on them, said Wei Min Tan, a principal of Castle Avenue Partners.
Some brokers are working to change that. The Corcoran Group plans to host a conference for prospective buyers in New York at which it will introduce them to bankers and initiate them into the process of obtaining a mortgage in the United States. Corcoran is owned by Realogy, which has a network of 24,000 agents in China under various companies -- including ERA, Century 21, Sotheby's and Coldwell Banker -- who can refer clients to Corcoran agents in New York.
To circumvent the language barrier, the companies interviewed for this article have staff members who are Chinese speakers. Mr. Tan of the Castle Avenue Group speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and the Hokkien dialect. Bond New York recently added a Chinese language page to its Web site.
Feng shui and other cultural preferences are a consideration. Michael Chen, the director of Asian market development for Bond New York, noted, for example, that Asian buyers do not want to live on the fourth floor (associated with death because in some dialects the word rhymes with death) and prefer the eighth floor (associated with luck and prosperity).
Beyond New York's financial advantage, the appeal to Asian buyers includes a large Chinese-speaking community in Manhattan and in the outer boroughs, as well as a lack of suffocating pollution.
''The quality of life is better,'' Mr. Tan said. ''Work hours are better, and there is a better family and work/life balance.''
And for many newly wealthy buyers, Manhattan real estate also represents security.
''Socially, economically and politically,'' said Mr. Reuveni of Brown Harris Stevens Select, ''it is a safe haven that is a solid place to invest your money.''

HEADLINE: Buy, Sell, Hold (Tight)

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL, CHARLES DUHIGG and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
ONE of the most harrowing stretches in Wall Street history began with the loss of the AAA credit rating of the United States and ended with fears of a new recession. In between, the wild swings in the financial markets captivated the nation, and the world.
Even financial professionals were grasping for answers. Many were selling -- and many were buying as fast as they could. Each was making a bet on whether last week was a hiccup, or the start of something worse.
9:45 p.m. Friday, Aug. 5: Waterbury Center, Vt.
As she watched her beloved Red Sox battle the Yankees, Karissa McDonough opened her laptop to check e-mail. 
Jumping off the screen was a subject line from a news alert at 9:03 p.m.: ''U.S. Long-Term Debt Downgraded by Standard & Poor's.''
She stared at her screen in disbelief. Ms. McDonough, the chief bond strategist at People's United Bank in Connecticut, had spent her working life analyzing the debt of companies and governments. This news, however, was surreal. This happened in other countries. Not here.
''We were just downgraded!'' she exclaimed to her husband.
''Who's we?''
''The United States!''
She had to react swiftly. Clients might panic. Money managers at People's United would need to know what to say. She began tapping on her laptop. At 11:02 p.m. she sent an e-mail to more than 100 colleagues. The downgrade, she told them, was ''historic but not catastrophic.''
Ms. McDonough went on: ''The U.S. Treasury market remains the safest, largest, most liquid investable asset class in the world.'' Governments like China's, she said, would be hard-pressed to find a better alternative.
She collapsed into bed. She had a sinking feeling that her vacation on Cape Cod, scheduled for the coming week, was about to be downgraded, too.
Noon Saturday, Aug. 6: Pasadena, Calif.
Stephen Walsh, the chief investment officer of Western Asset, had been expecting the e-mail all day.
''How do you think the markets will respond on Monday?'' a worried official from the United States Treasury asked him.
A few weeks earlier, Western Asset, one of the nation's largest bond fund managers, had asked Standard & Poor's for a private briefing about America's credit rating. S.& P. had already announced that there was an even chance that the nation's AAA rating might be lowered.
The S.& P. analysts were prohibited from saying more. But when they met with Western Asset, it was clear that the odds had worsened. ''You could tell a lot by their body language, how carefully they answered certain questions,'' said one of the people in those meetings. The analysts didn't say anything specific, but they didn't have to. Afterward, Mr. Walsh took his top lieutenants into his office, one by one. A downgrade is inevitable, he told them. We need a plan.
Now, it had happened. The previous night, the once unthinkable had occurred. The Treasury official from Washington wanted to know how Mr. Walsh -- a man who indirectly controls half a trillion dollars in assets -- thought the markets would respond. The Treasury was planning to sell billions of dollars of new bonds in the coming week. If buyers didn't materialize at the auctions, it could be disastrous for the government, the financial markets and the entire global economy.
''I think investors understand it's not that big a deal,'' Mr. Walsh told the Treasury official.
It was the same thing he had been saying all day to colleagues, hedge funds and investment banks seeking his advice. ''U.S. Treasuries are still the most high-quality instrument out there,'' he told them. People need a safe place to put their money, and if the downgrade unsettled the stock market, as he suspected it would, investors would flock to safe investments like Treasuries, regardless of S.& P.'s opinions.
''World investors didn't downgrade U.S. debt; S.& P. did,'' he told one caller. ''It's just one opinion.''
When he hung up, his wife turned to him.
''What if you're wrong?'' she asked.
''That's the great thing about Wall Street,'' he replied. ''We'll know Monday morning if I'm a genius or an idiot.''
11:30 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 7: East 66th Street, Manhattan
It looked like a sell-off. Not a panic like the one that had struck in 2008, but something different.
Michael Warlan, who heads equity trading for Third Avenue, a mutual fund company in Manhattan, sat in his home office on the Upper East Side, fielding calls and sending instant messages to brokers around the globe.
Amid the turbulence, he smelled opportunity.
Third Avenue, with $15 billion in assets under management, had in recent months moved about 12 percent of its money into cash. Its strategy is to invest in undervalued stocks -- and in May, June and July, there had been precious few good deals to be found. Now, Mr. Warlan sat with a list of stocks he had been eyeing for months. Many were dropping close to the target prices that Third Avenue had been seeking. His colleagues were calling.
The consensus: it was time to buy.
Mr. Warlan started executing trades in foreign markets, pausing for a nap around 2 a.m., then waking at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets. Without stopping to sleep any more, he went to his office that morning, at the corner of Third Avenue and 41st Street, a few blocks from Grand Central Station. By close of business on Monday, he had spent $110 million to buy stocks around the world.
''It was adrenaline,'' he would later say. ''Pure adrenaline.''
4:30 a.m. Monday, Aug. 8: Pasadena
Working in California, Mr. Walsh started his day before sunrise -- to be ready for the opening bell in New York. It was the first day of United States trading after the debt downgrade.
The stock market opened down, and then grew worse. The sell-off had actually started the day before. Mideast markets had nosedived on Sunday. Futures contracts in Chicago had tumbled. As stocks and corporate bonds fell, Mr. Walsh walked over to one of his traders, a young man with a shaved head, facial scruff and the posture of a man who spends a lot of time sitting in front of a Bloomberg terminal.
They had worked up a list of companies that they suspected would suffer from a spooked market. Ford. HCA. Energy stocks. As the trader watched his screens, he saw that those companies' bond prices were trading 8 percent to 10 percent below their expected range. It didn't make any sense: Ford's finances hadn't changed over the weekend. HCA -- a large hospital chain -- hadn't stopped admitting patients. It was as if investors were dumping anything with a hint of risk, and, paradoxically, rushing to Treasuries, the very securities that S.& P. had just downgraded.
''You see opportunities?'' Mr. Walsh asked.
''Yup,'' said the trader, Walter Kilcullen. ''Stuff is being offered, and no one wants to bid.''
Western Asset had set aside $700 million for just such an opportunity. It was a one-time fire sale -- as long as their instincts were right. And no one would know for at least a month, maybe longer. ''Let's do it,'' Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Kilcullen punched a button on his keyboard, picked up the phone and started bidding on bonds that, seemingly, no one else wanted to touch.
Even as the market panicked, Western Asset wasn't selling. Mr. Walsh was convinced that the future of the American economy was as strong as it had been on Friday.
4 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 9: Broad and Wall Streets
As the closing bell sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, traders glanced at the Dow: after plunging 635 points the day before, it closed up 430 points, one of the wildest swings in recent memory. At Third Avenue and Western Asset, traders bided their time, waiting for the panic to strike again.
10 a.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Bridgeport, Conn.
On the wall of the People's United in downtown Bridgeport, the flat-screen television broadcasts CNBC. The news is that the Dow had plummeted more than 300 points in less than an hour.
Thirteen floors above, in a spare corner office overlooking the Connecticut Turnpike, John Traynor, the bank's chief investment strategist, prepared for an hourlong call with his team. A bronze sculpture of a bull and bear wrestling sat on his desk.
''There are seven participants on the call, including you,'' said the computerized operator.
Ms. McDonough, the strategist, had dialed in from Cape Cod, where she had sent her husband outside to chase around their children.
Mr. Traynor told his colleagues that by Friday he wanted a memo sent to clients detailing the bank's thoughts on the market turmoil. He peppered them with questions. Was there a risk that the other two big ratings agencies might strip the United States of its AAA status? What would prompt People's to reduce its exposure to equities? Are financial stocks a buy at these prices? Should the money managers adjust their bond allocations after the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates until mid-2013?
''We're in the preservation-of-capital business, and I don't want to make a quick trade,'' Mr. Traynor said.
Forty-five minutes into the call, Albert Brenner, a senior portfolio manager, brought up Europe. During the discussion, concerns about French and Italian banks had set off a fresh wave of selling, driving the market down 420 points.
''I'm worried about Europe, and worried about the way that the market is worried about Europe,'' Mr. Brenner said. Another portfolio manager agreed and suggested that the problems overseas were of even greater concern than the issues facing the United States.
''We've seen a flight to quality rearing its head as money has come out of weaker sovereigns and into U.S. treasuries,'' this manager said.
Mr. Traynor looked up from his notes. It wasn't just Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain that were in trouble, he said. Maybe big European banks were exposed to all that debt.
''That's a situation no financial institution wants to be in and could have serious consequences.''
Noon Wednesday, Aug. 10: Midtown Manhattan
Third Avenue spent another $110 million on Tuesday, and the pace of buying then slowed a bit. At a series of meetings, analysts had the chance to present their ''pound-your-fist ideas,'' trades so appealing that you're willing to pound the table to convince the company to buy.
In the oval conference room, Jakub Rehor, a senior research analysts, was extolling Allianz, the huge German insurer and owner of the bond giant Pimco. A handful of colleagues were ready to challenge him, mostly to test the strength of his convictions.
Deflation would be toxic for Allianz, argued Amit Wadhwaney, who leads the group. Could Europe handle deflation as stoically as the Japanese? he asked.
''It happened in Switzerland,'' Mr. Rehor answered. ''Switzerland has been living with it. Twice in the last decade.''
''But Switzerland is one country. Germany, France, Italy, Spain -- there are these divergent interest groups,'' Mr. Wadhwaney said. The European economy, bound by a currency but not much else, seemed to be fraying. Wealthy countries like Germany were beginning to chafe at demands that they bail out their poorer neighbors.
''Yes, so it's not even clear who has their hands on the steering wheel,'' Mr. Rehor said. ''This is a car with 15 steering wheels.''
Which led to another question: Will the Europeans start printing money, as an alternative to further bailouts? The consequence of that could be rampant inflation. On the other hand, it would be almost impossible for some nations to reclaim their former prosperity without turning on their printing presses.
''They probably will print the money,'' Mr. Rehor said. ''Once it looks like one of the big guys -- Italy, France, Spain -- is in trouble, they'll look at the size of the problem and say, 'We can't fix it with the bailout fund.' ''
8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Pasadena
That night, Mr. Walsh watched the news with his daughter, who had just received her first paycheck as a kindergarten teacher. Scenes of rioting in England flashed on the screen. The two had been talking about the week's financial upheavals. The United States, Mr. Walsh told her, was fundamentally secure.
But Europe was a different matter. The stability of some European banks was unclear, he worried. As much as Congress was bickering in the United States, the politics were even worse in Greece, Italy and Britain. It was hard for Mr. Walsh to get his arms around European politics, to understand who was ultimately in charge. It wasn't clear that anyone had a plan for how to react if another crisis took hold.
''Could that ever happen here?'' his daughter asked, pointing to the images of Britons setting cars on fire and looting stores.
''I don't think anything like that could happen here anytime soon,'' Mr. Walsh replied. But there were reasons for concern. Social services were likely to be cut further in many states as governments grappled with a slow recovery and declining tax revenue, he said.
''If we can't get our act together, it could come here,'' he told her. ''I worry that what we're seeing in Europe is coming to a theater near us.''
11:43 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Pasadena
As President Obama's face appeared on the giant TV screens at the front of the room, traders stood up from their desks to watch. The president was speaking at a battery company in Holland, Mich., his words intended to calm jittery investors.
His voice came from small speakers on each trader's desk. Except for the television and the cricket chirps of ringing phones, the room was quiet. Someone had installed a large smiley face along one of the rafters.
''There's nothing wrong with our country,'' the president said. ''There's something wrong with our politics.''
Walter Kilcullen, the trader who was buying up bonds for Western Asset during the fire sale, glanced at his neighbor. Mr. Kilcullen hadn't shaved that morning. He looked exhausted. He had been getting up at 3:30 a.m. every day, buying everything he could find at the right price -- deploying hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then hitting the gym to blow off steam, then staying up late at home to re-analyze his trades.
His girlfriend kept telling him to come to bed. He was too tired to explain why this was not the week to catch up on his sleep.
Back at the office, he thought to himself that he had made some good purchases. He had bought one class of bonds when they were 10 percent below normal prices, and then watched them climb 5 percent, a multimillion-dollar profit in a few days.
But it didn't matter. His overall portfolio was down for the week, battered by the downgrade. Over time, it would probably climb again. But he would end the week at a loss.
He rubbed his eyes and pointed to the president on the screen. ''At least he didn't say the bond market is oversold,'' he told his neighbor. They laughed.
''Blah blah blah blah,'' someone at the back of the room said to Mr. Obama's image.
Mr. Kilcullen switched off his speaker and turned back to his screen. There were more bonds to buy.
12:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Midtown Manhattan
With the market lurching both up and down, David Barse, the chief executive of Third Avenue, asked about conversations that one of his investment groups, called the credit and distressed team, had been having with clients concerned enough to call and check in.
''They really want to hear the inside story,'' said Tom Lapointe, a member of the team. ''Because they read the paper and everyone's drawing graphs that say: 'My God, it's just the beginning of 2008. Look at how this correlates. If that's the case don't we have 80 percent more downside?' ''
''What are you telling them?'' Mr. Barse asked.
''If risk reprices, risk reprices across the board,'' Mr. Lapointe answered. ''I can't give them the surety of knowing because I don't know. I know it's different this time, and I also tell them, 'By the way, every time someone tells me something is different this time, I always hold my wallet.' ''
3:50 p.m. Friday, Aug. 12: Midtown Manhattan
Michael Warlan, the Third Avenue trader, sat in front of a half-dozen computer monitors and watched the market drift to a quiet close -- a modest gain for the day. As the minutes ticked away, he was still shopping, having spent close to $400 million on stocks in the span of five days.
He scoured his screens one last time. Nothing. The closing bell rang through a television that was tuned to CNBC. He slapped a palm on his desk. Time to head home.
Looking back on the hundreds of trades he made this week, was he happy?
''I'm happy we had a plan in place for these very circumstances,'' he said.
And the trades themselves? ''Talk to me in 6 to 12 months.''

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IT'S been dizzying. The markets have been swinging madly up and down -- mainly down for equities, as anyone in the stock market knows too well.
How bad has it been? Despite brief rallies, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen more than 13 percent from its May peak. For four consecutive days, the index moved up or down by at least 4 percent, the first time that's happened.
In a steadily rising market, investing may be a pleasant pastime, like knitting or chess or antique-collecting. Lately, it's been a blood sport. William Butler Yeats captured the feeling nicely: 
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.
There are prosaic explanations for the gyrations that have been unmooring the financial markets. Start with the unseemly squabbling over the debt ceiling in the United States, and the inability of politicians in Washington to come to grips with the nation's growing debt load.
Then there's the parallel debt crisis in Europe, which has exposed fissures in the European Union and vulnerability among its major banks. Behind all of that is a sagging global economy -- highlighted, in the United States, by a moribund housing market and painfully high unemployment.
While these issues aren't new, the accretion of them all is like ''adding grains of sand to a mound on the beach,'' said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, the world's biggest bond manager. ''For a while, you add sand and nothing much happens,'' he said. ''Then with just a few extra grains, the structure starts to shift.''
There has been one significant change in the structure of markets recently, he said. It was partly symbolic, but still disturbing: the Standard & Poor's downgrading of the sovereign debt of the United States. Why is this so important?
It's because AAA United States Treasury bonds have been the linchpin of the global financial system, and the center of myriad calculations in business, portfolio construction and capital markets.
In this context, Mr. El-Erian said, the downgrade represents a wide perception of instability in the world's financial structure. ''We lived in a world in which 'risk free' and United States Treasuries were interchangeable terms,'' he said, ''a world in which it was assumed that the United States would safeguard its pristine AAA rating, and protect the dollar, the world's reserve currency.'' Now, for many around the planet, the world's core seems much less solid.
Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, says the true rate for a ''risk-free investment,'' which had been assumed to be the 10-year Treasury yield, now needs to be ''approximated,'' a procedure heretofore required for emerging markets. ''The distinction between developed and emerging markets has blurred,'' he said, ''and will require a fundamental rethinking.''
Eugene F. Fama, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, said S.& P.'s move was ''a nonevent in itself, because it merely reflected a view that was already well understood by the markets.'' But, he added, it reflected ''a great deal of pessimism out there, a great deal of uncertainty'' over whether Western governments would resolve their fiscal dilemmas. ''Capitalism itself is under duress,'' he said.
Mr. Fama, a leading theoretician of efficient markets, said the current volatility ''is exactly what you'd expect when efficient markets are confronted by massive uncertainty.''
Not that the Treasuries have been supplanted by another putative risk-free security. In the current crisis, Treasuries have been very much in demand. Their prices have soared, and yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. Thanks in part to a Federal Reserve pledge last week to keep rates low until at least 2013, the 10-year note fell on Friday to 2.25 percent.
Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, predicted correctly in May that the 10-year Treasury yield would dip below 2.5 percent over the summer as the economy weakened and investors sought a haven from greater distress in Europe. Now, he says, long-term government bond yields are likely to remain very low for several years, and the Fed is likely to ease monetary conditions further.
There is more risk in the global financial system, he says, but for canny investors, it has created a ''phenomenally good time to buy.'' He sees bargains in stocks as well as in municipal bonds. Over the long haul, he said, he's also bullish on gold, but added that ''its recent parabolic rise will lead to a correction, so this isn't the time to buy it.''
If the American economy doesn't lurch into recession, and if corporate earnings stay strong, then stocks are far better priced than government bonds, said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW. For a while last week, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500, a rare occurrence, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm. It also happened in the 2008-9 financial crisis, presaging the stock market bottom of March 2009.
While there will be opportunities for astute investors, Mr. El-Erian says that in addition to a ''new normal'' of slow economic growth and high unemployment, we must now also grapple with a weakening of the financial system's core. ''We will be living in a more volatile world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Growing Gloom for States and Cities: The Republican-led debt crisis will only add to budget cutbacks in capitols and city halls

 BODY:
States and cities had already endured a harrowing three-year financial slide when the debt-ceiling crisis darkened their outlooks even further. In the space of just a few weeks, the Republican-led standoff on spending and taxes brought them a triple dose of bad news: a budget deal that will probably lead to a significant reduction in federal aid; a bond downgrade that could eventually trickle down to the local and state level, making borrowing more expensive; and a stock market plunge that is bleeding state employee pension funds.
Washington should have been trying to find a way to help states avoid the layoffs and cutbacks that have contributed heavily to the high unemployment rate. Instead, it seems to be doing everything possible to make the situation worse in state capitals around the country. 
States have been cutting frantically for the last four years because of declining tax revenues, but the 2012 budget year will have the deepest cuts to education, health care and other services since the recession began. A recent report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that nearly all states will spend less on vital services in 2012 than they did in 2008, after inflation, even though there are more children in public schools and more poor people on the Medicaid rolls.
That means that 100,000 low-income people will be kept out of Medicaid in Arizona, which has frozen enrollment. New Jersey plans to cancel Medicaid coverage for 23,000 parents. Texas eliminated prekindergarten money for 100,000 children. Ohio and Pennsylvania are each cutting school aid by more than 7 percent this year, which in Ohio is equivalent to more than 14,000 teachers' salaries.
More layoffs are also likely in many states, on top of the 577,000 jobs eliminated by state and local governments since 2008. (More than a dozen states facing shortfalls have inexcusably cut taxes, or, as in New York, plan to let tax surcharges expire.)
And now comes the Budget Control Act of 2011, the deal reached in Congress to cut $2.4 trillion over the next decade in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Although the deal could have been worse and was structured by White House negotiators to reduce the impact on safety-net programs like Medicare and Medicaid, it will do real damage at the state and local level.
The act will cut $917 billion out of domestic discretionary programs, about 60 percent of which will come from nondefense spending. That will inevitably reduce transportation, education and environmental aid sent to the states.
Any kind of grand bargain to raise revenues by the ''super-committee'' that was formed by the debt ceiling deal will probably affect Medicaid, which is shared between the states and Washington. If the committee fails, an automatic trigger mechanism would cut $1.2 trillion -- not from Medicaid and the other social-insurance programs, which are protected in the deal, but from the military (whose bases are important to many state and local budgets) and from discretionary programs.
The credit downgrade that resulted from the debt crisis has yet to directly affect state and city bonds, many of which are now absurdly rated higher than Treasury bonds, but credit scrutiny will only get stricter for already weakened states and cities.
If investors start to get nervous about the public sector, borrowing costs could go up. Stock volatility is also taking a toll on state pension funds, which are often heavily invested in the market. Last Monday, when the Dow Jones fell by more than 600 points, the California retirement system lost $6 billion. Declines in the market also lower income tax revenues for state coffers.
The Republicans who produced this artificial crisis, and are responsible for its effects, say they would like nothing more than to see a reduction in state as well as federal spending. That is where government hits closest to home, affecting the size of classrooms, the bulbs in streetlights, the asphalt in potholes, and the lines in emergency rooms.
They are well on their way to achieving their goal, making life more difficult in every city and town.

HEADLINE: Inside The Greek Volcano

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
GOVERNMENT debt has been top of mind this summer. As Congress and the White House played a dangerous game of political brinkmanship over the federal debt ceiling, and, last week, as Washington tried to digest a lowering of the nation's credit rating, we could better understand that America's fiscal indebtedness had broad consequences for the global economy as well as our own.
It was against this backdrop that I read ''Greece's 'Odious' Debt: The Looting of the Hellenic Republic by the Euro, the Political Elite and the Investment Community'' (Anthem Press, $29.95) by Jason Manolopoulos. 
The author, who is also a founder of an emerging-market hedge fund, sets out to analyze the Greek fiscal crisis and its larger reverberations. ''Not a single constituency emerges well from this story,'' he writes. ''Greek politicians, Greek society, trade unions, leaders of the European Union, the I.M.F., the world's investment banks -- each and every one has scarcely put a foot right in a collective display of hubris, miscalculation, overambition, deception, mis-selling, folly and, in some cases, sheer greed in a saga that has continued for decades.''
If this sounds overly alarmist or polemical, think again: Mr. Manolopoulos backs up his analysis with cool, detached facts. He focuses on Greece's largely unreformed economy, which is characterized by widespread corruption, business structures run by elites, low levels of investment in new technologies and industry clusters, and dependence on just a few sectors -- like tourism, shipping and agriculture.
The book argues that forms of corruption have played a pivotal role in the development of Greece's inefficient, uncompetitive economy. In particular, the author blames ''clientelism'' -- ''interest groups within society requesting favors from politicians as clients, often with little regard to a reciprocal contribution to the economy.''
For example, he says, a bloated public sector has led to lifetime positions that can become bargaining chips for politicians and constituents. This has led to pay raises without links to productivity, to a collective sense of entitlement and to huge pension obligations. It is small wonder that Greece's 2010 austerity measures, aimed at retirement reform, produced so much unrest.
In a book rife with supporting data, the most memorable statistics are those related to corruption, both in and outside government, as well as to Greece's retirement provisions. Consider that before last year's reforms, the official retirement age in Greece was 58, versus an average of 63.2 in other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the average Greek pension paid almost 96 percent of average annual lifetime earnings; versus 61 percent in other O.E.C.D. nations.
Huge pension liabilities, along with tax evasion, an expanding government, large military expenditures, growing trade deficits, an $11 billion price for the 2004 Olympics, and an anemic real economy -- combined to increase Greece's indebtedness, the book argues.
In 1990, government debt amounted to 71 percent of Greek gross domestic product; by 2009, the figure was 115 percent. Until 2007, the availability of global credit, along with misplaced global confidence in the economy's soundness, helped stoke the fires of the debt. These factors also helped Greece put off meaningful economic and fiscal changes aimed at producing ''the sustainable kind of growth that is built on business development, rather than 'growth' that turns out to be a debt-fueled consumer binge.''
How could governing elites in Athens, Brussels and New York have gotten the fundamentals of Greece's situation so wrong for so long? The answers help us understand both the Greek disaster and the broader 2008 financial crisis.
For one, political and business actors relied on inadequate measurements, Mr. Manolopoulos writes. Most obvious was the importance placed on G.D.P. as an indicator of national well-being. G.D.P. gauges a country's economic activity, not its wealth. Borrowing to consume perishables that don't raise the level of productive assets, he notes, raises G.D.P. in the short run and creates an illusion of positive economic performance.
A second and more chilling explanation of why elites proved so incompetent at governing the Greek economy -- as well as the larger, global one -- is related to what Mr. Manolopoulos calls the ''Washington consensus,'' a faith in deregulation, free trade, mobile capital flows and fiscal responsibility that he considers elitist.
Two elements of this consensus -- market deregulation and the liberalization of capital flows -- helped create enormous pools of global credit, making it ''easier for short-termist governments to abandon the principle of fiscal responsibility,'' since spending not financed through tax hikes could be financed by foreign loans, he says.
Last but not least, all this free-flowing capital has prompted bubbles -- in housing, finance and other areas -- that add volatility to national economies and impose harsh costs, particularly on the poor and middle classes.
This is a brave, complicated and timely book. It would have been even stronger with more attention to how Greece, the United States and the larger global economy could now start avoiding the mistakes made over the last 20 years.
I turned the last page struck by two questions, both of which flow from the book's wide-ranging analysis: Where are the leaders who will make brave decisions, based on their citizens' long-term interest? And who among us will light the way to changing our own behavior -- changes that will help us reset our economies and move ahead with a collective purpose? In this summer of fiscal volatility and political gamesmanship, we can't find answers soon enough.

RETROMANIA
Pop Culture's Addiction to Its Own Past
By Simon Reynolds
458 pp. Faber & Faber. Paper, $18.
Five years ago, a young Scottish woman named Sandi Thom reached No. 1 on the British charts with her song ''I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair).'' She delivered it with a voice of pleading and with a cappella sincerity, as if she were trying to sell you something. Perhaps that was why I found it irritating; or else it was the suggestion that punk rockers would break bread with someone who had flowers in her hair. Thanks to Simon Reynolds's ''Retromania,'' I now understand that she ''purposefully conflated 1967 and 1977 to speak to the vague nostalgia felt by many young people for a lost golden age when music had power and integrity.'' 
The thing is, Simon Reynolds was a punk rocker. At least, when he was a British teenager, his earliest serious love in pop was for postpunk. His favorite artists were, in Ezra Pound's phrase, making it new. Now he is an unassailable pop scholar. ''Retromania'' laments how unoriginal pop is today: how it feeds on its own history, trades in references and has started reworking material from a past that is ever more immediate. So doesn't he find Sandi Thom's song irksome? Not so much. He is oddly indulgent or, given how mordant he is elsewhere, he at least praises it with faint damnation as ''just a pretty ditty.''
The very vagueness of Thom's nostalgia is what lets her off the hook. Reynolds's special concern is for those who are stuck in the past, and can't let it go. He piles up examples of those clingy types -- the museum curators, the tribute bands, the bloggers who share their MP3 archives, the iPod fetishists who derive a sense of their own identity from the range of tracks they've stored -- and wishes that they could move on.
Still, what makes this book so wise is its author's awareness of his own complicity in nostalgia. He even holds out hope that there is a tasteful way of displaying pop's past without it all blurring into what the polemical journalist Julie Burchill dismissed as ''rock's rich tapestry'' -- something that weaves all pop, however rebellious, into a cozy backdrop to our lives. So he pauses to admire the Sex Pistols' failure to cooperate with the heritage industry, and their rowdy refusal to be inducted into any Hall of Fame. He's half right: Johnny Rotten has appeared on British reality television shows, and advertises butter.
It's not so much the selling-/out that saddens Reynolds. Rather, it's our ready acceptance that the past is our only future: that after postmodernism, with its weary, overinformed view that there is nothing new to say, comes something called ''superhybridity.'' Superhybridity, a concept borrowed from an art magazine, exists because the Internet can bring whatever we want into our hard drives, so that we can sample it or mash it up: no culture, from any time or place, can be remote from us. Or, as Sandi Thom puts it, we no longer live in an age when ''computers were still scary and we didn't know everything.''
So do we know everything now? Reynolds makes excellent fun both of those who know lots of things superficially and of the specialists. The generalists can cram their bandwidth with MP3 files that were rare until moments ago, and load them onto their iPods in order to listen to each track for just a few seconds. The specialists, on the other hand, need to record music on the same equipment that their idols used, showing the same impulse that seems to lie behind the period-/performance movement of classical music. An aside from Reynolds reveals how messed up the whole situation is. Ciccone Youth produced a range of covers on ''The Whitey Album,'' including ''a cover of John Cage retitled '(silence)' (a sped-up version of his '4' 33'',' i.e., a couple of minutes of silence).''
Sherrie Levine, whom Reynolds calls an ''appropriation artist,'' argues that this kind of borrowing and reworking takes us back to culture as it was before the Renaissance: ''You strove to be fully mature in your tradition. Originality was not an issue.'' Reynolds's own experience of postpunk leads him to disagree (even though he is so forensic on the influences of punk that he manages to make this, too, seem traditional). The music ''drastically amped up the belief in constant change.'' Afterward he fell in love with the rave scene of the 1980s, which ''served as a booster shot for me, reconfirming the modernist credo: art should constantly push forward into new territory.''
He writes ''should'' and not ''must,'' and for a moment he makes ''Retromania'' read like an advice book rather than a manifesto demanding action. But he does demand change, not least for pragmatic reasons. If artists keep recycling recently produced art, they'll soon be recycling the recycled bits. (Kanye West is a notable offender.) Then there are economic and even moral reasons to make progress. ''The world economy was brought down by derivatives and bad debt,'' he writes; ''music has been depleted of meaning through derivativeness and indebtedness.''
That's an epigram as a rock journalist would deliver it. Like the best of Reynolds's writing, it's elegant and urgent. Sometimes, he almost seems to be parodying rock journalism itself. Here he is, describing T-Rex's sound: ''rock 'n' roll and 12-bar boogie filtered through flower power: John Lee Hooker meets Gandalf's Garden, Chuck Berry overripe and fruity fit to split.'' In any other context, this name-/dropping prose would seem part of the problem. Here, though, it suggests not so much Reynolds's knowledge as his knowingness. Whether or not he likes the music, his love of describing it is palpable. The search is still on for music Reynolds can describe without allusion to other music. But here, as throughout, the quest is as fruitful for us as it is frustrating for him.

HEADLINE: Starved Budgets Inspire New Look At Web Gambling

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
The District of Columbia is not thrilled that its residents are traveling to Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia to gamble in casinos. Starved for cash, like states across the country, the district wants some of the millions in revenue that gambling generates each year.
So district officials want residents to gamble closer to home -- inside their homes, actually. Or in cafes, restaurants and bars. By year's end the district hopes to introduce an Internet gambling hub that would allow Washington residents to play blackjack, poker and other casino-style games.
''They can do it from Starbucks, a restaurant, bar or hotel, or from a private residence,'' said Buddy Roogow, executive director of the D.C. Lottery, who expects the new games to eventually raise $9 million a year. ''That's real money in D.C.''
It's an idea gaining currency around the country: virtual gambling as part of the antidote to local budget woes. The District of Columbia is the first to legalize it, while Iowa is studying it, and bills are pending in places like California and Massachusetts. 
But the states may run into trouble with the Justice Department, which has been cracking down on all forms of Internet gambling. And their efforts have given rise to critics who say legalized online gambling will promote addictive wagering and lead to personal debt troubles.
The states say they will put safeguards in place to deal with the potential social ills. And they say they need the money from online play, which will supplement the taxes they already receive from gambling at horse tracks, poker houses and brick-and-mortar casinos.
''States had looked at this haphazardly and not very energetically until the Great Recession hit, but now they're desperate for money,'' said I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School, where he specializes in gambling issues.
When it comes to taxing gambling, he said, ''the thing they have left is the Internet.''
Federal efforts over the last year to legalize online gambling have failed, so the moves by the District of Columbia and the states have put them into a murky legal arena with a potentially big obstacle. The Justice Department in recent years has vigorously pursued operators of offshore Internet casinos, shutting down their sites and arresting their executives when they travel to the United States.
The agency's position has been that these operations violate federal laws including the Wire Act of 1961, which prohibits wagering over telecommunications systems that cross state or national borders.
The move by states to allow online wagering prompted two United States senators last month to ask the Justice Department to quash those efforts, too. In their letter, Senators Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said that about a dozen states were considering such efforts.
''In many cases, Internet gambling advocates in those states cite the silence of the Department of Justice in the face of these efforts as acquiescence,'' the letter says. ''We respectfully request that you reiterate the Department's longstanding position that federal law prohibits gambling over the Internet, including intrastate gambling (e.g. lotteries).''
Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment beyond saying that the department was considering the senators' letter.
In the past, federal prosecutors have sent letters to a handful of states telling them that federal law prohibits ''all forms'' of online gambling. And in 2006, Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act, which prohibits businesses from taking the proceeds of illegal bets placed over the Internet.
But legal experts say the law sent a mixed message to the states. It seems to carve out an explicit exception for states to run online gambling operations. But in the bill's legislative history, it says it is not meant to amend existing law on the subject, which can be taken to mean that the Wire Act prohibitions still apply, said Mark Hichar, a lawyer who specializes in gambling law at Edwards, Angell, Palmer & Dodge in Boston.
''The legislative history is a real head-scratcher,'' Mr. Hichar said.
Arthur Terzakis, staff director of the Committee on Governmental Organization, a legislative policy committee in the California State Senate, said the 2006 law ''gives states the right to do this.''
Two California state senators late last year introduced bills to allow Internet gambling inside the state, estimating that such a move could raise roughly $1.4 billion to $2 billion over 10 years. One bill legalizes only online poker, while the other allows an array of games of chance and skill. The bills are still pending. California and other states say they will require proof of residency or use technological means to screen out nonresidents.
Some states, including New York and North Dakota, already sell lottery subscriptions online. Since 2005, New York has offered a subscription service that allows people in the state to enter a string of Lotto or Mega Millions drawings. The state says 100,000 people subscribe.
New York is exploring whether to allow people to draw from an escrow account when they decide to buy into a single drawing -- say, when the jackpot reaches alluring levels.
The lack of a challenge against existing online lotteries from the Justice Department has given hope to other states that they will have clear legal sailing. But Mr. Hichar, the gambling lawyer, said the existing efforts may just ''have flown below the radar.''
Illinois, which passed a law two years ago allowing it to put its lottery online, asked the Justice Department about its plan but has not heard one way or another, suggesting it can move ahead, said John Cullerton, president of the State Senate.
He said Illinois had budgeted to gain some $200 million in additional revenue from moving the lottery online and allowing people to buy into it who ''don't want to wait in line at a 7-Eleven.''
''We'll be selling to new players, not the same old players,'' he said. ''That means more roads and bridges.''
Officials in other states sympathize with the logic.
''We need money,'' said Matt Fitzgerald, legislative director for Michael Rush, a Massachusetts state senator, who last month introduced a bill to allow the state lottery to test an expansion into other ''games of chance,'' but not poker.
It's not all about revenue. In Iowa, which is running a budget surplus, lawmakers say they want to legalize online poker to create a regulated forum for a popular activity.
''A number of Iowans are doing it and may not even realize it's illegal,'' said Jeff Danielson, a Democrat and the president pro tempore of the State Senate. ''We want a regulated environment that's safe and protects consumers.''
Earlier this year, a bill to make New Jersey the first state to legalize online gambling passed the Legislature, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed it.
Some critics say the state efforts will make gambling too accessible.
''It's the equivalent of opening a lottery retailer in every home, office and dorm room in America,'' said Les Bernal, executive director of the Stop Predatory Gambling Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group.
''It's a business model built on addiction and indebtedness,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sara Riese, Michael O'Sullivan

BYLINE: By PAULA SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Sara Beth Riese and Michael Brendan O'Sullivan were married Saturday afternoon in Santa Rosa, Calif. The Rev. James K. Knutsen, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of the Incarnation, with the Rev. Fergal McGuinness, a Roman Catholic priest, assisting. 
The bride, 30, is a program officer at University Research, a nonprofit organization in Bethesda, Md., that implements health care programs for disadvantaged people worldwide; her responsibilities include training and providing rural health care workers in Benin, West Africa. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and has two master's degrees from Columbia, one in public health and the other in international affairs. She is the daughter of Dorothy M. Colman-Riese and Randy C. Coleman-Riese of Santa Rosa, Calif.
The bridegroom, 32, works at the World Bank in Washington, where he analyzes agriculture and land projects in Africa that potentially aid women. He graduated cum laude from George Washington and also has a master's in international affairs from Columbia. He is a son of Kathleen O'Sullivan and Michael C. O'Sullivan of West Chester, Pa.
Ms. Riese met Mr. O'Sullivan in 2002, when she arrived for a Peace Corps assignment in Burkina Faso, West Africa, where Mr. O'Sullivan was already working. Ms. Riese, however, was posted to a village at the other end of the country, so the two crossed paths only a few times.
They reconnected during graduate school at Columbia in 2005, when Ms. Riese discovered that he was among a group of other former Peace Corps volunteers starting classes there. ''I could sense there was some chemistry with Sara,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. But both were reluctant to introduce romance into the equation and disrupt the balance of their close-knit group.
Their feelings for each other picked up steam the next fall semester. ''Sara and I started to blush when we saw each other,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said, ''and I knew something was happening but wasn't quite sure what it was.'' But when he confessed his feelings for her, Ms. Riese, who described herself as a ''logical person,'' was shocked. His departure the next day for a two-week research trip in Senegal offered her time to mull it over. The e-mail from her he had been waiting for arrived the day he was to return to New York.
''I wrote in the subject line, '' 'a cost benefit analysis,' because that was what we were studying in graduate school,'' Ms. Riese said, laughing. ''I had weighed my options in terms of risking my really valuable friendship with him, and I had decided pursuing our relationship was worth it.'' PAULA SCHWARTZ

HEADLINE: 'I Yield My Time to the Gentleman From Stratford-Upon-Avon'

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER. 
Bill Keller is executive editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Eleven summers ago I was sent to a management program at the Wharton School to be prepped for bigger things. Along with lectures on finance and entrepreneurship and the like, the program included a delightfully incongruous session with Al Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on poetry.
For three hours he talked us through ''The Red Wheelbarrow'' and ''Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.'' The experience -- especially when contrasted with the appalling prose of our other assigned reading -- sent me fleeing to the campus bookstore, where I resumed a long-interrupted romance with meter and rhyme. I started with college-era familiars (Larkin, Yeats, Dickinson, Cummings) and then, over the years, picked through the writers serendipity brought my way. A review got me started on Elizabeth Bishop. Friends gave me Frederick Seidel and Seamus Heaney. A publisher introduced me to Kay Ryan's witty morsels. I stumbled on Brad Leithauser and the Scottish poet Don Paterson in bookshops. I carry my favorites as subway companions. 
I prefer craft to spontaneity, accessible to esoteric, and poems that engage both head and heart, but that's just me. I'm no literary critic, let alone a poet (excluding the birthday doggerel I compose for my very tolerant older daughter each year). I read for pleasure, not for self-improvement. Yet I've come to understand better why poetry belongs in, say, a Wharton program for midcareer corporate executives.
Professor Filreis says that he is ''a little shocked'' at how intensely his Wharton students respond to this unexpected detour from the businesslike, not just as a respite but as a kind of stimulus. Many write afterward asking him to recommend books of poetry. Especially now.
''The dire economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think 'out of the box' in the way poetry encourages,'' he told me.
Which brings me to Congress, an institution stuck deeper inside the box than just about any other these days. You have probably heard that up on Capitol Hill, they're very big on prayer breakfasts, where members gather over scrambled eggs and ask God for wisdom. You can judge from the agonizing debt spectacle we've watched this summer how well that's working. Well, maybe it's time to add some poetry readings to the agenda.
Pause here while I acknowledge the rolling of eyes. My own editor allowed, when I told him what I wanted to propose, that the idea raised ''a tiny, very, very small red flag,'' presumably about my need for a little vacation. Poetry? Congress? Really?
Really. Seriously. I mean, sure, I might prefer corporal punishment, or taking away their parking places. But a little time out from the bloodless discourse of the chamber and those lobbyist arm twists and hive-mind caucuses so that they can enjoy a little food for the imagination -- could it hurt?
I'm not suggesting that poetry will guide our legislators to wisdom any more than prayer has. Just that it might make them a little more human. Neither am I proposing that lawmakers pay more attention to the music of their oratory. Mario Cuomo's well-worn dictum, that politicians should campaign in poetry but govern in prose, still holds true; the problem is that Washington is hardly governing at all.
Poetry is no substitute for courage or competence, but properly applied, it is a challenge to self-certainty, which we currently have in excess. Poetry serves as a spur to creative thinking, a rebuke to dogma and habit, an antidote to the current fashion for pledge signing.
''In poetry there are no absolute pledges prior to understanding what's being said,'' Filreis says. ''If you go to a poem with a prior commitment, you'll get neither edification nor pleasure from it. Poetry is open.'' It is, moreover, an invitation to consider the inner lives and circumstances of others -- for instance, the 14 million despairing jobless so marginalized in the latest political pageantry.
The poet Shelley, in a rather highfalutin defense of poetry nearly two centuries ago, wrote, ''A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.'' Shelley concludes that essay by calling poets ''the unacknowledged legislators of the world,'' because they bring imagination to the realm of ''reasoners and mechanists.'' ''Mechanist'' is an old-fashioned word that translates roughly as ''Grover Norquist.''
The relevance of poetry was declared more succinctly in five lines from the love poem ''Asphodel, That Greeny Flower,'' by William Carlos Williams:
&nbspIt is difficult to get the news from poems &nbspyet men die miserably every day &nbspfor lack of what is found there.
I asked David Orr, the poetry columnist for the Book Review, to prescribe some poems that might, if closely read and considered, be of value to our ossified Congress. Given that Orr titled his provocative new guide to modern poetry ''Beautiful and Pointless,'' I wondered if he would be up for harnessing poetry to such a utilitarian assignment. But he said that while he hesitates to say that people ''should read poetry,'' which makes it sound like flossing or taking a vitamin supplement, he has no problem saying that certain specific people might benefit from reading certain specific poems. As an antidote to the smug feedback loop that constitutes our current politics, he offered poetry that encourages ''hesitation, doubt and ambiguity.''
''If our representatives have spent the last few months huffily asserting, our poets have spent the past century hesitantly questioning -- and the latter approach seems far more useful to the country at the moment,'' he said in an e-mail.
You'll find several poems Orr offered as apt to our political paralysis at The 6th Floor Blog, but here is one that seems too perfect not to quote in full. Besides, how often does a columnist get Philip Larkin to write his kicker?
Since the majority of me Rejects the majority of you, Debating ends forthwith, and we Divide. And sure of what to do
We disinfect new blocks of days For our majorities to rent With unshared friends and unwalked ways, But silence too is eloquent:
A silence of minorities That, unopposed at last, return Each night with canceled promises They want renewed. They never learn.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Drug War, Feminized

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Katie Orlinsky contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Damien Cave is a New York Times correspondent who covers Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
WITH a sweet, awkward smile, Nancy Lilia Nunez offered up the main details of her life: she is a mother of three, having given birth to a daughter just seven months ago, and she is serving a 25-year sentence for helping to kidnap a 15-year-old girl. We were sitting at El Cereso -- the Ciudad Juarez prison -- a drab, hulking complex of brick and steel. Ms. Nunez wore tight jeans and eye makeup, as if heading to the mall.
At one moment, she declared with simply stated conviction that she had no idea the 15-year-old girl was being held for ransom in the house where Ms. Nunez was arrested. The next, she seemed to be holding back information about the friends she was arrested with. Ms. Nunez is only 22. She grew up here, in one of the world's most crime-infested cities. But was she just hanging out with the wrong crowd, or is she a criminal deserving decades behind bars? 
With her case and others, this is what Mexico is struggling to figure out. The number of women incarcerated for federal crimes has grown by 400 percent since 2007, pushing the total female prison population past 10,000.
No one here seems to know what to make of the spike. Clearly, the rise can partly be attributed to the long reach of drug cartels, which have expanded into organized crime, and drawn in nearly everyone they can, including women.
Detained lieutenants for cartels have told the police that some act as lookouts. Other women work as drug mules, killers, or as ''la gancha'' (the hook), using their beauty to attract male kidnapping victims. At least one woman, Sandra Avila Beltran, became a major cartel leader, before her arrest in 2007 for trafficking and money laundering.
Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. More women are working in every aspect of the economy, ''including drug trafficking,'' said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an assistant professor of government at the University of Texas, Brownsville. Yet, because Mexico's justice system is so opaque, incompetent and corrupt, it is nearly impossible to know which prisoners deserve their punishment. Human rights lawyers say this is especially true for women, who are often unwittingly used by men they love. Several women at the prison, for example, said they only realized after their arrests that the cars they were caught driving had been packed full of drugs by boyfriends or brothers.
And in a society as traditional as Mexico's -- where women are responsible for virtue and order, as Octavio Paz once wrote -- mere involvement in crime is enough to cause outrage and fascination. Mexicans (and Hispanic telenovela viewers in the United States) simply cannot get enough of feminized crime. One of the most popular novels in Mexico today is ''Queen of the South,'' which follows a Mexican woman who becomes the most powerful drug trafficker in southern Spain. When Telemundo made it a telenovela this year, it became a ratings bonanza on both sides of the border.
Many of the women at El Cereso have received similar notoriety. Eunice Ramirez, 19, is the most famous. She was arrested last November for luring men into places where they could be kidnapped, and immediately photos from her Facebook page appeared nationwide, mostly showing her in a bikini.
American border patrol agents say that they have also been catching more attractive teenagers in short skirts with drugs taped to their inner thighs.
The result, here at least, is a female prison population both gang-connected and perfume-scented. Most of the 160 women here at El Cereso -- one of several prisons with women a few walls apart from male inmates -- are between 18 and 26. At least a third are still awaiting trial, most are charged with drug possession or trafficking, and daily life in their shared cells looks almost juvenile. Ms. Nunez's walls feature a poster of Disney princesses; others are decorated with heart stickers.
This is nonetheless a dangerous place. Guards separate the women, as they do the men, by gang affiliation. Conflicts are common. ''Every day,'' said Ms. Nunez, her neck full of bruises, ''there is at least one fight.'' Or worse -- a week after our visit, 17 inmates, including one woman, were killed in what the authorities described as a series of gang executions with automatic rifles smuggled into the complex.
It only highlighted the wide gap between the sexy myth of feminized crime, as portrayed on the Web and in telenovelas, and the more complex reality. Ms. Ramirez in particular fails to live up to her sensational billing. In person, she is painfully shy, speaking with a heavy lisp, barely above a whisper. When we met, she was busy with her visiting 2-year-old daughter, who had her mother's onyx eyes, and a face severely scarred by burns sustained when arsonists burned down the family's house after Ms. Ramirez's arrest.
Some of the women here say they turned to crime to make money to meet their children's needs. Other mothers, maintaining their innocence, say they are racked with guilt for being forced to abandon their families. Ms. Nunez, who arrived here three months pregnant, said her biggest regret was ever becoming friends with the group involved in the kidnapping. Although several in the group, men and women, are also inmates at El Cereso, she said: ''We never talk. I have no one.''
Indeed, above all else, the women seem to feel lonely and misunderstood. Karla Solorio, 26, serving time for a drug conviction, said that she often cried at night thinking of her 7-year-old son.
''I'm just a reject,'' she said, dabbing at her eyes to avoid ruining her makeup. ''I'm not someone who works. I'm not someone with a family. I'm just a prisoner.''
Correction: August 21, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Aug. 14 with a news analysis article, about women imprisoned in Mexico as a consequence of that country's drug wars, misstated the age of one of the women, Karla Solorio, who was convicted of drug and weapons trafficking. As the article correctly noted, she is 26, not 27.

HEADLINE: Sharp Cut In Program For Needy

BYLINE: By JESSE HIRSCH. 
hirsch.jesse@gmail.com

 BODY:
For nearly 30 years, a federal initiative has helped ensure that the Bay Area's needy have sustenance and a roof over their heads, if only for a night. 
But this summer, local social service agencies got a nasty surprise. In late July, the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program announced that the Bay Area would lose $1.5 million in financing. The region has been allocated $1.9 million, down from last year's $3.4 million.
Three of the seven Bay Area counties -- San Francisco, Marin and Napa -- will receive no money at all. Marin and Napa had not initially qualified in 2010 but later received nearly $70,000 from a pool of money that program officials set aside for counties that did not meet standards for the regular allocation.
San Francisco will lose out on $592,000 it had gotten from the program last year, the most drastic of the Bay Area cuts. The national board decided that the program would finance only areas with unemployment and poverty rates at least two points above the national average, instead of just at or above the average.
The director of safety net programs at the local United Way chapter, Laura Escobar, who is responsible for distributing the money to the counties, said she planned to argue that San Francisco should get a share of this year's set-aside money, which is only $250,000 for the entire state.
Local organizations were not told of the cut until after the 2011 fiscal year started in July. The budget gridlock in Washington delayed Congressional allocations for the program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, until April from January.
When the dust cleared, the program's financing had been chopped by 40 percent.
Program administrators then spent months deciding how to distribute the remaining money nationally. The San Francisco Food Bank had already cut $1.6 million from its operating budget of $14.5 million for the current fiscal year, said Sean Brooks, director of programs. It received $161,000 from the federal initiative last year. ''We made grants and allocations based on federal funds we receive every year,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''To get cut off is patently unfair.''
He said the food bank would probably cut back on buying more expensive proteins like meat and eggs.
Smaller agencies may fare worse. Ms. Escobar said that last year, each of 11 emergency shelters in San Francisco received $24,000 to $35,000 from the program. ''For the smaller shelters that count on this money each year, losing it will make a huge difference,'' she said.
Food banks are also coping with a surge in demand. Each week, 30,000 households in San Francisco and Marin County use the SF Food Bank directly or indirectly, Mr. Brooks said, which amounts to 70 percent more people than when the recession began in 2008.
''After 28 years, during a time when our lines are longer, and people are in the most need of the help we provide, it just doesn't make sense to cut off our funding,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On the Hudson, Not Everyone Sees Williamsburg

 BODY:
Many readers had strong reactions to last week's Metropolitan cover article by Peter Applebome, ''Williamsburg on the Hudson.'' The article ran online with a different headline, ''Hipsters on the Hudson,'' and for many commenters that word was a lightning rod. Additionally, they took issue with the comparisons drawn between various Hudson Valley towns and New York City neighborhoods. Readers also responded to Robin Finn's article about urban garden theft, ''Pilfered Peppers in City Gardens; Tomatoes, Too.'' Below, excerpts from the comments on both stories, drawn from NYTimes.com.
For what it's worth, I would argue that Rhinebeck is the Upper West Side, and Millbrook is the Upper East Side. John C.,
Rhinebeck, N.Y. 
No, Rhinebeck is definitely the Upper East Side. Newburgh is Hell's Kitchen. Newburgh has more potential than the others, but way too many social problems. However, if you want an old brownstone or brick overlooking the Hudson, you'll never find a better window of scenery cheaper. R.,
Upstate
The only thing West Village-y about Woodstock is the cost of living here. A,
New York
Oy vey! Only ethnocentric New Yorkers would, with straight faces, write, read and comment on this article. I am particularly tickled by ''No, Rhinebeck is the Upper East Side.'' I live in Bethel, CT. It's definitely the East 63rd Street and Third Avenue of Connecticut.
Susan Josephs,
Bethel, Conn.
I still see the rampant poverty in towns like Beacon, Poughkeepsie and Hudson, in particular. What happens to those people with this gentrification? Where do they go? Those were the ''affordable'' parts of Dutchess County, but with the Williamsburg-ization of those towns, soon there won't be any place that is affordable around here anymore. Kate,
New York
I honestly have never understood the hatred for ''hipsters.'' So some people pay more attention to fashion and culture than you do. There are always ephemeral trends that some people (not all) enjoy chasing and enjoying. It doesn't make them worthy of your hatred; in fact, I think it makes them more interesting in many cases. Plus, they are bringing money into depressed areas. ml,
New York
I don't think it's so much ''hatred for hipsters.'' Mild contempt and disdain, yes. It's based on their lack of authentic self. Always chasing the next ''hip'' thing, and adopting whatever the ''hip'' blog or lifestyle magazine or maven instructs them to make themselves into today. It won't be long before the towns they are gentrifying now will be ''so five minutes ago.'' One is reminded of Marie Antoinette and her court at Versailles, playing dress-up as faux shepherds and shepherdesses. ACW,
New Jersey
It's fun to take potshots at ''hipsters'' and arrivistes, and one can always find a couple of people who fit those labels. But most don't. The problem is that the one jerk driving badly in a Mercedes or a 20-something in oversize sunglasses and an orange jumper toting a Platinum card sticks in the mind more than the majority who blend in. Sam Pratt,
Hudson, N.Y.
Can't blame the hipsters for fleeing N.Y.C. or getting off of Long Island. But I'm pretty darn sure that all of the art galleries and organic food shops are not going to replace an IBM plant ... like the one that's not there any longer and never will be again ... and the locals will be glad to tell you so. TFL,
Frog Island, N.Y.
A big problem with this article is the faulty assumption of what ''Brooklynization'' means. If Brooklyn to you is the gentrified, theme-park neighborhoods that took flight in the last decade, well that's O.K. A more appropriate term of what's going on in Beacon might be ''gentrification.'' Clefnote,
Brooklyn
I note with trepidation that there is one sleepy Dutch-settled country town (my own) that remains unspoiled by ''hipsters'' (whatever those are). It does have a struggling commercial drag with hip restaurants and bars, big countrified houses, an annual artist studio tour and lots of ethnic diversity, along with amazingly easy transportation to Manhattan. Some parts remain economically depressed, but the old-timers and newcomers over all get along pretty well. House prices are very high, but taxes are relatively low. This paradise lies somewhat southeast of the Hudson, and we call it Flatbush. Brenda Becker,
Brooklyn
O, Gentle Readers! Do not be fooled: it is not hip here. There are a few trendy cafes; their names change regularly as their owners go bust and new, brightly optimistic, owners come in. There are no good jobs. And once you leave your cozy Park Slope or Williamsburg apartment, you will never be able to return. The market rises in N.Y.C., but stagnates up here; if you sell your three-bedroom home in the Hudson Valley, you'll have enough to buy a studio in Bensonhurst. So you will be an expat. Surprisingly, it will also cost more to live here, because you will need to have a car (or two, if you are a couple, because you have to drive everywhere), and your taxes will be high. When we moved our family to Ulster County in 2002, real estate ads touted ''hip, happening Rosendale,'' which was pretty darn funny for a town that is basically a single street about a half-mile long. But it's not funny to see the empty storefronts that line the street these days, as one by one, the hopeful visionaries from Brooklyn and elsewhere discovered there is no economic base here, and fled. Beware, O Reader! The only truth in this article is that it is very, very nice to wake up to the sound of birds. Susan,
New York
On Rotten Thievery
My mother grew up in the height of the Great Depression. She and her siblings would pick up rotting apples from the ground just so they would have something to eat. The farmer, when he saw it, came out with a belt to hit the kids for stealing rotten apples! Perhaps the folks who stole the produce were just hungry, victims of a bad economy. I know that stealing is not right, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see this happen even more as the economy worsens. GC,
Central New Jersey
My husband and I gave one another fruit trees for Easter this year, a peach and a Macoun apple. Though we didn't expect much this first year, the peach tree had about two dozen small, ripening (but not yet quite ripe) peaches on it a couple of weeks ago. They have all vanished. They were very neatly picked by a two-legged thief. No, I didn't file a police report, but I was sure tempted as the tree is hardly visible from the street. Someone actually had to get up our driveway to help themselves, and that's the creepiest part for me. The trespassing. Patty B.,
New Jersey
There are some countries where they have fruit trees and a small box where you can pay for the fruit that you take, on an honor system. It is absolutely unmanned. Just think if this system were in place in New York City: not only would all the fruit be gone in the fastest time, but the money and the box would most likely be stolen as well. Andrei,
New York
Why don't they hire the thieves to be guards and pay them in produce?

RULES OF CIVILITY
By Amor Towles
335 pp. Viking. $26.95.
The saying ''May you live in interesting times'' has undeniable resonance for the investment executive-turned-/novelist Amor Towles. In 1989, he was set to go to China for two years to teach. When the Tiananmen Square massacre put an abrupt end to that plan, he headed for Manhattan. On his first night in the city, he met two strangers. One would become his brother-in-law; through the other, he found the job in which he has worked for 20 years. What would have happened if he'd hit town a day later? This is the kind of improbable-but-true serendipity that plots the lives of people in their 20s -- in whatever epoch -- before they know the weight that decisions made in a moment might have. 
In Towles's first novel, ''Rules of Civility,'' his clever heroine, who grew up in Brooklyn as ''Katya,'' restyles herself in 1930s Manhattan as the more clubbable ''Katey,'' aspiring to all-American inclusion. As World War II gears up, raising the economy from bust to boom, Katey's wit and charm lift her from a secretarial pool at a law firm to a high-profile assistant's perch at a flashy new Conde Nast magazine. One night at the novel's outset touches off the chain reaction that will produce both Katey's career and her husband, and define her entire adult life. She's swept into the satin-and-cashmere embrace of the smart set -- blithe young people with names like Dicky and Bitsy and Bucky and Wallace -- with their Oyster Bay mansions, their Adirondack camps, their cocktails at the St. Regis and all the fog of Fishers Island.
The city does not necessarily allow Katey to forget herself. When she pops into a newsstand at Astor Place to buy The Times, a boy from the old neighborhood recognizes her as he tries to cadge a smoke. ''Hey. I know you, right?'' he asks. ''I don't think so,'' she replies, noticing that he has ''the same presumptuous smile and the wandering eye'' that he'd had when they were 14. ''That's the problem with being born in New York,'' the paper seller remarks, after the scrounger saunters off. ''You've got no New York to run away to.''
Except, as Towles so persuasively shows, New Yorkers do have another New York to run away to: the New York of their past. For Katey, who in 1966 is moved to recall hers, this bygone metropolis is the New York of 1938, the most consequential year of her youth. Her memories reanimate that era, awakening in the reader the tingling recognition that her history and the city's remain familiar, latent, even recurrent, with would-be Kateys lurking in office cubicles to this day.
With this snappy period piece, Towles resurrects the cinematic black-and-white Manhattan of the golden age of screwball comedy, gal-pal camaraderie and romantic mischief (think of ''Stage Door,''''Made for Each Other,''''My Man Godfrey'' and even Fay Wray in ''King Kong''). With Katey, we travel by cab and watch Broadway ''slipping by the windows like a string of lights being pulled off a Christmas tree,'' or see limousines idling in front of the 21 Club, smoke spiraling from their tailpipes ''like genies from a bottle.'' These pages prompt recollections of movie scenes stamped so deeply on the psyche that they feel remembered: elevated trains, Carole Lombard and Jimmy Stewart, smoky jazz clubs and men in fedoras. To call such images cliched would be to call youth cliched, to call Manhattan itself a cliche. As in the 1937 Lombard film ''Nothing Sacred'' -- which opens with a mighty montage of towering buildings super/imposed with the words ''This is New York, Skyscraper Champion of the World . . . where the Slickers and Know-It-Alls peddle gold bricks to each other . . . and where Truth, crushed to earth, rises again more phony than a glass eye'' -- an ironic attitude can do little to diminish the power of the city's mythology. And if, as you watch or read such archetypal stories, the thought does arise that nothing (and nobody) is quite as it seems, what remains, as Gershwin wrote, '' 's marvelous.''
Katey rooms in a women's boardinghouse with a strong-willed girl from the Midwest named Eve, who's determined to live in New York without her daddy's financial support. On New Year's Eve in 1937, Katey and Eve head for a Village jazz club with three dollars between them, intending to scrape by on one martini an hour and to peel off to a Ukrainian diner as 1938 dawns, for a 15-cent breakfast of coffee, eggs and toast. Enter a handsome man, ''an upright 5-foot-10, dressed in black tie,'' with brown hair, ''royal blue eyes'' and a cashmere coat so elegant Eve can't take her eyes off it. She instinctively introduces herself as ''Evelyn'' to sound a little grander. The man's name is Tinker (''How the WASPs loved to nickname their children after the workaday trades,'' Katey notes, admiring him all the same). He stands them to drinks, gallantly venturing into the cold night to find Champagne and returning with a bottle hoisted aloft by its neck, ''grinning like a truant holding a fish by the tail.''
Not long after midnight, Tinker disappears, leaving behind a solid gold engraved lighter, like a male Cinderella with a Zippo instead of a slipper. Will one of the roommates add his initials to her monogram? Tracking him down shouldn't be hard; he's let slip that he lives in the Beresford, a luxury building on Central Park West. But once they find him, will he turn out to be a prince? If he is, why does he have a heavily underlined copy of George Washington's notes on proper social behavior (the ''Rules of Civility'' of the title)? Wouldn't such niceties come naturally to a prince? Towles's central characters are youthful Americans in tricky times, trying to create authentic lives, even if quasi-pseudonymously. ''In New York City,'' he writes, ''these sorts of alterations come free of charge.''
The novel follows Katey through 1938 as her friends and circumstances shift, and as social masks rise, fall and rise again. In Manhattan, she recognizes, a long memory is not always convenient. And from the beginning, the reader knows that after this eventful year, Katey will not see Tinker for nearly three decades -- until she happens upon his image at the Museum of Modern Art while strolling with her husband through an exhibition of Walker Evans photographs of subway riders, taken between 1938 and 1941. She spots Tinker in one of them, ''ill shaven, in a threadbare coat.'' When she points out the photograph to her husband, identifying Tinker as an acquaintance, he furrows his brow and says, ''Riches to rags.'' But Katey remarks, ''Not exactly.'' Yes, she thinks, ''Tinker looked poor in that picture. . . . But he looked young and vibrant too; and strangely alive.''
Evans had snapped Tinker the year he quit trying to scale Manhattan's invisible mountain and took work on the docks. Standing on Pier 80, smoking, leaning against a piling and admiring ''the whole staggered assembly of town houses and warehouses and skyscrapers stretching from Washington Heights to the Battery,'' Tinker had thought that ''from this vantage point Manhattan was simply so improbable, so wonderful, so obviously full of promise -- that you wanted to approach it for the rest of your life without ever quite arriving.'' As Towles shows, that can be arranged. In a way, that can hardly be avoided.

HEADLINE: A Rocking Chair Called Manhattan

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
BACK in the 1940s and '50s, Isabel Morton used to stride onto the stages of hotels in the Catskills, wearing shimmering beaded gowns and belting out Gershwin classics like ''The Man I Love.'' The gowns were made by her husband, Irving, who worked in the garment industry.
''And I had a great figure,'' Mrs. Morton said proudly. ''I still do.''
Mrs. Morton is now 92. She has lived for 35 years in a rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment on East End Avenue for which she pays $1,200 a month. Her husband of 53 years and her only child have died. She has had four heart attacks and has neuropathy, a neurological disease, although as she said cheerfully, ''Nobody ever died from numb feet.'' She is largely homebound; only when an aide pushes her in a wheelchair can she go to Carl Schurz Park. 
And so she is cheered by visits from the teenage girls dispatched weekly by Dorot, an organization that provides services designed to help the city's elderly stay in their own homes for as long as possible.
''I teach the girls points of interest, like how to conduct themselves, and in turn they keep me company,'' Mrs. Morton said. ''I always like an audience.''
According to the most recent census figures, Mrs. Morton is one of 460,000 New York City residents age 75 and over, a group that makes up 5.6 percent of the city's population. Nearly 100,000 of them live in Manhattan, where they account for 6.2 percent of the population. Moreover, their numbers are poised to explode. Starting in January, when the first of the baby boom generation began turning 65, a boomer has reached that milestone every eight seconds.
The lingering effects of the recession and the increasing appeal of the city have combined to persuade many older New Yorkers to stay put, avoiding the financial, psychological and logistical costs of uprooting themselves.
''We tend to think of Manhattan as a city largely of the young and middle-aged, but that's not strictly accurate,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College. ''When it comes to old folks, New York is full of them. Their presence undercuts the notion that everyone goes to Florida.''
Of the 10 census tracts in Manhattan with the greatest percentage of residents 75 and older (upward of 9 percent), 6 lie east or west of Central Park. From the white-brick buildings on the East Side to the stately prewars of the West Side, both areas are rich in apartment houses with elevators, doormen and a profusion of neighbors, all prized by this population. Single women, who make up the majority, appreciate the generally safe streets.
Like Mrs. Morton, some Manhattanites have been ensconced for decades in rent-stabilized apartments or in co-ops now worth many times the original purchase price. Their numbers are swollen by suburbanites eager to exchange driving and mowing the lawn for big-city attractions ranging from museums to unusual restaurants.
Growing numbers of older New Yorkers live in housing specifically tailored for their needs, or are helped by programs like Dorot that provide everything from home-delivered meals to volunteers who escort people to doctor visits. An increasingly age-friendly mass transit system, along with discounts for items ranging from subway rides to movies, can help older New Yorkers get around, manage on fixed incomes and fill their days pleasurably. The wealth of hospitals and social service agencies provide support in times of need. Even at a time of widespread budget cuts, Manhattan does relatively well in this respect.
And especially in Manhattan, with its rich cultural offerings, retirees can easily keep busy, active and stimulated. The concentration of apartment buildings can facilitate providing services like visiting nurses. All these things can help older people stay in their own homes, a goal that has broad public benefits.
Of course, the very sick or frail may be daunted even by the most sophisticated buses or the most welcoming museums. People from all income groups fall through the safety net, unserved by the programs intended to reach them. But for the relatively healthy and mobile, and those with some resources, Manhattan's offerings are considerable.
Here are ways some of the borough's older residents have made places for themselves.
Harold and Phyllis VanderMalle, both in their early 80s, and their friends Sally Praver, 79, and her husband, Paul, 86, live in Penn South, a middle-income co-op in the heart of Chelsea. They can often be found in the complex's popular senior center, a space that suggests a well-equipped playroom for adults. Shelves containing thousands of donated books line the walls, and origami birds made by residents flutter from the ceiling above a huge flat-screen TV.
Penn South, which turns 50 next year, is what is known as a NORC -- the initials stand for ''naturally occurring retirement community.'' Its 2,820 apartments are home to 5,000 people, of whom 22 percent are over 75. More than half the households include a resident over 60.
Thanks to large dollops of public and private money, the co-op offers a wide range of services intended to ease and enhance life for its aging population.
The VanderMalles, who have been married since 1956 and have one son, were among the original tenants. They live in a two-bedroom apartment, for which they paid $3,250. The Pravers, who have two sons, arrived in 2003 from Queens after 21 years on the waiting list. They have a one-bedroom apartment that cost $15,000.
''I didn't think I'd be alive by the time my name came up,'' Ms. Praver said.
They are among the many who partake enthusiastically of the services offered at Penn South, not just the library, which the VanderMalles run, but also the twice-monthly pizza and film evenings and the classes in activities ranging from yoga to indoor gardening.
And the center is just one of many offerings available at Penn South to address the needs of its older residents. On-site nurses measure blood pressure. On-site social workers help residents get access to Meals on Wheels and home health care.
When Mr. VanderMalle broke his pelvis, a walker appeared as if by magic. Nearby supermarkets have been encouraged to offer discounts to older customers. The landscaped grounds function like a college campus. ''Outside, I greet I don't know how many people,'' Ms. VanderMalle said. ''I never knew older people were so much fun.''
Penn South is one of more than 40 NORCs in New York -- 16 of them in Manhattan -- that receive combinations of city and state money. And in the opinion of many who deal with the elderly, NORCs are the wave of the future.
''This is clearly the way to go,'' said Elaine Rosen, the social worker who runs the programs for the elderly at Penn South. ''The real issue is the ability to stay in your home and not be isolated, not to be bored or lonely or scared.'' Another benefit is that the population includes younger people who can provide an informal support system for their older neighbors.
It's no surprise that the Penn South waiting list, now closed, contains 6,000 names.
Elaine Habib and Jo Marchese, widows who describe themselves as ''over 75,'' have lived for about a decade in the Hamilton House on West 73rd Street. A handsome building with a crystal chandelier in its double-height lobby, the Hamilton House is one of three nonprofit residences operated by Project FIND, one of the city's most established organizations for the elderly. Rents are controlled and social services provided. To live in one of the 173 apartments, a person must be at least 62 and have an income that falls below a certain level (currently $45,850 for an individual and $52,400 for a couple). The waiting list is long.
Ms. Habib and Ms. Marchese each have one-bedroom apartments, pleasantly crowded with furnishings and memorabilia, for which they pay about $400 a month. The balance of the $940 rent is covered by a federally funded rental subsidy program called Section 8.
They realize that without a place like the Hamilton House, they could not afford to live in such a pricey part of the city. They're appreciative of the in-house social workers, the lively activities at the senior center next door and the rich cultural offerings in the area.
''There are so many pluses,'' said Ms. Marchese, who used to work in customer service. ''You're independent. You're in a beautiful neighborhood. You feel connected. What's not to like?''
Ms. Habib, a former legal secretary, agreed. ''Originally I was skeptical,'' she said. ''I didn't want to live with all these old people. But now I'm one of them, and it doesn't bother me at all.''
Eleanor Kremen, an 84-year-old former social worker who is divorced and has no children, lived for years in a one-bedroom apartment on West 96th Street. But her training made her conclude that as she aged, she might not be able to live alone. ''I foresaw the future,'' Mrs. Kremen said. ''I realized I might need someone in another room.''
Twenty years ago she moved to a two-bedroom apartment in her building for which she pays $1,000 a month. The decision proved wise. Today she has Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease. Her arms and legs are thin as a child's, and she can get around only in a wheelchair. Round-the-clock aides sleep in her bedroom, while she finds it more comfortable to sleep on the living room couch, near the old upright piano that she still plays.
And through the home-sharing program run by the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens, Ms. Kremen also has a roommate, Amy Ronek, a 37-year-old communications director from Iowa. Ms. Ronek, who has her own bedroom, shares the kitchen and bathroom and contributes to household expenses. She also provides companionship, or as she puts it, ''I'm the entertainment.''
The home-sharing service, a sort of Match.com for the elderly, is free. Pairs are formed via a questionnaire that touches on everything from smoking to overnight guests. To date, the foundation has matched up more than 2,000 people.
For Ms. Ronek, the benefits are many. She had had roommates previously and enjoyed having another person around. Because she has her own room, she has privacy. And the arrangement allows her to live in a neighborhood like the Upper West Side, which she might not be able to afford otherwise.
For Ms. Kremen, also, the benefits are both financial and social.
''It's very nice having someone in the house,'' she said. ''And Amy is a very special person. She's more cheerful than me. She's more cheerful than most people.''
Despite the number of services for the elderly, most Manhattan residents over 75 manage on their own, often in places they have lived for decades.
Brigitta Ortner, who is 83 and who emigrated from Germany with her family in January 1939, has lived since 1952 in a fourth-floor walk-up on West 95th Street, where her monthly rent is about $1,000. Years ago, when her stepmother first saw the apartment, she described it as a dollhouse. Despite the climb, Ms. Ortner, who used to work at Saks Fifth Avenue, has no intention of leaving. ''I guess I'm too lazy to move,'' she said.
Ms. Ortner walks a great deal, sometimes three to six miles a day. ''The wonderful thing about New York,'' she said, ''is that you can walk everywhere -- to the grocery store, the movies, Lincoln Center, in the parks.''
Her energy may be one reason she can manage all those stairs. And as an inveterate walker, she is especially enamored of the benches recently installed on her block where she can stop and chat with friends.
The benches were provided through the efforts of Gale A. Brewer, the local councilwoman. Her district, which covers a large swath of the Upper West Side, is home to nearly 50,000 older people. Partly for this reason, Ms. Brewer has been a prime mover behind the Age-Friendly New York Initiative, an effort sponsored by the New York Academy of Medicine, the City Council and the mayor's office to institute modest changes that taken as a whole are meant to improve life for the city's graying population.
Earlier this year Ms. Brewer's office produced the Age-Friendly West Side Grocery Guide, analyzing 23 grocery stores in terms of amenities like handicapped-access restrooms, seating, senior discounts and meat in single-portion packages. Her wish list is long and includes goals like making parks more user-friendly (more restrooms, fewer stairs); making streets easier to navigate (fewer potholes, slower traffic signals); fine-tuning public transportation (adding bus shelters, repairing subway elevators); improving the Access-a-Ride program, which provides transportation for disabled people; and finding better ways to alert the elderly to the city's many free or discounted cultural events.
For older New Yorkers who have no intention of forsaking the city they love, despite obstacles that can sometimes be formidable, such changes can't come soon enough. ''Someday I may have to retire to California, where my niece wants to take care of me,'' Ms. Ortner said. ''Till then, I'm staying in New York.''

HEADLINE: Working at Making The Most of Your Vacation

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
THE workplace can be stressful -- even more so in a difficult economy. Thank goodness employees can relax fully during their vacations.
Well, maybe not.
Assuming that they get a paid vacation -- far from a given in the United States -- employees may be reluctant to take time off because of towering workloads and fears that their jobs are vulnerable. If they do arrange for time off, there is the stress of getting work done in advance or delegating duties to co-workers.
Once a vacation starts, it can be exciting, refreshing and relaxing. But not always: it can also be profoundly destabilizing, with the lack of a predictable routine causing anxiety. And there is the heightened possibility of losing things, whether luggage, hotel reservations, cabin pressure, directions or respect for a travel companion. 
Then, after time off, employees face a flood of pent-up e-mails and demands -- unless they were obsessively responding to them during the vacation, thereby wiping out the restorative value it may have had.
These days, because of technology, it's very hard to disengage completely from the office during a vacation, says Daniel H. Pink, the author of ''Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,'' who answered questions about vacations while he was on a recent vacation.
The border between what is work and what is personal is more porous than ever, and that cuts both ways, Mr. Pink says. So while people may have to answer an e-mail from their boss on a Sunday, he notes, they may also order shoes online or make an orthodontist appointment for their child while at work.
Whereas the transition from working to going on vacation used be like an on-off switch, it's now more of a dimmer switch, Mr. Pink says, and people need to adjust it in a way that works for them. For example, during his vacation, he tends to check e-mail only a few times a day.
Barbara Adachi, a principal in Deloitte Consulting's human capital practice, started creating a stricter separation between vacation and work when she was in Patagonia on vacation several years ago. Her BlackBerry didn't get reception there, she said, ''and I had no choice but not to check it -- it was very freeing.''
Now she doesn't check e-mail at all during vacations, and if there is an urgent situation, people can contact her assistant, who knows how to reach her.
In the belief that vacations ultimately make employees more productive, Deloitte Consulting keeps a ''watch list'' of people who are billing a lot of hours and haven't taken time off in a while, Ms. Adachi says. The company also keeps track of when people on the same project are planning to take time off, to ensure that ''somebody's got your back when you're out,'' she says.
Cross-training and planning are crucial to ensuring that people take all their vacation time, thereby improving their health and happiness, says John de Graaf, executive director Take Back Your Time, an organization that promotes work/life balance. In European Union countries, where a minimum of four weeks of paid vacation is mandated, companies take this training much more seriously, he says.
Mr. de Graaf's plea to have the United States require companies to provide time for vacation has fallen on deaf Congressional ears. Such a law would be a tough sell. Is it any coincidence, after all, that the United States is among the most productive nations in the world and that American workers take just about the least amount of vacation?
It's true that American businesses are highly productive, Mr. de Graaf says, and that can be linked in part to the fact that Americans work more hours.
But companies need to be aware that not taking time off exacts a price in the form of employee burnout, poor physical and mental health and high turnover, he adds.
Also, vacations just plain make people happier, right?
Interestingly, a recent study out of the Netherlands, though confirming that vacations do heighten happiness, found that the greatest benefit occurred before the vacation -- in short, anticipation appears to trump reality.
In recognition of this, people may want to consider taking more trips of shorter duration, Jeroen Nawijn, the lead author of the study, told The New York Times last year.
''If you have a two-week holiday, you can split it up and have two one-week holidays,'' he said. ''You could try to increase the anticipation effect by talking about it more and maybe discussing it online.''
So perhaps bosses should be understanding if they happen to see their employees sneaking a look at Kayak.com or Tripadvisor.com while sitting at their desks.

HEADLINE: Conventional Fed Wisdom, Defied

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
NEWS last week that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates near zero until mid-2013 was welcomed by many investors, but the bleak message about the economy still came through loud and clear.
The Fed has spent several years trying to kick-start the economy with low rates and other policies, with little success. Which raises this question: Will more of the same help now?
Among the doubters is Thomas M. Hoenig, the soon-to-be former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Mr. Hoenig, at the helm of the Kansas City Fed for the last 20 years, has thought long and seriously about the problems facing the central bank, and he spoke with me about them last week after attending his final meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. He will turn 65 next month, the mandatory retirement age for a Fed bank president. 
Mr. Hoenig has been pretty much alone among Fed presidents in publicly calling to break up large banks that are too big to succeed.
''Extremely powerful institutions, both financially and politically, undermine the long-term strength of our system and make us look like a financial oligarchy,'' he told me. This view, of course, receives little applause in Washington and on Wall Street.
Mr. Hoenig has espoused this view for more than a decade, and he has grown accustomed to being ignored or criticized for it. Back in 1996, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he presciently warned about the dangers of expanding the federal safety net to cover financial institutions trading complex derivatives and structured finance vehicles.
Pushing for a new regulatory regime that would deny a safety net to institutions engaged in risky activities, he told the attendees: ''The threat of failure keeps a bank honest and inhibits it and the industry from trending toward excessive risks. Without this market discipline provided by creditors willing to withdraw their funds when they suspect a bank of being unsafe, banks have an incentive to take excessive risks.''
Mr. Hoenig's prescription was to bar institutions that engage in risky business from offering government-backed deposits and to minimize their access to emergency Fed loans. Although he has been vindicated in this view, big bankers howled and regulators yawned at the time.
''I was trying to point out that these kinds of activities are beyond management's control,'' he recalled, ''and that if you want to do this, you cannot have the taxpayers subsidizing it.''
He added: ''It was controversial. It was not well received by some.''
In 1999, as Congress was finally doing in the Glass-Steagall rules that had separated investment banking from old-fashioned commercial banking, Mr. Hoenig made another public warning about big, interconnected financial companies. ''In a world dominated by megafinancial institutions, governments could be reluctant to close those that become troubled for fear of systemic effects on the financial system,'' he told an audience at the European Banking and Financial Forum in Prague. ''To the extent these institutions become 'too big to fail,' and where uninsured depositors and other creditors are protected by implicit government guarantees, the consequences can be quite serious.''
We sure found that out.
More recently, in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, Mr. Hoenig has continued to counter the conventional wisdom in Washington. ''The Dodd-Frank legislation, for all its 2,300 pages, does not fix the fundamental problem of too-big-to-fail banks,'' Mr. Hoenig said last week. ''I think the post-Depression response was the answer -- you break them up. If you are going to have access to the safety net, you are going to limit your activities.''
Last year, when he was a voting member of the open market committee, Mr. Hoenig dissented on monetary policy decisions at every meeting. Because he is no longer a voting member of that committee, his current views on the Fed's most recent policy decision were not reflected in the dissents registered last week by three other regional Fed bank presidents, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, Narayan Kocherlakota of Minneapolis and Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia.
''My objections have been based on the fact that the central bank has to think about what its policies mean for the long term,'' Mr. Hoenig said. ''We as a nation have consumed more than we produced now for well over a decade. Having very low rates for an extended period of time encourages us to continue focusing on consumption, but to correct our imbalances, we have to focus on production.''
Creating jobs and finding ways to keep American businesses from fleeing abroad is not exactly the domain of the Fed, Mr. Hoenig conceded. But neither should the Fed's actions work against the goals of generating a more productive economy, he said.
''The central bank has to be, in a way, a neutral player, and yet we find ourselves trying to stimulate, and the effect is further leveraging,'' he said. ''If I thought zero rates would bring jobs, I'd want it forever. But it distorts the economy.''
He continued, ''In 2003, when we lowered rates and kept them there because unemployment was 6.5 percent -- look at the consequences.'' Those consequences included the nation's mortgage feast, followed by its current economic famine.
Another important theme for Mr. Hoenig concerns the mistrust that has arisen as regulators provide favors to powerful institutions while asking other industries, and ordinary Americans, to accept less.
Ask farmers to accept fewer federal subsidies, or the housing industry to live without the mortgage tax deduction, or ordinary Americans to contemplate changes to Social Security, and they all push back, he says.
And many of these people say the same thing: ''Why should I compromise when the largest institutions get bailed out and continue to get their bonuses?'' he says.
POINT taken. If there were a sense that everyone, big and small, powerful and weak, would be asked to sacrifice, we might be able to agree on a way forward for the economy, Mr. Hoenig said.
''We have to bring a greater sense of equitable treatment,'' he said. ''When we do that Americans will say, 'Yes, we are all in this together.' ''
Mr. Hoenig does not yet know what he will do after leaving the Fed, but he aims to stay in public service. Let's hope he lands in a job where some of his ideas can be put into action.

HEADLINE: Loving Groupon But Dating Others

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING. 
dgreising@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
David Greising writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
When Groupon Inc. first filed papers for its initial stock offering in June, the company floated the novel idea that investors should ignore its steep marketing costs when figuring its financial results. Quite deservedly, Chicago's tech darling drew nothing but scorn.
Then last week, when Groupon tried to undo the damage by abandoning its attempted accounting gambit, the discontent doubled down. Analysts from New York to Silicon Valley raised questions about whether the I.P.O. would move forward, and a growing legion of skeptics wondered anew about Groupon's long-term prospects. 
Of course, controversies about initial stock offerings are common. But here in Chicago, Groupon is a special case. The hype and hope surrounding the company are such that Chicagoans are riveted to the saga.
The city's boosters argue that Groupon's importance is overstated. And, to an extent, they have a point. Chicago's nascent high-tech ecosystem shows signs that it could carry on regardless of what happens with Groupon. Over the last decade, some 45 companies have raised $100 million in initial stock offerings: Orbitz, NAVTEQ, Fieldglass, Archipelago. University-based start-up investors -- the five-year-old Hyde Park Angels, which is connected to the University of Chicago, and the recently formed Wildcat Angels with ties to Northwestern University alumni have begun to spring up. Built in Chicago, a networking group led by the serial entrepreneur Matt Moog had more than 100 Chicago tech C.E.O.s at a lunch last week.
A Chicago-based incubator, Excelerate Labs, shows promise with a unique approach to nurturing start-ups. And Lightbank, a $100 million venture fund that backed Groupon and is run by its co-founders, Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, is among several funds focusing on Chicago. Computer programmers are in demand; tech salaries are rising.
Amid the stirring, Groupon has emerged with an implied promise that it can lead Chicago to a higher level. Groupon may operate from the old Montgomery Ward & Company headquarters downtown, but from the perspective of Chicagoans, the company lives in a glass house. People watch, and they care.
Perhaps it was the display of courage in turning down Google's $6 billion buyout offer late last year. Perhaps it is the fact that Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky, at a remarkably young age, have broken into the inner circle of Chicago's hidebound business community. Or maybe it's the simple fact that Groupon's deal-of-the-day business is so simple and far-reaching that it touches people on their iPhones and computers every day.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Gov. Pat Quinn clamor to get close to Groupon. The staid conclaves of the City Club and Economic Club lend an ear to the company's founders. Legions of college graduates live secure in the belief that if all else fails, they can always become copywriters at Groupon. And 2,000 Groupon employees in three buildings downtown say they may be right.
That is why, when Groupon gets too cute with its publicity stunts, tone-deaf with an advertising campaign, thin-skinned with public relations and -- especially -- too creative with financial reporting, people in Chicago notice. And that is why, when investors start speculating that Groupon's I.P.O. may not go forward as planned, Chicagoans shudder.
This is a city often burned by ill-founded hopes for a high-tech future. So when Groupon grew up a bit last week, with the refiling of its I.P.O., it was an occasion for people who dream of Chicago as a tech center to sigh with relief.
The company's critics saw the revised filing as an admission of weakness, but a contrary -- and valid -- view is that it is a signal of promise. The company backtracked on the ill-considered financial metrics that rightly attracted scorn. It got more specific and sober in acknowledging the competitive challenges it faces.
This more serious approach, together with the recent hiring of a new chief operating officer from Google, are signs that Groupon is girding for battles ahead.
There are those who say Chicago's development as a tech center is secure, with or without a boffo future for Groupon.
''Any time you have a tent pole success, it's a good thing, and Groupon has been one,'' said Michael Sacks, the new vice chairman of World Business Chicago and a board member of The Chicago News Cooperative.
''But the entrepreneurial community, the tech community that Groupon is part of, is not dependent solely on Groupon,'' Mr. Sacks said. ''Chicago is a growing success. Period. End of story. Nothing will change that.''
Perhaps true. But Chicago's tech ecosystem has a far better chance with Groupon as its standard bearer than with no clear leader showing the way.

HEADLINE: Borderlands

 BODY:
Andrew Rice did a wonderful job in ''Life on the Line'' describing the misunderstood binational bubble that is El Paso, Tex., and Juarez, Mexico. His picture is incomplete, however. Virtually every one of the sources he quoted was someone who had more than enough money to pay for an investor's visa or take other measures to flee the violence in Mexico and remake their lives on the U.S. side with very little disturbance to their family life. But what about the hundreds of thousands of poor Juarenses who escape with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and horrible stories haunting them? It's not so easy. There are no visas to keep them safe, no work permits, and the U.S. government is reluctant to give them asylum, granting less than 2 percent of petitions from Mexican nationals.
LOUIE GILOT, Executive Director, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, El Paso, Tex. 
I am perplexed by the title of the cover story, which refers to the border between El Paso and Juarez as ''the end of America.'' It is an insult to Americans who live south of the United States to write that North America has claimed the title of America for itself while disregarding the rest of the continent. There are five continents, and America (which consists of North, South, Central America and Mexico) is one of them. We are all Americans.
ROCIO MATALLANA, Millstone, N.J.
The article about anchor babies born in El Paso reminded me of a conversation with the sister administrator of a Catholic hospital in El Paso around 1980. She asked me how to reduce the number of babies born in the hospital emergency-room parking lot. I pointed to the lighted cross on the hospital roof and suggested she turn off the spotlight. She said that would lessen her ability to serve the poor. I would guess she's still in the anchor-baby business.
JOHN BATTAGLIA, Southport, N.C.
I have worked at the Casa de Nacimiento. We've had clients give birth while they mourned the murder of husbands, brothers and best friends. They are here trying to give birth to hope for their babies. Much of the reactionary response attempts to dehumanize the people of Mexico and these women. I see them as mothers who are working to provide their children with the best chance for ''life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' which we profess to believe is an inalienable right.
TRPLR, Calif., July 28, 6:16 p.m.
It is interesting to note how the culpability of the United States is often a side argument in news reports concerning the drug violence in Mexico. Let's not fool ourselves: the U.S. appetite for drugs and the multibillion-dollar gun industry are providing fuel for this war. The chief organizations responsible for the violence are the sociopathic cartels themselves and the corrupt Mexican government. If the United States were concerned with the human toll and not just its business interests, the El Paso-Juarez dichotomy (which is really the U.S.-Mexico dichotomy) would not be pathetically reduced to ''symbiotic and parasitic.''
DAVE O., Boston, July 31, 5:59 p.m.
Excellent article. The most telling quote was ''no one outside'' really understands. I wish Andrew Rice had had the gumption, however, to spend more time in Juarez. Yes, it's dangerous, but odds are slim that anything bad would actually have happened. (I have friends who work in Juarez and travel across the border every day.) In contrast to the drug-cartel violence that (deservedly) makes up much of the news, Rice would have come to understand that Juarez is also, astonishingly, growing and prospering in some areas. Over the last decade, economic and educational opportunities have expanded vastly in Mexico -- a fact largely unnoticed by many in the United States. As this trend continues and the Mexican government devises realistic ways to reduce corruption and confront drug cartels, Mexico's prosperity will surprise all but the most observant north of the border.
I am no Pollyanna. The current situation in much of northern Mexico is unbelievable (imagine the reaction and response if 3,000 people were murdered, in one year, in any given U.S. city). I believe, from firsthand experience, that this crisis will somehow be resolved. And the ensuing century in Mexico will be entirely different.
ESTEBAN, Denver, July 29, 2:40 p.m.

HEADLINE: Eagles' Spree Was Years in the Making

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
BETHLEHEM, Pa.
When DeSean Jackson rolled into the Philadelphia Eagles' training camp on Monday with his agent and his holdout in tow, it provided a brief reminder that even a team that has seized the N.F.L. marketplace by the throat this summer must occasionally deal with the mundane realities of insufficient contracts and unhappy players.
But Jackson is also a stark example of why the Eagles' free-agent shopping spree, which netted top-line players like cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha and defensive lineman Jason Babin, and stunned the Giants by signing receiver Steve Smith last Wednesday, is unlike ones most others (read: the Washington Redskins) have periodically engaged in with disastrous results.
Jackson and quarterback Michael Vick are the only 2 of the Eagles' 22 projected starters who are not under contract for next season, said the team president, Joe Banner, and Vick has said talks are under way to extend his contract. Banner estimated that 26 of the 28 players who are likely to get the most playing time in 2011, including kickers and punters, are under contract at least through 2012, and some of them beyond that. 
Last year, the Eagles captivated fans with young, explosive offensive talent. Now they have injected some of the best veteran defensive help available. Banner cringed at the suggestion that the Eagles' mind-set might best be described as ''all in.''
'' 'All in' to me implies a short window, and that's the only thing I object to,'' Banner said in a recent interview. ''Because we are going to do everything we can to win the Super Bowl, that's accurate. But all in implies right now, bust if it doesn't happen. We have structured this so it will be sustainable, and that's a big difference between what we've done and what we've seen others do.''
The structuring, it turns out, began not long after N.F.L. owners decided in the spring of 2008 to opt out of the collective bargaining agreement. The Eagles examined the rules that would be put in place and realized the 2011 free-agency period, if it happened at all, would present an extraordinary buyer's market.
Because players who would usually have been unrestricted free agents in 2010 were tied up instead, two free-agent classes would be rolled into one, at the same time as teams would again have to work within a salary cap after having none in 2010 -- meaning some teams would not be buyers because they were close to the cap number.
So began the meticulous preparation for what finally came to fruition in the last two weeks. In contracts they made late in 2008 and 2009 -- including those for Asante Samuel and Jason Peters -- the Eagles purposely made the 2011 cap numbers the lowest of the contracts, which is unusual because most contracts have their lowest cap numbers early in the deal.
''You'll have twice as many players available as usual, and we're either locked out or there is a reduced cap,'' Banner said. ''You don't have to be a brilliant person to figure out there's going to be huge opportunity. You can't have increased supply and reduced dollars and not have it. We didn't know the names, but we did it to take advantage of what was clearly going to be a very team-friendly marketplace. There was a strategic element to this. There was luck as well. Frankly, it turned out better than we hoped.''
The Eagles had planning meetings throughout the lockout, the final one in June, when it became clear there would probably not be a spending minimum this season, most likely further eliminating a few more teams from competition. They set up ''strike zones'' for each player they sought -- a range of money they would be willing to pay. When the player fell into their zone, the Eagles wanted to be able to move quickly to secure him.
Jeffrey Lurie, the team's owner, abhors having dead money -- dollars that count against the salary cap even after a player is gone from the team -- because it has an effect on the opportunity to compete in later years. So the Eagles had to avoid the usual vexing element of other free-agency sprees: exceeding the salary cap, forcing teams to figure out how to make it work later. That created an uncertainty on the biggest prize of all.
''I really anticipated not being able to get Nnamdi,'' Lurie said. ''I knew we were poised if the economics worked out, but I thought there would probably be a team or two that would make him their sole acquisition and be in the stratosphere that wasn't best for our football team.''
Some players the Eagles wanted they did not get, but even they seem stunned by their success. Banner said he would have been happy with adding cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (and a second-round draft pick) in the Kevin Kolb trade, then getting Babin.
''When the Nnamdi thing happened, I was like, 'Oh, my God, wow, this is unbelievable,' '' Banner said.
The signings came so rapidly that when quarterback Vince Young was brought in as Vick's backup and running back Ronnie Brown signed, they were relegated to afterthoughts in the Eagles' incredible makeover. Banner received text messages from people around the league wondering how he had any money left.
The danger is that so many headline-makers will not mesh with so little time to prepare. Banner has unreserved confidence that Coach Andy Reid can make it work, because he thinks Reid's strongest suit is managing players, expectations and egos.
Banner pointed to 2002, when quarterback Donovan McNabb broke his foot late in the season and Reid never blinked when he received the news in the training room, even though A. J. Feeley and Koy Detmer were then his quarterbacks. Banner said Reid never allowed the thought that the injury might derail the Eagles. The Eagles went 5-1 to end the regular season before McNabb returned for the playoffs.
Although the Eagles are rarely portrayed this way, Lurie and Banner think of themselves as risk-takers, pointing to, among other things, their acquisition of Vick last season. (Smith, who is coming off microfracture knee surgery and might not be ready to practice for weeks, also fits the profile.) They know they have taken another big risk this year -- risk with balance, Lurie calls it.
He has a taste for the theatric. In February, a film he produced, ''Inside Job,'' won the Academy Award for best documentary. That film was in part about the way risky behavior in the financial services industry led to the economic meltdown.
Lurie compares what the Eagles have accomplished so far to producing the movie. It was fun and exciting, but the Eagles have not yet won anything. After nearly three years of planning, though, almost everything has fallen into place for them.
Perhaps their meltdown is still to come. But even as the first rush of signings has ended and the team-building has begun, the good fortune continued. After all, by Monday afternoon, DeSean Jackson was back to practice, too.

HEADLINE: The Age Of Outrage

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
Paris
AUGUST was once a time for dreaming, wandering the empty streets of this city, reading silly-season newspaper stories after a leisurely lunch washed down with Sancerre, gazing at squares where fountains plashed and the pregnant or the old chatted on benches at dusk. Then something happened.
The world speeded up. Stress levels soared. Idle moments evaporated. Egos expanded. Devices became hand-held. Money outpaced politics. Rage surged. As Leonard Cohen put it: ''The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows.'' 
Except that everybody is at a loss. When David Cameron rushes back from Tuscany (a k a Chiantishire) to riot-ravaged London, and Nicolas Sarkozy hustles home from the Riviera to a Paris debt crisis, and the summer vacation void vanishes in Europe (once so long the Germans coined a word for ''free-time angst''), all bets are off.
August aborted this year. It morphed into the serious season. The beach lost out to the barricades. A time of outrage is upon us.
The fury in British cities follows huge social protests this year in Greece, where violence also flared, and in Spain, where tens of thousands have camped out from Madrid to Barcelona. Other nations, including Portugal, have seen a diffuse anger rooted in a shared conviction: things can't go on like this. This European malaise is no stranger to a United States of high unemployment, economic bafflement, ideological radicalization and political pettiness.
Numbers tell part of the story. Youth unemployment in the 27-nation European Union stands at just over 20 percent, ranging as high as 45.7 percent in Spain. In Britain youth unemployment has risen from 14 percent in the first quarter of 2008 to 20 percent. About one in every five young Europeans and young Americans is wondering how to get any sort of working life on track. Britain's NEETS (not in education, employment or training) meet U.S. boomerang kids in the anxiety of waiting.
The anxiety grows when governments are slashing benefits and pushing back retirement ages in an attempt to deal with spiraling deficits. A working gerontocracy hardly helps the young. Brits from Tottenham to Teesside have watched the most patrician cabinet since Macmillan cutting everything from libraries to youth counseling services. Theirs is a ''No Future'' revolt.
A feeling has grown in Western societies that uncontrollable forces are at work shrinking possibility. History has never seen a global power shift as radical as the current one that managed to be peaceful.
The united Europe of today is built on the ashes of successive empires -- from the Roman to the British -- that ended in one form or other of violent convulsion. Now the American quasi-imperium, and more generally the dominion of the West, is ending, not rapidly but steadily.
Growth, jobs, expansion, excitement -- and, yes, possibility -- lie in the great non-Western arc from China through India to South Africa and Brazil. Go South! Go East! That's the dictum of the age but not always practicable in Peckham or Peoria. The world has been turned upside-down. What we are witnessing is how shaken Western societies are by such inversion.
As new powers emerge, globalization has altered the relationship between capital and labor in the former's favor. Many more cheap workers have become available outside the West as technology has eliminated distance. Returns on capital have proved higher relative to wages. That's the story of the post-cold-war period. The gap between rich and poor has become a gulf.
The only people who walked away unscathed from the great financial binge that preceded this mess were its main architects and greatest beneficiaries: bankers, financiers and hedge-fund honchos.
This, too, is fueling a time of outrage that has left Western politicians chasing shadows.
Perhaps the society dealing best with these dilemmas is Germany. It has invested in a highly educated work force. It has matched workers' skills to jobs. It has continued to make precision machinery others can't make. It has fostered cooperation between labor unions and employers and between industrialists and the government in defense of German jobs. The youth unemployment rate is under 10 percent.
It has not tried to race to the bottom to compete with China, or imagined that financial and other services could sustain a society, or shirked on training, or tried to dismember unions, or believed that markets held all the answers. Past cataclysm has contributed to Germany's ability to see past ego to the common good needed for stability.
Alas, Germany is also involved in a fit of navel-gazing. It is tired of others' problems. It is sick of bailing out the Greeks. Surveys suggest 50 percent of Germans now have little or no faith in the European Union, the country's postwar route to rehabilitation. German leadership has become an oxymoron just when needed.
The United States and Western Europe saved Germany. Perhaps it's time to return a little of the favor -- not with money alone, but ideas.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: How to Heal the Economy

 BODY:
A letter on Wednesday called on President Obama to take immediate decisive action. Then readers offered their ideas.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''Past Time for a New Agenda'' (editorial, Aug. 9): In the face of Standard & Poor's downgrade of America's credit rating, a volatile stock market and a jittery public, President Obama needs to display real leadership and take decisive action on the economy.
Mr. Obama must offer a plan with specific ideas for creating jobs by investing in infrastructure, and for reducing the deficit by increasing the age for Medicare beneficiaries, using means-testing for Social Security recipients, reforming the tax code to close loopholes and make it fairer, ending subsidies for giant corporations, bringing all of our troops home from Afghanistan by Christmas and eliminating the Bush tax cuts for the super-rich.
This plan should be given to Congressional leaders with the proviso that it must be passed before the end of this year. Mr. Obama should take a 50-state tour to present this plan to the American people, who should put pressure on their representatives to vote for it. 
If Congress, notably the Republicans, fails to enact his plan, it will bear the responsibility for the consequences.
HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN New York, Aug. 9, 2011
The writer is senior director of a recruitment firm for financial executives.
Readers React
Mr. Lowenstein crystallizes the position in which American progressives find themselves: Most of what he suggests is eminently reasonable, and almost none of it is doable.
Republicans, who have control of the House and the ability to throttle the Senate, will not tax the rich, will not end corporate subsidies, will not means-test entitlements and, most of all, will not spend the nation's money on government programs that work. The only one of Mr. Lowenstein's proposals within the president's power is bringing the troops home, and that will have little economic impact except in the very long run; we will still have a $700 billion military budget.
So what is really being proposed here -- as by The Times's editorial, as by most progressive commentators -- is that the president ratchet up the rhetoric and escalate the very polarization that has already paralyzed us, and given the rest of the world reason to doubt our trustworthiness, our competence, if not our sanity. While it would be emotionally gratifying to hear the president trash-talk the right, it's hard to imagine what real good might come of it.
As for the proposed 50-state tour to present his plan, Mr. Obama already has that on his schedule. It's called the electoral campaign of 2012, and it will, for better or worse, put the fate of the American people exactly where it belongs -- in their own hands.
DAVID BERMAN New York, Aug. 10, 2011
With all the daunting problems we face, the questions being asked are: What can President Obama do? What can the Fed do? What can Congress do? We're so focused on government, we forget the private sector, as Mr. Lowenstein did in his letter.
The private sector seems to be waiting for some far-off day when government gets out of the way. It's time for the private sector to stop sitting on the piles of cash we hear about and use it to create new demand, to create growth. Stop overworking your existing employees. Hire new employees.
I keep hearing that ''government's the problem.'' Well, if you run a company and you've got the ability to hire but you're not hiring, you're the problem.
We need to talk about what you can do for your country.
REBECCA ZICARELLI Bethel, Me., Aug. 10, 2011
What I find sad about Mr. Lowenstein's plan is that if it could be enacted by a popular vote in a special election, it could be law right away.
However, given the trench warfare mentality in Congress, notably among the Republicans, such a plan is unlikely to be considered until a far more draconian plan is required.
ROBERT OKSNER Winter Park, Fla., Aug. 10, 2011
Fear-inspired hyperbole about the so-called ''debt crisis'' and ''explosion of government spending'' has twisted the public discourse about fiscal policy. The upshot is a feeling that our long-range fiscal problems must be solved today, lest we descend into ''ruin'' (as Jeffrey Manns warned in an Aug. 10 Op-Ed article).
So Mr. Lowenstein stresses the need to make decisions by ''the end of this year'' about major changes in entitlements such as increasing the age for Medicare beneficiaries (which will increase the number of uninsured and up the ante for any national health care program) and means-testing Social Security. It's too bad that we're in the midst of a ''crisis'' and cannot address these problems in a more thoughtful way.
DAVID SALKEVER Baltimore, Aug. 11, 2011
The writer is a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
I agree that President Obama must take immediate and decisive steps to improve the economy. But I disagree with some of Mr. Lowenstein's recommendations.
Using means-testing to limit benefits turns Social Security into a welfare program; this would quickly erode its base of support. Social Security is a program that we all pay into, is a crucial lifeline for many seniors and must remain a program that we all derive benefit from. Eliminating the yearly cap on the payroll tax would be fairer and go further toward strengthening the program.
Raising the age for Medicare beneficiaries would disproportionately hurt poor people. People who work in physically demanding occupations are less likely to be able to work longer as they wait to reach eligibility for Medicare. Injuries and illness that they are unable to treat will tend to become worse by the time they are covered by Medicare, and so the cost of eventually treating them may be higher than it otherwise would have been.
In addition to these ideas being poor choices on their own merits, how would they improve the economy?
KEN UTTING Neptune Beach, Fla., Aug. 10, 2011
I agree with every one of Mr. Lowenstein's suggestions and would add one more. Because there is such a deep malaise among the people I know in the face of the dysfunction around us, why not create a Rebuilding America plan that would give those of us who don't have a lot of money a chance to participate directly?
Why not sell ''rebuilding bonds'' (like World War II's war bonds) so that ordinary people like me could contribute to the rebuilding of our aging infrastructure? Use our investments only for jobs and materials needed for rebuilding bridges, schools, water and sewer systems, transportation systems and the like.
Let me and many people like me participate in putting people back to work and investing in our country.
MARGARET HANEY Dayton, Ohio, Aug. 10, 2011
It is clear that the government can't hire us out of these dismal times because it has no money to pay for its current programs, much less for ''creating jobs by investing in infrastructure.'' But it is also clear that raiding Medicare and Social Security to preserve more than favorable tax treatment for the wealthy is an obscenity that cannot be allowed.
The only fair and sustainable way to eliminate the national debt is to put the unemployed back to work, not in make-work jobs paid for with borrowed money, but in self-sustaining jobs creating wealth in the private sector. And to do that we need to find a way to increase the demand for things grown, mined and made in the United States.
The suggestion that we protect our economy with tariffs, as we did throughout the Industrial Revolution, is treated as heresy these days. But the continuing weakening of the dollar due to our permanent trade imbalances will eventually have the same effect on imports as high tariffs. We have allowed our financial, commercial and political elites to make ''protect'' a dirty word. But a failure to protect is neglect. And is that really our best course?
DAVID RAINES Lunenburg, Mass., Aug. 10, 2011
Mr. Lowenstein proposes to raise federal taxes and spend money building infrastructure.
I oppose higher taxes in principle because I think the federal government gets more than enough to do what is needed of it, and the only way to rein in Washington's corrupt politics is to keep the federal government deeply in debt.
I oppose his spending scheme because infrastructure projects usually don't involve small businesses, which are the engine of the American economy, but instead huge, unionized and often corrupt construction corporations.
JAY BUTE El Lago, Tex., Aug. 10, 2011
Mr. Lowenstein is exactly correct in his assessment of what President Obama should do, with two small changes:
First, Mr. Obama should scrap the 50-state tour, which will look like a campaign effort, reducing the efficacy of his pitch. Instead, he should work hard to sell the plan to the American people via television every day and use the Internet to get people's responses.
Second, President Obama should really shame any opponents -- not just Republicans but also Democrats. He needs to attack in a way that he has never done before. Thus far President Obama has shown a staggering inability to use the bully pulpit in a way that demonstrates real courage and conviction. If he did this, if he risked his second term, regardless of success or failure, he would earn my respect and probably that of many other Americans.
It's time to show us what you've got, Mr. President, or go home.
KURT SCHMIDT Zagreb, Croatia, Aug. 10, 2011
The writer is an American who owns a small business in Savannah, Ga.
The Writer Responds
I am moved by the determination, creativity and sense of responsibility reflected in these responses. Our leaders need to understand that the American people are willing to sacrifice for the good of our nation.
I suggest, Mr. Berman, that all those ''will not's'' could easily become ''can do's'' if President Obama has the courage to put them before Congress and we the people support him. As to bringing home the troops by Christmas, the savings in money, not to mention lives and limbs, will be immediate; we are currently spending about $10 billion a month in Afghanistan.
The private sector that Ms. Zicarelli refers to is ''sitting on the piles of cash'' because of the uncertainty created by the incredibly perverse actions taken by radical members of Congress. Unless and until Congress accepts the fact that shared sacrifice (revenue increases and spending cuts) is the only way to rebuild the economy, the private sector will keep its cash where it is.
Mr. Oksner could be, sadly, very right that the Republicans, especially the Tea Party fanatics, would make it very difficult to pass this plan.
We are descending into ''ruin,'' Mr. Salkever, because almost 20 percent of the work force is unemployed or underemployed, and we have spent well beyond our means for more than two decades now. I believe that the only way to get the fanatical right wing to increase revenues is to take on entitlement programs in the same sweeping manner.
To Mr. Utting, means-testing would not turn Social Security into a welfare program. Recipients like me, who can afford to receive less than our current stipend, would do so, and those who could not afford a cut would not be affected.
Thank you, Ms. Haney, for agreeing with all my suggestions! And I agree with yours about rebuilding bonds.
It is true, Mr. Raines, that government cannot ''hire us out of these dismal times.'' But a return to sanity in government would spur investment and hiring, and the American people might just start to consume products and services again. Alas, protectionism in our global economy would make us even greater pariahs than having our credit rating reduced.
Mr. Bute responds that I propose to raise federal taxes. Tax reform and ending loopholes could actually lower rates for most taxpayers.
To Mr. Schmidt, if a 50-state tour looks like a ''campaign effort,'' I say all the better. President Obama will be re-elected, or not, on the basis of what the American people believe he has accomplished with regard to rebuilding the economy. I believe he should take the ''bully pulpit'' directly to the American people.

HEADLINE: Power to the Corporation!

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
DES MOINES, Iowa
I saw Mitt Romney's hair move.
No really, I did. We were standing amid the soybean and corn fields in rural Iowa and a breeze lifted some of his salt-and-pepper mane out of its Brylcreem perfection.
The tenuous and scarce Republican front-runner, who hopes to do ''darn well'' in Iowa, was poking at President Obama. ''I sure as heck wouldn't be on a bus tour if I were president of the United States,'' he said. 
I tried to focus on his patter-on-a-stick in this rare encounter with the press, but I kept thinking about another tall, dark and handsome avatar of perfection known for holding back: Cary Grant. Like Grant, Romney is a fastidious dresser with an athletic build. But the 64-year-old former governor of Massachusetts doesn't make you swoon, maybe because he looks like a statue of himself.
Grant came to mind because the setting for Romney's press conference, outside the Vermeer agricultural manufacturing plant in Pella, recalled the famous scene in Hitchcock's ''North by Northwest'': Mad Man Roger O. Thornhill has to run for his life through Midwest cornfields when the bad guys chase him in a crop-duster. It's an apt image for the riven Republican Party: Some maniacal Tea Party meanies fly in out of nowhere to spew poison, chasing the establishment guys out of their more refined natural habitats.
One pollster here wryly noted that the Republican presidential prospects divide into ''the sane and the insane.''
Since the sane ones are boring as spackle and the insane ones have crackle, Republicans must hope that the mildly insane premise in Dr. Nassir Ghaemi's new book about leadership and mental illness is correct.
In ''A First-Rate Madness,'' Dr. Ghaemi, the director of the Mood Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center, asserts, ''In the storm of crisis, complete sanity can steer us astray, while some insanity brings us to port.'' I hope that means harbor instead of alcohol, since two Mormons are running.
Not only did I see Romney's hair move, I saw him sweat. This must have come as a great relief to his handlers; when he was campaigning in 2007, some advisers worried that he looked too perfect in an ad showing him jogging through the woods.
Knowing that perfect can read as false, his ad team would try to shoot him with a hand-held camera using videotape, as opposed to film, which can create prettier, slicker images.
On the state fair soapbox, Romney put a loafer up on a bale of hay and perspired from the heat as some in the audience chatted about how his first name is Willard. While Democrats are amused that Romney shares a name with a famous movie rat, it is also disturbing that Mitt and Willard morph into Millard, the name of one of America's most mediocre presidents.
In the debate in Ames on Thursday, Romney replied to a question from Fox's Bret Baier about the debt deal by saying, ''Look, I'm not going to eat Barack Obama's dog food, all right?''
He was trying to be tough, but unfortunately may have reminded people of the infamous time he put Seamus, his Irish setter, in a dog carrier strapped to the roof of the family station wagon for a 12-hour drive from Boston to Ontario.
At the fair, Romney -- whose net worth is between $190 million and $250 million -- once again went manly by flipping a pork chop on a grill and facing down hecklers worried about cuts in Social Security. When a man in the audience yelled that corporations should be taxed more, Romney replied, ''Corporations are people, my friend.''
Give ''The Stormin' Mormon,'' as Neil Cavuto approvingly called him on Fox News, credit: never has the traditional Republican doctrine been so succinctly explained.
Of the corporation, by the corporation, for the corporation. We the corporation. Corporations who need corporations are the luckiest corporations in the world. Power to the corporation!
Romney may not have realized that he was articulating the same fundamental concept of the American right that Justice Antonin Scalia propounded in the Citizens United case, when the Supreme Court opened the way to Super PACs and a flood of surreptitious new donations in politics. (A former official at Bain Capital, Romney's old private equity firm, admitted recently that he was the one who anonymously gave $1 million to a pro-Mitt Super PAC.)
The association of individuals in a business corporation, Scalia wrote in his concurring opinion, ''cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not 'an individual American.' ''
The back-door money infused by Karl Rove, the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers and others elected a slew of radical Republicans. Thanks to that Congressional wrecking crew, America's credit rating has been downgraded and its economy has been hurt.
At least Republicans are getting most of the blame for that, my friend.

HEADLINE: Iowa Poll Goes To Bachmann; Paul Is Second

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa -- The race for the Republican presidential nomination came into sharper focus on Saturday as Gov. Rick Perry of Texas declared his candidacy in South Carolina and Michele Bachmann won a closely watched poll of voters in Iowa.
With Republican enthusiasm swelling over the prospect of defeating President Obama next year, thousands of party activists converged here for the Iowa straw poll. The outcome, combined with the entrance of Mr. Perry, could help reorder the top tier of contenders, with Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Perry positioned to challenge the perceived front runner, Mitt Romney, and each other.
Ron Paul of Texas, whose libertarian views put him at odds with many Republicans, finished slightly behind Mrs. Bachmann in the straw poll. Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota who argued that Mrs. Bachmann was not sufficiently qualified to be the party's nominee, finished a distant third.
The results of the straw poll provide only a snapshot of the race, but along with Mr. Perry's announcement, represented a significant reshuffling of the campaign and highlighted a deep uncertainty among Republicans over who would be the strongest nominee. Republicans sense a new opportunity to win back the White House, but there was little clarity about whether voters would choose someone from the party establishment, an outsider or a hybrid. 
''You have just sent a message that Barack Obama will be a one-term president,'' Mrs. Bachmann said, standing outside her campaign bus after she was declared the winner. ''This was a wonderful down payment on taking the country back.''
By virtue of his long tenure as governor of Texas, his credentials as a social and fiscal conservative and his fund-raising capability, Mr. Perry has an opportunity to challenge Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, who did not actively participate in the straw poll. But first, Mr. Perry will likely have to confront Mrs. Bachmann, whose victory here provides a new opening to raise her profile beyond the Tea Party movement that fueled the rapid rise of her candidacy.
The race, at least in the short term, will focus on this trio: Mr. Romney, who is seen as next in line for the nomination, if the traditional rules of Republican presidential politics apply; Mrs. Bachmann, whose insurgent style has captured the imagination of many conservative activists; and Mr. Perry, who served in the United States Air Force and worked in farming before entering politics at age 34, has tapped into passionate small-government, anti-Washington sentiment within the party.
The straw poll was the first big test of Mrs. Bachmann's organization, and propelled her to the top of the field in Iowa, whose caucuses open the Republican nominating season early next year. Her coalition included home-schooling parents -- T-shirts were made specifically to identify them in the crowd -- and members of local churches.
The straw poll here, along with Mr. Perry's announcement in South Carolina, marked the biggest day yet in the Republican presidential campaign. The events were 1,200 miles apart, but Mr. Perry's candidacy was a chief topic of conversation here and threatened to upend the contest that has been playing out here for months.
In caravans of cars, vans and buses, party activists and curious voters descended on Iowa State University on a cool, pleasant day. While the candidates repeatedly assailed Washington, the straw poll grounds seemed as though much of Washington had been transported here, with party leaders, television personalities and a collection of interest groups on hand.
Mrs. Bachmann won with 29 percent of the nearly 17,000 votes cast, with Mr. Paul claiming 28 percent. Mr. Pawlenty, who received 14 percent, said his campaign was just beginning, but conceded, ''We have a lot more work to do.'' Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, won 10 percent. After winning the event four years ago, Mr. Romney declined to wage a campaign, and received just 3 percent of the vote.
It was hardly a perfect laboratory of democracy.
The right to cast a ballot cost $30. Most campaigns footed the bill, throwing in a lunch of barbecued pork, grilled hamburgers and ice cream as an enticement to spend part of the day in Ames. The campaigns poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the political carnival, which is a fund-raiser for the Republican Party of Iowa.
The event unfolded as a daylong pep rally for Republicans, who may have supported different candidates, but were unified around the notion of defeating Mr. Obama.
In speech after speech, the candidates drew the most enthusiastic applause as they delivered forceful criticism of his handling of the economy, the downgrade in the nation's credit rating and the sustained period of high unemployment.
No candidate invested more in the straw poll than Mr. Pawlenty, who relocated his national campaign operation to Iowa in hopes of jump-starting a candidacy that has flagged since Mrs. Bachmann joined the race in June. A day before the straw poll, he said that he would have to ''retrench in some way,'' with the prospect of his fund-raising drying up and an expensive overhead to maintain.
Mr. Perry's entrance could also pose a new threat to Mr. Pawlenty. For weeks, Mr. Pawlenty urged voters to settle on a candidate with executive experience. The candidate who could pick up that argument, several Republicans here said, could be Mr. Perry.
''He's an attractive candidate,'' said Tim Gibson of Clive, Iowa, 59, who stood in line at the straw poll, waiting to cast a write-in vote for Mr. Perry, who won 4 percent of the vote. ''He brings leadership to the race. My top priority is winning the election and I want to vote for someone who can win.''
The participation of 16,892 Iowa voters on Saturday represented an increase from 2007, when 14,302 voters turned out for the straw poll. But even with increasing enthusiasm over the prospect of defeating Mr. Obama, the balloting was far less than the 23,685 people who voted in the 1999 poll, which propelled George W. Bush's candidacy. ''The size of today's crowd is a sign that the Republican resurgence is alive,'' said Matt Strawn, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.
Yet the raw vote totals represented a sliver of the people the campaigns will ultimately need to win over before the Iowa caucuses, which open the party's nominating fight early next year. The results are not intended to serve as a predictor of things to come, but rather a snapshot of time for the intensity, organization and sentiment surrounding a particular candidate.
The disappointing finish for the Pawlenty campaign is explained, in part, by voters like Dave Freligh, a retired private investigator from Winterset, who carried a green ''Pawlenty '12'' T-shirt under his arm. He accepted a ticket from the Pawlenty campaign, but decided to support Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, because he wanted him to keep his candidacy alive so the race would not be dominated by politicians.
''I feel like a little bit of a fraud,'' said Mr. Freligh, 67, shrugging as he walked away from the voting area. ''Now, I'm waiting to see who has real leadership qualities and who gets my juices going.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about the race for the Republican presidential nomination referred incorrectly to the employment history of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who announced his candidacy on Saturday. Mr. Perry served in the United States Air Force and worked in farming before entering politics at age 34. He has not held elective office ''his entire adult life.''

HEADLINE: Shaking Up Republican Field, Perry Officially Enters the Race for President

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Ames, Iowa, and Matt Flegenheimer from Greenland, N.H.

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announced Saturday that he was running for president, declaring it was ''time to get America working again'' as he sought to offer the Republican Party a candidate who appeals to both fiscal and social conservatives.
As many of his fellow candidates flooded Iowa over the weekend to woo voters at the Ames Straw Poll, Mr. Perry, 61, headed here to the RedState Gathering, an annual convention of conservative bloggers being held in South Carolina, another early primary state, to begin seeking his party's nomination on a small-government, anti-Washington platform.
''I came to South Carolina because I will not sit back and accept the path that America is on, because a great country requires a better direction, because a renewed nation needs a new president,'' he said.
''With the support of my family and unwavering belief in the goodness of America, I declare to you today as a candidate for president of the United States.'' 
And with that, Mr. Perry, whose intentions had been one of the biggest unanswered questions during the early stages of the Republican primary contest -- he was even the topic of a question at Thursday night's Republican debate in Iowa -- made his candidacy official.
Mr. Perry, who promised ''to give a pink slip to the current resident in the White House,'' began by introducing himself to the crowd as a small-town boy from humble means. But he quickly offered a stirring assessment on the state of America, criticizing President Obama and predicting, in a Reaganesque flourish, that ''it's time to believe that the promise of our future is far greater than even our best days behind us.''
Mr. Perry's entrance into an already crowded field is expected to reconfigure the dynamics of the race, offering Republicans a fiscal and social conservative who not only appeals to the party's base but can also challenge Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts who is leading in many polls, on jobs and the economy. His passionate speech on Saturday offered a vivid contrast to Mr. Romney, who comes across as more measured and often struggles to rouse his crowds.
Mr. Perry traveled from South Carolina to New Hampshire for his first appearance as a candidate in that critical state. At an invitation-only event in the backyard of State Representative Pam Tucker's Greenland, N.H., home, Mr. Perry spoke for 15 minutes and then took questions on topics including Libya, border security and nuclear energy.
His announcement reverberated 1,200 miles away in Iowa, where thousands of Republicans gathered to size up the party's candidates, who delivered speeches and asked for support in the Ames Straw Poll. Though Mr. Perry's name was not on the ballot, a group called Americans for Rick Perry urged people to list him as a write-in candidate, and he received 718 of the nearly 17,000 votes cast.
He is set to travel to Iowa on Sunday, where he intends to spend three days in the state introducing himself to voters who will open the nominating contest early next year.
Mr. Perry is the longest-serving governor of Texas, having been elected to three terms and having held the position for more than 10 years. He is known as a fierce and skilled campaigner, as well as a prodigious fund-raiser. In past campaigns, he has eked out victories and also come from behind to win by large margins. ''He becomes immediately one of the top three candidates, and he fills a vacuum -- of someone who is a conservative, who has credibility and can speak to the fiscal conservative, anti-big-government and anti-Washington crowd, but he's also a social conservative,'' said Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for President George W. Bush.
What Mr. Perry does in the coming weeks will be the real test of his candidacy, said Republicans who were waiting to see if he could withstand the scrutiny that comes with a presidential campaign.
''He either gets in and gets through the gantlet of the first month or so and consistently moves forward and wins the nomination, or he's got this terrific flameout,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''There's no middle ground.''
Mr. Romney has positioned himself as the candidate with real-world experience who can turn the economy around and create jobs, and Mr. Perry will compete with him on that front, making a case that his policies of low taxes and light regulation have helped Texas post a strong record of job growth at a time when most of the nation is struggling.
''We'll create the jobs and the progress needed to get America working again,'' Mr. Perry told the crowd in Charleston. ''And I'll promise you this: I'll work every day to make Washington, D.C., as inconsequential in your life as I can.''
Democrats challenged Mr. Perry's efforts to portray his policies as having benefited Texas.
''He's cutting services in order to maintain really low tax rates, and so many of the jobs he's created are these minimum-wage jobs, not these living-wage jobs,'' said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. ''I think he has, as they would say here in Texas, plenty of 'splaining to do about his positions.''
Mr. Perry, a fifth-generation Texan, grew up in a rural community in Paint Creek, on a tenant farm nestled in the West Texas plains, an area known as the Big Empty. Mr. Perry, an Eagle Scout, told Texas Monthly last year, ''There were three things to do in Paint Creek: school, church and Boy Scouts.''
His mother, he said, was a good seamstress who still made his underwear when he went off to college at Texas A & M University, from which he graduated in 1972 with a major in animal science.
Mr. Perry, a Methodist who regularly attends an evangelical megachurch near his home and hosted a large ''Nation in Crisis'' prayer rally this month in Houston, is a natural candidate to appeal to his party's religious right, as well as to parts of its small-government wing, including elements of the Tea Party movement.
In some ways, Mr. Perry embraced Tea Party ideals before the party itself was popular, winning re-election in 2010 -- first by beating Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in a primary challenge for governor, and then defeating Bill White, the former mayor of Houston -- by positioning himself as an outsider, despite his two terms as governor. He pitted Texas against Washington, and prevailed.
Mr. Perry has walked a fine line on immigration, trying to balance his state's business interests with calls for stricter enforcement and border security, and that may not endear him with some Republicans, especially those aligned with the Tea Party.
In 2001, he signed his state's version of the Dream Act, a bill that allowed children of illegal immigrants to attend state universities as long as they were working toward citizenship and had graduated from a Texas high school. Yet a decade later, he led the push for a bill that would have allowed the police to question people they picked up about their immigration status.
Mr. Perry, who greeted the cheering crowd in Charleston with a drawled ''Howdy,'' is Mr. Bush's direct successor as governor, and with his Texas twang and swagger, he can seem like a caricature of the former president. Voters trying to figure out what they think of Mr. Perry will invariably wrestle with their feelings about Mr. Bush, which, Republicans say, may become a potential liability if he makes it to the general election.
Though Mr. Perry is a disciplined campaigner, he has been known to get carried away when speaking and sometimes finds himself trying to rein in his own statements. In 2009, he briefly but publicly raised the issue of secession.
''There really was considerable talk down here about all the talk of secession that bubbled up around his gubernatorial campaign,'' Mr. Doggett said. ''So that when he started talking about running for president, the question was: of which country?''

HEADLINE: White House Debates Fight On Economy

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the economy worsens, President Obama and his senior aides are considering whether to adopt a more combative approach on economic issues, seeking to highlight substantive differences with Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail rather than continuing to pursue elusive compromises, advisers to the president say.
Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Plouffe, and his chief of staff, William M. Daley, want him to maintain a pragmatic strategy of appealing to independent voters by advocating ideas that can pass Congress, even if they may not have much economic impact. These include free trade agreements and improved patent protections for inventors.
But others, including Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, say public anger over the debt ceiling debate has weakened Republicans and created an opening for bigger ideas like tax incentives for businesses that hire more workers, according to Congressional Democrats who share that view. Democrats are also pushing the White House to help homeowners facing foreclosure. 
Even if the ideas cannot pass Congress, they say, the president would gain a campaign issue by pushing for them.
''The president's team puts a premium on being above the partisan fray, which is usually the right strategy,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate. ''But on this issue, when he knows what the right thing to do is, and when a rather small group on one side is blocking any progress, you have to be willing to call that group out if you want to get anything done.''
Dan Pfeiffer, the White House director of communications, said that there was no internal debate. ''The president's first priority is to work with Republicans and Democrats to grow the economy, create jobs and reduce the deficit, but if the Republican House continues its 'my way or the highway' approach, he will make sure the public knows who is standing in the way and why.''
The issue is being framed by the 2012 election. Administration officials, frustrated by the intransigence of House Republicans, have increasingly concluded that the best thing Mr. Obama can do for the economy may be winning a second term, with a mandate to advance his ideas on deficit reduction, entitlement changes, housing policy and other issues.
Mr. Obama plans to spend time this weekend considering his options, advisers said. The White House expects to unveil new job-creation proposals in early September.
The ailing economy, barely growing at the same pace as the population, has swept all other political issues to the sidelines. Twenty-five million Americans could not find full-time jobs last month. Millions of families cannot afford to live in their homes. And the contentious debate over raising the federal debt ceiling -- which Mr. Obama achieved only after striking a compromise with Republicans that included a plan for at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years -- has further shaken economic confidence.
Republicans contend that the Obama administration has mismanaged the nation's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Obama's political advisers are struggling to define a response, aware that their prospects may rest on persuading voters that the results of the first term matter less than the contrast between their vision for the next four years and the alternative economic ideas offered by Republicans.
So far, most signs point to a continuation of the nonconfrontational approach -- better to do something than nothing -- that has defined this administration. Mr. Obama and his aides are skeptical that voters will reward bold proposals if those ideas do not pass Congress. It is their judgment that moderate voters want tangible results rather than speeches.
''If you're talking about a stunt, I don't think a stunt is what the American people are looking for,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters on Wednesday. ''They're looking for leadership, and they're looking for a focus on economic growth and job creation.''
A wide range of economists say the administration should call for a new round of stimulus spending, as prescribed by mainstream economic theory, to create jobs and promote growth. It is clear that the House would never pass such a plan.
But Christina Romer, who stepped down last year as the chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Obama should fight for short-term spending in combination with long-term deficit reduction.
''Playing it safe is not going to cut it,'' said Ms. Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Not proposing anything bold and not trying to do something to definitively deal with our problems would mean that we're going to have another year and a half like the last year and a half -- and then it's awfully hard to get re-elected.''
But there is little support for such an approach inside the administration. A series of departures has left few economists among Mr. Obama's senior advisers. Several of his political advisers are skeptical about the merits of stimulus spending, and they are certain about the politics: voters do not like it.
Mr. Plouffe and Mr. Daley share the view that a focus on deficit reduction is an economic and political imperative, according to people who have spoken with them. Voters believe that paying down the debt will help the economy, and the White House agrees, although it wants to avoid cutting too much spending while the economy remains weak.
As part of this appeal to centrist voters, the president intends to continue his push for a so-called grand bargain on deficit reduction -- a deal with Republicans to make even larger spending cuts, including to the social safety net, in exchange for some revenue increases -- despite the strong opposition of Congressional Democrats who want to use the issue to draw contrasts with Republicans.
Administration officials say that their focus is on a number of smaller programs that could benefit the economy, a theme Mr. Obama has emphasized in his recent speeches.
''We know there are things Congress can do, right now, to get more money back in your pockets, get this economy growing faster and get our friends and neighbors back to work,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday in his weekly address.
On Aug. 5, in a move that went virtually unnoticed amid the clamor over a rating agency's downgrading of United States debt, the administration announced a new jobs program for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama called it a ''reverse boot camp,'' intended to retrain veterans for civilian jobs. Part of the program would include a ''returning hero tax credit'' for companies that hire unemployed disabled veterans.
The administration may also merge the Department of Commerce, the Office of the United States Trade Representative and some economic divisions at the State Department into a new agency, administration officials said. Possible names include the Department of Jobs or the Department of Competitiveness.
This focus on the little things is painful for many Democrats who see big problems, but there is growing acceptance that there may be no alternative to waiting for the next election.
''I'm as frustrated as everybody else on the planet both with where we are and with the response,'' said Sarah Rosen Wartell of the Center for American Progress. ''But I was reflecting on how difficult a hand they were dealt and how limited the options are.''
''If the other side has demonstrated an unwillingness to be a party to a compromise,'' she added, ''then you've got to lay out your vision as clearly as possible and make your case for it to the public.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about economic policy discussions within the Obama administration omitted, in some copies, the word ''only'' from a quotation by Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. In noting that the administration does not see deficits and jobs as an either-or choice, Mr. Pfeiffer said that ''it would be political folly to make the argument that only government spending equals jobs.''

FISCAL calamity? Deceased former governor? Middling Jay-Z album?
New Yorkers had a rough week. On Twitter, thankfully, no wound is too fresh to poke at in 140 characters.
Last Sunday, many users mourned the death of Gov. Hugh L. Carey, praising the former governor's handling of the New York financial crisis in the 1970s. Some found occasion to unearth Mr. Carey's quips, which revealed him to be a man of his time. ''A Senate session is like a woman driving,'' @erickuo posted, quoting the governor. ''Who knows what'll happen?''
An assault on the pop singer Gavin DeGraw in the East Village demanded similar gravitas. Amid the fan tributes and occasional gripes about his music, @EJdance85 tested a new verb: 
''Kinda scared to walk thru east village now ... I don't wanna get gavin degraw'd.''
The release of ''Watch the Throne,'' an album by Kanye West and Jay-Z, had New Yorkers at least as spooked. Though tracks like ''No Church in the Wild,'' ''Murder to Excellence'' and ''Lift Off'' generated heavy traffic, reviews among the city's Twitter users were mixed.
@iDstroy suggested that Jay-Z, a 41-year-old mega-millionaire with a wife some might consider attractive, could be losing touch with his gritty upbringing in Brooklyn, posting:
''Jay-Z should have to go back and sell drugs for a year if he wants to keep rapping about it.''
The rapper is not the only local icon becoming less accessible. Users also lamented the looming closing of the Statue of Liberty, which will restrict indoor access over the next year while renovations are performed. @MikeHadge, a Twitter user from Astoria, wrote:
''The Statue of Liberty is closing for a year, all immigrants will be redirected to Mexico.''
New Yorkers took solace, at least, in welcoming a new member to the Twitter community, at least for a while: @CondeElevator, a compilation of anonymous observations from the elevators in the Conde Nast Building, which houses magazines including Vogue and The New Yorker. The account gained more than 70,000 followers in its first week and spawned imitators focusing on Hearst magazines and Goldman Sachs.
Some Conde gems chronicled journalism's daily challenges:
''Male editor: 'There's got to be a way to make a pun on tumescence in the hed.' ''
Others tackled weightier matters: ''Girl #1: I love that necklace, I saw it at Banana last week and almost bought it too. Girl #2: [flips hair] This is Gucci.''
Alas, Twitter's latest treasure was short-lived. As curious parties scrambled to identify the source of the account, the user went silent.
''Girl or Guy #1 [in elevator alone]: This got really crazy. Love my job. Better stop. #sorry''
THIS WEEK ON TWITTER: Gov. Hugh L. Carey Gavin DeGraw Jay-Z No Church in the Wild Murder to Excellence Lift Off Statue of Liberty @CondeElevator; Trending topics are drawn from a periodic sampling by The New York Times of locally trending popular terms reported by Twitter in the past week, with posts of specific New York interest highlighted.

PERSON: Howard G. Paster 

HEADLINE: Howard G. Paster, 66, Clinton Aide Who Helped Pass Nafta

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Howard G. Paster, a consummate Washington insider whose effectiveness as a corporate lobbyist took him to the White House as President Bill Clinton's liaison to Congress, where he helped push through the North American Free Trade Agreement, died on Wednesday in Baltimore. He was 66 and lived in Washington.
Mr. Paster's death, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, was caused by encephalitis, his wife, Gail, said. 
As Mr. Clinton's principal ambassador to Congress at the time, Mr. Paster had to overcome the opposition of a majority of House Democrats to pass Nafta, relying heavily on Republican support instead.
The agreement, which was phased in beginning in 1994, removed most tariff and nontariff barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico to create one of the world's largest trading blocs. Together, the three nations produce $17 trillion in goods and services every year.
Facing predictions of failure, Mr. Paster and his team of 20 aides won a come-from-behind victory, in part by promising deals for farmers and offering job-training programs to bolster American workers.
''The horse trading is nothing but people defending their constituent interests, and that's an entirely appropriate thing for them to do,'' he said.
Mr. Paster, whose style could be brusque and whose rhyming nickname was Faster Paster, was less persuasive in selling Mr. Clinton's package of measures to stimulate a faltering economy through public works, education grants and the extension of unemployment benefits.
''It's fair to say that the fact the stimulus bill did not pass is my responsibility,'' Mr. Paster told The New York Times in May 1993. ''I miscalculated over what it would take to negotiate a bill.''
In December 1993, less than a year into the Clinton administration, Mr. Paster resigned to become the chairman and chief executive of the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton. In an interview with NPR, he said he lacked the stamina to continue. He was ''not Superman,'' he said.
In a statement after Mr. Paster's death, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Paster had made a ''tremendous difference'' in carrying out his administration's ''crucial initiatives.''
Howard George Paster was born on Dec. 23, 1944, in Brooklyn and grew up in Nassau County, on Long Island. His father was an automobile dealer, and his mother a fervent volunteer for the Democratic Party. He graduated from Alfred University in western New York, where he edited the campus newspaper, then earned a degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
Early in his career, he worked on the staffs of Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, and Representative Lester Wolff, Democrat of New York.
He became the chief Washington lobbyist for the United Automobile Workers in the late 1970s and played a leading role in negotiating the loan bailout of the Chrysler Corporation. His performance impressed the negotiators on the other side of the table, lobbyists from Timmons & Company. Timmons hired him away at the end of the talks.
In a dozen years at Timmons, Mr. Paster represented Eastern Airlines and Major League Baseball, among other clients. He helped the oil industry by softening some provisions of the 1991 Clean Air Act. In August 1992, he moved to Hill & Knowlton, becoming its chairman of public affairs and general manager of its Washington office. His contract included a clause that he would be free to leave if offered a job in the Clinton administration.
Michael Berman, a longtime friend of Mr. Paster's and an important figure in the Clinton campaign, brought Mr. Paster to the attention of the Clinton team, according to The Washington Post. His many friends in the Senate and the House, particularly Representative John D. Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat, endorsed him.
In 1994, Mr. Paster returned to Hill & Knowlton as its chief, promising to excuse himself from business that involved lobbying with Washington, although lobbyists worked for him. A directive by Mr. Clinton barred him from lobbying the White House for five years.
In 2002, Mr. Paster was promoted to executive vice president of the WPP Group, Hill & Knowlton's parent, which operates in 107 countries and has 146,000 employees. He was also the president of the Little League Foundation, which raises money for youth baseball.
Mr. Paster is survived by his wife, the former Gail Kern, the emeritus director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington; his children, Emily and Timothy Paster; his sisters, Stephanie Paster and Ann Brody Cove; and four grandchildren.
Washington had changed since his days in the White House, he told The Times in an interview in 2009. Lobbying had become less straightforward, negotiations more complex. ''Now it's 'yes, but' or 'no, but' or 'on which bill?' '' he said. ''You have to go retail -- committee to committee.''
His political instincts remained sharp. In May, after the death of Osama bin Laden, he remarked on Republican proposals for changing Medicare, telling The Times, ''That's almost as good for the Democrats as Bin Laden.''

HEADLINE: Adrift in Iowa: Tired Rituals In Tough Times

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Ames, Iowa WAS it a debate or a horticultural seminar? The eight Republicans who gathered on a stage in this fecund state last week spoke of the federal government as if it were some monstrous plant, each of them essentially promising to come at it with shears sharper than any rival would wield. Their mantra was cut, cut, cut.
Tim Pawlenty made it clear that homeowners might have a new, inexpensive gardener at their disposal. If they could find a crop of specific entitlement-reform plans anywhere in Obamaland, he said, ''I'll come to your house and mow your lawn.''
It was a cute bit. Problem was, I'd heard it before, two days earlier, when he appeared briefly at a coffee shop in the town of Sully, his campaign Winnebago zooming in, his campaign Winnebago zooming out. Then again, I'd already heard most of what Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney said at the debate, too. The moderator, Bret Baier, had implored everyone ''to put aside the talking points'' and ''polished lines,'' but that was like asking aardvarks to go easy on the ants. A species can't be denied its subsistence diet. 
In advance of Saturday's straw poll here, Republican presidential hopefuls descended on Iowa, traveled its breadth, paid homage to the butter cow at the state fair and provided the most concentrated glimpse of campaign 2012 to date.
It was an intensely dispiriting spectacle, because it was an entirely familiar one: the same old same old at a moment of extraordinary global uncertainty and profound national anxiety. Americans are more frightened and pessimistic -- and Washington is more dysfunctional -- than they've been in a very long time. But the script in Iowa was unchanged.
Photo op followed photo op. Prefabricated one-liners abounded. Strenuously, speciously folksy riffs and poses prevailed. And candidates vying for the opportunity to lead a diverse nation nonetheless played a tired game of Excite the Right, dwelling on their opposition to gay marriage and trumpeting their anti-abortion credentials. Those aren't and can't be the issues this time around. Not with the European debt crisis threatening to become a worldwide contagion, London burning, the Arab world convulsing, the Dow jackhammering and America's crisis of joblessness grinding on and on. Not now.
It's time for nobler, smarter, more substantive politics. It's past time, actually. But that's not what Iowa presented.
In Sully, where only about a dozen voters turned out to see him, Pawlenty reached so far for attention-getting metaphors that he landed in a smelly field. Deriding President Obama as someone too quick to dispense blame, he likened him to ''a manure spreader in a windstorm.'' Just hearing the phrase, I wanted to take cover -- and a shower.
I didn't make it to Rick Santorum's appearance the previous day at a Hy-Vee grocery store in Iowa Falls, but I wish I had, because it was there that he equated gay marriage with both incest and a square, moderately absorbent crumb remover.
I'll explain.
Santorum was saying that when you speak of two men or two women as married, you indulge in a fiction. An impossibility. ''This is a napkin,'' he announced in an angry voice, abruptly ripping one from a dispenser and holding it high. ''I can call this napkin a paper towel. But it is a napkin. Why? Because it is what it is.''
So while someone might assert that ''marriage could be between fathers and daughters,'' he added, ''It doesn't make it marriage.'' Agreed. It makes it a crime, and to mention that in the same breath as same-sex couples is nothing short of appalling.
Santorum was competing for the same evangelical voters who seem to have taken such a shine to Bachmann. On Sunday she visited two Iowa churches, the second one in the town of Waukee, where the pastor, Jeff Mullen, told congregants, ''we inherently know that homosexual behavior is immoral and unnatural.''
''God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,'' Mullen said, reading from the book of Romans, according to news reports. His sermon was supplemented by a video in which a man testified to having converted from homosexuality to heterosexuality with God's help. No more gay. All prayed away.
Bachmann was investing heavily in a strong finish at the straw poll. She planned to bus supporters there, spring for their $30 tickets (this is how we elect presidents?) and accommodate them in an air-conditioned tent with free barbecue and live music from Randy Travis. Over at the Herman Cain tent, voters were going to have to make do with live music from ... Mike Huckabee.
Bachmann's debate performance was troubling. In her opening remarks, she caromed from senseless to ear-splitting, first saying that her vote against raising the debt ceiling had proved correct and then veritably yelping that Obama would be a one-term president.
But that wasn't the scary part. The scary part was how little distance there was, really, between her and the others on the stage. For all of the agitated sniping between Bachmann and Pawlenty about her legislative record, between Ron Paul and Rick Santorum about Iran, and between Newt Gingrich and the panel of questioners about his alleged persecution, there was a stunning ideological uniformity on display. Among the eight candidates, not one brooked the possibility of any tax increases to help solve the debt problem, even though John Boehner, a fiscal conservative, seemed to have a mind partly open to that at the start of the debt-ceiling negotiations.
HOW can that be? It's because all of the Republican Party is running scared of its super-conservative faction in Congress and because the Republican nominating process rewards a rightward tilt. That remains true this election cycle, to the party's and the country's detriment. Obama is a flawed president confronting epic challenges; he needs to be drawn into a serious conversation with a Republican nominee who represents a plausible alternative, not with someone boxed into a corner. Is that where Romney, the current front-runner, would end up?
In Iowa he talked repeatedly about his 25 years in the private sector, and at one point stressed that he spent only four years -- his one term as Massachusetts governor -- in elective office. It's clear already that the issue of experience will play out in a fascinating way in 2012, with Obama's critics faulting him for too little preparation but trying not to seem like veteran politicians themselves, lest they run afoul of an anti-incumbent mood. Romney walks that fine line by focusing on his career in business. He says it gives him economic chops Obama will never have.
Speaking of chops, Romney went to the state fair on Thursday and donned a red apron to grill pork, because grilling pork is of course a vital part of being commander in chief. He also made remarks from a makeshift stage with bales of hay in the foreground. Bales of hay seem to emerge out of nowhere and creep into the camera frame whenever politicians touch down in farm states, where those politicians tend to talk like they're on ''Hee Haw.'' Over several days I heard Romney say ''sure as heck,'' ''fella'' and ''darn well.'' I half expected him to take a pitchfork to that hay.
Rick Perry wasn't around, but that didn't preclude a constant discussion of him, my favorite bit of which was a CNN segment in which it was revealed that his father-in-law had performed his vasectomy. I'm not sure where on the spectrum of family values that falls or why voters need to know it.
If politicians exhibited some silliness in Iowa, so did reporters. Like hounds heeding a whistle, they swarmed to Sarah Palin when she dropped by the state fair on Friday, again rewarding her coyness about the presidential race with extra-rapt attention. She dithers; we drool.
She was asked if the president was to blame for the nation's credit downgrading, and said yes. ''Because from the top, leadership starts from the top, the leadership of our country,'' she said, syntactical as ever.
She was also asked if she was looking for votes. ''I'm looking for fried butter on a stick and a fried Twinkie as soon as I can get there,'' she said. She deserves as much. And we deserve something much, much better.

ECONOMIC TROUBLES LOOM
OVER BIDEN'S TRIP TO CHINA
As Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to depart for China to meet with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, a new uncertainty looms over relations between the two countries. Chinese leaders face profound questions about the strength of the American economy and American leadership because of the government's struggle to meet its debt obligations and the partisan schisms and political paralysis that turned a problem into a crisis. PAGE 11
ARGENTINE PRESIDENT'S ODDS
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, appears to be heading toward re-election in October, aided by a splintered opposition and a growing economy that is overshadowing previous concerns about her polarizing leadership style. Just two years ago she seemed a long shot to be re-elected, in part because she clashed with farmers, one of the country's most powerful interests. PAGE 9 
AMERICAN SEIZED IN PAKISTAN
A group of seven or eight armed men abducted an American citizen from his residence in the early morning hours in the eastern city of Lahore, police officials said. It was not immediately clear if the men were Islamist militants or secular kidnappers seeking a ransom. An American Embassy spokesman said the kidnapped man was Warren Weinstein, who was said to be working on an American-financed development project. PAGE 11
DEBATING THE CAUSE OF RIOTS
After the widespread rioting in several cities in Britain, a debate continues to rage across the country -- in Parliament and in the streets -- as to why it took place. The British are struggling to determine the impact of deep mistrust of the police in poorer communities, income inequality and rampant youth unemployment. PAGE 6

WITHOUT NEW COWBOYS,
MONASTERY WILL SELL CATTLE
At Assumption Abbey, a Benedictine monastery with a 1,900-acre ranch in the hills of western North Dakota, monks mix their days of prayer with cattle ranching. But with few younger monks feeling the calling, and aging monks no longer able to do strenuous work like baling hay and repairing fences, the abbey plans to sell off its entire herd. PAGE 13
SNOW DETERS PARK VISITORS
Temperatures have been colder than usual at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington, keeping record mounds of old snow lying around and discouraging everyone, from the most rigorous climbers to backpackers, hikers and Sunday drivers. The amount of snow on the ground is setting records, and the total number of visitors to the park is down more than 30 percent this year. PAGE 16

AN AFRICAN CHIEF
IN A CABBY'S CLOTHING
Isaac Osei, an immigrant from Ghana, keeps a frantic schedule running a New York taxi company -- making repairs, fighting parking tickets, getting taxis inspected. But his responsibilities don't end there. When Mr. Osei flies back to Ghana, he will become Nana Gyensare V, a chief of the Akwamu people, who oversees the residents of five towns across the Eastern Region. As a chief, he holds the hybrid responsibilities of a mayor and a royal. PAGE 20
SHOOTING IN IDYLLIC PARK
The area around Morningside Park in Upper Manhattan has in recent years attracted waves of young professionals, in part with the promise of a new Harlem. A shooting at the park tested the value of social media and public outrage in a neighborhood trying to break its bonds with a violent past. PAGE 21

EAGLES' SHOPPING SPREE

After N.F.L. owners decided in 2008 to opt out of the collective bargaining agreement, the Eagles realized the 2011 free-agency period could present an extraordinary buyer's market, picking up top-line players like DeSean Jackson, cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha and defensive lineman Jason Babin. PAGE 1
SCANDAL RATTLES A REFORMER
In the midst of a football scandal at Ohio State, the university president E. Gordon Gee has endured the most difficult stretch in three decades spent running some of the country's largest universities. His predicament raises questions such as what power, if any, college presidents hold over their athletic departments and whether anyone, Gee included, can actually enact change in major college sports.

HEADLINE: America's Economic Woes Cast a Pall On the Vice President's Talks in China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Over the winter, officials in China and the United States were trying to turn a new page in relations. In January, during a state visit to Washington by President Hu Jintao, leaders worked hard to dispel the rancor that had been slowly building. Soon after, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. committed to an earlier proposal to meet this summer with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, who is expected to succeed Mr. Hu next year.
But as Mr. Biden prepares to depart for China on Tuesday, a new uncertainty looms over relations. 
Chinese leaders are asking sharp questions about the strength of the American economy and American leadership, because of the government's struggle to meet its debt obligations and the partisan schisms and political paralysis that turned a problem into a crisis. Mr. Biden postponed his original departure date in July to help hammer out the agreement that forestalled default on some obligations but failed to avert a downgrade of America's AAA credit rating by Standard & Poor's. Xinhua, the state news agency, published a commentary demanding that the United States ''cure its addiction to debts'' and ''live within its means.''
The uncertainty about America goes straight to China's pockets: it holds more than $1.1 trillion in United States Treasury securities, making it the country's largest foreign creditor. Some ordinary Chinese have publicly criticized the Chinese leadership for investing so much in American government securities.
Europe's continuing sovereign debt miseries, the specter of a possible double-dip recession in the United States, and the turmoil in global markets last week have only heightened anxiety in China, whose economic growth depends to a large measure on its vast export sector.
Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Peking University, said he attended a meeting at the Ministry of Finance last week where officials were wringing their hands.
''The feeling of everyone was that the world economy has just suddenly become very unpredictable,'' he said. ''No one wants to see the U.S. economy keep going downhill and a new financial crisis. China and the U.S. are very important in keeping the global economy stable.''
As they get to know each other, Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi will no doubt discuss some of the security issues that have divided the two countries -- American arms sales to Taiwan, North Korea's nuclear program and tensions over the South China Sea. But the economic issues have moved to the fore.
''The primary purpose of the trip, which was planned before recent economic problems, was to build the relationship with Xi Jinping,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, who until April was the senior director for East Asian affairs on the National Security Council. ''Recent events in the economic sphere have undoubtedly put the U.S. economy and U.S. currency on the agenda.''
Da Wei, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, said, ''U.S. Treasury debt is the biggest concern since it's about the safety of China's financial investment.''
As in the United States, domestic troubles in China have been taking precedence over foreign relations. The efforts of Chinese leaders to maintain social stability have been challenged this summer by ethnic violence in the western region of Xinjiang and a remarkable surge of public criticism over the government's handling of a deadly high-speed rail crash in Zhejiang Province.
Perhaps most unsettling for the country's leaders is the creeping rise in the inflation rate; China's consumer price index went up 6.4 percent year-on-year in June, the steepest rise in three years. Analysts say average inflation for the year is certain to surpass the 4 percent benchmark Chinese leaders had set. Though it may be peaking, ''inflation is likely to remain the policy priority well into the fourth quarter,'' Alistair Thornton, a China analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a report last week.
Inflation puts China in much more of a policy bind if the West gets mired in another deep slump. In 2008, when the global financial crisis hit, China relied on stimulus spending and loose lending by state banks to pump up infrastructure building and other capital-intensive projects to maintain economic growth. Now, Chinese officials are concerned about rampant spending and are trying to tighten bank lending.
One point of tension between the United States and China has faded into the background in recent months: China's valuation of its currency. The Obama administration had long pushed China to appreciate its currency to correct trade imbalances and help restructure the world economy. The Chinese government was reluctant to do so, fearing the cost to exports. But an undervalued renminbi contributes to inflation, so China has been slowly letting the renminbi rise against the dollar.
The issue may also be losing some of its weight in American politics. The International Monetary Fund pointed out in a report last month that a stronger renminbi would not necessarily bolster job creation in the United States.
So instead of Mr. Biden pressing the Chinese on their currency, Chinese officials are likely to be pressing him about the stability of the dollar. All the while, they will be trying to gauge the strength of President Obama, having witnessed the difficulties he faced in persuading Republicans in Congress to raise the debt ceiling.
''It always encourages good behavior in China when they think they're dealing with a strong U.S. president,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council in the Clinton administration. ''It's hard to see how recent events would have created an impression that he's a strong leader.''

HEADLINE: Will the ECB Change Course?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Tight money is a really bad idea right now.

 BODY:
Just a quick note on the euro situation. The rescue operation to head off a self-fulfilling panic in Italy and Spain has succeeded, for now. But meanwhile the real economies continue to suffer; the latest is France, where growth has stalled.
What this means is that of the four big eurozone economies -- Germany, France, Italy, Spain -- three are now stalled with high unemployment. So why, exactly, did the ECB raise rates? This isn't even one-size-fits-all, it's one-size-fits-one.
Yes, inflation. But eurozone inflation looks just like US inflation: a bulge due to higher commodity prices that it already passing through the system, with clear indications that inflation will be back to low levels soon. And anyway, Europe really needs a somewhat higher inflation target than the United States to deal with its lack of labor market integration.
So will the ECB back down on its monetary tightening? There's a lot at stake here: a very fragile euro can't handle a trigger-happy central bank.

HEADLINE: Squeezing the South into Submission

BYLINE: MICHAEL O. VARHOLA


HIGHLIGHT: The Union blockade of Southern ports, derided at first, had immediate consequences for Confederate civilians and soldiers alike.

 BODY:
Though the Union army was still getting its war footing, by August 1861 the Northern blockade of Southern ports and waterways was almost complete. That month federal ships closed the Mississippi River to commerce between loyal and secessionist states, while naval squadrons were in place off the coast of most Southern cities, from south Texas to the Chesapeake. President Lincoln had approved the blockade, known as the "Anaconda Plan," in April. At first it was widely derided in the North and dismissed in the South-the American navy, people said, was in no shape to clamp down on thousands and thousands of miles of coastline. Nevertheless, this massive operation had an immediate impact on the Confederate economy and, as it tightened its grip on the Southern coastline, began to choke the South into submission. 
That is not to say that the blockade was perfect; in fact, scholars since have pointed to the seemingly large number of blockade runners who managed to slip past the Union ships. But the relevant data point is not how many ships evaded capture, but how many ships never sailed that, undeterred, otherwise would have. From that point of view, the blockade was an unimpeachable success: blockade runners only accounted for about five percent of the regular incoming and outbound trade that would have otherwise been conducted.
Moreover, these were commercial ventures, unguided by some overarching strategy in Richmond. Not surprisingly, they were disproportionately concerned with the importation of luxury goods, which were much more valuable by volume than commodities but which did little to actually support the Southern war effort. And the South desperately needed commodities, particularly foodstuffs: while the South had an agricultural economy, most of what it grew were cash crops like cotton and tobacco, and it imported great quantities of food from both the northern United States and overseas. 
"From the beginning, the blockade reduced food imports into the South," writes the historian Andrew F. Smith in Starving the South: How the North Won the Civil War. "Coffee, tea, spices, and wine quickly became difficult to acquire. More important losses from a nutritional standpoint were apples and dairy products, such as butter and cheese, which had been imported from New England; citrus fruits, dates, pineapples, and vegetables, which had been imported from Bermuda and the Caribbean Islands became scarce, as did salt which had been mainly imported from abroad before the war." With the halt of trade between the two halves of the country via the Mississippi, the South also lost its imports of grain from the Midwest. 
Southerners also depended on external trade to provide most of their manufactured goods, including ones made from raw materials they produced. While the South grew more cotton than any other region in the world at the start of the Civil War, there were single towns in New England that produced more cloth in their mills than all those of the Confederacy combined. 
But it was the loss of salt - most of it brought from Wales as ballast in ships - that perhaps most profoundly affected the South, because it was so critical in the preservation of food, particularly meat. Without adequate supplies of salt, Southern pork and beef could not be preserved and then sent from the areas where it was produced to the places where it was needed - particularly cities and wherever the rebel armies were located. The Confederate government encouraged domestic salt production but, despite some dramatic local successes, this never came anywhere near to meeting the South's civil or military needs. 
"The obtaining of salt became extremely difficult when the war had cut off our supply," wrote the Alabama native Parthenia Antoinette Hague of her wartime experiences: 
This was true especially in regions remote from the seacoast and border states, such as the interior of Alabama and Georgia. Here again we were obliged to have recourse to whatever expedient ingenuity suggested. All the brine left in troughs and barrels, where pork had been salted down, was carefully dipped up, boiled down, and converted into salt again. In some cases the salty soil under old smokehouses was dug up and placed in hoppers, which resembled backwoods ash-hoppers.
While the blockade precipitated increasingly severe and widespread shortages throughout the South, numerous other factors exacerbated their effects: the diversion of resources to the Confederate armies; the decrease in food production caused by so many able-bodied men being put under arms; wastage in areas exposed to combat; deliberate destruction of agricultural production by Union forces in occupied regions and coastal areas; reduced production caused by the flight or liberation of plantation slaves; the migration of refugees, many of whom had previously been involved in food production, from occupied zones into urban areas; and the degradation of the Southern railroad system. 
Indeed, the blockade of Southern ports did not just shut down trade with third parties, it also curtailed coastal trade within the Confederacy itself and made such commerce dependent on other modes of transportation, primarily the railroads. Even as more strain was being placed upon the rail system, however, the non-industrialized South was less and less able to adequately maintain or repair them. 
The 10 percent of Southerners who lived in urban areas were the first and most severely affected by shortages, and actual starvation threatened the populations of cities like New Orleans by midsummer 1861. Rural folk of all economic levels, black and white, were at least able to fall back on subsistence farming (though everyone was subject to being shaken down by commissaries collecting foodstuffs for the armies in the field). 
The Confederate government did try to encourage plantation owners to curtail cotton production and shift over to food crops. While it had some limited success in this endeavor, the nature of the secessionist government, with its states' rights-centered constitution, was such that it did not force the issue, and most planters followed what they thought was still the path to profit and continued to grow cotton. 
Aside from the effects of war and the blockade, Southerners also had to contend with maldistribution. In fact, throughout the conflict the South produced enough food for its civilians and soldiers, but it found it increasingly difficult to preserve surpluses and in move them to areas of scarcity. Besides the preservation problem, interdiction of coastal traffic also meant that transportation of goods depended on the South's rickety railroad system, which was never adequate to the demands placed upon it. Confederate armies, at the far end of the supply lines, were nearly always short of food and materiel, especially as the war progressed. 
Shortages led to inflation and, as the price of foodstuffs spiked, buying power steadily decreased, by about a sixth during the first year of the conflict. Increases in prices were especially marked in areas close to the front lines,where food distribution was directly affected by the fighting. A typical Southern family's food bill was $6.65 per month at the time of secession, $68 per month in 1863, and $400 per month in 1864. Indeed, by the spring of 1863, prices for food and dry goods were going up about 10 percent a month. Butter that cost 20 cents a pound when secession was declared commanded seven times as much a year later - and up to 100 times as much in some locales, if it was available at all, during the last year of the war. Untenable prices led to outbursts of civil unrest and incidents, ranging from the looting of supply trains to bread riots in Richmond and other Southern cities. 
Before the first summer of the war was over, Southerners had already begun to suffer the effects of shortages imposed by the conflict. Few could conceive, however, just how severe the privations they would ultimately have to endure would become in the months and long years that followed.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cap Tales

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo points to Massachusetts as a success story in tax caps, but the state offers cautionary examples, too.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had a remarkable legislative rookie season. He pushed through same-sex marriage, ethics reform and a 2 percent property tax cap. The cap got the least attention downstate (it does not apply in New York City) but could forever rework the face of town and city finances in the rest of the state.
 And that could prove quite damaging.
The governor often points to Massachusetts, which enacted a 2.5 percent property tax cap nearly three decades ago. This state offers an island of stability in a recession-tossed sea.
"It's not how much you spend, it's what you achieve," Mr. Cuomo told Utica residents in a meeting I attended last May.
On the screen overhead his Power Point presentation showed Massachusetts (once known as Taxachussets) dropping to the 23rd most heavily taxed state in the nation from the second. And yet the state is the nation's leader in test scores.
So cool.
Or not. 
Massachusetts legislators counter-balanced tax caps with a sharp increase in aid to towns and cities, a step Mr. Cuomo rejected.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston authored a series of studies of the caps that raises many troubling questions. Its studies suggest caps have exacerbated wealth inequality, no small matter given New York's deep divide between rich and poor.
In 2009, a Reserve Bank economist looked at what happened when residents voted to override the caps and impose higher taxes. Of 1,180 override attempts since 2000, 51 percent passed, most often in well-to-do towns.
"When override ballot questions fail to pass, however, municipalities are left with budget shortfalls causing cuts in public services, school programs, public workers, and the like," the Fed study found.
An earlier 1997 Federal Reserve study by a trio of prominent economists looked at housing prices in Massachusetts. Home values rose fastest in well-to-do towns where residents could afford to override the property caps and services remained intact.
A year later, these economists studied the effect of tax caps on school budgets and enrollment. Again, there was that rich town/poor town chasm. "Families with children appear to be 'voting with their feet', moving out of communities that have run up against their tax limits," the authors found.
Predictions are risky business in public policy. But the Massachusetts experience offers many cautionary tales for New York's experiment with property tax caps.
Shocked! At Toll Hikes
The practice of politics, not unlike the frequent ingestion of hallucinogens, can leave practitioners sounding as if they are at direct variance with observable reality.
So when news broke a week ago that the Port Authority would propose $4 toll increases on Hudson River bridges and tunnels, reporters sought comment Governors Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie (New York and New Jersey, respectively).
It was as if both men were auditioning for the role of Captain Renault in the classic film "Casablanca." They were shocked, SHOCKED, to hear talk of toll hikes.
So Governor Christie: "You are kidding, right?"
So Governor Cuomo: "I think the proposal is a nonstarter for obvious reasons."
Of late Mr. Cuomo has grumbled -- "There appears to be long-term problems at the authority" -- in a fashion that suggests the Port Authority executive director, Chris Ward, might want to fire up his resume.
Yet none of this can be taken at face value.
Governor Cuomo appoints six members of the Port Authority Board and Governor Christie appoints the other six. (Gov. Cuomo has so far appointed just two of his six potential representatives). Unless we assume these men are incompetents (not likely) or easy-going, hands-off sorts (vastly, highly, absurdly unlikely), we have to assume that they knew a toll increase proposal was coming. (My colleague Michael Grynbaum reported this out rather definitively).
Then again, political reality is often fungible. Three months after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took office in 1993, the police department released data showing crime had dropped sharply. The new mayor released this news late on a Friday, without comment. Why? Because his aides knew credit for a crime drop so early in his administration should be given to his predecessor, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
When crime dropped again that June, Mr. Giuliani, with no discernible giggle, dropped his previous disclaimer. He took credit for the entire six-month drop in crime. And his crime-fighting reputation was minted. (Unfortunately, few reporters took note of the cognitive dissonance.)
A final point: Skeptical eyes should examine the Port Authority's books, but keeping a megalopolis moving is expensive. Money is needed to replace the 80-year-old suspension cables on the George Washington Bridge, to rebuild a Port Authority bus station that regularly takes its place among the homeliest structures designed by man, and to construct a new World Trade Center.
Our governors proclaim compassion for hard-pressed toll payers even as they too stick their fingers in the Port Authority's honey pot. Mr. Christie's fingers are particularly sticky, as he claims a billion or two to repair, expand and otherwise tend his state's highways.

HEADLINE: Little or Nothing

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: This is a grand policy debate?

 BODY:
Calculated Risk says it perfectly: this report in the Times on economic debate within the White House shows a fierce argument between those who want to do very little on jobs and those who want to do nothing at all.
If the report is at all correct, this Grand Debate [/sarcasm] isn't just about political strategy:
A series of departures has left few economists among Mr. Obama's senior advisers. Several of his political advisers are skeptical about the merits of stimulus spending, and they are certain about the politics: voters do not like it.
Mr. Plouffe and Mr. Daley share the view that a focus on deficit reduction is an economic and political imperative, according to people who have spoken with them. Voters believe that paying down the debt will help the economy, and the White House agrees, although it wants to avoid cutting too much spending while the economy remains weak. 
Plouffe and Daley, macroeconomic theorists! (And no, that's not rank-pulling; it's not about credentials, it's whether these men have actually put in the kind of homework that would qualify them to oppose what amounts to standard textbook macro).
And as for the political side, I guess I'm puzzled: you have an obstructionist GOP, and rather than point out that obstruction, you restrict yourself to calling for measures that this obstructionist opposition might actually accept. Doesn't this mean that voters learn nothing about the extent to which the GOP is in fact blocking job creation? 
Mark Thoma notes something else: the administration's vision of what to do with a second term still doesn't include job creation, it's all about more Grand Bargain deficit reduction. As he says,
The best thing the administration can do is abandon support for struggling households now so Obama can get reelected and reduce social insurance programs that help struggling households?
It all makes me think of an 80s-era joke about centrist Democrats, which was that their big difference from Republicans was compassion: the Democrats about the victims of their policies.
OK, to be fair, an Obama second term would be a lot less hard on working Americans than, say, the Texasification of America that would take place under Rick Perry. But "not as vicious as the GOP" isn't exactly a stirring slogan.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Drops Out of Republican Race

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: After a disappointing third-place showing in the Iowa straw poll, Mr. Pawlenty acknowledged that he had decided overnight that his candidacy could not proceed.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, dropped his bid for the Republican nomination for president on Sunday morning, saying his disappointing performance in Iowa's straw poll convinced him that his campaign had run its course.
Just hours after his third-place finish in Iowa, Mr. Pawlentysaid on ABC's "This Week" program that his message "didn't get the kind of traction we needed and hoped for" in order to continue.
"There are a lot of other choices in the race," he said. "The audience, so to speak, was looking for something different."
Mr. Pawlenty informed his supporters on a conference call Sunday morning before his television appearance that he is ending his candidacy. He thanked his supporters in the call, two participants said, but acknowledged that he had decided overnight that his candidacy could not proceed. 
Mr. Pawlenty, who had been weighing a presidential campaign for years, had developed a robust plan to win the Republican nomination. But his strategy did not take into account the rising popularity of a fellow Minnesotan, Representative Michele Bachmann, whose candidacy had overshadowed Mr. Pawlenty's. He had staked his entire campaign around a strong finish at the Iowa straw poll, which he did not achieve.
Mrs. Bachmann won the poll, edging Representative Ron Paul of Texas. Mr. Pawlenty was a distant third.
It was a sudden end to the presidential candidacy of a former two-term governor, who had once talked about bypassing the straw poll. But a poor showing at a debate two months ago made him change his mind, associates said, and left him no choice but to throw everything into the straw poll.
On "This Week," Mr. Pawlenty said he would probably endorse one of his former rivals eventually, but he declined to do so Sunday morning. Asked what he thought of Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Pawlenty said she would be "tested" through the nomination process.
"I think she's qualified," he said. "She's going to have to make her case."
Speaking moments later on the same program, Mrs. Bachmann praised Mr. Pawlenty but said that the message from her victory in the straw poll was that voters are looking for "someone authentic" like her.
"I'm talking about what people really care about," she told Jake Tapper, the host of the ABC program. "You saw a big message sent to Washington. They really want someone they can trust and can believe in."
Mr. Pawlenty first became a national figure four years ago as a finalist to become the vice presidential nominee for Senator John McCain of Arizona. That job eventually went to Sarah Palin, the governor from Alaska.
Four years later, Mr. Pawlenty became the first major Republican to announce a presidential bid. He quickly assembled a campaign staff that included top operatives and experienced donors. He began traveling to neighboring Iowa.
Asked whether he would consider being a vice presidential candidate in 2012, Mr. Pawlenty said he would not.
"I've been down that road before," he said. "That's not something I'm going to consider."
In months of campaigning through Iowa, Mr. Pawlenty had presented himself as a can-do governor whose experience as the chief executive of Minnesota for eight years would make him a good president.
"We need somebody who is a tested, proven leader with results who can fix the country and get it back on track boldly and quickly. That's what I did in Minnesota. That's what I'll do for the country," he said during a stop recently in Grinnell, Iowa.
Mr. Pawlenty also increasingly took aim at President Obama, describing the state of the country in gloomy ways and blaming Mr. Obama for failing to do what was necessary to turn the nation's economy around. He made that case in television ads, airing four ads ahead of the straw poll and spending nearly $1 million.
But Mr. Pawlenty made his first big mistake during a debate in New Hampshire in June. After coining the term "Obamneycare" before the debate, he declined on the stage to go on the attack with his rival, Mitt Romney, standing on the stage.
That was viewed by donors and activists as a missed opportunity to stand up to his leading Republican rival. Raising money, which had always been difficult for the campaign, became tougher after that.
The biggest challenge for Mr. Pawlenty came as Mrs. Bachmann's campaign picked up steam. Mr. Pawlenty's strategy had been built around a strong finish in Iowa, and the straw poll became a way to prove to reluctant donors and supporters that the strategy was still sound.
In the Fox debate this week, two days before the straw poll, Mr. Pawlenty took direct aim at Mrs. Bachmann, hoping to dent her momentum in Iowa.
"Her record of accomplishment and results is nonexistent. That's not going to be good enough," he said during the debate. "The American people are going to expect more and demand more."
But Mrs. Bachmann deftly handled the attacks, accusing Mr. Pawlenty of holding positions that sound "a lot more like Barack Obama, if you ask me."
The exchange clearly benefited Mrs. Bachmann more than it did Mr. Pawlenty, who received less than half of her votes in the straw poll. In the end, Mr. Pawlenty concluded that he could not continue.
"It was disappointing," he said. Asked about the candidates remaining, Mr. Pawlenty added: "They are going to be tested. As you know, its a big bright light that comes down on you. And we'll see."

HEADLINE: Bachmann Faces Tough Questions on Sunday Shows

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Appearing on all five Sunday morning talk shows, Mrs. Bachmann was peppered with questions about her opposition to raising the debt ceiling, her views about gays and lesbians, and the role that faith would play in a Bachmann administration.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Michele Bachmann quickly became the target of fresh scrutiny Sunday morning as her victory in the Iowa straw poll propelled her into the top tier of a rapidly evolving Republican presidential contest.
Appearing on all five Sunday morning talk shows, Mrs. Bachmann was peppered with questions about her opposition to raising the debt ceiling, her views about gays and lesbians, and the role that faith would play in a Bachmann administration.
"All of these kind of questions aren't what people are concerned about right now," Mrs. Bachmann complained on NBC's "Meet the Press. But pressed on the issues, Mrs. Bachmann said, "I think my views are clear."
The tough questioning of Mrs. Bachmann came even as news broke that Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is dropping out of the presidential campaign and a day after Rick Perry, the Texas governor, formally entered the race. 
The rapid-fire developments are helping to push the Republican race toward a three-way contest between Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Perry and Mitt Romney ahead of a busy post-Labor Day period. There are four nationally-televised debates scheduled for September alone.
But even before then, the Republican campaign for the White House is accelerating quickly. Mrs. Bachmann and Mr Perry are set to appear at the same Republican fund-raiser Sunday night in Waterloo, Iowa, Mrs. Bachmann's hometown.
The prospect of the two candidates crossing paths so quickly has injected a new sense of urgency on the campaign trail even as the candidates look toward the first voting that will take place in Iowa and New Hampshire early next year.
Mrs. Bachmann did not comment directly on Mr. Perry Sunday morning, but cited her own experience in Washington as something that voters would continue to find appealing.
"Well, I think what I offer to the voters is what they have seen already. I'm a very proven, effective advocate in Washington, D.C. and against the issues people really care about it," she said on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "I've been on the front lines."
In her appearances on the talk shows, Mrs. Bachmann defended her positions on how to ramp up the nation's economic activity and repeated her criticisms of President Obama's policies.
"I've been at the tip of the spear and a champion for what people are calling for," Mrs. Bachmann said on NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday morning. "It's President Obama who failed to put any plan forward. Thats' what led to the uncertainty."
Mrs. Bachmann was repeatedly questioned about her opposition to raising the debt ceiling. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace noted that "talk from you and others about not raising the credit limit and the political gridlock was one of the reasons that they downgraded the debt."
Mrs. Bachmann responded by blaming Mr. Obama for the downgrade, saying that legislation could have been passed to avoid a default even if the debt ceiling was not raised.
"I introduced a plan to ensure that the United States sovereignty would not default. That's important," she told Mr. Wallace. "No wonder the markets would be roiled if we didn't have a plan. I had one, unlike President Obama."
The hosts of the shows also pressed Mrs. Bachmann on past statements about social issues.
On ABC's "This Week," Mrs. Bachmann was asked about a statement she made in 2006 that being gay was the equivalent of "personal bondage, personal despair, and personal enslavement."
Mrs. Bachmann declined to say whether she still believed those words, saying only that "I am not running to be any person's judge. And I give -- I ascribe dignity and honor to all people, no matter who they are. And that's how I view people."
On "Meet the Press," she gave a similar answer to the same question.
"I don't judge them. I don't judge them," she told host David Gregory. "I'm running for the presidency of the United States."
Mrs. Bachmann would not respond to questions about whether she would appoint a gay or lesbian person to her administration or as a judge, saying only that her criteria would be whether that person had a commitment to the Constitution, were competent, and shared her views.
"That's all I can tell you. I'm not judging," she said on NBC.
Asked about whether she could work with a highly divided Congress if she were elected president, Mrs. Bachmann said that her campaign appeals to Democrats and "apolitical" voters as well as the conservatives that turned out at the Iowa straw poll.
But she declined to offer a specific example of where she had worked to compromise with Democrats to advance legislation.
"Well, I'm trying to think of one right now that would be a compromise. There has been -- on big issues I don't compromise," she said on CNN. "I don't compromise my core sense of principles. But I've taken thousands of votes in Congress. And I'm sure that there's areas where the bills aren't perfect, but you vote for them."

HEADLINE: Obama Shifts Gears From Coaxing G.O.P. to Swaying the Public

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: After rocky budget talks and an economic downgrade, the president shifts his strategy away from coaxing Republican leaders.

 BODY:
CANNON FALLS, Minn. - House Speaker John A. Boehner once explained conservatives' hard line on the debt limit this way: "A lot of them," he told a radio host, believe "enough chaos" would make opponents yield.
Chaos arrived in financial markets last week after Standard & Poor's, citing Washington gridlock, stripped the United States of its AAA credit rating.
Whoever ultimately gains political advantage, the events of the last few weeks have opened a new phase of President Obama's fight to advance his agenda and win a second term.
Ever since Democrats lost the House in midterm elections last year, the president has vacillated between conciliation and confrontation with ascendant Republicans.

He struck a lame-duck deal with Mr. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, after the 2010 election to extend the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. He assailed the budget overhaul proposed by Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Then, under threat from House Republicans who would not raise the government's borrowing cap, he retreated to private negotiations on a "grand bargain" to reduce the budget deficit.
But the failure of those talks and the deterioration of the country's economic outlook have unsettled Mr. Obama and are now altering his approach.
He still wants Congress to pass stimulus and deficit reduction measures that his economic team is preparing to unveil as early as this month. But his strategy no longer turns on coaxing Republican leaders.
It turns, instead, on his ability to leverage public opinion through events like the town hall-style meeting planned for Monday here, kicking off his Midwestern bus tour. If he cannot apply enough public pressure to move Congress, he will try to move 2012 voters to give him a mandate.
Test for White House
White House aides saw the shift after handing the president his speech for last week's appearance at a factory in Michigan, as economic advisers monitored post-downgrade gyrations on Wall Street and the full-blown debt crisis in Europe.
Mr. Obama thought the draft speech was too soft on the Republicans - and so he personally sharpened it. The result: a famously "cool" president delivered the hottest rhetoric of his tenure, blistering opponents for refusing "to put the country ahead of party" because they would "rather see their opponents lose than see America win."
His effectiveness will be tested when Congress returns in September to consider his ideas for reversing recent economic setbacks that have freshly alarmed consumers, investors, the White House and the Federal Reserve. The global economy appears stuck in what Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond investment firm Pimco, calls "a damaging feedback loop" of eroding circumstances, slow government action and market volatility.
In addition to extending the current payroll tax cut for employees, Mr. Obama's economic team is considering extending that cut to employers - doubling the $100 billion annual cost. In addition to a $50 billion infrastructure bank and a $45 billion extension of unemployment benefits, the administration is considering seeking a $75 billion tax break for companies hiring new workers.
Those steps would steepen the path for a special Congressional committee, created as part of the compromise over raising the debt ceiling, which seeks at least $1.2 trillion in new deficit reduction this fall. The White House is mulling whether to advance Mr. Obama's deficit-reduction recommendations for that panel separately, or in an integrated package with job creation ideas.
Expectations remain low for anything beyond least-common-denominator accords - unless economic conditions and public pressure shift the political facts on the ground. At this point, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner said, the House has "no plans to take up" the president's job creation ideas except for patent reform and pending trade deals.
The Deal-Averse
In 21st-century political culture, the presidential bully pulpit is far less powerful than it used to be.
Moreover, Republicans have a simple and powerful story to tell about Mr. Obama's bottom line: 9.1 percent unemployment, economic growth below a 1 percent annual rate for the first half of 2011, trillion-dollar budget deficits. Mr. Obama's explanations can offset, but not erase, an incumbent's responsibility for results.
The compromise-averse House Republicans who share power with him have suffered blows, too - in the polls from independent voters, in private complaints from business leaders, in public warnings from veteran Republican politicians, pundits and intellectuals. The party's accelerating 2012 nomination race may not help.
In the Iowa straw poll over the weekend, a candidate who opposes raising the country's debt limit under any circumstances (Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota) edged out a candidate who supports abolishing the Federal Reserve (Representative Ron Paul of Texas). Every Republican candidate in a debate before the straw poll pledged to oppose any tax increase - even if paired with spending cuts 10 times as big.
That leaves even some of Mr. Obama's fiercest critics helping him make the public argument he will sound again on this week's bus tour.
"If taxes cannot be raised under any circumstances, then we have veered from economic policy to religious catechism," Peter Wehner, a former deputy to Karl Rove in Mr. Bush's White House, wrote for Commentary.
He continued, "There is something amiss when the political pressure in a party, any party, is so intense that it prevents a serious intellectual conversation from even taking place."

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Bachmann and Perry Cross Paths but Don't Meet

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The two Republican candidates appeared at the same event in Waterloo, but they did not acknowledge each others' presence.

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Iowa - Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann had an opportunity for their first face-to-face encounter of the 2012 presidential campaign just a day after Mr. Perry entered the race and Mrs. Bachmann won its first high-profile contest, the Ames straw poll.
But they missed it.
The two appeared at the Electric Park Ballroom in this small town in northeastern Iowa where Mrs. Bachmann was born. The event drew dozens of national reporters eager for any interaction between the two candidates.
But Mrs. Bachmann did not arrive until after Mr. Perry was finished speaking. And Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, slipped out a side entrance as Mrs. Bachmann signed T-shirts. The two never acknowledged each others' presence, leaving for another day the direct confrontations that are sure to come.
Mr. Perry spoke first, but made no reference to his rival. Unlike Tim Pawlenty, who attacked Mrs. Bachmann's qualifications at Thursday night's debate, Mr. Perry chose to send a more subtle message: making his first Iowa appearance in her hometown but not taking her on directly.
During her remarks, Mrs. Bachmann made no reference to her rival even as he sat at a dinner table just feet from where she stood. Mr. Perry applauded politely when Mrs. Bachmann criticized Mr. Obama, but otherwise sat quietly during her speech.
Ed Rollins, the campaign manager for Mrs. Bachmann, said after the event that "the debate will be there" soon enough.
"We've got three to four debates in September," Mr. Rollins said. "We will all be on the same stage and everybody gets to make their judgments."
The site of the event Sunday night was a historic ballroom, where a mirrored ball and neon lights have long welcomed big bands, boxing matches and old-time movies.
In his remarks, Mr. Perry lashed out at President Obama's administration, saying that jobs and debt are the two most important issues facing the country.
"We are in economic turmoil," Mr. Perry said. "And if we don't have a president of the United States who gets the country working again we are in trouble."
Mr. Perry described what he said were four principles to make the economy flourish. No. 1, he said, is "don't spend all the money" in Washington.
"We've got to have courage to walk in to Washington, D.C., and say, folks, we are not spending that amount of money," he said to applause. "The president of the United States has a pen. It's called a veto pen. And I will use it until the ink runs out if that's what it takes."
Mr. Perry aligned himself with members of the Tea Party, saying that "we are not angry, we are indignant."
"We're indignant about a government that borrows trillions of dollars because they don't have the courage to say no," he said. But he added: "With your help, we will make sure that America is again the last great hope of mankind."
When he was finished, Mrs. Bachmann told the crowd of several hundred that she wanted to say "thank you" for her victory in the straw poll.
"Yesterday, together, we sent that message to Washington, didn't we," she said. "We sent a message to Washington that Barack Obama's time is extremely limited and that 2012 can't come soon enough."
Mrs. Bachmann repeated many of the lines she used on the stump during nearly 50 days campaigning for the straw poll. She defended the Tea Party movement against criticism from Democrats that it is too extreme when it comes to fiscal matters.
"The Tea Party party has been the best antidote to the out of control spending that we have seen," she said "Instead of dissing the Tea Party we should be praising the Tea Party."
In her remarks, Mrs. Bachmann said that voters should trust her to go to Washington as their voice, carrying messages of lower taxes, conservative values and a demand to get rid of the nation's debt.
"The poison water of Washington didn't change me," she said. I went there and I fought. I fought when it wasn't convenient."
At the end of her appearance, Mrs. Bachmann suddenly produced an apple pie that she said she wanted to give away to the "oldest Republican woman" in the crowd. A 100-year-old woman raised her hand.
"A winner!" Mrs. Bachmann said.
Sunday night's appearance for Mr. Perry is the continuation of a tour that will take the governor through Iowa Monday and Tuesday, back to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Thursday, and then to South Carolina again on Friday and Saturday.
Mark Miner, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, declined to say when the governor would engage Mr. Romney or Mrs. Bachmann directly in an effort to draw distinctions among them.
"The governor is going to focus on his vision for the country and his record," Mr. Miner said. Echoing the motto painted on the side of Mr. Perry's new campaign bus, he added: "He's going to focus on what his vision is to get America working again."
In a brief news conference with reporters after her speech, Mrs. Bachmann said she did not interact with her rival because of a full day that included a trip for a family visit in Waterloo.
But, she added, "We welcome Governor Perry to the race."

HEADLINE: Cheap Robots vs. Cheap Labor

 BODY:
Workers in China's export heartland of Guangdong make $200 a month assembling the consumer goods Americans hold so dear. In Jiangsu, they make $175. It seems that isn't cheap enough. 
Terry Gou, the founder and chairman of Foxconn, which employs one million workers in China making Apple iPads, H.P. computers and other electronic devices, announced at a company party in Shenzen last month that he would deploy a million robots at his plants by 2013 to do much of the labor currently performed by human hands.
It's not only Foxconn complaining about expensive labor. Many companies have moved away from export hubs in coastal areas to regions like Chongqing, where workers are paid $135 a month. Others are going farther. Yue Yuen, the world's biggest shoe maker, is setting up shop in Cambodia and Bangladesh.
Foxconn said it wants employees to move ''higher up the value chain.'' Certainly, moving up the technology ladder drives economic development. The tractor and other farming inventions pushed millions of Americans off the farms. Computers displaced clerical workers. These breakthroughs created better-paid jobs for educated workers. But it's unsettling to see cutting-edge labor-saving technologies deployed in a country where jobs must be found for some 300 million Chinese who live off the land.
Wages are rising, with salaries of many factory workers in China going up 20 percent to 30 percent annually. But that's mainly because the new manufacturing jobs are far from where the underemployed farmers live. And the Chinese government doesn't make it easy for workers to move from where they live to where they are wanted.
Even with this kind of wage pressure, pay is still very low. A Department of Labor study estimated that manufacturing workers in China earned $1.36 an hour in 2008 -- about 4 percent of what an American worker made and less than wages in Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines and even India.
It's hard to believe that hundreds of millions of Chinese can move quickly up the economy's ''value chain'' to become tomorrow's nurses and engineers. In the meantime, as robots take over more work, the millions trapped in the countryside will have even fewer opportunities.

HEADLINE: Flash-Sale Site Shifts Its Model

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
On a recent day on Gilt.com, shoppers could buy 10 round-trip tickets on Virgin America for $3,585, three sessions of laser hair-removal for $352 or eight Alaskan king salmon fillets for $118.95.
That's a reflection of how the Gilt Groupe, which made online flash sales of women's clothes popular in the United States, is trying to refashion itself as a high-end Amazon.com -- a one-stop shop for luxury goods, half of which it says will be full-price within a few years.
Kevin Ryan, Gilt's chief executive, said the company was simply repositioning as ''a broader lifestyle brand, all high-end,'' adding, ''Whether it's full-price or discount is a detail.'' But others say the effort reveals that the much-heralded flash-sale business is hitting its limits.
''The whole raison d'etre of this flash-sale business is that it was highly lucrative,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research. ''That didn't turn out to be a reality.'' 
Gilt was at the forefront of flash-sale sites, which sell brands' excess inventory at deep discounts for a limited period of time, an idea modeled on France's Vente-privee.com. Most of the sites took off in 2009, when even wealthy people severely slashed their spending. They solved a range of e-commerce business problems, particularly the risk of buying inventory upfront, because flash-sale sites generally buy on consignment.
Also, because the sales are time-sensitive, sites have an excuse to e-mail customers every day and customers are less likely to abandon their online shopping carts because they are shopping against the clock.
But in the United States, unlike in Europe where flash sales began, the competition is overwhelmingly steep, not only from similar sites like HauteLook and ideeli, but also from discount stores like Ross and T.J. Maxx and department store outlets like those of Nordstrom and Barneys.
Compounding flash-sale sites' problems, manufacturers have cut back on production since the depths of the recession so there is less inventory available. And even as the economy sours again, sales of full-price luxury goods are booming.
Analysts said that if stocks continue to tumble, consumers might cut back on spending yet again, which would be a boon for flash-sale sites. In July, visits to flash-sale sites were double what they were a year ago, according to the research firm Hitwise.
''If the market flattens out and stays there and doesn't recover somewhat within two and a half weeks, consumers will change their behavior,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for apparel at the NPD Group. ''Flash-sale sites are going to market it as: 'Why worry about the stock market? You can still indulge guilt-free.' ''
In the meantime, Gilt is resorting to traditional models.
Last Monday, Gilt introduced a full-price men's clothing site, Park & Bond, that breaks entirely with the flash-sale model. Items on Park & Bond are in-season, available all the time and not discounted. Gilt also has a full-price food site as well as sites for travel, gifts, furniture and decor, children's clothes and accessories and local business deals.
''They're doing what was the whole danger of the retail business in the first place -- investing in inventory -- and that's the part that's a little unintuitive here,'' Ms. Mulpuru said. ''I wouldn't say it smacks of desperation, but it's definitely an attempt to figure out how they can pivot and change their business model because the first one didn't work out as they planned.''
Mr. Ryan said that Gilt's flash-sale sites continue to be successful. Gilt, three-and-a-half years old, brought in $500 million in gross revenue last year. ''It's impossible to say that this has not grown very quickly in a very short period of time,'' he said. Inventory fluctuates, he said, but there is enough available for Gilt to host 30 sales a day.
Rather than a sign of problems with the business, he said, the move to full-price is ''an opportunity to sell more things to the same person.'' Though flash sales have less inventory risk and the marketing costs are lower because people visit each day, full-price commerce has higher profit margins and Gilt does not have to create a new Web site each day, he said.
Still, most of the flash-sale sites remain, like Gilt, unprofitable, analysts say, and many have also tried to grow by expanding into new areas, though not into full-price commerce. Rue La La and ideeli, for instance, have branched into children's apparel, travel and local deals, but have rarely sold full-price items.
Gilt, which analysts expect will soon join the wave of Web companies going public, is valued at $1 billion by venture capitalists who have invested $240 million in it. It has 800 employees. But it is still a minnow compared with Amazon and its department-store rivals, and its upper management ranks have been shaken as people have left the company.
Still, Gilt and other flash-sale sites have become formidable competitors for department stores.
Shoppers say they shop less at traditional retailers because they shop more on flash-sale sites, according to Forrester's consumer research. Gilt attracted 946,000 visitors to its Web site in June, just behind Bloomingdales.com with 982,000 visitors and significantly more than Barneys's 198,000 and Saks Fifth Avenue's 779,000.
Now Gilt wants to make the site more welcoming to men. Its three-year-old men's flash-sale business was already $100 million in 2010, half the size of its women's business, which is a bigger ratio than at most retailers.
''Go to Saks.com or BergdorfGoodman.com and what greets me on the home page?'' Mr. Ryan said. ''It's two women in dresses. That's not my site.''
Gilt is about to find out how well it can compete with those stores. The new men's site, which started with 100 brands, is the first time that Gilt has sold apparel that is available elsewhere for the same price.
Men tend to shop less for entertainment and more for specific needs, said Tyler Thoreson, head of men's editorial and creative at Gilt, so flash sales do not cater as well to them. Instead, they want to be outfitted for an occasion, whether it's a summer wedding or a work presentation, and they want advice.
Park & Bond has a big editorial component, a mash-up of an e-commerce site and a men's magazine.
There are how-to pieces that cover ''the core skills any guy needs to have,'' Mr. Thoreson said, like how to perfect a tie dimple, and profiles of ''men of style.'' Unlike e-commerce sites that show pages of products in grids, Gilt posed models on the streets of New York, and photo guides show how to pull off trends like ''plaid on plaid on plaid'' (blazer, shirt and kerchief). The articles and photos all link to items to buy.
Park & Bond plans to send three e-mails a week to customers who sign up, said John Auerbach, its president.
''With flash sales, you do have that benefit that you're in somebody's in-box everyday, and you do have that data you collect from being a members-only site,'' he said. ''This is more traditional e-commerce.''

HEADLINE: The Limitations on Central Banks

BYLINE: By IAN CAMPBELL

 BODY:
If the first fear is global recession, the second is that central banks have run out of fixes. They do have means to respond, but only with radical and possibly dangerous policies whose efficacy is dubious. These nuclear monetary weapons might be better kept locked away.
Printing money -- or quantitative easing -- has always been seen as the last resort. Now, it seems to be the only option. It has various manifestations, and recent weeks have shown some of its limitations. 
The Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan tried to reverse the appreciation of their respective currencies by increasing liquidity to banks and striving for still lower short-term interest rates. Japan also intervened directly in the currency market by selling yen. But it remains close to its peak, and the Swiss franc has pushed on to new highs. This type of involvement has not proved effective.
The European Central Bank has shunned Q.E. outright. Being bold has meant buying euro zone government debt in the secondary market, while neutralizing the monetary effect by sucking in bank deposits. This big gun has worked. Yields on 10-year Italian and Spanish government debt have tumbled by over one percentage point.
The question for the central bank is whether it should go further by buying large amounts of euro zone sovereign debt without any offsetting moves that take money out of the system. This might seem an easy solution to the region's debt crisis. But the risk is that the central bank becomes a holder of debt that requires restructuring -- as is probably the case now with Greece.
The central bank then faces real losses that it must pass on to European governments. Again, it could just print more money to fill the hole, monetizing the debt, as economists say. Numerous irresponsible central banks in Latin America and elsewhere have done so in the past. But the usual result has been high inflation. Germany, which remembers Weimar, sees this as the ultimate risk.
The Bank of England has so far taken a conservative Q.E. course -- buying $:200 billion of British government bonds. Growth there remains weak. The bank may well decide in coming months to start a second round of Q.E. But it's doubtful how effective more gilt purchases would be. The bank might be tempted to be bolder and buy corporate bonds. The risk is that this is like pushing on a piece of string, as the real problem is a lack of demand in the real economy.
By far the boldest exponent of Q.E. has been the Federal Reserve. Its second round of money printing financed purchases of $600 billion of Treasuries. The question is how much QE2 has achieved and, as markets panic, if QE3 will soon be required. But when the yield on the American 10-year note is already hovering around 2.4 percent, would more Treasury purchases be useful?
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has said that more radical options are available. Cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities, he wrote in 2002, could permit a ''money-financed tax cut'' equivalent to a ''helicopter drop'' of money, to use a phrase from the economist Milton Friedman. Politicians would certainly balk at that -- as would most Fed governors, three of whom have rejected the bank's new commitment to keep rates low till 2013.
Congress sought to tie the government's hands on conventionally financed spending, and is politically miles away from using printed money to finance looser fiscal policy.
The reality is that bolder Q.E. would bring risks for the dollar and for inflation worldwide. QE2 coincided with a surge in global commodity prices, increasing inflation in emerging economies and, now, in America to 3.6 percent. Gasoline prices are up 36 percent in the last year. Consumer purchasing power has been harmed. If more Q.E. means higher prices, the policy risks obstructing growth.
But if recession returns to the United States, the world economy slows and the markets' worst fears are realized, then the Fed and other central banks would have no other option. The world isn't desperate yet, even though America's recovery is slow. Central banks do have an arsenal. They just should not rush to use it. IAN CAMPBELL

HEADLINE: California Scrutinizes Nonprofits, Sometimes Ending a Tax Exemption

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A growing number of nonprofit groups in California are being denied exemption from property taxes because the state's chief tax collector and assessors contend they do not do enough to benefit state residents, according to lawyers representing the groups.
''I have a client who applied for the exemption recently and has been denied on the basis that it would not be doing enough to benefit the citizens of California,'' said Ofer Lion, a lawyer. Mr. Lion would not name his client, but said it was new charity with ''a global outlook in its mission.''
''They purchased a building in California because they relied on being able to qualify for property tax exemption,'' he said. ''If it has to pay the tax, it's not going to go under, but less money will, of course, be available for its mission.''
No one knows how many nonprofit groups in California have been affected or why the issue has become contentious now, but the state's budget woes have been mentioned as a likely motive. ''It probably has something to do with the economy,'' said Stephanie L. Petit, who has clients dealing with the process. ''I think regulators are starting to look more closely at organizations that have the property tax exemption.'' 
State and local governments have been taking a hard look at nonprofits and the various tax exemptions they receive for the last couple of years, as tax revenues have fallen and the demand for public services has risen.
Last year, Hawaii tried -- and failed -- to impose a 1 percent tax on nonprofit groups. Boston has asked nonprofits to pay the city what is essentially a discounted property tax, and Chicago plans to ask nonprofits to start paying water and sewer fees.
Not surprisingly, such plans run into stiff opposition from nonprofit groups and their political supporters. But in California, the rules on the property tax exemption for nonprofits evolved out of a 1944 ballot initiative, so they are more grounded than in many other places -- if not necessarily applied assiduously by county assessors.
The state has a two-tiered system, in which nonprofits first apply to the Board of Equalization, which collects state-mandated fees, sales and sin taxes and certifies exemption eligibility.
But assessors in each of the state's 58 counties make the final decision on exemptions, after determining whether that property is used in a way that is of ''primary benefit'' to California.
The meaning of ''primary,'' however, is widely interpreted. ''Although there has to be a primary benefit in California or to Californians, the way we look at primary is not a straight 50 percent test,'' said Anita Gore, spokeswoman for the Board of Equalization. ''Some activities and things nonprofit organizations do can't be quantified in that sort of easy way.''
In Los Angeles County, for example, two properties owned by World Vision International, a Christian relief and development organization whose work is largely done overseas, are exempt from property taxes.
Similarly, Direct Relief International, which supplies medical supplies, drugs and equipment to countries around the world, does not pay property taxes on the office building and warehouse it owns in Santa Barbara. ''In the current environment, I can imagine why local assessors would be looking for revenue and scrutinizing all the organizations exempted from local property taxes to see if they've complied with all the requirements and basically met their end of the policy bargain,'' Thomas Tighe, chief executive of Direct Relief, said in an e-mail.
In San Mateo County, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has had a property tax exemption for decades, said Terry Flinn, special assistant to the county assessor.
So far this year, the Hewlett foundation has granted $14.2 million, or about 27 percent of its total gifts of roughly $52 million, to groups working in California. The rest went out of state and around the globe.
Mr. Flinn said that the foundation holds a long-term lease on the property it occupies, which is owned by Stanford. Both Stanford and the foundation are granted exemption from property taxes by the county each year. ''It's now on our radar as something to look at,'' he said.
Lawrence E. Stone, the assessor next door in Santa Clara County, has been one of the staunchest defenders of the primary benefit standard. Santa Clara grants property tax exemption to some 4,000 nonprofit groups, including the Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Stanford.
Those two nonprofits alone account for about $90 million in tax revenue, were it collected.
Mr. Stone noted that a number of nonprofits that do operate exclusively in California are not eligible for property tax exemption. ''I just came from one of the largest Rotary clubs in the country,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Rotary and other service organizations do a tremendous amount of service in local communities, and they're not exempt.''
He testified at one of three hearings about the exemption held by the Board of Equalization in 2007 and 2008, after a group of nonprofits led by the International Community Foundation in San Diego complained.
John Walton, the late son of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores, had given the charity, which works to build support for nonprofits working in Mexico and Latin America, a seven-acre property nine miles from the Mexican border, but the San Diego County assessor had refused an exemption.
That meant the charity was paying about $21,000 in property taxes a year, said Richard Kiy, its president. ''A number of the issues we grapple with have cross-border impacts and so have an impact on Californians both directly and indirectly,'' Mr. Kiy said.
For example, International Community works with nonprofits in Mexico that are fighting tuberculosis, which is increasing in California because of migration patterns. ''Californians benefit from that work,'' Mr. Kiy said.
The board, however, voted 3-to-2 for no change in the rules.
International Community found a way out of its property tax burden by creating a new nonprofit and giving the Walton property to it. That nonprofit, which operates as Olivewood Gardens, runs educational programs on organic gardening and nutrition in California, among other things.
Olivewood Gardens leases a building on the grounds to International Community, which now pays no property taxes. ''Imposing property taxes on nonprofits in a global era is clearly just a money grab,'' Mr. Kiy said.
Mr. Lion said his client is appealing the board's denial of the exemption and that it would most likely consider a legal challenge to the primary benefit rule. ''I think it's clearly a violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution, and it may also be a violation of the equal protection clause, given the uneven application of the standard,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 17, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about new scrutiny of property tax exemptions for some nonprofit groups in California misstated the number of groups with exemptions in Santa Clara County. It is about 4,000, not 290,000. (The larger number includes tax-exempt homeowners.)

HEADLINE: Divining New York's Fate Should a Double-Dip Recession Hit

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City may have recovered from the Great Recession sooner and more strongly than the rest of the nation did, but it is no less likely to slip back into reverse, economists said.
If the plodding national economy stumbles into another recession, New York -- plagued by high unemployment and the prospect of a rising tide of layoffs on Wall Street -- probably will take a tumble, too.
''The likelihood of a double-dip recession has increased, and that's led to a great deal of concern,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office. ''If there were to be a double-dip recession at the U.S. level, certainly the city would be in trouble.''
The last recession, triggered by the financial crisis that wiped out some of the biggest American investment banks, surprised many economists and local officials by being shorter and shallower in New York City than elsewhere. The city has regained jobs lost since the financial crisis of 2008 at twice the rate of the country as a whole. 
The city had the added benefit of surpluses that had piled up during the rapid growth that preceded the crisis, helping to bridge gaps in the budget in the last few years.
''The cushion that the city had built up during the boom years is now largely behind us,'' Ms. Lowenstein said. ''If we were to go back into recession this quickly, from a fiscal standpoint we wouldn't have some of the benefits we had last time.''
The concern that New York would not fare so well in another downturn stems partly from rumblings about layoffs from the big banks with headquarters in the city. They did not cut as many jobs during the downturn as city officials had been bracing for, but the worry is that a second round would make up for that.
''Now we're starting to see another round of big layoffs in the financial services industry in New York, and it looks like that is going to be ongoing for some time,'' Marisa DiNatale, an economist with Moody's Economy.com, said. If the national economy stops growing altogether, Ms. DiNatale said, there will be ''even a bigger chance that layoffs continue for longer and are even larger.''
In May and June, Wall Street already had ''wiped out'' all of the jobs it had added since January, Ms. DiNatale said. She added that she would not be surprised if employment in the securities industry fell nearly as low as it had at the depths of the recession. That would mean the loss of several thousand additional high-paying jobs.
Last week, Economy.com said the chances of a double-dip recession had risen to one in three, from one in four just two months ago.
''The city almost never bucks the trend,'' Ms. DiNatale said. ''If the U.S. goes into recession, the city almost always goes into recession as well.''
On Friday in Lower Manhattan, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that he had reduced his forecast for economic growth, but that he still did not expect another recession this year.
''We've had a lot of turbulence in financial markets,'' Mr. Dudley said at the end of a week in which the stock market swung wildly down and up, then back down and back up. But he said he doubted that the volatility signaled a reversal of the anemic recovery.
Mr. Dudley described the pace of growth in the metropolitan region as ''disappointing,'' and he called the recent round of layoff announcements from big banks a ''potentially troubling development.''
Still, he said, the city is less vulnerable to a slump on Wall Street than it once was because its economy has been diversifying. As evidence, he pointed to statistics showing that in the past year the big banks and other financial companies did not lead the way in hiring.
As the city's unemployment rate declined to 8.7 percent in June from a post-crisis high of over 10 percent, the biggest job gains came in health care, education and businesses depending on a steady flow of tourists into the region.
Among the higher-paying professions, services like law, accounting and management consulting added more jobs than Wall Street did.
Even some of the hardest-hit industries, like construction and real estate, were on the brink of hiring again when the financial markets dived this month after Standard & Poor's downgraded the nation's credit rating.
''We are actually on the cusp of staffing up again,'' said Jeffrey E. Levine, chairman of Levine Builders, a developer of apartment buildings based in Douglaston, Queens. After cutting jobs and rental prices a few years ago, Mr. Levine said, he has kept his staff ''lean and mean'' through what he called a tremendous turnaround in the city's real estate market.
As an example, he cited Ohm, a building with more than 400 apartments in the northwestern part of the Manhattan neighborhood Chelsea.
''At the beginning of the Great Recession, we were renting at $54, $55 a foot,'' Mr. Levine said. Now, the same apartments are going for about 20 percent more, up to $65 per square foot -- or as much as $2,800 a month for a studio.
Mr. Levine attributed New York's relatively strong rebound to the city's appeal to young professionals as a place to live and work in, as well as its attractiveness to affluent foreigners for investment in times of global unrest.
''In other parts of the country, my rents are unchanged in three years,'' Mr. Levine said, adding that he considered talk of New York City's falling back into recession ''overblown.''
At Bowery Kitchen Supplies, the owner, Howard Nourieli, chalked up the strength of his business to the weakness of the American dollar. Many of the customers buying $150 kitchen knives at his store in Chelsea Market in Manhattan are visitors from South America, he said. On Friday, a cooking-school operator from Argentina spent about $300 on purchases that included a knife made in Japan, Mr. Nourieli said.
The business, which started on the Bowery, once catered to professional cooks and restaurant owners. But its clientele has evolved as the city has drawn more shoppers from other cities and other continents, Mr. Nourieli said. ''Tourists are coming and they're spending money,'' he said.
Then, asked if he had any difficulty filling jobs, Mr. Nourieli noted the weakness of the job market. ''There's plenty of people here in New York that can work,'' he said. ''I haven't had a problem finding people.''

HEADLINE: Who Is to Blame if Shares Continue Steep Declines?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
David Carr, whose Media Equation column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
William Shakespeare,
Macbeth, Act V, Scene 5
At the end of last week's wild stock market gyrations, share prices were down only a moderate amount for the week, leaving investors to wonder whether there was any meaning at all to the volatility.
As is often the case when market gyrations become excessive, governments have good reasons to hope that the significance, if any, lies in market imperfections rather than in fundamental economic problems.
If it is the latter, attention is likely to be focused on issues of sovereign debt in Europe and on whether governments on both sides of the Atlantic have the ability and the will to prevent a new global credit crisis and recession. 
If it is the former, then it is the behavior of market participants, or problems of market structure, that is to blame. In the past, that explanation has been much more palatable to politicians. Sometimes it has even been correct.
If it is not real economic problems that are responsible for sharp falls in stock prices, then the blame is likely to fall, as it has in the past, on people who seek to profit from declines and on market innovations, such as stock index futures and computerized trading strategies.
Short-sellers, who bet that prices will go down and thus perhaps help to push them down, are almost always among the first targets of political criticism, and this year is no exception. At the end of last week four European countries banned short-selling of financial stocks, and Germany renewed its push to get Europe to prohibit what it calls ''naked short-selling'' of credit-default swaps.
It is particularly angry about swaps that allow people to place bets that governments will default on their debts. Germany's proposal would mean no one could obtain such protection against, say, an Italian default unless he owned Italian government bonds and needed protection.
Until 2008, Wall Street almost always opposed restrictions on short-selling. But that year investment banks became strong supporters of banning such sales and investigating people spreading negative rumors.
It was not, of course, a coincidence that the rumors then were about banks. After Lehman Brothers collapsed, short-selling of financial stocks was banned. It bolstered stock prices for a while, but did nothing to halt the rot that really was spreading within bank balance sheets.
So far this year, the United States has not joined in taking action against short-selling, although regulations on it have been strengthened since the 2008 plunge.
In the 1920s, the targets of scorn were Wall Street pools, thought to be pockets of capital that would manipulate a stock up and then profit by dumping overpriced shares on speculators lured into thinking the rising price was a result of more than manipulation. After the 1929 crash, the pools were widely blamed for bear raids, which were more or less the opposite and used short-selling to drive down prices. Attacking the speculators did not, in the end, do much to help the prices.
In the 1987 crash, portfolio trading, made possible by the relatively new stock index futures market, became a target of criticism. That strategy involved taking offsetting positions in the futures market and the stock market, such as by buying a futures contract and selling short the underlying stocks
Traditional money managers loved being able to sell a futures contract quickly to protect against losses in a declining market, but were outraged that the buyer of the contract immediately sold shares short, seemingly without regard to price.
Related to that was a product called ''portfolio insurance,'' which convinced money managers they could buy stocks without much regard to price, secure in the knowledge they could use futures -- or options on futures -- to exit quickly in a down market.
Since the sale of futures by portfolio insurers was based on a computer program that assumed continuous markets, it had no way to stop selling when prices became ridiculously low. Humans who understood what was happening had no desire to buy until they were sure the portfolio insurance traders were through.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22 percent on one day, on Oct. 19, 1987.
In a way, the flash crash of May 6, 2010, was similar. It brought high-frequency trading firms to the fore. As markets became more and more electronic, and computers enabled trades to be completed in milliseconds, those firms had come to supply most of the liquidity needed to allow markets to function.
That is, when normal investors wanted to buy or sell stocks, the high-frequency firms were often on the other side of the trade, making small amounts on many trades. They had taken over a profitable function once restricted to stock exchange specialists and Nasdaq market makers, which were required to post bid and asked prices and to step in to buy when others did not wish to do so.
The high-frequency firms discovered that when they did not want to trade, they could still get the advantages of being deemed to be market makers through the use of ''stub quotes.'' A firm that did not want to buy a stock could post a bid of 1 cent for shares that were trading for $30 or $40, and be confident that it would not have to buy.
On May 6, other bids vanished for some stocks. There were lots of reasons for that, including a falling market under stress from worries over Greek debt and an apparent mistake by one money manager, which put in an order to sell far more stock index futures than it meant to. Under the old market structure, trading would have stopped, as it did on the New York Stock Exchange, while things were sorted out. But in the electronic markets, investors who had put in orders to sell shares at market prices got just $1.
The essential point, similar to the portfolio insurance fiasco of 1987, was that computers had been programmed to sell regardless of price under some circumstances, and there was no mechanism for cooler heads to step in and slow things down.
After 1987, the markets imposed circuit breakers to halt trading temporarily if prices fell sharply, and after the flash crash that was extended to individual stocks.
Both the 1987 crash and the 2010 flash crash occurred when markets were under stress for other reasons. It was market structure and trading strategies -- related to relatively new financial and technological innovation -- that turned what might have been an orderly market decline into a crisis.
The extreme volatility of 2011 began only a few weeks ago, and so far it has not approached the levels of 1987 or 2010. The largest intraday swing -- the difference between the daily high and low -- in the Dow industrials this year was 640 points, or 6 percent, last Tuesday. The figures were 1,010 points and 10.2 percent in the flash crash. Similarly, the largest declines from one day to the next this year have been about a quarter of the magnitude of Oct. 19, 1987.
Nonetheless, it is likely there will be investigations seeking explanations of volatility in market structures, and it is probable that short-selling restrictions will spread if prices fall rapidly in coming weeks.
There is one other likely response if prices keep falling. There will be assurances that the markets are overreacting, and that the real economy is doing better than stock prices would indicate.
On Nov. 6, 1929, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 14 percent in little more than a week, this newspaper published a report from Washington citing ''views held in high official circles here.''
The article praised the Federal Reserve for its quick reaction in keeping credit available and forecast that a stock market drawing in less cash would make more money available for mortgage loans.
''The effect of the collapse upon productive business, if there is any at all, will be purely psychological,'' it added, ''as is indicated by the fact there has been no cancellation of orders and no curtailment of buying, except perhaps in the luxury trades, according to the same view.''
Nearly six decades later, on Oct. 20, 1987, this newspaper printed a front page analysis headlined, ''Does 1987 Equal 1929?'' It was encouraging: ''The quick answer, many economists say, is no.''
That time, the optimists were correct.

HEADLINE: For Consumers, Anxiety May Trump Low Rates

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's announcement last week that it intended to keep credit cheap for at least two more years was a clear invitation to Americans: Go out and borrow.
But many economists say it will take more than low interest rates to persuade consumers, a crucial driver of the nation's economy, to take on more debt.
There are already signs that the recent stock market upheaval, turbulence in Europe and gridlock in Washington over the federal deficit have spooked consumers. On Friday, preliminary data showed that the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index had fallen this month to lower than it was in November 2008, when the country was deep in recession.
Under normal circumstances, the Fed's announcement might have attracted new home and car buyers and prompted credit card holders to rack up fresh charges. But with unemployment high and those with jobs worried about keeping them, consumers are more concerned about paying off the loans they already have than adding more debt. And by showing its hand for the next two years, the Fed may have inadvertently invited prospective borrowers to put off large purchases. 
Lenders, meanwhile, are still dealing with the effects of the boom-gone-bust and are forcing prospective borrowers to go to extraordinary lengths to prove their creditworthiness.
''I don't think lenders are going to be interested in extending a lot of debt in this environment,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm. ''Nor do I think households are going to be interested in taking on a lot of debt.''
In housing, consumers have already shown a lackluster response to low rates. Applications for new mortgages have slowed this year to a 10-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Sales of furniture and furnishings remain 22 percent below their prerecession peak, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, a research service.
Credit card rates have actually gone up slightly in the last year. The one bright spot in lending is the number of auto loans, which is up from last year. But some economists say that confidence among car buyers is hitting new lows.
For Xavier Walter, a former mortgage banker who with his wife, Danielle, accumulated $70,000 on a home equity line and $20,000 in credit card debt, low rates will not change his spending habits.
As the housing market topped out five years ago, he lost his six-figure income. He and his wife were able to modify the mortgage on their four-bedroom colonial in Medford, N.J., as well as negotiate lower credit card payments.
Two years ago, Mr. Walter, a 34-year-old father of three, started an energy business. He has sworn off credit. ''I'm not going to go back in debt ever again,'' he said. ''If I can't pay for it in cash, I don't want it.''
Until now, one of the biggest restraints on consumer spending has been a debt hangover. Since August 2008, when household debt peaked at $12.41 trillion, it has declined by about $1.2 trillion, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics of data from the Federal Reserve and Equifax, the credit agency. A large portion of that, though, was simply written off by lenders as borrowers defaulted on loans.
By other measures, households have improved their position. The proportion of after-tax income that households spend to remain current on loan payments has fallen, from close to 14 percent in early 2007 to 11.5 percent now, according to Moody's Analytics.
Still, household debt remains high. That presents a conundrum: many economists argue that the economy cannot achieve true health until debt levels decline. But credit, made attractive by low rates, is a time-tested way to bolster consumer spending.
With new risks of another downturn, economists worry that it will take years for debt to return to manageable levels. If the economy contracts again, said George Magnus, senior adviser at UBS, then ''you could find a lot of households in a debt trap which they probably can never get out of.''
The market most directly affected by the reluctance to borrow is housing. With many owners still owing more than the current value of their homes, they cannot sell and move up to new homes. New mortgage and refinancing loan volumes fell nearly 19 percent, to $265 billion, at the end of the second quarter, down from $325 billion in the first quarter, the lowest since 2008, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter.
Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, burned by the housing crash, are extra careful about approving new loans. In June, for instance, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage buyer, said that borrowers whose existing debt exceeded 45 to 50 percent of their income would be required to have stronger ''compensating'' factors, which might include higher savings.
Even those borrowers in strong financial positions are asked to provide unusual amounts of paperwork. Bobby and Katie Smith have stellar credit, tiny student debt and a combined six-figure income. For part of their down payment, they planned to use about $5,000 they had received as wedding gifts in February.
But the lender would not accept that money unless the Smiths provided a certified letter from each of 14 guests, stating that the money was a gift, rather than a loan.
''We laughed for a good 15 or 20 minutes,'' recalled Mr. Smith, 34.
Mr. Smith, a program director for a radio station in Orlando, Fla., said they ended up using other savings for their down payment to buy a $300,000 four-bedroom ranch in April.
For those not as creditworthy as the Smiths, low rates are irrelevant because they no longer qualify for mortgages. That leaves the eligible pool of loan applicants wealthier, ''older and whiter,'' said Guy D. Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''It's creating much more of a divide,'' he said, ''between the haves and the have-nots.''
Car shoppers with the highest credit ratings can also get loans more easily, and at lower rates, said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
During the recession, inability to obtain credit severely curtailed auto buying as lenders rejected even those with good credit. Now automakers are increasing their subprime lending again as well, but remain hesitant to approve large numbers of risky customers.
The number of new auto loans was up by 16 percent in the second quarter compared with the previous year, said Melinda Zabritski, director of automotive credit at Experian, the information services company.
But some economists warn that consumer confidence is falling. According to CNW Marketing Research, confidence among those who intend to buy a car this year is at its lowest since it began collecting data on this measure in 2000.
On credit cards, rates have actually inched slightly higher this year, largely because of new rules that curb the issuer's ability to charge fees or capriciously raise certain interest rates.
At the end of the second quarter, rates averaged 14.01 percent on new card offers, up from 13.75 percent a year earlier, according to Mail Monitor, which tracks credit cards for Synovate, a market research firm. According to data from the Federal Reserve, total outstanding debt on revolving credit cards was down by 4.6 percent during the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier.
Even if the Fed's move helps keep rates steady, or pushes them down, businesses do not expect customers to suddenly charge up a storm.
''It's not like, 'Oh, credit is so cheap, let's go back to the heydays,' '' said Elizabeth Crowell, who owns Sterling Place, two high-end home furnishing and gift stores in Brooklyn. ''People still fear for their jobs. So I think where maybe after other recessions they might revert to previous spending habits, the pendulum hasn't swung back the same way.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Consumers' Burden: Households have reduced their debt payments from a peak of almost 14 percent of after-tax income in 2007 to levels similar to those of the 1990s. But total household debt is still well above the levels that it was in the 1990s. High debt creates a reluctance to spend and borrow -- new mortgages, for instance, have declined -- which does not help to stimulate the economy.

HEADLINE: Drones Alone Are Not the Answer

BYLINE: By DENNIS C. BLAIR. 
Dennis C. Blair, a retired admiral, was director of national intelligence from 2009 to 2010.

 BODY:
Mechanicsburg, Pa.
OVER the past two years, America has narrowed its goals in Afghanistan and Pakistan to a single-minded focus on eliminating Al Qaeda. Public support for a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan has waned. American officials dealing with Pakistan now spend most of their time haggling over our military and intelligence activities, when they should instead be pursuing the sort of comprehensive social, diplomatic and economic reforms that Pakistan desperately needs and that would advance America's long-term interests.
In Pakistan, no issue is more controversial than American drone attacks in Pakistani territory along the Afghan border. The Obama administration contends that using drones to kill 10 or 20 more Qaeda leaders would eliminate the organization. This is wishful thinking. 
Drone strikes are no longer the most effective strategy for eliminating Al Qaeda's ability to attack us. Past American drone attacks did help reduce the Qaeda leadership in Pakistan to a fearful, hunted cadre that did not have the time or space to plan, train and coordinate major terrorist acts against the United States.
But the important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce Al Qaeda's capabilities. They will not.
Instead, we must work with Pakistan's government as an equal partner to achieve our common goals while ensuring that the country does not remain a refuge for Taliban fighters.
Qaeda officials who are killed by drones will be replaced. The group's structure will survive and it will still be able to inspire, finance and train individuals and teams to kill Americans. Drone strikes hinder Qaeda fighters while they move and hide, but they can endure the attacks and continue to function.
Moreover, as the drone campaign wears on, hatred of America is increasing in Pakistan. American officials may praise the precision of the drone attacks. But in Pakistan, news media accounts of heavy civilian casualties are widely believed. Our reliance on high-tech strikes that pose no risk to our soldiers is bitterly resented in a country that cannot duplicate such feats of warfare without cost to its own troops.
Our dogged persistence with the drone campaign is eroding our influence and damaging our ability to work with Pakistan to achieve other important security objectives like eliminating Taliban sanctuaries, encouraging Indian-Pakistani dialogue, and making Pakistan's nuclear arsenal more secure.
Reducing Al Qaeda to a fringe group of scattered individuals without an organizational structure will only succeed if Pakistan asserts control over its full territory and brings government services to the regions bordering Afghanistan.
Washington should support a new security campaign that includes jointly controlled drone strikes and combines the capabilities of both countries. Together, the American and Pakistani governments can fashion a plan that meets the objectives of both without committing to broader joint campaigns that would not be politically viable at the moment.
We can help Pakistan with logistics, transport and intelligence; Pakistan can help us by deploying security forces and improving local government on the ground. Drone strikes targeting Qaeda leaders and other terrorists would be conducted by mutual agreement.
The raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May showed Pakistan that the United States would respect its sovereignty only so far. A cooperative campaign against common enemies offers them the best chance of controlling American actions in their country. And Pakistani participation in the targeting of drone strikes would remove a major source of anti-American resentment.
If we are ever to reduce Al Qaeda from a threat to a nuisance, it will be by working with Pakistan, not by continuing unilateral drone attacks.

HEADLINE: Wave of Setbacks Threatens Europe

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Julia Werdigier from London.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Economists may still be debating whether Europe is headed for a sharp slowdown or even a recession, but Steve Knott, who installs home heating systems in Barrow-in-Furness, a port town in northwest England once known for its iron mills, is convinced he already knows the answer.
Mr. Knott, 53, who runs Furness Heating Components, has cut his work force to 18 people from 25 and said business was tougher than he had ever seen it. ''There's a lot of competition, and people are just not building that many houses anymore,'' Mr. Knott said.
Data released on Friday leaves little doubt that the European economy is losing momentum before most countries have even recovered to the level of output they had in 2008, when the recession hit. 
But the larger question is whether an increasingly bitter brew of flagging output and a sovereign debt crisis -- along with the market downturn -- will create something more sinister than a mere slowdown, and lead more businesses to cut jobs and investment as Mr. Knott has.
In France, the second-largest economy in the European Union after Germany, growth came to a standstill in the three months through June, according to official figures. Meanwhile, industrial production in the 17-nation euro area fell 0.7 percent in June compared with May, more than analysts had forecast.
On Tuesday, economists expect a report on euro area economic activity to show that gross domestic product slowed to 0.3 percent in the second quarter, from 0.8 percent in the first three months of the year.
If there is less economic growth, governments will collect less tax revenue. They will have more trouble paying their debts. That could make investors even more nervous and add to turmoil in the stock and bond markets, which will undercut business and consumer confidence, which will lead to yet slower growth, and so on.
''There is a real risk that there is a self-enforcing cycle under way here,'' said Martin Lueck, an economist at UBS in Frankfurt.
Mr. Lueck says he believes the most likely prospect is less dire, but even his more optimistic view calls for a brief slowdown on the way to a ''new normal'' of weaker growth in Europe and the United States. And he acknowledged that, in 2008, many economists underestimated how quickly and severely the financial crisis would spill into the broader economy.
''We learned the hard way,'' Mr. Lueck said. ''The links between the financial world and the world economy are very strong.''
Another recession is already well under way in Greece and Portugal, while growth in countries like Spain, Italy and Britain has been very slow since last year. But now Germany, which has been remarkably strong, hauling the rest of the Continent along with it, seems to be decelerating. The Ifo Business Climate Index, considered a reliable predictor of German growth, fell in July as executives became less optimistic about exports.
''It is more than a soft patch,'' said Eric Chaney, chief economist at a French insurer, the AXA Group. ''The business cycle is really coming to a quasi-standstill in Europe.''
Worse-than-expected results from companies like Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens in the last month have reinforced the feeling that Germany's extraordinary boom is near an end. E.On, Germany's largest utility, said on Wednesday that it might need to cut as many as 11,000 jobs after experiencing the first loss since it was created a decade ago from a group of state-owned utilities.
E.On attributed the loss chiefly to the government's decision to force some of the company's nuclear power plants to close early, but sales declines in foreign markets like Britain and Hungary also played a role.
Even companies that have done well are warning about risks ahead. ''The coming months will be challenging for us,'' Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in late July after the carmaker reported that profit more than tripled, to 4.8 billion euros ($6.8 billion).
A big problem for Europe is that domestic demand is weak and growth has become primarily dependent on sales from abroad, where the signals are flashing yellow. The United States, still the largest foreign market for companies like BMW, is slowing and could slip into recession. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan had a greater impact on global trade than economists expected. And demand from China and emerging markets is slackening.
''Germany is so leveraged in global trade that if something happens, then Germany slows immediately,'' Mr. Chaney said. ''That makes the recovery more fragile. It depends on the good health of the rest of the world.''
Some German exporters are still smarting from the severe recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and must now gird for another retrenchment. An association that represents makers of construction machinery said last Wednesday that it expected a sales increase of more than 10 percent this year, but that sales were still one-third below their 2008 peak.
Many German companies are still not operating at capacity, while they worry about debt problems in the United States and Europe as well as unrest in the crucial Middle East market, said Christof Kemmann, chief executive of BHS-Sonthofen, a maker of machinery for processing building materials.
''Even when some sectors are reporting good numbers, there is no reason for euphoria,'' Mr. Kemmann said.
And it looks increasingly unlikely that demand from home will recover in time to offset fading exports. Government austerity measures have cut into consumption in countries like Ireland and Italy, and the belt-tightening is spreading. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in attempt to reassure bond investors that the country can service its debt, last week told his budget and finance ministers to come up with new measures to cut the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, from a projected 5.7 percent this year.
Britain, where unrest in the streets is only adding to uncertainty among consumers and businesses, provides a prime example.
Britain's economy grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, but disposable income in the 12-month period through March fell 2.7 percent for the average British family as a result of inflation and higher interest rates. As consumers avoid the stores, several retailers, including Jane Norman, a women's fashion retailer; TJ Hughes, a discount department store; and the wine and spirits retailer Oddbins have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
Despite the risk of another recession, the British government has vowed to stick with its $:80 billion ($130 billion) austerity program, which is expected to cost 300,000 public sector jobs.
''It's pretty harsh times,'' said Dave Knight, secretary for the Unison trade union, which represents workers for the Waltham Forest Council in the North of London, an area hit by unrest. Of four council offices, three will close, he said. A team of five psychologists who counseled troubled students will lose their jobs.
Many economists warn that the austerity measures could be counterproductive by making people fearful of unemployment and afraid to spend. ''Austerity has become the problem, not the solution,'' said Ian Harnett, a managing director at Absolute Strategy Research. ''Me saving is great. You saving is great too. But if we all save it's not good.''
For all the economic angst, many economists say that risk of a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis has been overblown. Banks have more capital in reserve than they did then, the argument goes, and central banks have shown they are ready to step in at the first hint of trouble. This month, signs of stress in the interbank lending market prompted the European Central Bank to expand cheap loans to banks in the euro area, to ensure that none run short of cash.
Further, some economists say, investors have a much better understanding of where the risks lie than they did in 2008, when no one knew which banks were sitting on heaps of bad assets. Under pressure from regulators, European banks disclosed their holdings of government debt last month. The abundance of information makes a panic less likely, these analysts argue.
''Global financial markets are not headed for a second meltdown,'' Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist at the United States International Trade Commission, said in a note. ''But growth is going to be slow,'' he added, ''until Western leaders correct the imbalance in demand between Asia and the West, and work off all the debt.''

HEADLINE: Tinkering With the U.S. Tax Code

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your excellent editorial about the necessity of raising taxes (''The Truth About Taxes,'' Aug. 7), I was surprised that you did not mention that the United States' overall tax burden -- state, local, federal, corporate -- as a percentage of gross domestic product is now one of the lowest of all the major industrialized countries.
Data recently released by the Organization for Cooperation and Development for 2009 rank the United States as 28th among the 30 advanced industrial powers. Legislators call for tax cuts for the sake of ''competitiveness'' perhaps without realizing that our total tax take as a percentage of G.D.P. is about 35 percent lower than Germany's. 
Informed debates over the deficit and debts are impossible without an accurate understanding of the state of American taxes.
CHARLES R. MORRIS New York, Aug. 8, 2011
The writer is the author of ''The Trillion Dollar Meltdown.''
To the Editor:
In your editorial you refrain from suggesting the most productive option: raising income tax rates on top earners to Eisenhower-era levels. Such a measure would virtually double the revenue garnered from these top earners without markedly compromising their standard of living. This should be a welcome opportunity for them to give back to the country that has given so much to them.
ERNEST KOLOWRAT Monson, Mass., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
I was a tax attorney in the 1950s when the top rate was 91 percent, so I have no sympathy for those who worry that raising the top rates to 40 percent or so will destroy the country.
At the same time, I disagree with your argument that the Bush tax cuts are the ''big reason'' for our deficits. The big reason for the deficits is that in just 10 years federal spending has gone from about 18 percent of our gross domestic product to over 25 percent. But no one wants to pay for this largess, so Congress runs deficits that our children will get to deal with.
ARTHUR O. ARMSTRONG Manhattan Beach, Calif., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
I am very much in favor of raising taxes on the wealthy. However, those earning $250,000 are not wealthy. (F.Y.I., I am not one of them.) This is obvious to anyone who lives in any major city in the United States. Why not raise the level to $1 million, an amount that I think everyone could agree on?
ERIC A. STONE Chappaqua, N.Y., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
The single most effective remedy for our deficit problem would be a tax that tracks the national debt. It would be levied as a surtax on all income. The revenue from this ''debt tax'' would be dedicated solely to paying interest and principal on the national debt. Those interest payments are fast approaching a whopping $500 billion per year.
This surtax would gradually reduce itself to zero as the debt was paid off, or increase as the debt rose. Such a tax -- especially if itemized on pay stubs -- would be a constant irritant to taxpayers and politicians alike, providing an effective means of inhibiting future deficits.
RON SHEPPE Rochester, N.H., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial recommends that ''super-low tax rates for investment income should be ended.''
In so doing, The Times echoed the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Simpson-Bowles) and the deficit reduction plan put forward by the Bipartisan Policy Center, led by Alice Rivlin and Pete Domenici. Both reports called for equal taxes on capital gains, dividends and ordinary income like wages.
Income inequality in America now stands at record highs -- probably due, more than any other single factor, to grossly unfair tax breaks on capital gains and dividends.
Is there any good reason to tax income from wealth at lower rates than income from work? Absolutely not.
GERALD E. SCORSE New York, Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Has The Times now accepted the magical thinking of the hard right: that lowering tax rates gives people ''incentives to work''? Most of us have substantial fixed expenses, such as rent and utility payments. Raising our tax rates gives us incentives to work, since we have to earn more to meet our existing obligations. If you're going to join the supply-siders and argue otherwise, please identify some people who decided to work harder only after their take-home pay went up.

HEADLINE: Some French Suggest Fiction Helped Set Off Market Panic

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- One source of last week's market panic could have been set off by a simple work of fiction.
A series of articles in Le Monde, ''End of the Line for the Euro,'' looked at how a collapse of the currency might hypothetically play out, particularly against the backdrop of French presidential elections next year.
While the newspaper's 12-part series was clearly labeled as fiction, it named real banks, like Societe Generale, whose shares plunged 15 percent last Wednesday, prompting the bank to deny speculation that it was in financial trouble. 
Now French politicians, business leaders and journalists -- at least those who are left in Paris during the dog days of August -- are wondering if that series somehow played a role.
The trail seemed to lead to London, where The Mail on Sunday published an article saying that Societe Generale was ''on the brink of disaster.'' Societe Generale and an Italian bank, UniCredit, were in a ''perilous'' state, the paper added, citing ''a senior government source.''
Last Tuesday, two days after the report appeared, The Mail retracted it.
Readers of ''End of the Line for the Euro'' noticed that Societe Generale and UniCredit were named in the same passage in the series, in an imaginary conversation involving the hedge fund manager John A. Paulson, in which he says that American regulators have been raising concerns about the liquidity of the two banks.
On Wednesday, a journalist at the Reuters news agency, Natalie Huet, speculated about a possible link between the tale in Le Monde and the article in The Mail on Sunday. ''The rumor of a collapse of SocGen could have come from a misreading of the summer series in Le Monde by The Daily Mail,'' she wrote on the blogging site Twitter, referring to the weekday sister publication of The Mail on Sunday.
Ms. Huet subsequently clarified that her comment was based on the ''words of traders'' and was merely intended to relay a ''funny and not impossible hypothesis.'' She also specified that she had been commenting in a personal capacity.
The story took off from there. On Thursday, the news agency Agence France-Presse said, in an article that it later killed, that the Le Monde series ''was the source of false information that has largely contributed to Societe Generale's stock market drop.''
On Friday, France's economy minister, Francois Baroin, discussed the possible connection in a radio interview.
By the weekend, the talk had grown so loud that Le Monde was moved to defend itself in a front-page editorial by Erik Izraelewicz, its top editorial executive.
''The reality is that our fiction had nothing to do with this crazy rumor,'' Mr. Izraelewicz wrote. ''The paradox is that this case has come to illustrate something that our series denounced: the unacceptable role played by rumors in determining the fate of nations and businesses.''
In the series, the fictional collapse of the euro zone is driven by market rumors -- spread by British traders -- that Germany intended to pull out of the euro zone. That set in motion a disastrous cycle of events.
The scrutiny comes at an awkward time for Le Monde, less than a year after it was taken over by a group of French business executives with links to the opposition Socialist Party, and less than a year before French presidential elections.
Even before the series ran, from late July through early August, it was the subject of complaints from Le Monde journalists, who issued a news release to protest the decision by Mr. Izraelewicz to give the plum assignment to a reporter at La Tribune, a business newspaper that he previously edited. Mr. Izraelewicz was named to the top job at Le Monde in February.
Societe Generale actually fared better in Le Monde's fiction than another French lender, Credit Agricole. That bank wrote a letter of complaint to the newspaper after it was portrayed as requiring a costly bailout.
The French market regulator, the A.M.F., is investigating the source of the speculation about Societe Generale.
As for The Mail on Sunday, a senior executive, who insisted that he not be identified because he was not an official spokesman, dismissed talk of a link to the series in Le Monde. Neither the paper's reporters nor its sources had been aware of the series, the executive said.

HEADLINE: Obama Shifts Gears From Coaxing G.O.P. To Swaying the Public

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
CANNON FALLS, Minn. - House Speaker John A. Boehner once explained conservatives' hard line on the debt limit this way: ''A lot of them,'' he told a radio host, believe ''enough chaos'' would make opponents yield.
Chaos arrived in financial markets last week after Standard & Poor's, citing Washington gridlock, stripped the United States of its AAA credit rating. 
Whoever ultimately gains political advantage, the events of the last few weeks have opened a new phase of President Obama's fight to advance his agenda and win a second term.
Ever since Democrats lost the House in midterm elections last year, the president has vacillated between conciliation and confrontation with ascendant Republicans. He struck a lame-duck deal with Mr. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, after the 2010 election to extend the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. He assailed the budget overhaul proposed by Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Then, under threat from House Republicans who would not raise the government's borrowing cap, he retreated to private negotiations on a ''grand bargain'' to reduce the budget deficit.
But the failure of those talks and the deterioration of the country's economic outlook have unsettled Mr. Obama and are now altering his approach.
He still wants Congress to pass stimulus and deficit reduction measures that his economic team is preparing to unveil as early as this month. But his strategy no longer turns on coaxing Republican leaders.
It turns, instead, on his ability to leverage public opinion through events like the town hall-style meeting planned for Monday here, kicking off his Midwestern bus tour. If he cannot apply enough public pressure to move Congress, he will try to move 2012 voters to give him a mandate.
Test for White House
White House aides saw the shift after handing the president his speech for last week's appearance at a factory in Michigan, as economic advisers monitored post-downgrade gyrations on Wall Street and the full-blown debt crisis in Europe.
Mr. Obama thought the draft speech was too soft on the Republicans - and so he personally sharpened it. The result: a famously ''cool'' president delivered the hottest rhetoric of his tenure, blistering opponents for refusing ''to put the country ahead of party'' because they would ''rather see their opponents lose than see America win.''
His effectiveness will be tested when Congress returns in September to consider his ideas for reversing recent economic setbacks that have freshly alarmed consumers, investors, the White House and the Federal Reserve. The global economy appears stuck in what Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond investment firm Pimco, calls ''a damaging feedback loop'' of eroding circumstances, slow government action and market volatility.
In addition to extending the current payroll tax cut for employees, Mr. Obama's economic team is considering extending that cut to employers - doubling the $100 billion annual cost. In addition to a $50 billion infrastructure bank and a $45 billion extension of unemployment benefits, the administration is considering seeking a $75 billion tax break for companies hiring new workers.
Those steps would steepen the path for a special Congressional committee, created as part of the compromise over raising the debt ceiling, which seeks at least $1.2 trillion in new deficit reduction this fall. The White House is mulling whether to advance Mr. Obama's deficit-reduction recommendations for that panel separately, or in an integrated package with job creation ideas.
Expectations remain low for anything beyond least-common-denominator accords - unless economic conditions and public pressure shift the political facts on the ground. At this point, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner said, the House has ''no plans to take up'' the president's job creation ideas except for patent reform and pending trade deals.
The Deal-Averse
In 21st-century political culture, the presidential bully pulpit is far less powerful than it used to be.
Moreover, Republicans have a simple and powerful story to tell about Mr. Obama's bottom line: 9.1 percent unemployment, economic growth below a 1 percent annual rate for the first half of 2011, trillion-dollar budget deficits. Mr. Obama's explanations can offset, but not erase, an incumbent's responsibility for results.
The compromise-averse House Republicans who share power with him have suffered blows, too - in the polls from independent voters, in private complaints from business leaders, in public warnings from veteran Republican politicians, pundits and intellectuals. The party's accelerating 2012 nomination race may not help.
In the Iowa straw poll over the weekend, a candidate who opposes raising the country's debt limit under any circumstances (Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota) edged out a candidate who supports abolishing the Federal Reserve (Representative Ron Paul of Texas). Every Republican candidate in a debate before the straw poll pledged to oppose any tax increase - even if paired with spending cuts 10 times as big.
That leaves even some of Mr. Obama's fiercest critics helping him make the public argument he will sound again on this week's bus tour.
''If taxes cannot be raised under any circumstances, then we have veered from economic policy to religious catechism,'' Peter Wehner, a former deputy to Karl Rove in Mr. Bush's White House, wrote for Commentary.
He continued, ''There is something amiss when the political pressure in a party, any party, is so intense that it prevents a serious intellectual conversation from even taking place.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Jobs Agenda, Anyone? Without more jobs, both the economy and the federal budget will deteriorate further

 BODY:
In what can only be described as a triumph of bad policy and craven politics, Congress and the Obama administration have spent the year focused on budget cuts, as the economy has faltered and unemployment has worsened. Official unemployment is 9.1 percent, but it would be 16.1 percent, or 25.1 million people, if it included those who can only find part-time jobs and those who have given up looking for work. For the past two and a half years, there have been more than four unemployed workers for every job opening, a record high, by far. In a healthy market, the ratio would be about one to one.
By a large margin, Americans have told pollsters that job creation is more important than budget cuts. Yet Republican leaders are wedded to austerity and appear to think that high unemployment will hurt President Obama politically more than it will hurt them, so they will likely resist efforts to create jobs, no matter how great the need. 
Without more jobs, both the economy and the budget will deteriorate further. It is past time for Mr. Obama to send a jobs plan to Congress that has popular appeal, one that he can use to try to shame Republicans. He will need cooperation from the Senate, which should bring one jobs-related bill after another to the floor, forcing its members to approve jobs initiatives or go on the record to show that they just don't care.
Mr. Obama has begun to talk more about jobs, but his agenda is thin. Its main components -- extending federal unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut beyond their expiration at the end of this year -- are vitally important, but their extension will only maintain the status quo. His idea for an infrastructure bank to finance large-scale building projects is also good, but would take time, and would not address the immediate need for jobs. Ditto his push for patent reform and trade agreements.
There are other ideas worth fighting for. Take, for example, Fix America's Schools Today, or FAST, an idea that has been incorporated into a House proposal to be introduced this fall by Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. Public school buildings in the United States are on average over 40 years old and in need of an estimated $500 billion in repairs and upgrades. A $50 billion school renovation program would employ 500,000 workers (1.5 million construction workers are currently unemployed) and could be easily scaled up. The money could be disbursed through existing federal formulas to all 16,000 public school districts. The initial cost could be largely offset over 10 years by ending tax breaks for fossil fuels, as called for in Mr. Obama's 2012 budget.
Other programs in the Schakowsky bill could employ an estimated one million young people for projects in federal parks, community centers and on college campuses, as well as 350,000 laid-off teachers, police officers, firefighters and health care providers.
Washington, in thrall to austerity, has abandoned one of the most immediate and powerful tools for supporting growth and jobs, namely, borrowing at today's low rates to provide direct fiscal aid to states. But Mr. Obama can and should make the case for targeted new jobs today, to be paid for over time by closing tax loopholes.
Republicans are sure to howl that new programs will undo the debt ceiling deal, but it is surely possible over a 10-year period to tackle near-term action on jobs and long-term action on deficit reduction. The alternative is even slower growth and higher unemployment.

HEADLINE: The Texas Unmiracle

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As expected, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, has announced that he is running for president. And we already know what his campaign will be about: faith in miracles.
Some of these miracles will involve things that you're liable to read in the Bible. But if he wins the Republican nomination, his campaign will probably center on a more secular theme: the alleged economic miracle in Texas, which, it's often asserted, sailed through the Great Recession almost unscathed thanks to conservative economic policies. And Mr. Perry will claim that he can restore prosperity to America by applying the same policies at a national level.
So what you need to know is that the Texas miracle is a myth, and more broadly that Texan experience offers no useful lessons on how to restore national full employment. 
It's true that Texas entered recession a bit later than the rest of America, mainly because the state's still energy-heavy economy was buoyed by high oil prices through the first half of 2008. Also, Texas was spared the worst of the housing crisis, partly because it turns out to have surprisingly strict regulation of mortgage lending.
Despite all that, however, from mid-2008 onward unemployment soared in Texas, just as it did almost everywhere else.
In June 2011, the Texas unemployment rate was 8.2 percent. That was less than unemployment in collapsed-bubble states like California and Florida, but it was slightly higher than the unemployment rate in New York, and significantly higher than the rate in Massachusetts. By the way, one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state's small-government approach. Meanwhile, Massachusetts has near-universal coverage thanks to health reform very similar to the ''job-killing'' Affordable Care Act.
So where does the notion of a Texas miracle come from? Mainly from widespread misunderstanding of the economic effects of population growth.
For this much is true about Texas: It has, for many decades, had much faster population growth than the rest of America -- about twice as fast since 1990. Several factors underlie this rapid population growth: a high birth rate, immigration from Mexico, and inward migration of Americans from other states, who are attracted to Texas by its warm weather and low cost of living, low housing costs in particular.
And just to be clear, there's nothing wrong with a low cost of living. In particular, there's a good case to be made that zoning policies in many states unnecessarily restrict the supply of housing, and that this is one area where Texas does in fact do something right.
But what does population growth have to do with job growth? Well, the high rate of population growth translates into above-average job growth through a couple of channels. Many of the people moving to Texas -- retirees in search of warm winters, middle-class Mexicans in search of a safer life -- bring purchasing power that leads to greater local employment. At the same time, the rapid growth in the Texas work force keeps wages low -- nearly 10 percent of hourly Texan workers earn the minimum wage or less, well above the national average -- and these low wages give corporations an incentive to move production to the Lone Star State.
So Texas tends, in good years and bad, to have higher job growth than the rest of America. But it needs lots of new jobs just to keep up with its rising population -- and as those unemployment comparisons show, recent employment growth has fallen well short of what's needed.
If this picture doesn't look very much like the glowing portrait Texas boosters like to paint, there's a reason: the glowing portrait is false.
Still, does Texas job growth point the way to faster job growth in the nation as a whole? No.
What Texas shows is that a state offering cheap labor and, less important, weak regulation can attract jobs from other states. I believe that the appropriate response to this insight is ''Well, duh.'' The point is that arguing from this experience that depressing wages and dismantling regulation in America as a whole would create more jobs -- which is, whatever Mr. Perry may say, what Perrynomics amounts to in practice -- involves a fallacy of composition: every state can't lure jobs away from every other state.
In fact, at a national level lower wages would almost certainly lead to fewer jobs -- because they would leave working Americans even less able to cope with the overhang of debt left behind by the housing bubble, an overhang that is at the heart of our economic problem.
So when Mr. Perry presents himself as the candidate who knows how to create jobs, don't believe him. His prescriptions for job creation would work about as well in practice as his prayer-based attempt to end Texas's crippling drought.

HEADLINE: Chris Christie's Cue

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
This has been a clarifying week for the 2012 election. Thursday's Republican debate reminded everyone why Mitt Romney is the front-runner, as his rivals left the former Massachusetts governor more or less untouched. Saturday's Ames straw poll disposed of Tim Pawlenty, who not so long ago seemed positioned to give Romney a real challenge. Instead, that challenge will probably come from Rick Perry, whose entrance into the race promises to set up a Romney-Perry slugfest for the nomination, with Michele Bachmann playing spoiler.
Romney and Perry will be competing to face possibly the weakest incumbent since Jimmy Carter, with the world in turmoil and the economy adrift. Six months ago, it still seemed as if Republican primary voters might be choosing a sacrificial lamb to run against Barack Obama. Now it looks as if they might be choosing the next president. 
This should inspire Republicans to return, yet again, to the question that has dogged their party's field all year. Is this really the best we can do?
The answer is no. No one doubts Romney's intelligence or competence, but he has managed to run for president for almost five years without taking a single courageous or even remotely interesting position. The thinking person's case for Romney, murmured by many of his backers, amounts to this: Vote for Mitt, you know he doesn't believe a word he says.
But his phoniness would remain a weakness even if he won the presidency. He's a born compromiser pretending to be a hard-liner, and the hard-liners know it -- which means he would enter the Oval Office with conservative knives already sharpened and ready for his back.
Rick Perry has many of the qualities that Romney seems to lack: backbone, core convictions, a killer instinct and a primal understanding of the right-wing electorate. He also has the better story. Where Romney has to run away from his Massachusetts health care bill and downplay his years as a downsizing artist at Bain Capital, Perry can spend the campaign reminding voters that almost half of the new jobs in Obama's presidency were created on his watch in Texas.
What Perry doesn't have, though, is the kind of moderate facade that Americans look for in their presidents. He's the conservative id made flesh, with none of the postpartisan/uniter-not-a-divider spirit that successful national politicians usually cultivate.
Imagine if the Democratic Party nominated a combination of Al Franken and Nancy Pelosi for the presidency, and you have a sense of the kind of gamble Republicans would be taking with Perry. And even if that gamble worked, little in his record suggests that he's prepared to preside over a polarized country, or negotiate his way through a divided Washington.
Maybe Perry has hidden subtleties; maybe Romney has hidden convictions. But if this is a 1970s moment for America and the world, the Republican front-runners look more like John Connally and Gerald Ford than Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher.
So whose door should Republicans be knocking on instead? Unless Mitch Daniels changes his mind or Jeb Bush changes his last name, the only compelling possibility remaining is Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.
Of course Christie has ruled out running. (So had Perry, not so long ago.) Of course it would be an epic gamble on his part, since a loss would mark the end of his Garden State career. Of course Christie has obvious weaknesses: the brevity of his gubernatorial experience, the fact that he's more moderate than his party's base, the fact that it's been a hundred years since America elected a president with his avoirdupois.
But the looming Romney-Perry showdown throws Christie's strengths into sharp relief. Unlike the unloved Romney, Christie has a huge cheering section among movement conservatives, who love his combative style enough to forgive his ideological deviations. Unlike Perry, he's campaigned and governed outside the Republican Party's Sun Belt strongholds. Unlike both, he embodies the kind of voter who swings elections in America -- not a Mormon businessman or a cowboy-booted Texan, but a Catholic with middle-class roots born one state over from the Rust Belt.
Moreover, serving as the budget-cutting Republican governor of a Democratic state is a far, far better preparation for what awaits the next president than either Perry's small-government idyll or Romney's permanent campaign. In his brief New Jersey tenure, Christie has accomplished more, against more determined opposition, amid more media scrutiny and with more resilient poll numbers than almost any Great Recession politician.
Six months ago, the best argument for a Christie campaign was that the Republican Party needed him. That wasn't nearly enough to justify the risk. But if the country needs him? Then it might be worth considering.

HEADLINE: Indian Leader's Illness Prompts Questions, but Also Restraint

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Hari Kumar and Sruthi Gottipati contributed research.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- It has been 11 days since the announcement of the disappearance of Sonia Gandhi, the most powerful political figure in India. From all corners of the country, people have offered prayers and good wishes, even her political enemies. Yet what is most intriguing is that so few people are demanding that she be found.
Mrs. Gandhi's disappearance is voluntary, if startling. For more than a decade she has presided over the Indian National Congress Party, which made the Aug. 4 announcement such a surprise: she had left India for an undisclosed hospital in the United States to have surgery for an undisclosed condition. 
Questions begged for answers: Was her life in danger? Where was she? Would this affect the Congress Party-led coalition government? Yet few answers were provided.
Even now, Congress officials have released only the basic facts that Mrs. Gandhi, 64, has undergone ''successful'' surgery, has been released from intensive care and should return to India in a few weeks.
Rumors that she has cancer, or is being treated in New York, are unconfirmed. Some news outlets have published editorials calling for more disclosure. But in this raucously noisy political culture, Mrs. Gandhi's health has mostly elicited silence.
''The privacy of the family needs to be respected,'' said Sudheendra Kulkarni, an opposition commentator and a critic. ''It is not something that people are demanding to know.''
Symbolically, Mrs. Gandhi's health concerns mirror the weakened state of her party's coalition government. The current session of Parliament has so far produced only rancor, as opposition parties have shut down proceedings with angry, theatrical protests against corruption. A new national poll found that the government's credibility has been harmed by several major scandals, while critics and some allies complain of a leadership vacuum.
Even before Mrs. Gandhi's health problems, speculation had ebbed and flowed about whether Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would be moved aside before the next national elections in 2014. Mr. Singh and Mrs. Gandhi, who both enjoy reputations for rectitude, have dominated Indian politics since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government took power in 2004. Recently, though, the effectiveness of their arrangement has seemed to falter.
''It is perhaps the most directionless government the country has had in the last 20 years,'' said Yogendra Yadav, a social scientist. ''This is their seventh year in power, and people are beginning to see all the instances where the government isn't delivering where it said it would.''
Complaints are coming from all directions. Business leaders are frustrated over inaction on reforms on labor laws, foreign investment in retail and other issues. Social activists are planning a hunger strike to protest what they consider a watered-down bill to fight corruption. Leftists rail against rising inequality. A bill to create consistent, fair compensation policies when land is acquired for development is considered crucial, yet its passage is uncertain.
The strength of the Singh-Gandhi partnership has been a mutual lack of ego and a division of duties. Mr. Singh, the scholarly economist, has overseen the government and steered foreign policy. Mrs. Gandhi, the shy, Italian-born widow of Rajiv Gandhi, the assassinated former prime minister, has managed the internal politics and election campaigns of the Congress Party.
This role has made Mrs. Gandhi a ubiquitous figure at many party and government events, but otherwise she is largely shielded from public scrutiny. In the past decade, Mrs. Gandhi has almost never granted media interviews. Friends and political allies are loath to talk about her, knowing the family's intense obsession with privacy. This desire to avoid the spotlight is considered one reason that Mrs. Gandhi, who has twice delivered the Congress Party to national power, did not appoint herself prime minister.
Yet she has been a potent force on policy issues: She regularly meets with visiting heads of state and makes official overseas visits. She is an elected member of the lower house of Parliament. She also heads the National Advisory Council, a quasi-governmental body that writes social policy, a job that gives her a cabinet-level rank. And her influence is such that opposition leaders often belittle Mr. Singh as a junior partner.
Her status is why a handful of news media outlets have protested the secrecy about her health. ''In a democracy, the people have a right to know detailed information about the health of their leaders,'' The Business Standard newspaper wrote in an editorial, asking whether public money was being used for her medical care and noting that the issue raised serious questions about the future of the Congress Party. ''The entire nation would pray for her speedy recovery, but cannot be expected to shy away from raising these awkward questions.''
Yet, for the most part, the questions have remained tamped down. Some Indian journalists say they consider the issue off limits. Mr. Kulkarni, the opposition commentator, said Indians, in general, did not believe it is appropriate to pry into private matters like health or marital issues that are considered fair game in many Western nations.
''That just goes to show we are a different kind of society and we're a different culture,'' he said. ''In a time like this, it is not proper to demand information and transparency.''
At the Congress Party headquarters in New Delhi, Mrs. Gandhi's office was chained and padlocked last week, a standard security procedure when she is away.
Tom Vadakkan, secretary of the party's media department, said the public supported her desire for privacy. ''Medical conditions are sacrosanct in India,'' he said. ''Normally, we don't discuss medical history.'' He added: ''If Mrs. Gandhi feels this is a private matter, we respect her privacy. I'm told she's doing well. Maybe in three weeks she will be back with us.''
Monday is Independence Day, the anniversary of India's establishment as an independent democracy in 1947. Usually, Mrs. Gandhi raises a national flag on the grounds of the Congress Party headquarters; her absence this year will underscore questions about the future leadership. Her son, Rahul Gandhi, who heads the youth wing of the Congress Party, is her presumed heir and regarded as a likely future prime minister.
In her absence, Mrs. Gandhi has appointed a committee of four people to run the party, including her son. He has been at her side during her convalescence, but The Indian Express newspaper reported Sunday that he was returning to New Delhi for the holiday.
The Indian media is already asking whether he will be the one who raises the flag on Monday.

HEADLINE: After Iowa Vote, Republicans Face A New Landscape

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jeff Zeleny reported from Des Moines, and Michael D. Shear from Waterloo.

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Iowa -- The leading Republican presidential candidates scrambled to take command of a new landscape on Sunday after Tim Pawlenty abruptly ended his campaign and a three-way race began taking shape to find a nominee who can emerge as the strongest challenger to President Obama.
While Gov. Rick Perry of Texas had hoped to turn the contest into a two-man duel with Mitt Romney, he starts by facing Representative Michele Bachmann, whose weekend victory in the Iowa straw poll reordered the top tier of candidates. On the second day of his announcement tour, Mr. Perry sent a subtle message: making his first Iowa appearance in her hometown, but not taking her on directly.
While Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney each have emphasized cutting attacks on Mr. Obama, they now face the need to begin drawing distinctions with one another and set up what could be a long and hard-edged campaign for the party's nomination.
Their pitches often overlap, with Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney presenting themselves as job creators, while Mr. Perry and Mrs. Bachmann appeal to social conservatives. 
The contrasts are becoming increasingly clear as the slow-to-start campaign accelerates and candidates prepare to participate in three debates next month alone.
Mr. Obama is also stepping up his campaign. He will begin a three-day bus tour of the Midwest on Monday with appearances in Minnesota and Iowa, swooping into a region that is vital to his re-election to make a case that he has stabilized the economy and has the right prescriptions for continued improvement.
But as Republican optimism rises at the possibility of defeating Mr. Obama, a new air of urgency has gripped the nomination fight, with early strategies beginning to take shape.
Mrs. Bachmann is counting on a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses early in the new year. Mr. Romney is investing heavily in New Hampshire. Mr. Perry said he would not focus on a narrow strategy and pledged to compete in all corners of the country by emphasizing economic issues and his record of promoting job creation over the past decade in Texas.
''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Perry told supporters here, ''getting America working again is what the bulk of the people really care about.''
Mr. Romney appeared at a private fund-raiser in Nantucket, Mass., on Sunday and held no public campaign events. But in New Hampshire on Monday, aides said, he will continue his focus on the president and criticize his bus tour, avoiding becoming dragged into the back-and-forth of the Republican nominating contest until he has to.
Mrs. Bachmann, whose straw poll victory led Mr. Pawlenty to drop out of the race and solidified her role as a leading contender here in Iowa, is seeking to expand her appeal and win over voters who admire her passion but remain unsure of her level of experience. She appeared on all five Sunday morning talk shows, peppered with questions about her opposition to raising the debt ceiling, her views about gays and lesbians and the role that faith would play in a Bachmann administration.
''All of these kind of questions aren't what people are concerned about right now,'' Mrs. Bachmann said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' But pressed on the issues, she said, ''I think my views are clear.''
Mr. Pawlenty's abrupt departure from the race, after finishing a distant third in the straw poll, created one of the most significant ripples yet in the Republican nominating fight. While he struggled to generate the enthusiasm of Mrs. Bachmann's backers, he had a core group of loyal fund-raisers and supporters from Iowa to Florida that rival campaigns immediately started to pursue.
He said that he had no immediate plans to endorse another candidate.
Ray Washburne, a Dallas businessman and a top bundler for Mr. Pawlenty, said he received telephone calls from Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry on Sunday morning not long after Mr. Pawlenty announced his intention to leave the race. Both campaigns were aggressively pursuing political operatives, contributors and rank-and-file supporters.
''When the girlfriend breaks up with you,'' Mr. Washburne said, ''you're not ready to start dating just yet.''
Mrs. Bachmann's candidacy, which has rapidly gained visibility and credibility since she joined the race two months ago, has tapped into a sense of anger and frustration that voters have with Washington. Her engaging speaking style, personal connection with voters and appeal to conservative activists contributed to her victory at the straw poll on Saturday.
It remains an open question whether she can tap into the economic message that rival Republicans are building their candidacies around. But she signaled on Sunday that she has no intention of ceding the ground she has built in Iowa. When Mr. Perry made plans to hold his first Iowa appearance in her childhood hometown, Waterloo, she said she would join him.
The setting of their first meeting was the Electric Park Ballroom on the grounds of the National Cattle Congress in Waterloo, the same place Mrs. Bachmann held a rally on the eve of her announcement in June. As he entered the room, Mr. Perry declared: ''Man, y'all got a crowd here; this is awesome.''
''You'd think you were in Texas if you didn't know better,'' Mr. Perry said.
Mrs. Bachmann stayed on her campaign bus until Mr. Perry had finished speaking. She made no acknowledgment of her rival even as he sat at a dinner table just feet from where she stood. Mr. Perry applauded politely when Mrs. Bachmann criticized the president, but otherwise sat quietly during her speech.
Ed Rollins, the campaign manager for Mrs. Bachmann, said after the event that ''the debate will be there'' soon enough.
''We've got three to four debates in September,'' he said. ''We will all be on the same stage, and everybody gets to make their judgments.''
Mr. Perry's entrance is not likely to alter Mr. Romney's strategy, at least in the short term. Senior aides to Mr. Romney have long believed that they would face a social conservative who would emerge out of Iowa. The Romney campaign may be content to watch Mr. Perry and Mrs. Bachmann clash, but are waiting to see how Mr. Perry develops as a candidate before deciding their approach.
If Mrs. Bachmann emerges from that clash early next year in a stronger position than Mr. Perry, the contrast with Mr. Romney would be particularly sharp. But if Mr. Perry were to prevail, Mr. Romney is positioned to make the case that his experience in the private sector -- a businessman and the savior of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah -- trumps years as a politician in Texas.
For now, the campaign is unfolding as a Romney-Perry-Bachmann competition. But Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah and ambassador to China, is steadily raising criticism of Mr. Romney, reflecting his strategy of positioning himself as an alternative to Mr. Romney in New Hampshire. Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who finished a close second in the straw poll, could also influence the race with his strain of libertarian views that have become more popular in this economic climate.
''This is a very fluid situation right now,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said as he arrived at the Waterloo event on Sunday evening, the day after the straw poll delivered the first significant organizing test of the campaign. ''From here on, you are shooting with real bullets.''

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Downgrades, Upgrades and Doing Business in Britain

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do you agree that economic constraints can help you focus on what's important in your business?

What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
Around The World: Is It Safe to Do Business in Britain?
Well, my family and I just returned from our vacation in England, and here's what we saw.
The Downgrade: Reviewing the Reviewers
Standard & Poor's downgrades our debt. The S.&P. chief says to cut entitlements. Jared Bernstein agrees with him. Michael Moore says to arrest him. Ezra Klein thinks S.&P. got it right: "Those of us in Washington who would like to see the government work have long wondered when the business community and other entities who need a functioning political system would begin exerting a countervailing force." Economics of Contempt thinks S.&P. got it wrong: "They are, to put it very bluntly, idiots, and they deserve every bit of opprobrium coming their way." A blogger says"let's take a moment to remember that this shift to AA+ from AAA represents a healthy step (however slight) in the direction of reality and away from the fantasy created by the scores of dimwits that have held seat in Washington, D.C., over the past many decades." S.&P. also cuts the ratings on 11,000 municipal bond issues. Anita Campbell explains the impact of the downgrade on small businesses. China puts the United States on eBay. Jeff Miller gives the new deficit super-committee two-to-one odds of success.
The Downgrade 2: How About an Upgrade?
Speaking of downgrades, the Points Guy explainshow to upgrade to first class without paying for it.
The Data: Even the Sun's Issuing Warnings 
Stocks went on a frenzied ride last week (if we're in a bear market, let's hope it's this kind of bear). The Fed promises low interest rates and buoys the dollar. Gold soars. The Pulse of Commerce Index remains idle in July. Small-business optimism dips again. Quarterly non-farm productivity falls (pdf). The trade deficit expands. Forecasters predict severe solar storms. Job openings are unchanged. But ADP bets on small businesses to beat the dismal job reports, and unemployment applications hit a four-month low. The education bubble shows signs of bursting. But hold on, Dan Rather's still betting on the U.S.A. And Larry Kudlow says it's no time for panic: "It seems to me that the economy can hold up. It's not the kind of rapid growth I'd like to see. But it's not the deep and dark recession that seems to be embodied in the stock market plunge." Hale Stewart sees signs of a rebound. San Antonio businesses are showing higher optimism.
Red Tape Update: Fed Trucking Rules Could Be an Opportunity
The Veterans Administration is cracking down after an internal audit showed it had awarded millions of dollars' worth of contracts to companies that weren't actually owned by veterans or were otherwise ineligible. Some feel that new restaurant menu rules are a major headache for small businesses. New federal trucking regulations could increase opportunities for independent truck drivers and the Obama administration says the new standards will save $50 billion. A brave man defends tax breaks for private jets: "A host of measurements show companies using business aviation outperform those without aircraft across every key financial and non-financial measure of success." Hidden taxes on travelers add up. Barry Fisler, office comedian, introduces you to his work.
Women: Talking the Talk
A female entrepreneur explains why it's important to hire women for your start-up. One reason: "Women are more detail-oriented and comprehensive. In 2006, Louann Brizendine's controversial book, "The Female Brain," claimed that women speak three times the number of words that men do. At a start-up, this is an asset." A 12-year-old girl lets the music do the talking. Jessica Bennett explains why it's tougher for women than men: "Sure, we outpace the guys around us in high school, college, and post-graduate degrees. But there's a crucial shift that we're leaving out when we talk about the 'new gender gap' - that when women reach a certain age, most of these trends reverse themselves." John Stamos teaches guys how to cuddle.

An Intuit blogger lists five small-business contests worth entering. If your company is weird and explosive you could be eligible for $500,000. Small-business owners are turning to pawn shops. NASA picks a few small companies to build spaceships.
Retail: Consumers Are Getting Smarter
Retail sales rose the most in four months. First Data's latest Spend Trend report shows consumers spent less on credit cards in July, started shopping more at value retailers, and purchased fewer discretionary items. A blogger says, "New research shows that consumers are finally making progress in improving their overall financial condition. To put it simply they are getting smarter about money."

Groupon's founders get behind a start-up that negotiates group prices. A new study reveals the nation's top 10 consumer complaints and another says that American shoppers will spend more on good service. American consumers spend less than 2 percent on goods made in China. A new lid enhances the flavor of coffee.

This Week's Bests
Way to Sleep Better With Technology Lifehacker's Adam Dachis explains how technology helps him sleep better: "There are a few sleep-tracking tools that actually provide you with a pretty good picture of what's happening while you're unconscious. While these tools may not be as detailed as a sleep clinic, they can give you a good overview of how restful the night was and you can use this information to figure out what causes sleep problems for you and how you can have a more restful night."
New Way to Find Happiness Henri Juntilla offers seven steps to improve your happiness, for example: "Embrace Death. What is it that you really want to do with your life? What are some of the excuses, fears, and obstacles that are stopping you from doing that? And how do you think you can overcome those and start moving toward what it is that your heart truly wants? If you answer the above questions seriously, you may just find yourself strangely motivated to start taking action. There's nothing like following your heart when it comes to feeling happy and joyful."
See the Silver Lining Pamela Slim says there are upsides to economic constraints: "The global economy just delivered us a handy set of economic constraints. There is less time to dilly-dally on the road to building a business. You need to take action today. There are fewer fat pockets of easy money. You need to identify and dig deeply into the profitable veins of the market. There is less tolerance for poor performance or mediocre employees. You must step up your game or be moved out."
Question: Do you agree that economic constraints can help you focus on what's important in your business?

HEADLINE: The Credit Rating War

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Whether or not the downgrade of United States debt was merited, there are fundamental conflicts in the business model of credit ratings agencies that regulations need to address, an economist writes.

 BODY:
The continuing brouhaha over Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States government's credit rating offers a powerful lesson in institutional economics.
In standard economic models of "efficient markets," we can all easily obtain the accurate information we need to make good decisions. In the real world, we often cannot, in part because so much mis- and disinformation competes for our attention.
Many economic actors have an incentive to lie and cheat, and it is often hard to figure which ones actually do. Markets work best in an institutional environment that creates strong incentives for everyone to tell the truth.
Whether you call this institutional environment law and order or, more specifically, regulation, it's not easy to design because it is so easily corrupted. Those who anticipate the largest potential gains or losses typically dominate the decision-making process.
Some observers, as well as some representatives of the Obama administration, view the Standard & Poor's downgrade as a strategic effort to retaliate against regulatory changes that would adversely affect the company as well as a political intervention in the deficit-reduction debate.

Their fury was intensified when John Bellows, acting assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, discovered a significant informational error (a miscalculation amounting to $2 trillion) in Standard & Poor's initial explanation of the rating change. The rating agency declined to change its assessment after the error was pointed out.
Most Republicans interpreted the rating change as support for their insistence on deeper budget cuts, although some were perhaps chastened by Standard & Poor's emphasis on a crisis of governance induced by resistance to compromise.
Yet there is widespread bipartisan agreement that our dependence on the current credit ratings system is dysfunctional.
Ratings provide a far simpler and more comparable measure of creditworthiness than an in-depth analysis of every company's balance sheet can offer. Reports from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, the three most prominent agencies recognized as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations help guide both individual and institutional investment decisions.
But the ratings that these companies provide are often incredibly misleading. Their epic disregard of mortgage-backed derivative scams contributed to the near-collapse of the financial sector in 2008.
In general, ratings tend to follow the market rather than to inform it and may even worsen information problems, by giving investors a false sense of security. Rating companies argue that they can't be held legally liable for mistakes, because this would infringe on their free speech (an argument that will eventually be tested in court).
These failures are clearly linked to a basic flaw in institutional design: credit agencies receive payment from the very companies they rate, not the potential buyers who seek information about those companies.
Imagine baseball umpires who could be hired and fired by one team, movie reviewers paid entirely by Hollywood or restaurant critics who depend on the chefs they evaluate for every meal. All these arrangements violate a basic economic principle that incentives should be aligned to encourage rather than discourage honesty.
Conservatives sometimes play down this issue, emphasizing instead that government regulation has squelched competition by requiring many institutions to meet targets for portfolio composition based on ratings by the top three firms.
But these two problems are not mutually exclusive. The links between them have long been emphasized by scholars like Frank Partnoy, who published a detailed law review article on the topic in 1999.
It's not regulation per se that causes the problem, but bad regulation that could, in principle, be fixed. Thanks in part to the efforts of Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act outlines a number of specific policies that would diminish the influence of the top three rating firms.
These policies won't solve the misinformation problem, but they could substantially reduce it. (For a more detailed analysis of this issue, see this working paper by my University of Massachusetts colleagues Gerald Epstein and Robert Pollin.)
Of course, these policies will also reduce the profitability of the rating agencies. And implementation of Dodd-Frank as a whole faces enormous resistance, manifest in Congressional maneuvers to starve the Securities and Exchange Commission of money necessary for its effective enforcement.
The credit rating war is likely to escalate. Large institutional investors and hedge funds, with their hefty research departments, will be able to rise above the fray. Small investors trying to garner the information they need to make intelligent investments in stocks and bonds will continue to suffer casualties.
As for ordinary workers - they are just part of the supply chain. The business community has already lowered their rating far below investment grade.

HEADLINE: For Coal Plants, a Game of Chicken

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Utilities eye one another in considering whether to shut down plants or install scrubbing equipment when new environmental rules take effect.

 BODY:
 In an article in Friday's paper, I described how some companies that operate dirty coal-fired power plants are playing chicken as they face a decision on whether to retire them or install expensive scrubbers and filters. They are waiting to see what their neighbors will do as new environmental rules take effect: as with two restaurants in a town that can support only one, if your neighbor goes out of business, more business comes to you, and prices may well rise.
 In fact, in the largest grid jurisdiction in North America, the one operated by PJM Interconnection, money comes to plant owners in several different ways. The biggest is selling energy, or kilowatt-hours, and that price varies by time of day. Plants in areas where there is a lot of congestion on the grid and new supplies cannot easily be shipped in will enjoy something close to a monopoly and take in very high revenues on peak summer days. 
 American Electric Power, a multistate utility based in Columbus, Ohio, has been arguing that if it and its competitors close some big low-cost plants, customers will face abrupt rate increases of 10 to 35 percent. The nature of the PJM market magnifies the importance of losing a cheap generator; all producers get the same payment, equal to the highest-cost generation running, and if a low-cost generator is retired, then the most expensive generator needed to replace it will set a higher price for everyone.

 But the consulting firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance identifies a second mechanism by which prices will increase. In PJM and in parallel organizations covering New York,New England, the upper Midwest and California, electric generating stations are selling several services at once, each with its own price. 
The simpler thing they sell is electricity, which is priced in units of megawatt-hours. A megawatt-hour, or 1,000 kilowatt-hours, is the amount of energy that a suburban house uses in a month or so. But they also sell capacity: each utility that serves customers has to go into the wholesale market and buy not only energy but the actual availability of generation. 
There are few parallels outside the electricity world; it is as if a restaurant charged upfront for a reservation for a table, independent of the price of the food. The way the electric system works, the equivalent in a restaurant would mean paying for a table of adequate size, whether or not everybody showed up.
The capacity market is not only a way to compensate generators; it can also be used to set a value on the services of "demand response"companies. Those are companies that line up electricity customers who agree, in exchange for a payment, to turn off their equipment on peak days. 
Companies that serve retail electricity customers must buy as much capacity as the retail customers used in their last peak load day, plus a margin. And this summer, many of the companies had new peak loads. 
Eventually electricity customers pay for both the energy and the capacity. The mechanism is intended to compensate generators that sit idle much of the year but are really important on hot days. The price also serves as a signal to companies thinking about building new plants; if it rises high enough, they know it is time to build. 
Capacity payments have mostly been low in the last few years because the recession has cut demand for electricity and supply has been high relative to demand in the auctions or individual deals between utilities that serve customers and companies that own generation.
In a research note released late Friday, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said that capacity payments in 2014 and 2015 would reach a level equal to $7 per megawatt-hour of electricity sold - in other words, about $7 on the monthly bill of that suburban house, or seven-tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour. The national average retail price of a kilowatt-hour is about 10 cents, although in some parts of the Northeast it can be triple that amount. 
Higher capacity payments are one of the mechanisms through which surviving electric plants will get the revenue needed for add-on antipollution devices. 
Charles Blanchard, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance and author of the research note, said in an e-mail that capacity payments may reach 25 percent of total revenues as supply is reduced.
For the Independent System Operators, or I.S.O.'s, like PJM, the capacity problem will become more important as fewer generators are coal- or gas-fired power plants, which can be switched on at will to meet peak load, and more are wind or solar, which must be compensated for times it is not sunny or windy. 
"This trend is going to continue, as intermittent resources like wind and solar force I.S.O.'s to pay to keep gas-peaking plants online even though they're not used enough to be profitable based on electricity sales,'' Mr. Blanchard said in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Oh! What A Lovely War!

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Lessons from WWII, wasted on some people.

 BODY:
World War II is the great natural experiment in the effects of large increases in government spending, and as such has always served as an important positive example for those of us who favor an activist approach to a depressed economy. Christy Romer is very much on the same wavelength. 
It's especially relevant because in the 1930s, as today, many wise heads insisted that unemployment was structural, that many of the unemployed could not be gainfully employed no matter how much demand increased. Then demand actually did increase, and as Christy says,
But World War II has something to tell us here, too. Because nearly 10 million men of prime working age were drafted into the military, there was a huge skills gap between the jobs that needed to be done on the home front and the remaining work force. Yet businesses and workers found a way to get the job done. Factories simplified production methods and housewives learned to rivet.
Here the lesson is that demand is crucial - and that jobs don't go unfilled for long. If jobs were widely available today, unemployed workers would quickly find a way to acquire needed skills or move to where the jobs were located. 
Oddly, however, people on the right have taken to claiming that World War II actually weakens the case for stimulus. One line, due to Robert Barro, is that it shows fiscal expansion failing because private spending actually fell. Duh. As Christy says, there was consumer rationing -- spending was forced to fall. Also, something she doesn't note, there were severe restrictions on private construction, which meant that investment not related to the war effort was also forced to fall.
Recent work by Gordon and Krenn takes this even further by looking at the effects of the prewar defense buildup:
After reviewing evidence from the 1940-41 editions of Business Week, Fortune, and The New York Times, Gordon and Krenn document that the American economy went to war starting in June 1940, fully 18 months before Pearl Harbor. In February 1941 fully one percent of the American labor force was at work building army training camps for 1.4 million new draftees. Employment in ship-building to expand the U. S. Navy and to supply Lend-Lease aid to Britain accounted for another one percent of the labor force in 1941. As early as June 1941, capacity utilization had reached 100 percent in the production of iron and steel and durable goods of all types. 
And they show that during the period before capacity constraints were hit, the multiplier was actually fairly high.
But never mind. Matt Yglesias heroically actually reads Rick Perry's book, and learns that 
- 9. Private Enterprise Blossomed Under Conscription and Wartime Price Controls: Not only does he argue that the New Deal failed to end the Great Depression, but he asserts "recovery did not come until World War II, when FDR was finally persuaded to unleash private enterprise." (page 48)
Nothing shakes the faith of a true believer.

HEADLINE: How Far Should Consumers Unwind Debt?

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Economists say that debt still has a way to come down before the economy will return to full health, but the target is elusive.

 BODY:
In an article today, Tara Siegel Bernard and I examined whether the Fed's announcement that it would keep credit cheap for two more years would inspire more people to borrow and spend.
 Aside from consumer confidence, which is decidedly shaky, a crucial underlying factor holding back borrowing is that families are still paying off debt accumulated during the boom, when credit was easy and people treated their homes like big A.T.M.'s. 
 According to an analysis from Moody's Analytics, total household debt peaked in August 2008 at $12.41 trillion and has come down by about $1.2 trillion.
 As a proportion of gross domestic product, household debt peaked at 99.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009, and has come down to just under 90 percent. 
 Economists, who talk about the "deleveraging" process, say that debt still has a way to come down before the economy will return to full health. Just how far it needs to come down, though, is difficult to say.

 As recently as 2000, household debt was less than 70 percent of G.D.P., and in 1990 it was around 60 percent. 
Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the co-author, with Carmen M. Reinhart, of "This Time Is Different," a history of financial crises, has repeatedly cautioned that this recovery would take longer than most other recoveries because this recession was caused by a debt-fueled financial crisis.
 But even Mr. Rogoff does not have a specific target in mind for how far debt has to decline before households will feel comfortable adding debt again.
 It may not have to go as low as it has been in previous decades, he said, because "financial markets deepened and became more sophisticated, and interest rates have been coming down, which allows households to carry higher debt," Mr. Rogoff said.
 He said that studies of financial crises outside the United States have shown that economies generally retrace their steps -- in other words, if the ratio of household debt to G.D.P. doubled during the boom that preceded the bust, then the ratio needs to half again in order for the economy to get back to normal consumption patterns.
Whether that would be the case in the United States, Mr. Rogoff said, "I'm hesitant to say." But, he added, "the overhang of debt really is the major problem for policy makers." Mr. Rogoff suggests a mix of forgiving some of the housing related debt (perhaps in exchange for homeowners' giving up gains from future appreciation in their home values) and pursuing a mild inflationary policy.

HEADLINE: MMT, Again

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Still wrong.

 BODY:
In a way, I really should not spend time debating the Modern Monetary Theory guys. They're on my side in current policy debates, and it's unlikely that they'll ever have the kind of real -- and really bad -- influence that the Austrians have lately acquired. But I really don't feel like getting right back to textbook revision, so here's another shot.
First of all, yes, I have read various MMT manifestos -- this one is fairly clear as they go. I do dislike the style -- the claims that fundamental principles of logic lead to a worldview that only fools would fail to understand has a sort of eerie resemblance to John Galt's speech in -- but that shouldn't matter.
But I do get the premise that modern governments able to issue fiat money can't go bankrupt, never mind whether investors are willing to buy their bonds. And it sounds right if you look at it from a certain angle. But it isn't.
Let's have a more or less concrete example. Suppose that at some future date -- a date at which private demand for funds has revived, so that there are lending opportunities -- the US government has committed itself to spending equal to 27 percent of GDP, while the tax laws only lead to 17 percent of GDP in revenues. And consider what happens in that case under two scenarios. In the first, investors believe that the government will eventually raise revenue and/or cut spending, and are willing to lend enough to cover the deficit. In the second, for whatever reason, investors refuse to buy US bonds. 
The second case poses no problem, say the MMTers, or at least no worse problem than the first: the US government can simply issue money, crediting it to banks, to pay its bills. 
But what happens next?
We're assuming that there are lending opportunities out there, so the banks won't leave their newly acquired reserves sitting idle; they'll convert them into currency, which they lend to individuals. So the government indeed ends up financing itself by printing money, getting the private sector to accept pieces of green paper in return for goods and services. And I think the MMTers agree that this would lead to inflation; I'm not clear on whether they realize that a deficit financed by money issue is more inflationary than a deficit financed by bond issue.
For it is. And in my hypothetical example, it would be quite likely that the money-financed deficit would lead to hyperinflation.
The point is that there are limits to the amount of real resources that you can extract through seigniorage. When people expect inflation, they become reluctant to hold cash, which drive prices up and means that the government has to print more money to extract a given amount of real resources, which means higher inflation, etc.. Do the math, and it becomes clear that any attempt to extract too much from seigniorage -- more than a few percent of GDP, probably -- leads to an infinite upward spiral in inflation. In effect, the currency is destroyed. This would not happen, even with the same deficit, if the government can still sell bonds.
The point is that under normal, non-liquidity-trap conditions, the direct effects of the deficit on aggregate demand are by no means the whole story; it matters whether the government can issue bonds or has to rely on the printing press. And while it may literally be true that a government with its own currency can't go bankrupt, it can destroy that currency if it loses fiscal credibility.
Now, I am not predicting hyperinflation for the US -- I am not Peter Schiff! Most of our current deficit is cyclical, and even in the long run a modest return of political rationality would make the budget issue eminently solvable. But the MMT people are just wrong in believing that the only question you need to ask about the budget deficit is whether it supplies the right amount of aggregate demand; financeability matters too, even with fiat money.
OK, I have no illusions that this will convince anyone in this area. (Can you imagine John Galt admitting that he was wrong?) But I thought I should put it down.

HEADLINE: No Credit? No Problem

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The small businesses we surveyed -- unscientifically -- are not looking for credit.

 BODY:
One of the most important questions for small businesses hovering through all of the tumult of the last three years is whether they've been able to get the credit they need. The question has been hotly debated - even becoming a partisan issue last year, when Congress wrestled with the small-business lending fund that ultimately became law in the small-business jobs act. Banks tell anyone who will listen that they are eager to lend to any creditworthy business they can find. Republicans tend to put it slightly differently: small businesses that deserve credit can get it, but many are too cautious to make investments right now. Many Democrats and some small-business advocates say a good loan is hard to find.
Last Thursday, when we asked small-business owners around the country how they were faring in this new period of uncertainty, one of the things we wanted to know was whether they needed credit, and if so, whether it was available to them. And while our informal survey was small and hardly scientific, it will not reassure those who think making credit available is the chief solution to small-business woes. None of the businesses we asked told us they were having trouble getting a loan.
Several were making new investments. Sahadi's, the Middle Eastern food emporium in Brooklyn, hopes to expand its store to vacant space nearby. But the Sahadi family, which employs about 45 people, isn't worried about not getting the loan it needs to undertake construction. "Our relationship with our financial institution is still very good," said Bob Sahadi. "I mean we've had no reason to give them grief, and they have no reason to give us grief - we've both been good to each other."
In Toledo, Ohio, Mancy's Restaurant Group is adding a catering business to the four restaurants it already operates. But rather than borrow a million or two to buy a building and dedicate it to the new business, the Mancy family opted for a more modest course. "At our central office we have a commissary where we bake bread and have a butcher shop for our restaurants, and we're in the process and we have converted part of this facility to also prepare catered food," Gus Mancy said. The family is relying on "existing community assets" to host the events they cater. "At the big art museum in town we just found out Friday we're the preferred caterer, and the only caterer named right now," Mr. Mancy added.
Like Mr. Mancy, Scott Tate, of Tate Technology, a contract electronics manufacturer that employs 35 people in Spokane, Wash., was not eager to take on more debt. "We're always looking at updating our equipment," he said. "Obviously, to do that we would pay cash. We're not going to go out and borrow money to do it. But, he added, he was not in any rush to make the investment, given the current climate. "If you're trying to sell me a piece of capital equipment four years ago, I'd probably be a lot more interested," he sad. "Now I'm not too sure I want to go spend any money."
Here's one other thing Tate Technology and Mancy's Restaurant Group have in common, besides thriftiness: both are succeeding in part because competitors have failed. Mancy's, Mr. Mancy said, was filling a void left when other Toledo caterers closed their doors. And Mr. Tate said that his business has grown over the last three years because of a more aggressive sales strategy but also because several competitors shuttered. "We lost three contract electronic manufacturers in the Spokane area in the last three years," he said. "There used to be six, now there's three. Back before the dot-com crash in the late Nineties there were nine or 10 of us. The customers that they were servicing obviously have probably gone down, but they're still around. So that lower volume has to go somewhere else."
They weren't alone. Dan Pratt, owner of Pratt's Pets and Feed in suburban Phoenix, said that this year he's seen his best sales of the past decade - buoyed in part by less competition. "There were two stores very close to us that went out of business right away when things started getting pretty bad," he said. "So we recouped those customers as best we could because they were in our proximity."
They say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In the case of at least some of the small businesses that survived the last recession, that seems to be true.
How about your business? Have you benefited from the loss of competitors? Have you struggled to get credit?

HEADLINE: No Credit? No Problem

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The small businesses we surveyed -- unscientifically -- are not looking for credit.

 BODY:
One of the most important questions for small businesses hovering through all of the tumult of the last three years is whether they've been able to get the credit they need. The question has been hotly debated - even becoming a partisan issue last year, when Congress wrestled with the small-business lending fund that ultimately became law in the small-business jobs act. Banks tell anyone who will listen that they are eager to lend to any creditworthy business they can find. Republicans tend to put it slightly differently: small businesses that deserve credit can get it, but many are too cautious to make investments right now. Many Democrats and some small-business advocates say a good loan is hard to find.
Last Thursday, when we asked small-business owners around the country how they were faring in this new period of uncertainty, one of the things we wanted to know was whether they needed credit, and if so, whether it was available to them. And while our informal survey was small and hardly scientific, it will not reassure those who think making credit available is the chief solution to small-business woes. None of the businesses we asked told us they were having trouble getting a loan.
Several were making new investments. Sahadi's, the Middle Eastern food emporium in Brooklyn, hopes to expand its store to vacant space nearby. But the Sahadi family, which employs about 45 people, isn't worried about not getting the loan it needs to undertake construction. "Our relationship with our financial institution is still very good," said Bob Sahadi. "I mean we've had no reason to give them grief, and they have no reason to give us grief - we've both been good to each other."
In Toledo, Ohio, Mancy's Restaurant Group is adding a catering business to the four restaurants it already operates. But rather than borrow a million or two to buy a building and dedicate it to the new business, the Mancy family opted for a more modest course. "At our central office we have a commissary where we bake bread and have a butcher shop for our restaurants, and we're in the process and we have converted part of this facility to also prepare catered food," Gus Mancy said. The family is relying on "existing community assets" to host the events they cater. "At the big art museum in town we just found out Friday we're the preferred caterer, and the only caterer named right now," Mr. Mancy added.
Like Mr. Mancy, Scott Tate, of Tate Technology, a contract electronics manufacturer that employs 35 people in Spokane, Wash., was not eager to take on more debt. "We're always looking at updating our equipment," he said. "Obviously, to do that we would pay cash. We're not going to go out and borrow money to do it. But, he added, he was not in any rush to make the investment, given the current climate. "If you're trying to sell me a piece of capital equipment four years ago, I'd probably be a lot more interested," he sad. "Now I'm not too sure I want to go spend any money."
Here's one other thing Tate Technology and Mancy's Restaurant Group have in common, besides thriftiness: both are succeeding in part because competitors have failed. Mancy's, Mr. Mancy said, was filling a void left when other Toledo caterers closed their doors. And Mr. Tate said that his business has grown over the last three years because of a more aggressive sales strategy but also because several competitors shuttered. "We lost three contract electronic manufacturers in the Spokane area in the last three years," he said. "There used to be six, now there's three. Back before the dot-com crash in the late Nineties there were nine or 10 of us. The customers that they were servicing obviously have probably gone down, but they're still around. So that lower volume has to go somewhere else."
They weren't alone. Dan Pratt, owner of Pratt's Pets and Feed in suburban Phoenix, said that this year he's seen his best sales of the past decade - buoyed in part by less competition. "There were two stores very close to us that went out of business right away when things started getting pretty bad," he said. "So we recouped those customers as best we could because they were in our proximity."
They say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In the case of at least some of the small businesses that survived the last recession, that seems to be true.
How about your business? Have you benefited from the loss of competitors? Have you struggled to get credit?

HEADLINE: Was There Insider Trading on S.&P.'s Downgrade?

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Even if the Securities and Exchange Commission finds that information Standard &#038; Poor's downgrade of the United States' debt was improperly disclosed, proving insider trading will be very difficult.

 BODY:
The Financial Times reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission has started a preliminary inquiry into whether Standard & Poor's employees selectively leaked information about the impending downgrade of the United States' debt rating to AA+ from AAA, a decision that roiled the financial markets. This appears to be a prelude to investigating whether any investors used that information to profit before S.&P. officially disclosed the debt downgrade on Aug. 5.
Even if the S.E.C. finds that the information was improperly disclosed, proving insider trading will be difficult. And while S.&P. and other credit rating agencies are required to adopt policies to prevent such disclosure, it is questionable whether just leaking information violates any federal regulations, even if it breaches a corporate confidentiality policy.
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, sent a letter to Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, stating that "it is appropriate for the commission to conduct an investigation into whether S.&P. selectively disclosed information related to the U.S. government debt downgrade to any financial institutions, and whether any institutions that had that nonpublic information traded on that information prior to the official announcement."
Insider trading requires proof that material nonpublic information was used in trading securities in advance of its public disclosure. The first step is showing that information about the downgrade was not already available in the financial markets.
S.&P. announced on July 14 [link below] that it had placed America's sovereign debt on credit watch with "negative implications," indicating that a downgrade was potentially in the offing because of the political wrangling over raising the debt ceiling. And the Egan-Jones Credit Ratings Company, a much smaller credit rating agency, had downgraded American debt three weeks before S.&P. did. 
It is arguable whether S.&P.'s announcement on Aug. 5 of the rating change was all that confidential, given the speculation about it. Investors profiting from the debt downgrade can claim there was sufficient information in the market about the likelihood of S.&P.'s decision, much like the "mosaic theory" offered in the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the head of the Galleon Group hedge fund, on insider trading charges.
Assuming information about the downgrade was confidential, it must also be material, which means a reasonable investor would consider it important. This seems to be an easy element to establish because the wild gyrations in the market on the first trading day after the downgrade shows how investors viewed it.
The problem with proving materiality is that the information must be material to a particular security, so the question is, "Material as to what?" In the typical insider trading case, the information impacts a specific company, or at least a particular industry. That does not appear to be the case with the debt downgrade, whose impact was felt across almost every market, from stocks and bonds to commodities and derivatives.
In Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo, the Supreme Court held that in private securities fraud cases, one element of proving a violation is "loss causation," which requires showing "a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss." While that element does not apply in S.E.C. insider trading cases, it still must be shown that the disclosure of confidential information caused the value of the securities to rise or fall, and that a defendant profited from the change in value.
While the S.&P. downgrade certainly affected the markets, there were a number of other factors that likely contributed to the wide swings seen in the equity markets, like concerns over possible European sovereign debt defaults and a possible double-dip recession. In the Dura Pharmaceuticals case, the Supreme Court noted that "changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events, which taken separately or together account for some or all of "the fluctuation in the price of a security."
If it can be shown that S.&P. employees disclosed material nonpublic information, the next step is identifying who used the information in trading. The company warned the government about the downgrade, and Washington is not known for its ability to keep secrets.
The typical insider trading case involves tracing backward from a profitable trade to identify the source of the information, like when a trader makes an outsize gain by buying stock or options immediately before a takeover announcement. With the debt downgrade, it is not clear where the S.E.C. would start to look for improper trading. 
The securities directly affected by S.&P.'s announcement were United States Treasury bonds, but they rose in value rather than declined, the opposite of what one would expect on a downgrade.
On Aug. 5, the stock market closed down before the announcement and then suffered a precipitous decline the following Monday. That would seem to put the focus on those who shorted stocks, but the fact that it seemed like almost every stock declined that day would make it hard to show any particular company was specifically impacted by the downgrade rather than just caught up in the market's downward momentum.
The mere disclosure of confidential information is not a securities law violation, which only occurs when the information is used to trade. The fact that a S.&P. employee might have selectively disclosed the debt downgrade before its official announcement would not violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 unless the person gave the information with the understanding that the recipient would trade on it, i.e. "tipping." Without a link to a particular trader, there is no case for the S.E.C. to pursue against the company.
The credit rating agencies are required to take steps to keep their information confidential because it can have such a great effect on the markets. S.E.C. Rule 17g-4 requires the credit rating firms to adopt written policies and procedures prohibiting "[t]he inappropriate dissemination within and outside the nationally recognized statistical rating organization of a pending credit rating action before issuing the credit rating on the Internet or through another readily accessible means." 
To meet that requirement, S.&P.'s "confidential and sensitive information" policy provides:
"Employees must not disclose - even to other employees of ratings services or to personnel from Standard & Poor's or the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. - pending rating actions, the specific deliberations of a rating committee, or any other confidential information with respect to a credit rating unless the other employee needs to know the information in order to appropriately perform his or her credit rating activities or related oversight responsibilities."
Leaking information to banks and other investors about the impending debt downgrade would clearly violate the company's policy, but it is not clear whether that disclosure would also violate Rule 17g-4. That provision only requires S.&P. to have in place "policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent" such disclosure, but does not provide for any punishment of the firm by the S.E.C. if there is a violation of its internal policy.
The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, 15 U.S.C.  778o-7, authorizes the S.E.C. to suspend or even revoke the registration of a credit rating agency that violates the federal securities laws. Insider trading would certainly constitute such a violation, but it does not look like that case could be proven based only on disclosure of information about the debt downgrade without showing it was given to someone to actually profit on it.

HEADLINE: Washington, Capital of Economic Optimism

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In every state, a majority of residents think the economy is getting worse, but in the nation's capital, however, a full 60 percent of people think the economy is getting better, Gallup finds.

 BODY:
In case you're wondering why Congress spent so much time twisting itself in knots over the long-term deficit, instead of over the current jobs crisis, this might help explain things: Washington, D.C., is the most economically optimistic area in the nation, according to Gallup.
Every day Gallup polls Americans across the country about whether they think current economic conditions are good (or "excellent," "only fair" or "poor"), and whether the economy is getting better or worse. For each question, Gallup subtracts the percentage of people answering negatively from the percentage of people answering positively. Then the two results are averaged to come up with a value that Gallup calls the Economic Confidence Index.
If the index value is above zero, that means that people are generally confident about the economy. If the index value is below zero, then people are more pessimistic about the economy.
And guess what? Not only does Washington have the highest index value of any state or district in the country, it's also the place where the index value is positive.
Here are the top 10 states in terms of overall economic confidence:
These results are based on telephone interviews with 87,634 employed adults, 18 or older, conducted from January to June 2011 as part of Gallup Daily tracking. For each state, the margin of sampling error ranges from plus or minus 1 percentage point (for large states such as California), to plus or minus 8 percentage points (for the District of Columbia).
The biggest gap between the District of Columbia and the rest of the country is created by the second question used to create the Economic Confidence Index, on whether the economy is getting better or worse.
In every state, a majority of residents think the economy is getting worse. In the nation's capital, however, a full 60 percent of people think the economy is getting better.
This may be good evidence for those arguing that Washington exists in its own disconnected bubble. At the very least, Gallup's results show that the District of Columbia thinks very differently about the state of the economy than the rest of the country does.

HEADLINE: An Index for Ocean Health

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: The index, anticipated next February, measures the ability of marine ecosystems to thrive and to support human livelihoods - goals that are often in tension.

 BODY:
What has been billed as the "Dow Jones of ocean health" is six months from release, and Ben Halpern is feeling the pressure. "We're frantically wrapping up analyses," Dr. Halpern, a research biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said in a telephone interview.
Just as traders use various stock indices to monitor the global economy, micro-analyzing each blip, a team of nearly 50 scientists from many disciplines is designing an analogous tool to track the health of the world's oceans and the implications for human well-being. (Dr. Halpern is part of a core team of 15 scientists who work on the index daily.)
The Ocean Health Index, a collaborative project of the group Conservation International, the National Geographic Society, the New England Aquarium, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and the Synthesis and the Sea Around Us project, measures, country by country, the ability of marine ecosystems to thrive and to support human livelihoods - goals that are often in tension. The index aggregates complex data into a single numerical score for every country.
With a maximum possible score of 100, the number measures how well a country fares in achieving optimal oceanic conditions and management practices; the lower the score, the worse conditions are.

"It's easy to get lost in the hierarchy," Dr. Halpern said of the final scores. The index actually nests measurement within measurement: each country's score is based on 10 broad goals of ocean health like water cleanliness and biodiversity, and each of those goals relies on a more specific set of metrics.
Water cleanliness is, for example, subdivided into pathogens, chemical pollution, nutrient pollution, toxic contamination, trash and so forth. Metrics that are deemed more important carry greater weight. Along a beach heavily trafficked by tourists, for example, pathogens may carry greater weight than they do in Acadia National Park, where the aesthetic disruption from litter might be more problematic.
Over all, about 100 metrics are used to compile the index, which the team hopes to update at least once a year. Updating the scores will give policymakers an overview of ocean health trends over time and allow them to map out coordinated remedial efforts and conservation policies.
This ranking structure, both expansive and infinitesimal, has never before been applied to the oceans on a global scale. The index is also unique in its attention to the link between oceans and people, Dr. Halpern, said, noting that past examinations of marine health have tended to focus on pristineness as if the ocean were an untouchable wilderness.
"But the reality is we all like what the ocean provides - food to eat, a beach for recreating," he said. "If these use values are not incorporated into conservation, then any solution will be doomed from the start. Solutions have to revolve around how people benefit."
Data for the index are drawn from national databases and cover the exclusive economic zone of each coastal country - the marine territory extending 200 miles from shore over which nations maintain sovereignty. Yet the index offers the potential for a profusion of case studies on varying scales, from the health of the Long Island Sound or San Francisco Bay to large-scale analyses of the Mediterranean Sea or the vast open waters of the Pacific.
Stephen Katona, a former president of the College of the Atlantic, oversees the index, which combines two projects once independently assessing global ocean health and was seeded through contributions from several individual and corporate donors.
Thirty months later, challenges remain. A precise definition of 'health,' for example, appears elusive. "A booming whale-watching industry may come at the expense of thriving fisheries, while an emphasis on unpolluted waters may constrain coastal economies, three leading scientists contributing to the index noted in a recent article. "It is no trivial task to answer the question: healthy to whom?"
What is more, the data can be inconsistent in quality and quantity. The seas are vast and poorly explored, with many sections of ocean floor mapped less finely than the surface of Mars. "When you work at the global scale especially, and in the ocean particularly, there is always the issue of missing data," Dr. Halpern said.
Yet identifying the critical gaps in local and global ocean data yields benefits for researchers, allowing them to optimize their time and resources in the future.
Efficient problem-solving seems critical at this point, given that many scientists believe that humans are currently at risk of causing a global mass marine extinction event - the sixth to take place in 600 million years.
"We hope the index will stimulate more concerted and sustained actions" on ocean issues, Dr. Katona said. "We're trying to take an optimistic view -- if we apply enough time, money and political will to these problems, we can bring them under control. We can mitigate them, probably even solve them."

HEADLINE: Growing Older in an Urban Village

BYLINE: NIHARIKA MANDHANA


HIGHLIGHT: A two-year-old nonprofit serving 165 households, Lincoln Park Village in Chicago was organized by older adults who want to age at home. More than 60 such villages, modeled on Boston's decade-old Beacon Hill Village, have been started, and 100 more are in development.

 BODY:
Lois Stack, 63, planned to be on a plane to Los Angeles in less than 48 hours to attend her daughter's baby shower when her 77-year-old husband slipped on ice, breaking one wrist and spraining the other. If she wanted to make the trip, she'd have to find someone competent and affordable - and trustworthy - to help her husband cook, shower and eat while she was away. And she'd have to do it quickly.
So Mrs. Stack called Lincoln Park Village, an organization for seniors in her Chicago neighborhood.
The next day, a home care aide arrived from Relief Medical Services, an agency the village had vetted and recommended. Because the Stacks were members of the village, they paid 14 percent less than they would have had they approached the agency themselves. 
"If I had to start in the phone book, I would've missed my daughter's ceremony," Mrs. Stack said. "It was heaven-sent help."
Seniors in the Chicago neighborhoods of Lincoln Park, Lakeview and Near North can call the village for whatever they need - a ride to a doctor's appointment, someone to change a light bulb, assistance with Medicare paperwork. A two-year-old nonprofit serving 230 members in 165 households, Lincoln Park Village was organized by older adults who want to age at home. More than 60 such villages, modeled on Boston's decade-old Beacon Hill Village, have formed across the country, and 100 more are in development.
"Having a support system that can get you the services when and if you need them, but get them at home, seemed to make a lot of sense," said James Zartman, 83, a Lincoln Park founder who has lived in his two-story home for 52 years. 
The great majority of older Americans share Mr. Zartman's wish to age in place, a 2010 AARP study found. But many are forced out prematurely because they can't fix a leak or drive to the supermarket. For them, the village serves as an all-purpose matchmaker.
Lincoln Park members, who must be over age 50, pay an annual fee: $540 for individuals and $780 for a household of two. Those with incomes below $50,000, a fifth of members, belong to the village's Member-Plus program. They pay a reduced rate, as low as $100 annually, and receive a credit toward any expense.
From a small office with two staffers and a clutch of volunteers, the village provides referrals to approved services - home care agencies, handymen, lawyers, financial managers - that often offer member discounts. The village also collaborates with institutions like Rush University Medical Center, where members can schedule appointments with specialists or receive counseling.
Help also comes from fellow members and student volunteers. One member, Wally Shah, routinely drives others to doctors' appointments; a DePaul University student helps a 68-year-old with her unwieldy paperwork; a 50-year-old member and librarian makes "friendly visits" with a retired librarian in her 70s.
"The village is more than just providing services," said Dianne Campbell, the executive director. "It's beginning to weave a web of relationships and new friendships."
Mary Haughey, 90, for instance, attends the village's tai chi classes, takes walks with volunteers and stuffs envelopes at the village office.
"The village offers my mother stimulation and companionship, and it offers me peace of mind," said Mrs. Haughey's daughter Michal Brown, who lives an hour away.
Across the country, similar villages have mushroomed primarily in moderate- and upper-income neighborhoods. Most charge an annual fee of $400 to $700, according to the national Village-to-Village Network. But if they are to become cost-effective solutions for an aging population, advocates say, they must penetrate more diverse communities.
Questions also have surfaced about the sustainability of villages, which are dependent on donor dollars and membership dues. Founders have been surprised at how difficult it has been to expand membership.
"People say, 'I don't need it now, I'll join it when I do,'" said Mr. Zartman. "But in the interim, the village will have gone down the tubes because nobody supported it."
Lincoln Park needs 350 households to be sustainable, a daunting target, according to its treasurer, Bob Spoerri. Last year, it expanded its potential membership by merging with another struggling village nearby. Meanwhile, even established villages have seen their memberships plateau or drop during the recession. Beacon Hill, for instance, has fallen from 450 to 376 in the last three years.
"Membership money is not enough," said Candace Baldwin of the Village-to-Village Network.
Her organization has begun exploring the possibility of public funding, a tough sell in an economy where "the government doesn't have the money for government," said Joyce Gallagher of Chicago's Agency on Aging. Lincoln Park Village is considering whether Chicago villages can share costs - rent, printing, marketing - while maintaining their neighborhood identities, a model currently being tried in Marin County, Calif.
"We'll find a way," Mrs. Campbell vowed. "It's a part of the social fabric, the neighbor-to-neighbor connection that needs to be rebuilt in America."

HEADLINE: 'Made in China,' but Still Profiting Americans

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new study finds that a majority of the price consumers pay for goods labeled "Made in China" goes to American businesses, not Chinese ones.

 BODY:
Over the years I've heard many Americans fret about buying goods that are "Made in China," since they want their cash to go to American companies instead of Chinese ones. A new study, however, finds that a majority of the price consumers pay for goods labeled "Made in China" actually does go to American businesses, not Chinese ones.
The study, from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, estimates that of every dollar consumers spend on a product labeled "Made in China," about 45 cents goes to China for the cost of the original import.
On the other hand, about 55 cents of that dollar pays for services produced in the United States, such as the transportation for the product, rent for the store where the product is sold, the salaries of the salespeople at the store, the cost of marketing the product, the profits for shareholders of the retailer selling the product and so on.
What's more, the fraction of a retail product's price going to American services is higher for Chinese-made products than for products made in other foreign countries. For retail prices on overall imported goods, only 36 percent - or 36 cents on the dollar, instead of 55 cents on the dollar for made-in-China goods only - goes to American companies and their workers.
That difference is largely caused by the types of products American import from China versus other countries.
"The fact that the U.S. content of Chinese goods is much higher than for imports as a whole is mainly due to higher retail and wholesale margins on consumer electronics and clothing than on most other goods and services," write Galina Hale and Bart Hobijn, the authors of the study.
Bear in mind that there are other ways that American consumer spending gets channeled to China, among other countries. That is, many American-made products or services use imported goods as inputs. These types of imports, which are used as parts and not sold directly to consumers, are called "intermediate goods," as opposed to "final goods."
Given this, the New York Fed's study also looked into what share of total personal consumption expenditures in the United States goes to imported final goods (again, consumer products) and intermediate goods (parts).
The authors found that about 13.9 percent of all United States consumer spending goes to imports, including both final and intermediate goods. Chinese imports alone - including both final goods and intermediate goods from China - accounts for just 1.9 percent of total consumer spending.

Over the years I've heard many Americans fret about buying goods that are "Made in China," since they want their cash to go to American companies instead of Chinese ones. A new study, however, finds that a majority of the price consumers pay for goods labeled "Made in China" actually does go to American businesses, not Chinese ones.
The study, from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Fransisco, estimates that of every dollar consumers spend on a product labeled "Made in China," about 45 cents goes to China for the cost of the original import.
On the other hand, about 55 cents of that dollar pays for services produced in the United States, such as the transportation for the product, rent for the store where the product is sold, the salaries of the salespeople at the store, the cost of marketing the product, the profits for shareholders of the retailer selling the product and so on.
What's more, the fraction of a retail product's price going to American services is higher for Chinese-made products than for products made in other foreign countries. For retail prices on overall imported goods, only 36 percent - or 36 cents on the dollar, instead of 55 cents on the dollar for made-in-China goods only - goes to American companies and their workers.

The authors found that about 13.9 percent of all United States consumer spending goes to imports, including both final and intermediate goods. Chinese imports alone - including both final goods and intermediate goods from China - accounts for just 1.9 percent of total consumer spending.
An earlier version of this post said the paper was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was actually released by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Who Pays the Supercommittee?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at which industries and individuals have given members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction the most campaign contributions.

 BODY:
The 12 members of the "supercommittee" that will try to develop yet another bipartisan fiscal policy proposal have now been named. What types of spending programs and tax breaks should we expect these members to care about most?
It might help to look at which industries and individuals give them the most money.
MapLight, a nonpartisan research organization, has compiled donation profiles for each of the 12 members, using data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
Over the last decade the top donor, by far, was the legal industry, followed by securities and investment:
Top 10 Industry Contributors to Supercommittee Members

IndustryTotals	Lawyers/Law $31Firms,529,149	Securities & $11Investment,221,416	Democratic/$9Liberal,647,264	Health $9Professionals,321,588	Real $8Estate,793,350	$8Education,568,460	Misc. $7Business,902,021	Business $6Services,563,524	Women's $6Issues,396,728	$5Insurance,693,595	The individual organizations that gave the most money - including both PAC money and employee donations - were the Club for Growth, followed by Microsoft.
Top 10 Organization Contributors (PACs and Employees) to Supercommittee Members

OrganizationsTotals	Club for $990Growth,066	Microsoft Corp.$810,100	University of $629California,495	Goldman $592Sachs,684	EMILY's $586List,835	Citigroup Inc.$561,081	JPMorgan Chase & Co.$494,316	Bank of $349America,566	Skadden, Arps, et al.$347,356	General $340Electric,935	As all good economists know, incentives matter: Politicians (like all people) are generally reluctant to bite the hand that feeds them.
Given that the antitax group Club for Growth is at the top of the list of organizational contributors, for example, we might not be surprised to find that many of the committee members are dead-set against raising taxes.
Likewise, donations from the securities and investment industry might indicate that legislators could be reluctant to eliminate the lower tax rate for "carried interest," which primarily benefits investment managers. Donations from the real estate industry might mean the mortgage interest tax deduction, whose elimination many economistssupport, could also be relatively protected.
How else might we expect the sources of these donations to shape how committee members think about fiscal policy?

HEADLINE: Bank of America Sells Canadian Credit Card Business

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The bank is shifting its focus to credit cards in the United States while still struggling with the hefty losses in its troubled mortgage division.

 BODY:
Bank of America took steps on Monday to exit the international credit card business, agreeing to sell off its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block. 
With the announcements, Bank of America continued the push to overhaul its credit card business as the bank reels from hefty losses in its troubled mortgage division. While dumping the international card business, Bank of America has largely retained its card loans in the United States, among other core assets. The bank said it hopes the deals will shore up its capital ratios. 
"Our strategy is clear: We have been transforming the company to deliver the franchise to our core customer groups, and building a fortress balance sheet behind that," Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive, said in a statement. "While the credit card remains a fundamental core product for our U.S. customers, an international consumer card business under another brand is not consistent with that strategy." 
Since Mr. Moynihan took over in early 2010, the bank has sold some 20 different businesses for roughly $30 billion. One big deal was announced in May, as the bank shed its remaining stake in BlackRock for $2.5 billion. 
The moves come as Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank by assets, struggles to regain its footing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The beleaguered bank announced an $8.8 billion second-quarter loss after it agreed to settle huge legal claims surrounding its ill-fated acquisition of the subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial.
The bank's stock price has been beaten down, too, hovering around $7 for much of the month. Bank of America shares rose nearly 8 percent on Monday, following news of the deal. 
The announcements on Monday are Bank of America's latest attempts to shed portions of its sprawling credit card business. 
Earlier this month, the bank agreed to sell its Spanish credit card portfolio to Apollo Capital Management, the giant private equity firm. In April, Bank of America sold its $200 million small business credit card loans to Barclays. 
The TD Bank Group, in addition to buying Bank of America's $8.6 billion Canadian credit card business, agreed to purchase various other assets and liabilities for an undisclosed amount, according to a bank statement. The bank said it expected the deal to close in the fourth quarter.
The remaining European card portfolios are even bigger assets for Bank of America. The bank manages a combined $19 billion in credit card loans in Britain and Ireland, which it now plans to sell. That business employs about 4,000 people.

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: American officials believe that the Pakistani intelligence service might have allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage of an American stealth helicopter that crashed during the raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
One of Washington's richest lawmakers, Representative Darrell Issa of California, straddles the worlds of business and politics. Eric Lichtblau reports on how the Republican congressman's growing power has helped make him wealthier while also increasing the potential for conflicts.

        
American officials say it is likely that Pakistan's intelligence service allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage of a secret American helicopter with stealth capabilities that crashed during the commando operation in May that killed Osama bin Laden, Mark Mazzetti reports.

        
Since the Democrats lost the House in last year's midterm elections, President Obama has tried to forge compromises with Congressional Republicans to ease his agenda through. But in the wake of the gridlock over the federal debt ceiling and the nation's economic troubles, the cool-headed president is turning up the heat on Republicans, trying to leverage public opinion to get his economic policies through Congress, John Harwood writes in his Caucus column.
Around the Web:

        
Mr. Obama's approval rating hit an all-time low on Sunday, The Hill reports. Just 39 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup say they approve of Mr. Obama's performance as president.

HEADLINE: Best Politics Quotes From the Weekend

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: What the candidates were saying during the busiest weekend of the campaign so far.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Did you miss the incredible political activity in Iowa this weekend? If so, The Caucus has a roundup for you of the best quotes from the weekend, Iowa-style.
1. Michele Bachmann, the winner of the Iowa Straw Poll, repeatedly focused on her connection to the state -- she was born in Waterloo -- as she worked toward victory. "In Iowa we have successfully maintained the chain of liberty for 150 years my family has lived in Iowa," she said in Ames "I'm the seventh-generation Iowan. And every generation has successfully handed the torch of liberty to the next. It's as though we have forged a chain-link of liberty, and every generation has successfully kept the chain going. And now it's our chance, here in Iowa. We get to forge that next chain on the link of liberty." Mrs. Bachmann appeared on all five Sunday talk shows, including "Fox News Sunday," where the host Chris Wallace apologized again for asking if she was "a flake" on an earlier appearance. "I want to say on television what I said to you personally, I sincerely apologize, I didn't mean to do it," he said. Mrs. Bachmann responded, "All is forgiven, we move forward, so we're good to go."
2. In his speech announcing his presidential candidacy, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, said that "it is time to get America working again, to get citizens - to get our citizens working in good jobs and getting the government to working for the people again." The governor jumped into the race late, but is already adopting the rhetoric of his rivals by attacking President Obama. "Page 1 of any economic plan to get America working is to give a pink slip to the current resident in the White House," he said. In a speech in Waterloo, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Perry added: "The president of the United States has a pen. It's called a veto pen. And I will use it until the ink runs out if that's what it takes."
3. After a disappointing third-place finish, Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, dropped his presidential bid. In an appearance on ABC's "This Week" program, he said that he had tried to offer a message of experience that he hoped would appeal to voters. "Obviously that message didn't get the kind of traction or lift that we needed and hoped for coming into and out of the Ames straw poll," he told the host, Jake Tapper. "We needed to get some lift to continue on and to have a pathway forward. That didn't happen. So I'm announcing this morning on your show that I'm going to be ending my campaign for president." Asked about his former rivals, he said that "all of them are going to be tested, and somebody who can thrive in this process will have their mettle tested, and they'll be improved. And so a lot of times you see candidates start out weaker, they get stronger over time, or start out strong and fall by the wayside. So we just don't know."
4. The second-place finisher at the straw poll, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, continued to speak out against the growth of government and against American participation in wars overseas. In his speech at the straw poll he said that "the American people now, by a large majority, are saying we have been overseas too long. We don't need an American empire. We need to protect our borders and forget about the borders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's time to bring the troops home." He added, to loud applause in the arena, that "all we have to do is restore the belief in freedom, restore the belief in what made America great, restore our conviction that the Constitution works."
5. When Mr. Pawlenty dropped out of the race, several of his rivals sent out statements in response. Here are some of those.
Mitt Romney: "Tim Pawlenty and his entire team ran an honorable campaign. I admire his accomplishments as a two-term governor with a record of results for his state. I consider him a friend and I know he has a bright future ahead of him as a leader in the Republican Party."
Jon M. Huntsman Jr.: "Tim Pawlenty is an accomplished governor, a proud conservative and someone of tremendous character. Our families became close while we were serving together as governors and we are honored to call the Pawlentys dear friends. I know this wasn't an easy decision for Tim and Mary, and I wish them nothing but the best. Tim should be proud that he brought to this race ambitious solutions to turn around our nation's economy and to tackle debt and spending. I hope that all of his supporters continue to stay engaged in this defining election and work with us to ensure that our party wins in November."
Mr. Perry: "Tim Pawlenty is a good friend and colleague who I have worked closely with over the years, including visiting our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a governor, Tim stuck to conservative principles despite leading a blue state like Minnesota. He and Mary are true patriots who are committed to our country, and ran an honorable campaign that reflected their integrity. Governor Pawlenty's common-sense conservative
voice will remain prominent and influential as we work to beat President Obama in 2012 and get America working again.
Mrs. Bachmann: "This morning I spoke with Governor Pawlenty to express my respect and admiration for him, and to wish him and his family well. Running for the presidency requires enormous self-sacrifice. Governor Pawlenty brought an important voice and ideas to the campaign, and he served the people of Minnesota and our country well. Our party and our country are better as a result of his service and commitment."

HEADLINE: The Ripple Effects of Google's Motorola Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of Research in Motion and Nokia rose on Monday as investors hoped that someone might swoop in and buy either handset maker for its intellectual property.

 BODY:
Shares in Motorola Mobility jumped more than 56 percent on Monday after the company's $12.5 billion sale to Google was announced. But it was not the only technology company to see its shares rise.
Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Nokia enjoyed climbing stock prices after the deal came to light. That is presumably because of a greater appreciation for patents, which could be music to the two beleaguered companies' ears.
RIM shares were up 3.3 percent, at $25.36, in midday trading on Monday. And American depositary receipts of Nokia leaped 10.3 percent, to $5.91.
Google made it clear that one of the chief benefits of the deal -- why the search giant was willing to pay a 63.5 percent premium for Motorola -- was the company's arsenal of more than 17,000 patents, with an additional 7,500 pending.
Both R.I.M. and Nokia have their own intellectual property portfolios. And after at least two prominent patent sales, Motorola and Nortel Networks, investors appear to be hoping that there are deals in the future for the two handset makers.
For months, RIM had been under pressure, as its long-popular smartphones appeared to be losing steam to Apple's iPhone and handsets powered by Google's Android. The company's answer to the iPad, the Playbook, has yet to gain widespread acceptance.
Meanwhile, in an effort to rid itself of its "burning platform," Nokia cast its lot with Microsoft, choosing the tech giant's Windows Mobile 7 as its cellphone operating system going forward. 
But there are some glimmers of hope for improving the valuations of both companies. From a research note by National Bank Financial: "RIM's IP value may be worth $10 billion now; it's hard to say but speculation could lift the stock in the near term."
Some investors and analysts appear to be betting that Microsoft will eventually do more than work out an operating system deal with Nokia, with Forrester Research's John McCarthy writing that the Google deal may embolden the pride of Redmond, Wash., to dream bigger.
(One loser from the deal: InterDigital Inc., which owns a portfolio of about 8,800 patents. Google had reportedly been in talks to buy the wireless chip company, a deal whose prospects appeared to have withered considerably. Shares in InterDigital sank nearly 22 percent by midday on Monday, to $59.39.)

HEADLINE: Why Pawlenty's Candidacy Failed

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: To run for president, you need a compelling argument why voters should choose you. Tim Pawlenty didn't offer one.

 BODY:
There are a number of lessons one could take away from the surprisingly early implosion of Tim Pawlenty's presidential aspirations, which not long ago seemed like something to be taken seriously.
One is that experience, at least in the traditional sense, doesn't count for much anymore - or maybe it actually counts against you. This was true in 2008, when President Obama easily brushed aside questions about his having never actually governed anything, and we saw it again in the midterm elections that swept a raft of novices into Congress.
Another, perhaps, is that the advantages that have traditionally accrued to candidates who jump in early have largely evaporated. Mr. Pawlenty, who spent the last year organizing his campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa, started to feel stale and underachieving when his campaign didn't immediately ignite, while a succession of late entrants pushed him to the background.
But the more salient lesson here, it seems to me, has little to do with Mr. Pawlenty's resume or his strategy. If you want to run for president, especially as a little-known establishment candidate, it usually helps if you have something to say.
I'm not talking about an indictment of the other party or a bunch of policy speeches, both of which Mr. Pawlenty delivered adequately. I'm talking about a compelling argument for why your party should choose you and not somebody else who might have more money, or more rousing speeches, or better hair.
Bill Clinton, a little known Arkansas governor, put forth just such an argument when he ran in 1992. Democrats could go ahead and nominate another Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis, Mr. Clinton said, but they would once again be failing to acknowledge the flaws of liberal government, and they would lose.
George W. Bush ran in 2000 as a compassionate conservative, arguing that Republicans needed to transcend the rigidity that characterized the party on domestic issues. In 2008, Mr. Obama held himself out as a generational and temperamental departure from the Clinton era.
Whatever his other flaws as a candidate, Mitt Romney has begun, in recent weeks, to articulate a simple and elegant rationale for why he makes more sense than any of his rivals for the nomination. Mr. Obama didn't create our economic mess, Mr. Romney says, but the president doesn't know enough about private enterprise to clean it up. Mr. Romney, a former private equity investor, presents himself as the only candidate who does.
What was Mr. Pawlenty's essential argument? That he had been a commendable governor? That he was just as conservative as anyone else in the race? That he had a really gravelly voice?
He could have run as the only Republican in the race who viscerally understood the American working class, having come up the hard way. He could have run by arguing, as he did briefly back in the party's dark days of 2009, that Republicans needed to soften their rhetoric and broaden their base if they wanted to endure as a national party.
Instead, Mr. Pawlenty, who has always seemed like a thoroughly decent guy, ran an unusually tentative and risk-averse campaign, positioning himself as most things to most Republicans. He wanted to be the broadly acceptable Romney alternative who could also out-Tea-Party Michele Bachmann. Whatever you had in mind, he was your man.
Every now and then, a candidate can secure the nomination this way, simply by relying on the ineptitude of his rivals. (John Kerry in 2004 comes to mind.) More often, though, the case you argue is a lot more important than which consultants you hire or how many local activists you manage to sign up.
Mr. Pawlenty certainly isn't alone in having flailed trying to find a core argument, and he won't be the last well-regarded candidate in the field to suffer the consequences.
Look at Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and ambassador to China who, as a fluent Mandarin speaker, could be running as the one Republican candidate who really gets the challenge of global competitiveness. Or he could be arguing that, as a social moderate, he is the only candidate who can win enough independent and Democratic votes to wrest the White House from Mr. Obama and change the nation's economic trajectory.
Instead, like Mr. Pawlenty, Mr. Huntsman is running an aimless campaign as something in between Mr. Romney and the party's more confrontational conservatives, a kind of Romneyesque fallback. This, more than all the campaign infighting, most likely explains why his bid is at this point going nowhere.
And what argument will Gov. Rick Perry of Texas advance after the hoopla around his announcement this weekend inevitably subsides? Will it be enough for him to combine Mr. Romney's governing credentials with Mrs. Bachmann's religiosity and Mr. Bush's swaggering gait? Or will there have to be some reason, ultimately, that Mr. Perry that believed he was called to run, beyond the fact that he sees an opening?
This is a question Mr. Perry may need to spend some time contemplating, if he doesn't want to settle for a good speaking slot at the convention, right after Tim Pawlenty's.

HEADLINE: Romney's Fire on Obama Not Turned on Perry

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney compares President Obama to Jimmy Carter, but is more restrained in discussing his Republican opponent Rick Perry.

 BODY:
LITCHFIELD, N.H. - Hitting the campaign trail on Monday in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney compared President Obama to Jimmy Carter, suggested that "he's in over his head when it comes to the economy," and sent out a campaign release dubbing the president' swing through Iowa this week a "Magical Misery bus tour."
 But don't expect Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, to say anything half as harsh about his Republican rivals. As Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Texas Gov. Rick Perry competed for votes and attention in Iowa over the weekend, Mr. Romney kept his message focused squarely on the economy and job creation.
 "I'm running for office because I believe that having spent my life in the private sector, meaning in business, that I understand what it takes to get business going again," Mr. Romney said, talking to three-dozen employees at New England Small Tube. "I can assure you this. I will spend every waking moment, if I'm lucky enough to be president, trying to get America working again and get people good jobs. That's what I care about."
 He never once voluntarily brought up Mr. Perry, who earlier in Iowa took potshots at him, and when pressed about the Texas governor's recently announced candidacy at an availability in Litchfield, Mr. Romney chose only to draw an implicit contrast, highlighting his own experience in the private sector.
 "I've learned how the economy works and I believe that skill is what the nation is looking for," Mr. Romney said. "And I respect the other people in this race, but I think the only other person who has that kind of extensive private sector experience besides me in the Republican race is Herman Cain." 
 When asked about Mr. Perry's record on job creation in Texas, Mr. Romney again chose to talk about his own record instead.
 "You know, I can tell you that I think my jobs record spans not just four years as governor, but also the 25 years that I've lived in the private sector," he said. "I think understanding how the economy works by having worked in the real economy is finally essential in the White House and I hope people recognize that."
 "Private sector," it seemed, was Mr. Romney's preferred buzzword Monday morning, as he uttered it again and again, at two campaign stops and a press availability, in a tacit comparison with Mr. Perry, who was elected to his first public office in 1984 and has never lost an election since.
 Mr. Romney currently appears to be in a three-way race for his party's nomination with Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Perry, but he said he would not let "the political winds of the day" change "my speech and my vision for the American people."
 Addressing Mr. Perry by name for the first - and only - time all day, Mr. Romney said: "Rick Perry's now getting in - good guy, good governor. And he'll get a chance to be heard, we'll have a lot of debates and we'll see where it goes. I don't really measure the success of my campaign based on what other people are doing, but instead based on if what I'm telling folks is connecting and is seen by the American people as what America needs. So I wish Rick the very best and as the process goes on, we'll see whose background and skill most fits the needs of the country at a critical time like this."
 But while Mr. Romney was able to control his message Monday, he was less lucky when it came to the weather, a rainy, chilly mess of day in North Country New Hampshire. He had planned to start Tuesday off with a brisk, four-to-five hour hike up Mount Washington, a 6,288-foot summit whose website boasts it is "Home of the World's Worst Weather," but had to cancel because rain washed out the road from which Mr. Romney and his campaign planned to descend.
 Before the event was canceled, the Romney campaign had suggested that the press meet them at the summit - they doubted that the small gaggle of reporters would be able to keep up with Mr. Romney who, they claim, runs circles around the press.
 "Those boots look like they were made for stamping out Parliaments," said a Romney staffer, skeptically eyeing one reporter's black, not-exactly-hiking shoes.

HEADLINE: Merger News Helps U.S. Shares Return to Pre-Downgrade Level

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Ben Protess, David Jolly and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks swept higher Monday on Wall Street, returning the overall market to where it was before the United States credit rating was downgraded.
A spate of mergers and acquisitions helped build a rally of more than 2 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, leading some analysts to weigh whether the surge signaled a possible period of stability after last week's steep losses and volatility.
Standard & Poor's downgraded the nation's credit rating on Aug. 5, after the market had closed at 1,199.38. Stocks sold off the next week, with the S.& P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average finishing the five-day period nearly 2 percent lower. On Monday, however, the broader market as measured by the S.& P. 500 inched above the pre-downgrade level to close at 1,204.49, after gaining 25.68 points, or 2.2 percent. 
The Dow was up 213.88 points, or 1.9 percent, at 11,482.90, also exceeding its pre-downgrade close of 11,444.61. The same was the case with the Nasdaq composite index, up 47.22 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,555.20.
With gains of around 3 percent in utility, energy and bank stocks on Monday, analysts were cautiously weighing whether the worst of the recent upheaval was over.
''For now it is clear that in essence there is a relief in the market,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. ''You can feel it.''
Still, given the unease that had set in even before the downgrade, stocks are still in a slump. The S.& P. 500 is more than 10 percent below where it was as recently as July 22.
And even as shares climbed on Monday, Ms. Krosby and other analysts said there was plenty of new economic information in the week ahead that could upend the gains of the last three sessions, including jobless claims and the Consumer Price Index. In addition, Monday's volumes were low.
''When the buying picks up, we like to see more buying,'' she said. ''It is an indication of more conviction.''
New deals helped propel Monday's market. A multibillion-dollar Google deal, a rise in commodity prices and the perception that European leaders and the central bank would take measures including bond purchases to support heavily indebted member countries could be helping, analysts said, though such sovereign debt and economic problems are expected to remain a factor in the markets.
Financial stocks rose, including Bank of America, which increased 7.9 percent to $7.76. It took steps on Monday to leave the international credit card business, agreeing to sell its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount, and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block.
Citigroup was up 4.8 percent to $31.27.
Worries about the United States economy and the threat of a financial crisis in Europe had already overwhelmed traders, but the downgrade proved to be a tipping point, sending stocks reeling in what turned out to be one of the most tumultuous weeks on Wall Street.
Analysts said that investors were taking a second look at some of the causes of the volatility from last week.
Investors' attention was focused on a meeting Tuesday of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.
The two leaders will be addressing the threat to the euro zone posed by low growth and teetering public finances in some euro member nations, their room to maneuver circumscribed by fears that France could be next for market attacks.
''People are taking a more rational view of the path ahead, that some of the problems in Europe can be addressed with additional spending restraint from some of the governments,'' which will take time, said Russell Price, senior economist with Ameriprise Financial.
The euro rose against the dollar, a development that Ms. Krosby of Prudential attributed to expectations for the Merkel-Sarkozy meeting.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 98 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.31 percent, from 2.26 percent late Friday.
''Today was a day that people took a little bit of a rest to try to digest all the news that has happened and the volatility that has happened in the market recently,'' said George Rusnak, national director of fixed income for Wells Fargo.
Broader commodity prices were up, and investors were probably bargain hunting after last week's declines, said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
''It is part of the market trying to find its feet,'' he said. ''Despite the bounce on Friday, this market has been really beaten up.''
European stocks showed modest gains. The FTSE 100 index in London was up 0.6 percent. The CAC 40 in France rose 0.8 percent and the DAX in Germany was up 0.4 percent. Asian shares rose, with the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average gaining 1.4 percent.

''How Congress Devastated Congo,'' by David Aronson (Op-Ed, Aug. 8), suggests that Congress is to blame for the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In fact, the United States government should be commended for its leadership in trying to regulate ''conflict minerals'' and to starve rebels of the resources and weapons they need to kill and rape.
Although implementation needs better support to prevent human suffering, particularly in a vast, largely lawless country like Congo, the intention of the Dodd-Frank law is admirable. Inaction is not an option. Such due diligence regimes need to be global and strictly carried out. 
Companies should continue to invest in Congo, with third-party audits to minimize the risk of trading in ''conflict minerals.'' Those who do should face consequences from national police and international sanctions regimes. The resources of Congo should benefit the people rather than the rebels, who destroy their lives and livelihoods.
The women I met in eastern Congo want an end to this war. One way is to make the war less profitable.
MARGOT WALLSTROM New York, Aug. 11, 2011
The writer is the United Nations special representative of the secretary general for sexual violence in conflict.
To the Editor:
The long-term development of Congo depends on channeling potentially vast mining revenues into long-term development. At this moment, the mineral wealth of the eastern Congo feeds conflict and corruption, with a few crumbs falling to the local population; almost nothing goes to government coffers.
The ''conflict mineral'' provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which put the burden on companies to know and disclose the source of their supply, are a small but vital step in shifting the incentives away from the warlords. They won't solve the problem, but their part in ''devastating'' an already devastated land is overstated.
David Aronson's impressionistic account of harms and vague reference to the specter of China's seizing of business don't justify giving initiative back to the warlords.
PETER ROSENBLUM New York, Aug. 8, 2011
The writer, a professor at Columbia Law School, is a consultant to the Carter Center on a project regarding industrial mining in Congo.
To the Editor:
David Aronson's attack on the Dodd-Frank law's provisions on ''conflict minerals'' does not tell the full story.
It's not true that the law amounts to a long-term embargo. Despite alarmist talk of an end to eastern Congo's minerals sector, major international companies are planning to invest in the areas covered by the law, and initiatives aimed at effective tracing and auditing to clean up the minerals trade are being developed.
Mr. Aronson's article inadvertently echoes industry rhetoric aimed at delaying the implementation of the law. Any delay would frustrate companies that are trying to do the right thing, undermining efforts to curb a conflict that millions of aid dollars and several peace negotiations have so far failed to stop.
GAVIN HAYMAN Director of Campaigns, Global Witness London, Aug. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
As a Congolese civil-society advocate, I have seen how the Dodd-Frank legislation on ''conflict minerals'' provides ''the leverage needed to instill and impose ethical minerals business practices,'' according to a coalition of Congolese human-rights groups.
I have seen how the law has helped lead the Congolese Army to pull out of several mines, and how lowered exports are threatening commanders' profits.
The law accelerates reforms. Governments and industry are starting a minerals tracing and validation initiative, Motorola Solutions is pioneering a pipeline of conflict-free minerals, and army commanders are being arrested for their role in this trade.
Efforts to end the conflict must also address economic opportunities for mining communities, including alternative livelihoods and support for responsible mining.

HEADLINE: As Price Climbs, an Old-Fashioned Gold Rush Grips the Australian Outback

BYLINE: By MATT SIEGEL

 BODY:
SYDNEY, Australia -- Four years ago, Marco Nero was on top of the world. He was earning more than $1 million working as a film effects designer for some of the world's most prestigious digital animation houses.
His mind, however, was elsewhere.
Mr. Nero, 40, was increasingly spending his office hours poring over Web sites for anything he could find about an unlikely subject: gold. Like Humphrey Bogart's character in the classic 1948 film ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' he realizes now, he was developing a full-blown case of gold fever, a condition whose genesis he traces to a trip to a prospecting supply shop in the Sydney area.
''I happened to talk to the gentleman that was behind the counter, and he showed me a 2-ounce gold nugget he had and it was a beautiful piece. I held that in my hand,'' he said. ''I was probably hooked at that point.''
Shortly thereafter, despite protests from friends and family, he quit his job to hunt for gold. 
Last week, as concerns about the health of the global economy widened, gold hit a nominal high of $1,813 an ounce after a steady three-year climb. (Adjusting for inflation, gold prices would have to reach $2,300 an ounce to set a record.)
Gold prices are up 23 percent since the beginning of this year alone. As a result, more and more people are giving up lucrative jobs in cities in Australia for a chance at the quick riches and adventure offered by old-fashioned prospecting.
Australia is the world's second-biggest producer of gold, after China. Domestic mines produced 266 tons at a value of 12 billion Australian dollars ($12.42 billion) in 2010, the consulting firm Surbiton Associates said in its latest survey of the Australian gold mining industry. By comparison, the United States produced 240 tons in 2010.
An influx of out-of-towners to prospect in Australia has been a boon for small-business owners in former gold rush towns, many of which have fallen on hard times in recent years.
Take, for example, the tiny outback hamlet of Mudgee, about 170 miles northwest of Sydney. In 1851 it had a population of just 200, before ballooning to 20,000 after the discovery of gold in nearby Hargraves, which was ground zero for the first gold rush in the history of New South Wales.
But the fortunes of Mudgee flagged along with gold prices in the last century. Young people moved to the cities in search of steady work, while punishing droughts drove away farmers. Today, there are just 8,000 people spread sparsely along lonely streets built for more than twice that many inhabitants.
Slowly but surely that has begun to change, said Kim Ellis, 47. She and her partner, Lincoln Parsons, are the proprietors of Nuggets From Down Under, a prospecting supply shop in Mudgee. Ms. Ellis says that she has seen more new arrivals walk through her shop in the last six months than in the previous five years -- and that is without counting the huge number of weekend warriors and hobbyists.
''As gold prices are increasing, that's increasing the interest in gold because of the monetary value but also because of the lifestyle,'' she said. ''In the last six months I've seen probably four people -- that's just involved with my store -- four people that are quitting their jobs, selling up and going prospecting full time.''
Four may not sound like a lot, but for a town like Mudgee, every new addition is noticed -- and welcome.
''People have never been really game enough to let go of their security of having their job and their home,'' Ms. Ellis said. ''But what I'm seeing is lifestyle change and that this is something where you can actually make money. It can be a life-changing event. All you need is a nugget, and it's a life-changing event.''
For some, the look and feel of prospecting has changed little since the great gold rushes of the 19th century: stick a corrugated pan in a shallow creek, sift and hope.
But for the more discerning prospector, high-technology metal detectors like the Minelab GPX 4800 -- about $6,000 -- provide that extra advantage when hunting for the gold that may be just below the surface of the rough soil in the outback.
The global financial crisis and a general rise in commodity prices -- oil and food, in particular -- are the major factors propping up gold prices, analysts say. Recently, the dispute in the United States over the deficit ceiling and the downgrading of the debt rating by Standard & Poor's have prompted an increase in the price of gold as investors have sought out an investment that is a traditional haven. Volatile stock markets and the debt crisis in Europe are also giving a lift to the metal.
''The bull market is still very much intact,'' said James Steel, chief commodities analyst for HSBC in New York.
One defining feature of the current gold rush, many say, is the age of those joining up. Whereas prospecting for gold has traditionally been a hobby associated with the elderly, many of those moving out to the country are well below retirement age.
''It used to be mostly old folks at the club, but these days I've noticed there's quite a few younger fellows showing up, and I think that's mainly because of the price of gold,'' said Dean Eisler, vice president of the Prospector's Home Prospecting Club in Sydney, which runs package tours to prospect for gold.
Brian Dumesny, a 46-year-old military contractor from the city of Townsville, Queensland, in the northern Australian tropics, certainly fits that bill. A breakup with a partner helped him decide on a change of scenery, but it was the price of gold that gave him the confidence to change professions as well.
''I've always liked it,'' he said. ''Even since I was a young boy I did a little bit of panning and such, just messing around, but I guess now that in the last few years the price of gold has increased so much that it's become so much more viable.''
Mr. Dumesny said the last nugget he had found weighed 0.3 ounce.
''Four or five years ago that was worth only a hundred bucks, and now it's worth a bit over three hundred dollars,'' he said. ''So you don't have to find a lot to be comfortable, if you know what I mean.''
That logic appeals to Mr. Steel, the HSBC analyst. Is he surprised to hear that ordinary people in Australia have been throwing in the towel on city life to prospect full time? Not at all, he says. It is a phenomenon he has seen across the world, in places like Brazil, the United States and Australia.
''What I'd like to do is go to Australia and open up my own outback saloon,'' he said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Sending the Police Before There's a Crime

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
The arrests were routine. Two women were taken into custody after they were discovered peering into cars in a downtown parking garage in Santa Cruz, Calif. One woman was found to have outstanding warrants; the other was carrying illegal drugs.
But the presence of the police officers in the garage that Friday afternoon in July was anything but ordinary: They were directed to the parking structure by a computer program that had predicted that car burglaries were especially likely there that day. 
The program is part of an unusual experiment by the Santa Cruz Police Department in predictive policing -- deploying officers in places where crimes are likely to occur in the future.
In July, Santa Cruz began testing the prediction method for property crimes like car and home burglaries and car thefts. So far, said Zach Friend, the police department's crime analyst, the program has helped officers pre-empt several crimes and has led to five arrests.
The notion of predictive policing is attracting increasing attention from law enforcement agencies around the country as departments struggle to fight crime at a time when budgets are being slashed.
''We're facing a situation where we have 30 percent more calls for service but 20 percent less staff than in the year 2000, and that is going to continue to be our reality,'' Mr. Friend said. ''So we have to deploy our resources in a more effective way, and we thought this model would help.''
Efforts to systematically anticipate when and where crimes will occur are being tried out in several cities. The Chicago Police Department, for example, created a predictive analytics unit last year.
But Santa Cruz's method is more sophisticated than most. Based on models for predicting aftershocks from earthquakes, it generates projections about which areas and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes by analyzing and detecting patterns in years of past crime data. The projections are recalibrated daily, as new crimes occur and updated data is fed into the program.
On the day the women were arrested, for example, the program identified the approximately one-square-block area where the parking garage is situated as one of the highest-risk locations for car burglaries.
In contrast, CompStat and other crime-tracking systems in use in many cities are calibrated less frequently, rely more on humans to recognize patterns, and allocate resources based on past crimes rather than predicted future offenses.
The program was developed by a group of researchers -- including two mathematicians, George Mohler and Martin Short; an anthropologist, Jeff Brantingham; and a criminologist, George Tita -- in a project that used data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, which is hoping to begin using the program later this year.
''We're watching closely what is going on in Santa Cruz,'' said Capt. Sean Malinowski of the Los Angeles department's Foothill Patrol Division, who worked with the researchers when he was head of the department's crime center under the police chief at the time, William J. Bratton.
Captain Malinowski envisions a time when the police will issue crime forecasts the same way the Weather Service issues storm alerts.
''It would certainly be safer for everyone and more effective,'' he said, adding that the forecast might say, ''You're having a rash of shootings and the computer says it's going to continue in these places and on these days of the week.''
He added, ''Now, if we have a problem, we throw a lot of cops at it, and unfortunately, with the economy being the way it is, we don't have as many cops available.''
The CompStat system, Captain Malinowski said, was a big advance for policing, but the use of computer programs takes prediction to the next level.
With CompStat and other, similar approaches, ''we look at these maps and they're as accurate as we can get them,'' he said. ''But I'm looking at a map from last week and the whole assumption is that next week is like last week. The computer eliminates the bias that people have.''
For the Santa Cruz trial, eight years of crime data were fed into the computer program, which breaks Santa Cruz into squares of approximately 500 feet by 500 feet. New data is added each day.
Officers are given a list of the 10 highest-probability ''hot spots'' of the day at roll call. They check those areas during times that they are not out on service calls. Before the program started, they made such ''pass through'' checks based on hunches or experience of where crimes were likely to occur.
Mr. Friend said that the reaction to the prediction method among officers had been ''quite positive.''
''The feedback I've received is that there is appreciation that it has validated intuition or provided a new focus area that wasn't known,'' he said.
How accurate the program really is has yet to be demonstrated; its success will be evaluated after six months.
''The worst-case scenario is that it doesn't work and we're no worse off,'' said Mr. Friend, who enlisted Dr. Mohler, a professor at Santa Clara University.
Mr. Friend said the early indications were encouraging. Burglaries were down 27 percent in July compared with July 2010, suggesting that the targeted policing may have a deterrent effect, he said.
In Los Angeles, Captain Malinowski said, the police department hopes to expand the program to include some violent crimes, like gang shootings.
Predicting crime with computer programs is in some ways a natural outgrowth of the technology that companies like Wal-Mart now use routinely to predict the buying habits of customers, said Scott Dickson, a crime analyst for the police department in Killeen, Tex., who discussed the Santa Cruz experiment on his blog.
Law enforcement agencies, Mr. Dickson noted, have ''great warehouses of data'' that can be used to feed predictive programs. And in the end, he said, ''it's cheaper to prevent a crime than to solve a crime, and that's where I think the promise lies.''

HEADLINE: Medicaid Pays Less Than Medicare for Many Prescription Drugs, U.S. Report Finds

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Medicaid gets much deeper discounts on many prescription drugs than Medicare, in part because Medicaid discounts are set by law whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies, federal investigators said Monday in a new report.
The report, from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, could be used by lawmakers trying to cut drug prices as Congress looks for ways to rein in the cost of Medicare under the new deficit-reduction law. 
Under existing law, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of Medicare's outpatient drug benefit will increase an average of nearly 10 percent a year, to $175 billion in 2021, from $68 billion this year.
Medicaid and Medicare receive discounts in the form of rebates, which are paid by drug manufacturers when their products are dispensed to people enrolled in the programs.
The inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, found that rebates reduced spending on 100 widely used brand name drugs by 19 percent in Medicare and by 45 percent in Medicaid. After taking account of the rebates, Mr. Levinson said, Medicaid paid significantly less than Medicare for the same drugs.
Federal law specifies how the discount, or rebate, is calculated under Medicaid, the program for low-income people. The minimum rebate for a brand-name drug was increased last year to 23 percent of the average price that manufacturers receive for sales of the product to retail pharmacies.
Drug companies must pay additional rebates to Medicaid if a drug's price rises faster than general inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index. The inspector general said these added rebates accounted for slightly more than half of all rebates paid to Medicaid on the top 100 drugs. Prices for many of these drugs have been rising at a brisk pace.
''The inflation-based additional rebate is the primary reason Medicaid rebates are substantially higher'' than Medicare rebates, Mr. Levinson said.
''Manufacturers for virtually all brand name drugs under review paid inflation-based rebates'' to Medicaid because their prices rose faster than inflation, the report said.
For 68 of the 100 brand-name drugs examined in the study, the Medicaid rebate was at least twice as large as the rebate paid to Medicare.
About 30 million older Americans and people with disabilities receive drug coverage through Part D of Medicare. More than 50 million low-income people have drug coverage through Medicaid.
When Congress added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, it prohibited the government from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and stipulated that outpatient drug coverage should be provided entirely through private insurers like UnitedHealth and Humana, under contract with Medicare.
Insurers have aggressively negotiated with pharmaceutical companies, so Medicare's prescription drug program has cost the government less than originally predicted. But the private insurers have not obtained discounts or rebates as large as those secured by Medicaid, the inspector general said.
The study comparing Medicare and Medicaid was required by the new health care law.
Drug companies oppose the type of discounts required by Medicaid, seeing them as government price controls. Drug makers say they prefer Medicare's market-oriented approach, in which discounts are negotiated by drug plans and manufacturers.
Two Democrats, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, recently introduced bills that would require drug manufacturers to pay the higher Medicaid rebates for drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid. President Obama's deficit-reduction commission has endorsed the proposal, saying it could save $49 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: State Employees' Union Accepts Wage and Benefits Concessions

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Members of New York's largest union of state employees, in a begrudging acknowledgment of the increasingly hostile mood toward public workers, have agreed to accept major wage and benefits concessions sought by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
The union, the Civil Service Employees Association, announced late Monday night that its members had voted by about 60 percent to 40 percent to approve the contract agreement that the governor and union leaders struck in June. 
The ratification was a critical victory for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat whose plan to close the state's budget gap relied in large part on a bet that state employees would be willing to stomach a freeze on wages and an increase in the cost of health benefits in return for safeguarding their jobs.
The union's president, Danny Donohue, said in a statement: ''These are not ordinary times, and C.S.E.A. worked hard to reach an agreement that we believed would be in everyone's best interest. C.S.E.A. members agree that this contract is reasonable and responsible for the long term and shows that C.S.E.A. members will do what is right for the good of all New Yorkers.''
Savings from the five-year contract are expected to total $73 million this fiscal year, part of the $450 million in cuts that Mr. Cuomo's budget counted on extracting from the state work force. And the governor's office projected that if other unions agreed to the same terms total savings for the state would amount to $1.6 billion over five years.
Beyond the savings, the ratification also goes a long way toward validating Mr. Cuomo's strategy for dealing with public workers, tens of thousands more of whom will vote as early as next month on whether to agree to their own concessions.
In labor negotiations, the governor took a firm stance. He demanded significant financial concessions and was not shy about threatening layoffs to gain leverage.
At the same time, he did not attack collective bargaining or speak about the unions with any kind of hostility, unlike some other governors seeking to cut work-force costs, like Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Chris Christie in New Jersey.
''This is a big, big win -- a win for the union and a win for the people of the state,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ''The union avoided layoffs, and the state is financially stronger. I'm pleased that our approach of labor and management working together is vindicated.''
The announcement, made shortly before midnight, capped a day of suspense at the Capitol. Union leaders worked more than 12 hours counting paper ballots that had been mailed in over the last month by union members, who, along with aides to Mr. Cuomo and other officials, spent the day wondering what the final tally would show.
Nearly 30,000 of the union's 66,000 members voted.
The contract's approval could encourage the state's other major public-employee union, the Public Employees Federation, to approve its own, nearly identical deal with Mr. Cuomo when it is put to a vote next month. And it will bolster the governor's case as he seeks concessions from other, smaller unions in coming months.
The workers' willingness to accept the contract's cuts could also provide Mr. Cuomo with some political relief.
As he urged workers to do their part in helping the state rein in spending, Mr. Cuomo found himself increasingly at odds with organized labor, a traditional ally for a Democratic chief executive.
No organized campaign emerged among members of the Civil Service Employees Association who were dissatisfied with the contract.
But its passage remained no certainty because of the scope of the proposed cuts. The agreement calls for a freeze on base wages for three years, followed by 2 percent annual raises in the contract's last two years. The union's last contract offered 3 percent raises for three years and a 4 percent raise in the final year.
Mr. Cuomo, mindful of the failure of other recent labor deals, also stopped short of avowing complete confidence that the Civil Service Employees Association's members would sign off on the agreement.
His first labor deal, with a small union of law enforcement officers, was rejected in May, and in June public workers in Connecticut rejected their proposed contract, throwing that state's budget into turmoil.
But in New York, the prospect of layoffs -- Mr. Cuomo said he would have to eliminate as many as 9,800 jobs if workers refused to make concessions -- appeared to frighten union members into accepting a contract they might in other years have considered unthinkable. The contract agreement protects union members from broad-based layoffs for two years, and union leaders focused their ratification pitch largely around that promise of job security during difficult financial times.
In fact, hundreds of workers were only days away from losing their jobs when the 56,000-member Public Employees Federation agreed to its deal with Mr. Cuomo last month, averting the impending layoffs. On Thursday, the union's executive board approved the contract agreement, which will be sent to union members for consideration in September.
''There were no good choices,'' the union's president, Kenneth Brynien, wrote to members after the board's vote. ''In the past, contract negotiations achieved significant gains for our members. Unfortunately, the state of the economy, the will of the state's political leaders and public sentiment have created an environment where the services our members provide are undervalued.''

 BODY:

THREE years ago this month, Russia and Georgia fought a brief and brutal war over an obscure slice of mountainous land called South Ossetia that had declared its independence from Georgia. Flouting international law, Russia stepped in to defend South Ossetia and later formally recognized the secessionists as a legitimate government. Hundreds died and thousands of refugees fled the disputed region.
The 2008 war demonstrated the explosive potential created by the presence of phantom states: places that field military forces, hold elections, build local economies and educate children, yet inhabit the foggy netherworld between de facto existence and international legitimacy. 
With about 70,000 people, South Ossetia is one of the smallest of these oddities of international politics. Its fellow breakaway republic, Abkhazia, has approximately 250,000. Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria are two others in the former Soviet Union. To the south are the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus; the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; and the self-functioning territory of Somaliland. A half dozen other patches of land could be added to the mix; together, they are home to approximately 40 million people.
Phantom states stoke wars, foster crime, and make weak states even weaker. Nagorno-Karabakh is lauded by Armenia and loathed by Azerbaijan, leading all sides to stockpile arms in case of renewed violence. The unsettled status of Northern Cyprus weakens the economic prospects of all Cypriots and strains relations between the European Union and Turkey, Northern Cyprus's chief supporter. And although Somaliland has been an island of effective governance in anarchic Somalia, its unrecognized status has discouraged aid and investment.
Phantom countries frequently emerge from wars, and are sustained by the threat of further fighting. In Gaza, Hamas has waged an off-and-on war with Israel even as it has cracked down on local crime and picked up the trash.
Leaders of phantom states champion the right to national self-determination while the countries from which they seek independence stress the need for stable borders. Stuck between these incompatible principles, phantom governments tend to point out uncomfortable precedents and double standards and latch on to foreign patrons. Indeed, most phantoms survive in part because of external support. Moscow is the power broker in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while Armenia holds sway over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Taiwan shows one way out of this conundrum; despite existing in a state of legal uncertainty, it has thrived. From 1949 to 1971 the Nationalist government in Taiwan held China's seat at the United Nations and was recognized by most world governments. Since the 1970s, however, no major power has formally recognized Taiwan and it remains a source of tension between the United States and China. Yet, in the past four decades, Taiwan has become an economic powerhouse, a model of democratic transition from authoritarian rule and a responsible member of the international community -- all without a seat at the United Nations.
The key was engagement. Taiwan's economic and strategic importance pushed the United States, China and other great powers to tiptoe around -- and sometimes even embrace -- its unsettled legal status. Legitimate but unrecognized, a real country but not independent, Taiwan has demonstrated the positive power of creative ambiguity.
A similar approach could work elsewhere. Phantom governments are often corrupt, run by warlords and plagued by drug trafficking and other illicit trade. But transparent government, free elections and a peaceful foreign policy are as vital for phantom states as they are for real ones. If phantom governments behave well, they should be offered a path toward legitimacy by the world's major powers. Economic and political reforms can proceed parallel to, and even bolster, discussions over sovereignty.
By insisting on territorial integrity, the United States and other countries forgo the chance to turn phantom states into responsible players. So long as phantoms are denounced as separatists or outposts of illicit commerce, the international community has little opportunity to hold their leaders accountable. And treating them as mere eccentricities means that phantom states have little reason to care about the international order.
Even when a phantom state becomes a genuine state, the problems don't necessarily end. Eritrea, which seceded from Ethiopia in 1993 after years of war, is a warning. It has since fallen into tyranny, fought a border war with Ethiopia in which many thousands died, and supported the brutal Shabab militia in Somalia. Although Eritrea is independent, it remains a source of instability.
To avoid another Eritrea, the international community should push phantoms to reform rather than focusing exclusively on seeking statehood. Otherwise, millions of the world's citizens will linger in legal and political limbo -- rebels with a cause and soldiers with a ready-made grievance -- while their neighborhoods remain at risk of war.

HEADLINE: What Is Business Waiting For?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
When the German economy turned south after the 2008 financial crisis, the pain was mitigated by a program known as ''Kurzarbeit.''
The word means short work. Instead of laying off workers, German companies cut back their hours. The government then used money set aside during good times to pay the workers around 60 percent of their lost wages. The labor unions went along because they believed it was better to keep people employed even at reduced pay. This is the German social compact.
As we suffer through our own economic hard times, the German approach is something we can only envy. Here, companies quickly lay off workers, many of whom never find their way back into the full-time labor force. Corporations shy away from investing for the future, even though investment is what will turn the economy around. The government, for its part, invariably starts talking about ''job creation,'' but rarely does anything that makes a difference. 
This downturn is no exception. What are the latest unemployment figures? Some 25 million people -- more than 16 percent of the work force -- are looking for full-time work. Companies are hoarding cash while reporting record profits.
As for the government, President Obama's idea of job creation is extending unemployment insurance, on the one hand, and painting grandiose pictures of far-off ''green jobs,'' on the other. He is bereft of ideas for creating jobs in the here and now. Meanwhile, the Republicans insist -- despite moundsof evidenceto the contrary -- that more tax cuts would create jobs. By now, most Americans have lost hope that our current government will come up with a viable jobs program. It won't.
I am coming more and more to think that with the government essentially paralyzed for the foreseeable future, the only way we're going to get jobs is by turning to actual job creators: business itself. With all their cash, companies shouldn't be waiting for Congress to give them tax incentives to hire people. They should be trying to jump-start the economy -- and fend off another recession -- by making investments, and hiring workers, that will lead to renewed prosperity.
The only way that's going to happen, however, is if our society implicitly makes the kind of compact that German society makes explicitly: We have to be willing to allow companies to sacrifice short-term profits for the long-term good of the country. As the leadership expert Michael Useem wrote recently on The Washington Post's Web site, business needs to make ''people a priority, not just earnings.''
What makes that hard for executives is that they've spent the last 30 years having it beaten into them that the only thing that matters is delivering ''shareholder value.'' Over time, this phrase has become code for focusing on short-term profits -- and chief executives who have ignored this mantra have often found themselves kicked to the street by impatient investors like Carl Icahn.
But as Useem points out, it hasn't always been this way -- and doesn't have to be in the future. ''What might seem an idee fixe of the American way is really a moment's artifice,'' he writes, ''a prescription that served a past era but less well the current one.''
Indeed, it turns out that the focus on short-term profits is nowhere enshrined in the law. On the contrary: Delaware law, where many big companies are incorporated, gives directors enormous leeway to ignore short-term gain if they believe that doing so would ultimately benefit the corporation.
Does it ultimately benefit American business if the country gets back on its feet again? It seems to me that you can make a pretty strong case for that. If enough companies started hiring -- while wrapping their actions in the mantle of patriotism -- even Carl Icahn might have trouble complaining about it.
There is, of course, another reason corporate executives might be reluctant to sacrifice short-term profits by putting people to work. What if their competitors didn't go along? Then they would find themselves at a disadvantage. Useem would tackle that by having a credible group like the Business Roundtable leading the charge, rounding up companies that would agree to start hiring.
But Marc Groz, a financial risk expert I've gotten to know, has what I think is a more intriguing approach, which he calls a ''contingent commitment facility.'' ''Everyone is waiting for someone else to go first,'' he told me the other day. Using his facility, a company would agree to hire X number of new workers. But the commitment would only become binding if certain conditions were met -- such as having other companies in the same industry agree to do likewise. Once that happened, all the companies would have to do what they'd promised.
Groz's idea is new and fresh and untested. It could fail. In other words, it is exactly the kind of out-of-the-box ''job creation'' idea that our stymied government no longer has the ability to come up with. The ball's in business's court now.

HEADLINE: Casting Off Gloom, Wall Street's Deal Makers Are in a Frenzy of Activity

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Turmoil in the stock market. A downgrade of the United States credit rating. The economic crisis in Europe.
Such a vicious cocktail of bad news would normally cause Wall Street's deal machine to grind to a halt. But Monday had a spate of multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions, surprising investors, who had expected deal activity to slow in the grim environment.
Leading the M.&A. charge was Google, which said it was buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. The search company, which has made a business out of bucking conventional wisdom, does not seem deterred by the market tumult or the threat of a antitrust inquiry by the United States government.
Google's acquisition of Motorola, by far its largest deal, would use some of the nearly $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Corporations, especially the leading technology companies, are sitting on record amounts of cash, a fact that deal makers have been hoping would spawn mergers and acquisitions even in difficult markets. Apple has about $76 billion in cash; Microsoft has $53 billion. 
''Even intense market volatility won't get in the way of strategic deals,'' said Scott A. Barshay, a corporate partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. ''Well-capitalized companies are focused on the years ahead, not the last week of trading.''
Private equity has remained another reliable driver of deal activity. After struggling through the financial crisis, the world's largest buyout firms are now on firmer footing and have been looking to sell their holdings to return cash to their investors. The private equity world had two large exits on Monday: Time Warner Cable bought Insight Communications, which is owned by the Carlyle Group and others, for $3 billion, and the agriculture giant Cargill said it would pay about $2 billion for Provimi, an animal feed producer owned by the European buyout shop Permira.
With Monday's flurry of transactions - which also included a big oil-drilling deal and a large credit card disposition by Bank of America - worldwide M.& A. volume totals $1.8 trillion year to date, a 31 percent increase over last year at this time, according to Thomson Reuters. And Monday was the biggest ''Merger Monday'' in the United States since April 4, Thomson Reuters says.
Cargill to Buy Feed Company
Cargill, the American agricultural giant, said Monday that it planned to buy a Dutch animal nutrition company, Provimi, for $2.1 billion from the private equity firm Permira.
One of the largest privately held companies in the world, Cargill said it made a binding offer for Provimi, which specializes in nutrition and supplements for farm animals, for 1.5 billion euros. The deal will help Cargill add vitamin mixtures and additives to its animal nutrition business and expand in Latin America, Russia and Asia, where Provimi operates.
The deal comes as food prices increase and demand for meat from developing economies rises. Provimi, based in Rotterdam, employs about 7,000 people and operates in 26 countries. It had sales of 1.6 billion euros in 2010 and earnings of 86 million euros in the first half of this year.
Cargill's vice chairman, Paul Conway, said the acquisition was ''a significant move for Cargill into the higher value added segments in the animal nutrition market. Provimi has world-class expertise, knowledge and strong technical know-how, an area that we believe is key to the future of the industry.''

Bank of America Sheds a Unit
Bank of America took steps on Monday to exit the international credit card business, agreeing to sell its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block.
With the announcements, Bank of America continued the push to overhaul its credit card business as the bank reels from hefty losses in its troubled mortgage division. While dumping the international card business, Bank of America has largely retained its card loans in the United States, among other core assets. The bank said it hoped the deals would shore up its capital ratios.
''Our strategy is clear: We have been transforming the company to deliver the franchise to our core customer groups, and building a fortress balance sheet behind that,'' Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive, said in a statement. ''While the credit card remains a fundamental core product for our U.S. customers, an international consumer card business under another brand is not consistent with that strategy.''
Since Mr. Moynihan took over in early 2010, the bank has sold some 20 businesses for roughly $30 billion. One big deal was announced in May, as the bank shed its remaining stake in BlackRock for $2.5 billion.
The moves come as Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank by assets, struggles to regain its footing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The beleaguered bank announced an $8.8 billion second-quarter loss after it agreed to settle huge legal claims surrounding its ill-fated acquisition of the subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial.
The bank's remaining European card portfolios are even bigger assets. The bank manages a combined $19 billion in credit card loans in Britain and Ireland, which it now plans to sell. That business employs about 4,000 people.

Offshore Driller Builds Its Fleet
Transocean, one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors, said on Monday that it had bid $1.43 billion for Aker Drilling of Norway to expand its fleet by adding rigs and ships.
Transocean, which owned the rig lost in the oil spill disaster last year in the Gulf of Mexico, said it agreed to pay 26.5 Norwegian kroner ($4.80) in cash for each Aker share. The offer price is 62 percent higher than Aker's average share price over 30 days before the offer, Transocean said in a statement. Transocean will also assume $800 million of Aker's debt.
With the acquisition, Transocean will gain two ultra-deepwater rigs that are on long-term contracts in Norway to Statoil and Det Norske. It will also get two drill ships being built at a shipyard in South Korea. Transocean will have to pay $900 million for the ships upon delivery.
''Aker Drilling is an excellent strategic fit for Transocean,'' the company president and chief executive, Steven L. Newman, said in a statement. ''It allows us to enhance our position in Norway where we have enjoyed a long-term presence and excellent customer relationships.''
The board of Aker Drilling unanimously recommended the bid to its shareholders, Transocean said. Aker Drilling's shareholders are expected to vote on the offer later this month.

Cable Operator Expands Reach
Time Warner Cable announced on Monday that it had agreed to buy Insight Communications, a large Midwestern cable television operator, for about $3 billion in cash.
''We believe in our business and its long-term prospects and have long thought that Insight's well-run, technologically advanced systems would fit well with our Midwest operations,'' Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said in a statement.
Insight is owned by the Carlyle Group and other private equity firms, including MidOcean Partners and Crestview Partners.

HEADLINE: Looking Closer at Taxes on the Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
With the budget deficit growing and tax rates at a 60-year low, one question will remain near the center of the political debate in the coming months: Should the federal government raise taxes on the rich?
Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor known as the Oracle of Omaha, pushed the issue to the forefront this week by urging members of the new Congressional supercommittee on deficit reduction to stop ''coddling'' him and other affluent Americans and raise their taxes. 
In an opinion article in The New York Times on Monday, Mr. Buffett said he paid just under $7 million in federal payroll and income taxes last year, about 17 percent of his income, a lower percentage than anyone else in his office.
Echoing comments he has made in the past, he called on Congress to make the tax system more fair by rolling back the so-called Bush tax cuts on people who earn more than $1 million a year and on income from capital gains and dividends. He would also close the loophole allowing hedge fund managers to be taxed at a lower rate.
Whatever the political viability, his proposal would put a significant dent in the nation's budget shortfall. Based on projections by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury, the tax increase on all three fronts would generate as much as $500 billion in new revenue over the next decade -- about a third of what the Congressional committee is supposed to cut from the deficit.
''It's not going to solve the long-term budget shortfall all by itself,'' said Eric Toder, an economist at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ''The only way to do that is to have broader tax increases or reduce entitlements. But it could be an important piece of the puzzle.''
Because of Mr. Buffett's high visibility and wealth -- Forbes estimates his net worth at $50 billion, making him the world's third-richest person -- his comments brought a torrent of reaction. President Obama, who has fought unsuccessfully to increase taxes on the nation's highest earners, cheered Mr. Buffett's remarks during his Midwestern bus tour on Monday, saying that it was only fair that the spending cuts be balanced by tax increases on the wealthy.
Conservative bloggers and commentators brushed aside the proposals as grandstanding or as a gimmick to usher in a middle-class tax increase, and Pat Buchanan, a commentator on MSNBC, suggested that Mr. Buffett visit the section of the Internal Revenue Service Web site that accepts donations.
Republicans have been united in their opposition to tax increases, and gave Mr. Buffett's proposals a chilly reception. All six Republican members on the committee have taken a no-tax pledge. Representative Kevin Brady, a member of the Ways and Means Committee and a Texas Republican, flatly rejected Mr. Buffett's ideas.
''This is not a serious solution for deficit control or getting this dismal economy on its feet,'' Mr. Brady said. ''Economic growth does not follow a tax increase. So as much as I respect Mr. Buffett, his proposal fails on virtually every level.''
Despite the intense antitax sentiment that has helped the rise of the Tea Party movement since Mr. Obama took office, tax rates in the United States are at their lowest level since Harry Truman was president.
In 1950, the top income bracket had a 91 percent rate; today it is 35 percent. Mr. Buffett called for two new tax brackets for high earners -- for income above $1 million a year and another above $10 million. While Mr. Buffett's proposal did not suggest a rate, the Tax Policy Center has estimated that a 50 percent tax rate on income over $1 million would raise $48 billion over the next decade.
But one of the biggest factors reducing the comparatively low tax rates on investment income is the 15 percent for dividends, capital gains and ''carried interest,'' the money paid to hedge fund managers and private equity investors. Eliminating the carried interest provision alone would raise $21 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
And restoring capital gains and dividend rates to the levels before the Bush tax cuts -- when capital gains were taxed at a top rate of 20 percent and dividends were treated as ordinary income -- would bring the Treasury an additional $340 billion over the next decade.
Any of those measures would face intense lobbying and a battle in Congress. Indeed, Democrats were unable to roll back the carried interest tax break or the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy even when they controlled both houses of Congress. But with the prospect of severe spending cuts and another round of bitter deficit negotiations in Washington, proposals like Mr. Buffett's call to raise taxes on the affluent are likely to become an increasingly urgent part of the discussion.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about reaction to Warren E. Buffett's call for higher taxes on the rich misidentified the cable channel with which Pat Buchanan is affiliated. Mr. Buchanan, who suggested that Mr. Buffett donate to the federal government, is a commentator on MSNBC, not on CNN.

HEADLINE: Germany Flying Above The Storm

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- There is no one whose thoughts European officials would rather read than Chancellor Angela Merkel, who meets Tuesday at the Elysee Palace with France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, as they struggle to find a lasting solution to the European debt crisis.
The most common critique of Mrs. Merkel is that she lacks the necessary sense of urgency to restore confidence in the euro and calm the crisis. But a stroll through summertime Berlin makes clear why she remains so cool-headed. The streets are quiet and the cafes are full. Deeply tanned residents are returning to their jobs after vacations in fiscally compromised nations, like Greece and Portugal.
Germany may be the only European nation that is large enough and rich enough to cover the debts of its struggling neighbors, but its citizens are reluctant to be the source of the bailout. Germany is in many ways in the eye of the storm, with barely a hint of the winds swirling nearby. There is no tear gas, as in Athens; no tires burning, as in London; no chanting crowds packing public squares, as in Spain. While much of the rest of Europe is struggling to pass harsh austerity packages, Germany is in the midst of a debate over cutting taxes by as much as $14.2 billion. 
''It's as if there's this black cloud floating overhead but nothing has fallen on us,'' said Markus Ponick, 38, a teacher in Berlin, who on Monday was strolling down a tree-lined stretch of Bleibtreustrasse with a cup of coffee in his hand. The government had made cuts, Mr. Ponick said, but they had been ''cleverly chosen'' to spare the public pain. ''The effects of this crisis are imperceptible here,'' he said.
The only major protests to strike Germany have been over tearing down an old train station in Stuttgart or calling for the end of nuclear power. Animal rights and affordable Internet, rather than jobs and spending cuts, are more likely to cause people to take to the streets right now, and even then not in terribly great numbers.
The simplest explanation is jobs.
By one government measure, 706,000 more Germans were employed in May of this year than the year before, of which 415,000 were full-time positions and 289,000 part time. In terms of relative size, that would be roughly comparable in the United States to nearly 2.7 million more people with jobs in 2011 versus 2010.
With strong unions and legal protections for workers, Germany's labor market for years was compared unfavorably with the more flexible American one. Even after embarking on painful reforms, it suffered from high structural unemployment. In July, German unemployment was 7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent in the United States.
As Germany's population shrinks, some economists and policy makers are more concerned about a shortage of qualified workers than joblessness.
As for the young, the unemployment rate is the third lowest in Europe, behind only the Netherlands and Austria. Only 9.1 percent of people between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed here, less than half the 20.5 percent average in Europe.
''I wouldn't protest because I'm very content with my situation,'' said Kristina Kuhn, 21, a student out shopping on the upscale Kurfurstendamm boulevard on Monday afternoon. ''Young people can study, find jobs on the side and have opportunities for careers.''
A recent report in the daily newspaper Bild said that government experts expect the job boom to continue for another four years. In a survey of 1,800 Germans prepared for the business magazine WirtschaftsWoche by the Allensbach Institute for Public Opinion Research, a majority spoke of an era of increased insecurity, but a full 53 percent said they were optimistic about the next 12 months. Only 12 percent were pessimistic.
''They hear it on the news but for most Germans what they experience in their lives is completely different. The crisis is virtual,'' said Renate Kocher, the institute's director. ''What's decisive for most people is their own situation and for many people that has improved noticeably in the past three or four years.''
Still, for a country reliant on exports for growth, the possible slowdown in the global economy could have drastic and fairly sudden repercussions. No one can predict how the inward-looking Germans would react if things get worse here, as would happen if there were less of a market for their exports, but if the past is any guide, Ms. Kocher said, they are likely to be even stingier toward their neighbors and even less inclined toward the European Union in general.
In France, the second-largest economy in the European Union after Germany and that country's largest trading partner, consumer spending fell 0.7 percent in the second quarter, and growth was flat. Industrial production for the entire 17-nation euro area fell 0.7 percent in June.
''Germany is very dependent on its export markets and very dependent on world growth,'' said Stefan Bach, an economic researcher at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''But for now the job market continues to develop strongly in contrast to many other European countries.''
In some ways Germany has already been down the bumpy road toward economic restructuring its European partners now find themselves on. Its competitiveness came at a cost. Under the government of Gerhard Schroder, Mrs. Merkel's predecessor, large-scale protests broke out in response to difficult labor-market reforms, including making it easier to fire workers. German workers suffered through offshoring and layoffs, and even many who kept their jobs saw years of stagnant wages. But now, from the looks of things, the pain has paid off.
Germany's strength is not an anomaly but rather evidence of how the euro plays to its advantage. Now that less efficient economies like Greece and Portugal are locked into using the same currency, and cannot devalue to make their products more competitive in terms of price, Germany can keep selling to them.
As a result, Mrs. Merkel is under increasing pressure from abroad to buoy the weaker states, facing accusations that she is risking the financial stability of the bloc and with it the world by endorsing only half-measures. At home, she faces sharp criticism for inching closer to what critics here call a transfer union, sending German funds to wastrel neighbors.
The struggles and sorrows of their fellow Europeans are all over the nightly news. Yet so far, German trust in the euro appears steady. A survey of 2,366 people conducted by the Enmid polling institute in early August and published in Sunday's Bild found that 65 percent of Germans expect the euro to still be there in 2021, versus 31 percent who do not.
Ms. Kocher from the Allensbach Institute said that one result from the survey had truly surprised her. Of those questioned, 52 percent said they felt empathy for the protesters in Greece, while 39 percent said they did not.
''You always hear in the media and even in private discussions that Germans have no sympathy for the Greeks,'' Ms. Kocher said. ''But people remember the difficult transition they went through in the last decade, and they know it isn't easy.''

HEADLINE: The Clear Case for the Gas Tax: Without it, the highway system would crumble further and the economy would suffer

 BODY:
Unless Congress extends it, the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal gas tax will expire on Sept. 30. Allowing that to happen would be tremendously destructive. It would bankrupt the already stressed Highway Trust Fund, with devastating effects on the country's highways, bridges, mass transit systems and the economy as a whole. 
Reports suggest that some House Republicans may push to let the tax lapse or use the threat of expiration as leverage in the budget wars. This is a dangerous idea. If anything, the tax should rise to maintain a system that constantly needs upkeep -- the backlog of bridges needing repair is estimated at $72 billion -- creates jobs and encourages drivers to buy more fuel-efficient cars.
Excise taxes on motor fuels account for nearly nine-tenths of the $37 billion trust fund. The fund has lately required annual infusions from the Treasury Department to break even, and its obligations are growing. The gas tax has not increased since 1993, and its buying power, accounting for inflation, is now only 11 cents. Meanwhile, Americans are driving many more miles, placing greater stresses on the highway system.
When state taxes are added in, Americans pay, on average, about 43 cents per gallon in taxes -- or about one-eighth the total price at the pump. That's still a bargain compared with other industrial countries. Across Europe, drivers pay twice what Americans do at the pump -- and well over half of that is taxes. In Britain, the tax bite is more than $4 a gallon, or 10 times what Americans pay.
Though opponents will inevitably rail about taking money from the pockets of Americans in recessionary times, using gas-tax receipts on public investment puts that money right back into the economy. And ways can be found to cushion the blow for poorer and middle-class workers who depend on their cars by providing off-setting tax breaks through the earned income tax credit.
For both budgetary and environmental reasons, moderates from both parties have recommended increases in the tax. The Simpson-Bowles commission on budget reform urged an immediate 15 cent-per-gallon increase; former Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and John Danforth of Missouri have suggested a $1 increase to be phased in between now and 2020.
The loudest voices for ending the gas tax are coming from the right. Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, said his group would ask legislators to consider ending the gas tax ''cold turkey or phasing it out as soon as possible.'' But this is not exclusively a conservative phenomenon. There is something about the words ''gas taxes'' that drives otherwise sensible people to say silly things. In the 2008 campaign, when gas was around $3.60 a gallon, both Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain suggested a ''gas tax holiday.'' Barack Obama derided the idea then as a gimmick that would do little for consumers and nothing to end America's dependence on foreign oil.
Before Congress starts running with another very bad idea, President Obama should press to extend the tax now. And he should start explaining why -- for the sake of the economy, the environment and a functioning transportation system -- this tax will need to rise.

HEADLINE: In Campaign Style, President Kicks Off Three-State Bus Tour

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
CANNON FALLS, Minn. -- For most of the summer, President Obama has been under siege in the White House. On Monday, he became a road warrior, kicking off a three-day bus tour of the Midwest that provided him campaign-style opportunities to strike back at Republicans in a region vital to his re-election.
Traveling in a black bus with dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights that looked like something out of a ''Mad Max'' movie, the president urged audiences in Minnesota and Iowa to tell their elected officials they would no longer tolerate the partisan gridlock on display in the recent debt-ceiling talks.
''You've got to send a message to Washington that it is time for the games to stop,'' he told a crowd of 500 under a canopy of elm and black walnut trees here. 
''It's time to put country first,'' he said, recycling a line used by his Republican opponent in the 2008 presidential race, Senator John McCain of Arizona.
The tour did not quite match the jaunty charm of bus trips by would-be presidents, including Mr. Obama himself. But in his appearance here, and later at a more freewheeling one at an Iowa seed exchange, he struck themes intended to appeal to moderate and independent voters, while drawing sharp contrasts with Republicans.
''I'm here to enlist you in a fight,'' said Mr. Obama, tieless and in shirt-sleeves. He called on the crowd to demand leaders who choose ''the next generation over the next election.''
When Congress reconvenes next month, he said, he hoped it would move swiftly to lift the nation's fragile economy.
The three-state swing, which included impromptu stops at a school and a coffee shop where Mr. Obama loaded up on apple and pumpkin pie, is an effort to reclaim the initiative after a dismal summer in which the president was stymied on the debt talks and then rebuked with a downgrade of the country's credit rating.
At his first stop in Iowa, Mr. Obama said he would have work ready for Congress when it returned from its recess.
''I'll be putting forward when they come back in September a very specific plan to boost the economy, to create jobs and to control our deficit,'' he said. ''And my attitude is get it done.''
The Midwest trip is also putting Mr. Obama center stage in places where the Republican campaign for the presidency is heating up, and at a time when the president's approval ratings are at an all-time low. Republicans held a straw poll Saturday in Ames, Iowa, that was won by Representative Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota, and on Monday Gov. Rick Perry of Texas stumped in Iowa.
The president took a few shots at the Republican field, noting with an incredulous tone that none of the candidates, when asked at a debate, said they would support a deficit-reduction plan that included one dollar of tax increases for every $10 of spending cuts. ''That's just not common sense,'' he said.
Mr. Obama also obliquely criticized Mitt Romney, noting that Republicans had supported health-care plans that contained individual mandates -- as Mr. Romney did while governor of Massachusetts, and as Mr. Obama's health-care plan does -- only to disavow them later in what he described as a case of ''amnesia.''
The president's itinerary is giving him a homespun backdrop for his hard-edged message, taking him past family farms and through fly-speck towns like Peosta, Iowa, (population 1,377) and Alpha, Ill. (pop. 671) .
Standing before a red barn bathed in a rosy evening sun in Decorah, Iowa, Mr. Obama had a lively back-and-forth with a supportive, but often challenging, crowd. One young woman asked whether his backers could be confident he would not break their trust by cutting deals with Republicans on taxes and entitlements, given what she said were his negotiating tactics on the debt ceiling that ''cut away at that trust.''
Mr. Obama replied that the collateral economic damage from a national default would simply have been too great for him not to find a compromise with Republicans.
Another woman quizzed him on how he planned to get his economic agenda through Congress in September, given the lack of Republican cooperation. Mr. Obama said he understood the public's frustration with Washington because, he declared, ''the other side is unreasonable.''
Other people were more sympathetic. In Cannon Falls, David Hauge, 77, a farmer, said, ''People have got to remember how close we were to utter chaos'' when Mr. Obama took office. Mr. Hauge said he was baffled by the no-new-taxes pledge taken by many Republicans, adding, ''I can't imagine what it's like to negotiate with them.''
For a trip conceived as an economic tour, the choice of stops was curious. Cannon Falls and the other towns visited by Mr. Obama are faring better than much of the country, with lower unemployment rates.
White House officials said the point was to take the president to bucolic places not easily reached by Air Force One. Last week, they noted, he visited Michigan, a state that typifies the miseries of industrial America.
Certainly, this riverfront town hummed with excitement when Mr. Obama's caravan rumbled through. Crowds lined the streets and massed in front of the Old Market Deli, where he had lunch with five military veterans. Smaller groups clustered in lawn chairs in Decorah.
At the Coffee Mill in Zumbrota, Minn., Mr. Obama approached the pie case with a finger pressed to his lips. His order included a coconut cream pie, which he handed off to an aide. He stopped again at an elementary school and posed for pictures with children in brightly colored shirts.
While the White House billed all this as a presidential visit, the line between that and a campaign event is fine: loudspeakers blared standard Obama campaign anthems by U2 and Brooks & Dunn. Mr. Obama also spent a lot of time promoting his administration's commitment to rural America, talking about plans to develop alternative fuels, erect windmills and extend broadband networks to remote farms.
Still, those visions took a back seat to the shadows over the economy. The president pleaded for patience, saying that the United States had been dealt a string of bad luck but that the job market would recover in time.
He offered mostly familiar remedies like extending the reduction in payroll taxes and winning Congressional approval of free trade agreements. Officials played down hopes for major announcements on this trip.
''I know you're frustrated,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and I'm frustrated, too.''

HEADLINE: A Recess Destination With Bipartisan Support: Israel and the West Bank

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Looking for your member of Congress? Try Jerusalem.
More than 80 members of the House are visiting Israel this month as guests of the American Israel Education Foundation, a charity affiliated with the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee. It is the largest number of members of Congress ever to make the trip during a single recess, according to the organizers.
The numbers reflect both the size of the freshman Congressional class, which accounts for 47 of the visitors, and the enduring efforts of Israel to court its most friendly ally, the United States Congress. 
Having roughly one-fifth of the House visiting the region is particularly striking when the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is strained. An effort by Mr. Obama to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians fell flat this spring. Now the Palestinians are weighing a request to the United Nations Security Council to support a bid for statehood, leaving Washington in the uncomfortable position of blocking such a unilateral move while supporting democracy movements in other Arab nations.
''I think that what you have going on is a real bipartisan support for Israel in the Congress,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the most powerful Jewish member of Congress.
''The White House and president have not been as clear as where it stands and he stands on the relationship, and that has added interest on the part of the members,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''With Iran continuing to pursue nuclear capabilities, and with the upcoming vote in the U.N., which is a very destabilizing event, it is very important for us to be there and show what is at stake.''
The weeklong trips began earlier in the month with 26 Democratic members, who were accompanied by Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip, and are continuing over the next several days with 55 Republicans, who arrive in two delegations. (Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, will spend time with both.)
The trips' schedules include visits to both Israel and the West Bank, as well as meetings with President Shimon Peres and Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and with the Palestinian Authority's president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah. For many of the lawmakers, the trip is their first time in Israel.
''It's my responsibility to be able to advocate on pro-Israel issues,'' said Representative Michael Grimm of New York, a freshman who went with the first group of Republicans, in a telephone interview from the country. ''Coming here and being able to feel it and touch it to fully understand how daily life is for an Israeli is important. You have to actually see it and realize it is such a profound observation that everything is so close; everything is almost on top of each other.''
The trips have attracted criticism from a variety of groups, including supporters of the Palestinians and critics of American foreign aid, especially that for Israel. But in a rare show of bipartisanship, both Republicans and Democrats defended the trip.
''No one fails to go to Israel without a better understanding of the birthplace of the three major religions,'' said Mr. Hoyer, who has been to the country 12 times, adding that he agreed with Mr. Cantor's reasons for visiting the nation. ''Every time you go to Israel there are new circumstances and new challenges.''
Mr. Hoyer rejected the suggestion of critics that members ought to be attending only to domestic affairs right now.
''The Congress and its members can do multiple things at the same time,'' Mr. Hoyer said. ''Clearly the economic concerns of our country are great. But clearly the concerns in the Middle East obviously do have an impact on our economy given the energy supply that emanates from the Middle East and given the concerns we have with stabilizing the Middle East.''

HEADLINE: A Gold Standard Is Not Unthinkable

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
Fiat money has worked well since Richard Nixon ended the dollar's peg to gold 40 years ago this week, but this latest recession must gnaw at believers. If years of ultra-cheap cash give rise to serious inflation or an accelerated retreat of the American currency, the gold standard, however erratic and deflationary, could start to appeal again.
The arrangement born at Bretton Woods and used for nearly three decades was not a true gold standard, as it was entirely intergovernmental and the private holding of gold was illegal in America. It thus lacked the virtue of independence from political meddling, failed to provide anti-inflationary benefits and collapsed once its American sponsors no longer controlled the world economy. 
The true gold standard, in which gold coins circulated freely as legal tender, was started in Britain in 1717 and lasted for just under 200 years, interrupted only during the Napoleonic wars.
Compared with an ideal, stable and noninflationary monetary system, free from influence by elected officials, the gold standard has two flaws. The metal's supply is erratic. It can soar unexpectedly with new discoveries, thus causing currency values to fluctuate. Conversely, new deposits tend to be found slowly, making a gold standard excessively deflationary when population growth is rapid. That is what contributed to the standard's breakdown after 1900.
World population growth is now declining after its annual peak of 2.2 percent in the early 1960s. By 2030, it is forecast to fall below the 0.72 percent rate of 1900. That would make a gold standard practicable and not too deflationary.
That doesn't make it any more likely that central bankers would embrace it, despite advocacy from critics of quantitative easing and the Federal Reserve like Steve Forbes and Ron Paul. For one thing, it would drastically undercut the banks' influence.
But further chipping at the dollar's credibility, further downgrades of United States credit or other harmful results from years of very low interest rates could bring more people around to the idea of a new reserve currency. A return to the gold standard remains unlikely, but it's no longer unthinkable.
China's Speed Demons
China's high-speed railways may create a debt crisis. The government plans to spend 2.8 trillion renminbi ($438 billion) in the next five years improving the system, at least half of which is likely to come from borrowing. It has already spent about 2.1 trillion renminbi. It's hard to see how it will all be paid back.
The proposed 16,000 kilometers of lines due by 2020 is more than exist in the world today. China is ideally suited to building high-speed rail. Whereas such lines typically cost at least $35 million per kilometer, China's cost about $15 million.
Financing has so far been easy. The ministry of railways uses the proceeds of bond issues, freight surcharges and past ticket sales to provide equity. Local governments add more equity, while the remainder comes from bank loans. The typical project is 50-50 equity and debt, though the debt share has risen.
The trouble is that most Chinese passengers aren't prepared to pay high prices to save a little time. Tickets on China's new lines work out at 6 cents a kilometer, or about half the fares elsewhere in Asia, according to the World Bank. Construction delays and more safety checks after the fatal collision in July in the coastal city of Wenzhou will probably push costs up, and demand down.
That makes an eventual debt problem more likely. Railways are notorious for creating debt overhangs, even in rich countries. That said, even a cash-burning rail system brings benefits.
It will free up clogged freight lines, create growth in deprived rural areas and reduce high-polluting air travel. So it is likely that the government will stand behind the some 2.1 trillion renminbi of outstanding ministry of railways debts.
But that's little comfort to private investors in banks. China Construction Bank, for one, has lent the equivalent of 2.8 percent of its regulatory capital to a single railway operator. Lending for ''transportation'' has grown more than 60 percent in two years at the four biggest banks, with collateral backing as little as 30 percent. When payday comes, bank shareholders may be the ones taken for a ride.

HEADLINE: Lowe's Posted Flat Income In Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Lowe's Companies, the home improvement retailer, posted flat quarterly income on Monday as volatile weather and consumers' concerns about the economy muted demand during the company's important summer selling season. 
Lowe's lowered its sales forecast for the second half of its fiscal year as a result of consumers' uncertainty, the chief executive, Robert A. Niblock, said.
Mr. Niblock cited three factors likely to hurt spending: the debate in Washington this month over the debt ceiling, the subsequent downgrade by Standard & Poor's of the nation's long-term credit rating and the recent stock market fluctuations.
Shoppers continue to focus on repair and maintenance projects under $500, he added, rather than larger home renovation jobs.
Lowe's closed seven stores Sunday that it said were underperforming; the move eliminated 650 jobs.
The company said it earned $830 million, or 64 cents a share. That compares with $832 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding a charge related to the long-term value of the stores it closed, it earned 68 cents a share. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share, according to FactSet.
Revenue in the period, which ended July 29 and was the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, rose 1 percent, to $14.54 billion. Analysts expected $14.77 billion.
Mr. Niblock said in a statement that the performance fell short of the company's expectations, despite some recovery in seasonal sales.
Shares of Lowe's, which is based in Mooresville, N.C., rose 17 cents, to $19.68 on Monday.
The company said its revenue in stores open at least a year fell 0.3 percent. Lowe's results were strongest in the North Central and Northeast regions of the country as customers made repairs after a winter of snow and ice storms. Results were weaker in the Gulf Coast, which has suffered heat and drought this summer.

HEADLINE: A Confident Perry Lingers to Make Friends at the Fair

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was about to be overshadowed by yet another heckler at the Iowa State Fair on Monday when he turned to an old cheerleading trick.
''Do we have any Aggies in the crowd?'' asked Mr. Perry, summoning a voice from his days back on the yell squad at Texas A&M as he looked over a swarm of people who gathered to see his debut here as a Republican presidential candidate. ''We've got to have some Aggies in the crowd!''
With that, a cheer rose up and the audience burst into applause. The heckler, similar to one who irritated Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann at the same spot a few days earlier, was swiftly silenced. As a satisfying smile stretched across his face, he quickly resumed telling voters why he believes he should be the next president.
''I get a little bit passionate,'' Mr. Perry said. ''I think you want a president who is passionate about America -- that's in love with America.'' 
The introduction of Mr. Perry as an aspiring presidential candidate unfolded in bite-size pieces, with fresh details emerging as he sauntered across the fairgrounds on the third day of his announcement tour. The path had already been well worn by his Republican rivals who camped out in the state last week, but he breezed in like a long-lost visitor, so confident that he blew kisses into a camera when asked about Mr. Romney. ''Give him my love,'' Mr. Perry said.
The addition of Mr. Perry to the presidential campaign has changed the landscape of the Republican field -- particularly for Mr. Romney and Mrs. Bachmann -- while injecting a shot of vigor into the contest. Whether making up for lost time or feeling an itch to engage while he had a ready audience, Mr. Perry held a rolling conversation with reporters, interrupted again and again by people rushing over to thank him for joining the race. It continued at an evening stop in Cedar Rapids, when asked if Mr. Obama loved America, he said, ''You'd have to ask him.'' He also said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would get ''ugly'' treatment in Texas for his policies.
Asked about comparisons to George W. Bush, he said: ''I'm Rick Perry. He's George Bush. Our records are quite different.'' He added, ''I went to Texas A&M; he went to Yale. George Bush is not my opponent.''
Asked about Sarah Palin, he said: ''Sarah is a dear friend. She'll make the right decision.''
But it was the questions about Mr. Romney that seemed to most engage Mr. Perry.
''Take a look at his record when he was governor. Take a look at my record,'' Mr. Perry said. A few minutes later, he added: ''I wasn't on Wall Street. I wasn't working in Bain Capital,'' forging directly at the critique that Mr. Romney has made against him -- that his credentials are limited to government service, not deep experience in the private sector.
(At nearly the same time in New Hampshire on Monday, Mr. Romney said it was critical to have experience from the ''real economy,'' but he refrained from direct criticism of Mr. Perry. He added, ''I've learned how the economy works, and I believe that skill is what the nation is looking for.'')
The long-distance exchange, experience in the public sector versus the private sector, highlights a central argument that will be debated until Republicans choose a nominee next year to challenge President Obama. The bumper sticker message of Mr. Perry's candidacy, ''Getting America Working Again,'' is painted on his campaign bus, which on Wednesday will come within a few miles of Mr. Obama's own bus tour.
''This president has been an abject failure when it comes to the economy,'' Mr. Perry said.
For his part, Mr. Perry seemed pleased to take as many questions on the subject that came his way. He paused for a moment, as he reached a patch of shade on a warm afternoon, and told how he would lower the nation's unemployment rate.
''This is pretty simple stuff,'' Mr. Perry said. ''You don't have to be a rocket scientist. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand that you have to keep the taxes low, have a regulatory climate that's fair and predictable and you have a legal system that doesn't allow for over-suing.''
The freewheeling atmosphere that surrounded Mr. Perry, whose smile broadened every time a passer-by offered a wave or an encouraging word, stood in contrast to Mr. Romney. Four days earlier, Mr. Romney was surrounded by admirers, too, though he did not linger to absorb the compliments as Mr. Perry did.
Even in casual conservations, Mr. Perry inserted salient pieces of his message, particularly how 40 percent of the jobs created in the United States over the last two years have been in Texas. When a reporter asked how the same theory could apply to the entire nation, given that many of the jobs came from California and others were specific to the oil and gas industry, Mr. Perry raised his hand to signal silence.
''Come on now, son,'' he said. ''You've got to get your economics hat on here.''
If a presidential campaign could be won simply by kissing babies, high-fiving young boys and warmly embracing older women -- all of which Mr. Perry did with an enthusiasm and ease that only the most gifted politicians can muster -- then the transition from governor to candidate could be effortless.
But a morning visit to the state's most influential conservative radio station, WHO-AM, offered a view of the rigors ahead, with every detail from his decade-long record as governor as fair game for a fresh dissection. Listeners peppered Mr. Perry with a variety of questions, asking about an anti-cancer vaccine he required for young girls and his Democrat-to-Republican conversion after serving as Texas chairman for Al Gore's 1988 presidential bid.
''This was Al Gore before he invented the Internet and got to be Mr. Global Warming,'' Mr. Perry said, explaining how he was surrounded by conservative Democrats growing up in Paint Creek, Tex., before switching parties two decades ago. ''When you looked at the candidates, Al Gore was the most conservative candidate out there.''
Five months before voters begin making their judgments in the Republican contest, Mr. Perry is racing to introduce himself. He arrived 10 minutes early to deliver a speech at the fair's political soapbox, asking organizers: ''Can I just go up there and get after it?'' He paused long enough to remind a boy to study hard when school starts later this month.
Asked about his own academic record, which opponents have tried to use against him in previous campaigns, he declared: ''I'm going to be graded on how many jobs I created.''

HEADLINE: Republican Extremism, Bad Economics

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a Wall Street executive and a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, is a contributing writer to Op-Ed.

 BODY:
IN the middle of all the debt default drama and stock market turbulence, the leading Republican presidential candidates have begun to fill in the shadowy outlines of their positions on major economic issues.
And what a picture it is, a philosophy oriented around shrinking the role of the federal government in every imaginable way, by slashing spending, cutting taxes and halting or rescinding regulations. Their mantra is repeal and retrenchment, devoid of new initiatives or a positive agenda.
Some of these views are to the right even of the Tea Party; they amount to the most radically conservative positions of any set of candidates at least since Barry M. Goldwater in 1964. 
Take the agreement to avert a disastrous default by cutting at least $2.1 trillion from the deficit over the next decade. Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul all opposed it. Only Jon M. Huntsman Jr. (whose poll numbers -- perhaps not coincidentally -- are in the single digits) supported it. In contrast, 58 percent of the members of the Tea Party in the House ultimately cast yes votes.
Not to be outdone, Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Paul ventured still further, insisting that they would never vote to raise the debt ceiling. That may sound good on the Iowa campaign trail, but it would easily tip the economy into an unending downward spiral.
Then there's ''cut, cap and balance,'' the Tea Party-backed bill that the House passed in the midst of the debt ceiling showdown. It would have forced the elimination of a quarter of government spending, down to a share of the economy last reached in 1966.
The measure would also have initiated amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget, which would impede our ability to manage economic cycles. Yes, Ronald Reagan also favored a balanced budget amendment -- while supporting raising the debt ceiling 17 times.
Another recent legislative proposal that won support among the hopefuls -- an alternative budget proposal from Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin -- would have turned Medicare into a voucher program, shifting the bulk of the cost to the elderly.
But these are only the best-known of this crowd's extreme views. In an unpublished interview, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas told Fortune magazine that if he had been president in 2008, he wouldn't have engaged in the financial rescue effort. Without the bailout, initiated by the Bush administration, we would not have a functioning economy today.
Mr. Perry also wants to repeal the 16th Amendment, thereby eliminating the income tax, which accounts for 80 percent of government revenue. Like his fellow aspirants, Mr. Perry has offered no analysis to explain how the government would function under his vision.
Mr. Paul, who finished second in the Iowa straw poll on Saturday, has for decades sought to abolish the Federal Reserve, arguing that it is corrupt and unconstitutional. Eliminating our central bank is a crazy idea that would plunge the country back into an oscillating 19th-century world of panics and busts.
Mrs. Bachmann's victory in the Iowa straw poll has only encouraged her extremism. In interviews over the weekend, she proclaimed her opposition to extending unemployment insurance for the jobless and her support for repealing both the Obama health care plan and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And she said that Citigroup and General Motors should have been allowed to go bankrupt without government help. (Even The Wall Street Journal's editorial page appears unnerved; it called Monday for ''a candidate who can appeal across the party's disparate factions.'')
The candidates' extreme views on economic policies reinforce the broad perception that American politics have become more polarized. Keith T. Poole, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, found that ideological divergence in Congress was the highest in at least 120 years. Interestingly, he concluded that the increased polarization resulted mostly from Republicans' moving to the right, a conclusion that dovetails with the fact that Mr. Obama remains basically centrist even as his would-be opponents vie to outdo each other in their extreme form of conservatism.
Perhaps these Republican aspirants are simply pandering to antigovernment sentiment and, if elected, would govern more sensibly. Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned on eliminating ''unnecessary functions of government'' and then vastly expanded federal spending to fight the Depression. Bill Clinton did the reverse, pledging tax cuts in response to the 1990-1 recession but governing as a fiscal moderate. If any of these Republicans is elected, we can only hope that they will follow this pattern. Meantime, we have a lot to worry about.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Sheds a Unit

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Bank of America took steps on Monday to exit the international credit card business, agreeing to sell its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block. 
With the announcements, Bank of America continued the push to overhaul its credit card business as the bank reels from hefty losses in its troubled mortgage division. While dumping the international card business, Bank of America has largely retained its card loans in the United States, among other core assets. The bank said it hoped the deals would shore up its capital ratios.
''Our strategy is clear: We have been transforming the company to deliver the franchise to our core customer groups, and building a fortress balance sheet behind that,'' Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive, said in a statement. ''While the credit card remains a fundamental core product for our U.S. customers, an international consumer card business under another brand is not consistent with that strategy.''
Since Mr. Moynihan took over in early 2010, the bank has sold some 20 businesses for roughly $30 billion. One big deal was announced in May, as the bank shed its remaining stake in BlackRock for $2.5 billion.
The moves come as Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank by assets, struggles to regain its footing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The beleaguered bank announced an $8.8 billion second-quarter loss after it agreed to settle huge legal claims surrounding its ill-fated acquisition of the subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial.
The bank's remaining European card portfolios are even bigger assets. The bank manages a combined $19 billion in credit card loans in Britain and Ireland, which it now plans to sell. That business employs about 4,000 people.

HEADLINE: In Texas Jobs Boom, Crediting a Leader, or Luck

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Texas is home to at least one-third of the jobs created nationwide since the recession ended. The state's economy is growing about twice as fast as the national rate. Home prices have remained stable even as much of the country has seen sharp declines.
Is Texas lucky, or has the state benefited from exceptional leadership? As Gov. Rick Perry campaigned Monday in Iowa for the Republican presidential nomination -- with the economy dominating the national political landscape -- the answer to that question is central to his candidacy.
Even before he formally entered the race over the weekend, Mr. Perry and his allies set out to dictate an economic narrative on his terms. A radio spot last week in Iowa told voters that the governor ''has a proven record of controlling spending and creating jobs'' and suggested that he could replicate the success of Texas on a national scale. In a budget speech a few months ago, Mr. Perry, who declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article, boasted that Texas stood ''in stark contrast to states that choose to burden their residents with higher taxes and onerous regulatory mandates.'' 
But some economists as well as Perry skeptics suggest that Mr. Perry stumbled into the Texas miracle. They say that the governor has essentially put Texas on autopilot for 11 years, and it was the state's oil and gas boom -- not his political leadership -- that kept the state afloat. They also doubt that the Texas model, regardless of Mr. Perry's role in shaping it, could be effectively applied to the nation's far more complex economic problems.
''Because the Texas economy has been prosperous during his tenure as governor, he has not had to make the draconian choices that one would have to make in the White House,'' said Bryan W. Brown, chairman of the Rice University economics department and a critic of Mr. Perry's economic record.
And if Mr. Perry were to win the nomination, he would face critics, among them Democrats, who have long complained that the state's economic health came at a steep price: a long-term hollowing out of its prospects because of deep cuts to education spending, low rates of investment in research and development, and a disparity in the job market that confines many blacks and Hispanics to minimum-wage jobs without health insurance.
''The Texas model can't be the blueprint for the United States to successfully compete in the 21st-century economy, where you need a well-educated work force,'' said Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based liberal research group.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Perry is hearing none of it. In announcing his candidacy in South Carolina on Saturday, he pointed to his policies of low taxes, reduced government spending and regulatory easing as ''a recipe to produce the strongest economy in the nation'' and one that Washington would do well to duplicate.
Since Mr. Perry succeeded George W. Bush as governor in 2000, he has viewed his role as mostly staying out of the way of the private sector. When he has stepped in, he has tweaked the system, not remade it. For example, he pushed through tort reform to limit lawsuits against doctors, which encouraged the continued expansion of major medical centers. He also set up an enterprise fund that gave businesses nearly a half a billion dollars in grants and financial incentives over the last eight years to encourage their expansion.
For homeowners, he cut real estate taxes to make the state's already cheap housing a bit more affordable. And a few months ago, with the state facing a $27 billion deficit in its two-year budget, Mr. Perry called lawmakers into a special session and insisted they not raise taxes. The Republican-dominated Legislature complied, slashing billions of dollars in aid to public schools.
''He's been a promoter of stability in regulatory policy and stability in spending,'' said Talmadge Heflin, director of the Texas Public Policy Foundation's Center for Fiscal Policy and a former Republican state representative. ''That gives him something to show for whatever he runs for.''
As the Republican race pits the Texas governor against a former Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, the economies of the two states are bound to be contrasted. Texas has far outstripped Massachusetts in the number of jobs created over the last two years. But by other measures, the Massachusetts economy has been stronger, with a lower unemployment rate in June and economic growth of 4.2 percent last year, compared with 2.8 percent in Texas.
Few debate that Mr. Perry, 61, has been true to a ''less government is better government'' philosophy in one of the few states without an income tax. The question his detractors raise, however, is whether Mr. Perry has gotten a free ride -- and has gone untested -- because of the state's natural resources.
When Mr. Perry succeeded Mr. Bush, a barrel of oil was $25. Experts warned that Texas's natural gas and oil fields, which directly and indirectly support about one-third of its jobs, were in steep decline. But during his first term, global market forces began driving oil prices up. They peaked at $147 a barrel in 2008 and have largely remained above $80 over the last two years.
At the same time, a technological revolution in drilling -- the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling of shale rock -- has opened up new gas and oil fields throughout the state. In North Texas, companies are drilling under schools, airports and parks. Tens of thousands of rig jobs have been created and many residents have received thousands of dollars in lease sales and royalties.
The oil and gas industry now delivers roughly $325 billion a year to the state, directly and indirectly. It brings in $13 billion in state tax receipts, or roughly 40 percent of the total, financing up to 20 percent of the state budget.
''He's been lucky,'' said Bernard L. Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ''Obviously, neither the governor nor public policy in Texas has pushed oil prices up, and clearly the technological innovation has created a whole new industry in Texas.''
Other external factors have also helped.
Trade between the United States and Mexico has grown by 60 percent since Mr. Perry's inauguration, and last year alone more than $100 billion worth of goods passed through Texas border crossings and ports.
El Paso, the state's largest border city, is straining to keep up. Manufacturers have been running extra shifts to make parts for automobile and electronics plants in nearby Juarez, Mexico.
The federal government has also helped support Texas. Federal spending in the state, home of NASA and large Army bases, more than doubled over the last decade to over $200 billion a year.
And well before Mr. Perry's arrival in the Statehouse, Texas had digested the lessons of the recession in the late 1980s, when oil prices plummeted, real estate prices crashed, and savings and loan institutions failed and required a federal bailout.
Afterward, a succession of governors and mayors worked with business leaders to diversify the economy, and the Legislature enacted tight restrictions on mortgage lending, which helped Texas avoid the kind of real estate bubble that devastated states like Florida and Arizona.
This time around, the state has not escaped the downturn. The unemployment rate is 8.2 percent, a full percentage point below the national rate but still higher than other boom states like North Dakota and Wyoming, and Texas has one of the highest percentages of workers who are paid the minimum wage and receive no medical benefits.
And Mr. Perry could still be tested before next year's election. Oil prices have fallen almost 30 percent since April, and a broad economic slowdown could depress prices further. Texas will also feel the pain as Washington cuts spending on the military and space exploration, and the state trims spending.
Still, over all, Texas remains in an enviable position. The state has created more than 260,000 jobs since June 2009, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and the state's economy is growing at an estimated annual rate of about 3 percent, compared with the national growth rate in the last quarter of 1.3 percent.
At a recent ceremony celebrating the expansion of a video game company, Electronic Arts, that will bring 300 new jobs to Austin, Mr. Perry claimed credit.
''Thanks to our low taxes, reasonable and predictable regulatory climate, fair legal system and skilled work force, we continue to attract companies from around the nation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Thinking About a Double Dip

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: My business is in far better shape than it was at the beginning of the last recession. On the other hand, there could be a truck heading for me right now that I'm not seeing.

 BODY:
Watching the debt-ceiling talks and the stock market's gyrations the last few weeks, along with the resulting fears that we may be entering another recession, has reminded me of something that happened many years ago.
Christmas Eve, 1986. I was driving from Philadelphia to Boston with my wife in a 1977 Ford Fairmont to spend the holiday with family. We left Philadelphia around 2 o'clock in the afternoon and drove in heavy rain the whole way. As we crossed the border from Connecticut into Massachusetts that evening, the rain turned to sleet and then snow. The road wasn't covered, but it started to feel slippery. The Fairmont didn't have anti-lock brakes, or airbags, and it was terrible in snow, so I was careful to leave plenty of room between me and the cars ahead. And then we crested a hill just outside Worcester. 
I could see about half a mile ahead of me -- a long, straight line of tail lights, vanishing into the gloom. Suddenly, the lights weren't in a line any more. Twenty or so cars ahead of me, they started sliding from left to right, some winking on and off (a car was spinning) and all the rest flashing as drivers started pumping their brakes frantically, trying to keep from skidding. A clump of battered vehicles formed ahead of me -- a big chain-reaction crash. I hit the brakes as I saw the beginning of the accident, and the Fairmont immediately started to slide. So I started pumping, too. The extra space I'd left in front of me saved us. I was able to get the car stopped about 15 feet from the last car in the pileup, which was turned sideways across the left lane. I turned to see if my wife was O.K., and she was looking back at me, wide eyed.
There was a person standing just in front of my car, someone who had climbed out of one of the stopped cars. He was waving his arms frantically. I was looking at him and thinking, "No problem, buddy, I stopped." And then a semitrailer hit our left rear quarter panel. The left side of the trunk was crushed. All of the glass in the car shattered instantly. My head was jerked and slammed into the door pillar to my left, which nearly severed my ear. We were pushed into the car in front of us. I have no idea what happened to the guy waving his arms -- I never saw him again. I don't remember much of the next few minutes, but I was able to get out of the car (which I also never saw again). My wife was unhurt.
We spent some time by the side of the road, and were taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. I spent the rest of the evening waiting for stitches, surrounded by the casualties of an icy holiday evening. I was bloody and had a headache, but 15 stitches re-attached my ear. Many of my fellow patients weren't so lucky -- ambulances arrived in a steady stream and I shared a room with a drunk whose face had had a close encounter with his windshield.
What does this have to do with gyrations in the stock market? Nothing at all, I hope. But I have a suspicion that, once again, I may end up paying for someone else's misjudgment of dangerous conditions. My business isn't tied directly to the price of stocks. So if consumers pull back on spending in reaction to changes in the stock market and their net worth, we shouldn't see immediate effects. Last week, we got 13 calls from new clients, which is a decent number for August. (New inquiries per week have ranged from a low of eight to a high of 17 this year.) Even with the market going crazy, we sold two jobs worth almost $50,000, and sales for both the year and the month are where I wanted them to be.
One thing I learned from the last recession: there's always work out there. And if we do enter another recession, I'll have time to prepare. People order conference tables as the finishing touch on construction projects. Those projects usually take a year or more from planning to completion. So I'll be watching for a general slowdown of commercial construction and then a slowdown of the rate of inquiries. That could happen if other businesses are affected by a stock market dive.
Even if the economy does enter another recession, I may see little impact. If I can take market share from my competitors, for example, my sales might not go down at all. I spent a half hour on Friday looking at all of my competitor's Web sites, and I saw nothing new. I am still in the process of upgrading and improving my own site, and our Google rankings in free search continue to improve. Let someone else suffer: I'm going to keep spending money on the Web site and AdWords.
So am I worried? Not about the things I can control. My business is in far, far better shape than it was at the beginning of the last recession. On the other hand, there could be a semi sliding at me right now that I'm not seeing. There certainly are a lot of people waving their hands and shouting a warning. What's going to hit us next? European debt default? Washington's collective I.Q. dipping into negative numbers? Terrorist attack? The next plague? I can't do anything about any of those things, so I'll keep running my business the way I am now and just deal with the next thing when it happens.

HEADLINE: The Industry With the Most Steadfast Retirement Savers

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: In a comparison of retirement savings by industry, utility workers topped the list.

 BODY:
What is it about utility workers? They apparently are among the country's most dedicated retirement savers, according to new research from Vanguard.
Larger numbers of employees of small utility companies tend to save more in their 401(k) plans than workers in many other industries, the study found. Those at utility firms with fewer than 1,000 employees had a 92 percent participation rate. (Employees at large mining companies followed, with an 88 percent participation rate.) Vanguard plans as a whole had a 74 percent average participation rate.
On average, participants in the plans of both small and large utilities saved a higher percentage of their incomes, too: their 9 percent and 8.2 percent average contribution rates, respectively, surpassed the 6.8 percent average rate for Vanguard plans over all.
The study did not delve into the details of why certain industries were better than others at signing up employees and encouraging them to save. But longer-term employees in profitable industries tend to save more in general. And it may also be that some lines of work attract people who are inclined to be better long-term planners.
Utilities, for instance, tend to have workers who can map out gas production for the next 20 years. They may also apply those skills to their own retirement-saving efforts. "Utilities have engineers, armed with their spreadsheets," said Steve Utkus, head of Vanguard's Center for Retirement Research.
The industry studies are part of Vanguard's annual How America Savesreport, which examined overall patterns of more than three million participants in plans administered by Vanguard.
The report notes that overall plan participation dropped a bit, as the tough economy canceled out increases in participation due to automatic enrollment. (The report was released before the most recent stock market turmoil.)

HEADLINE: Making Low-Interest Auto Loans Work

BYLINE: LISA MARGONELLI


HIGHLIGHT: A followup, with reader comments, to a column on affordable car loans.

 BODY:
Last week I wrote about the New England-based program More Than Wheels, which helps people get low-interest loans on new or good used cars, and allows them to save money on repairs, gas and financing. Most of the commenters - especially those who live in rural areas - liked the idea of the program, but there were a few persistent questions and issues:
"Educator," from Maine, answered that question: "I am glad many of our readers have learned to be carfree. But living in rural areas may mean being close to mom - babysitting - and cheap trailers ($200 a year property tax vs. $1000 a month rent in the city), and many jobs are in rural areas - clerking in a store, waiting on table, working in light manufacturing, being a teacher's aid in a school. None of these pays over $20 K." 
Recent studies agree with "educator," and have found that owning a functioning car is key to finding a job. This article quotes research by Evelyn Blumenberg, professor of urban planning at UCLA, which found that residents of Los Angeles's Watts neighborhood who owned cars could access 59 times as many jobs as those without cars. And mass transit seems to provide better access to high-skill jobs than to middle- and low-skill jobs, according to a recent report by the Brookings Institution - leaving lower-paid workers more dependent upon cars. 
Several commenters felt that the $895 More Than Wheels charges is high. I contacted chief executive Terri Steingrebe to get a better sense of why the fee is part of the program. "We don't think of ourselves as a social service," she wrote back, "we see ourselves as a social enterprise." In part, the fee (which is folded into the cost of the loan, not paid up-front) offsets the $6,000 or so of services the average client receives from the organization. 
Perhaps more importantly, the fee is part of More Than Wheels's long-term plan to be more self sustaining - at a higher volume of clients these fees could cover 65 percent of the costs of the program, making the organization less dependent upon donations. Steingrebe says clients study the fees and compare them to the cost of getting a car and credit on their own and find them favorable: "What we've observed is that people are not looking for a handout. And they take pride in paying for at least a portion of the cost of these services."
More Than Wheels spent its early years dealing exclusively with rural New Hampshire residents, but with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Boston-based Strategic Grant Partners the program has expanded to the Boston area in the hopes of testing its model in an urban setting and, eventually, growing across the region and possibly the country. In Boston, obviously, they're dealing with a different situation than New Hampshire: while the city has public transportation, people who work odd hours, multiple jobs, live in farther-away suburbs or have family members with health concerns still sorely need cars.
Nevertheless, the Boston population did not immediately respond to advertising. So More Than Wheels established an 800 number, entered formal relationships with lenders and car dealers across the Boston area, and put an evaluation system in place. But potential clients, accustomed to the abuses of the used-auto industry, were suspicious. The most frequent question was, "Why are you trying to help me?" People felt it was too good to be true. So More Than Wheels has worked to get the word out through churches and immigrant service groups, and has also formed a partnership with the Dana Farber Clinic, a health-care provider. The home health-care industry has a huge transit need for employees who often log many miles and irregular hours while earning relatively low wages. Though never focused on filling a "quota" of loans, More Than Wheels has seen its numbers rise now that church-goers and workers can tell one another that the program is not a scam. 
With its emphasis on financial education and credit repair, More Than Wheels will likely need to grow organically to maintain its integrity. But many other institutions could, and should, get involved in providing low-interest auto loans. The National Credit Union Foundation lists a variety of credit union programs that reach out to borrowers with poor credit on car loans. Analyst Bill Myers found that lending autos to people with poor credit can be profitable for credit unions, but they need to help clients select good cars, work more closely with them to ensure repayment and provide things like mechanical breakdown insurance - in some ways services similar to those provided by More Than Wheels, but in a more standardized format.
One way to jump-start this kind of lending would be for the federal government to back up targeted auto loans against default through a program similar to the loan guarantee program offered by the Small Business Administration. I wrote about this idea a few years ago in Issues in Science and Technology. 
One reader, Bruce Daggy, wrote me wondering how people like himself, who are looking to invest their savings at better than bank rates, could "invest" in a fund for low interest auto loans for people like Tammy Trahan (see last week's column). I think this is a great idea, and have often wondered why we couldn't have "green" bonds, much as my grandparents bought war bonds. 
Here's a bit more of Bruce's thinking: "There is general agreement that one necessary step for fixing the economy is massive deleveraging; and a better solution to personal or business transportation can help accomplish that. One barrier is the upfront capital required." Similar issues exist with capital for fuel-efficient cars, solar panels, energy efficient heating and lighting, he notes. "There are people of good will who have money, and right now if they want to invest it in something safe, like a 10 year Treasury, that money is earning about 2%. Why not offer them a bit more to do something socially useful?" He wonders whether a Web-based lending pool might work. What do you think?
Here is where I offer a philosophical caveat: I love the idea of reinventing auto finance for people who need it, and think it's crucial for us to redirect resources towards more efficient vehicles, but I wonder if it's wise to reinvent the wheel when what we're really trying to do is circumvent a predatory lending business. Maybe it would be simpler, and more relevant, to change the way the auto lending industry is regulated. Here is a range of sensible suggestions for reform from the National Consumer Law Center. 
A second philosophical caveat is that in order for an auto lending program to be really "green," it also needs to truly help reduce oil consumption, pollution and greenhouse gases. That may require more than helping families into more fuel-efficient cars. We all could use a refresher course in how to reduce our fuel use - everything from eco-driving and proper tire inflation, to using the money saved on gas to move closer to work - a strategy Tammy Trahan said she's adopting on her own. But a green lending program would need a very clear set of measurable goals aimed at reducing fuel consumption and costs for drivers.
Finally, it's possible that smart green auto-lending programs aimed at the middle class could have bigger green benefits - they could create a large and lasting market for highly fuel-efficient cars from Detroit, spur innovations that please customers and reduce oil dependence while creating jobs. Right now, auto fuel efficiency in the United States is partly driven by contentious struggles between federal regulators and the auto industry. Thoughtful loan programs could change that equation while helping to insulate the U.S. economy against high oil prices. And, unlike Cash for Clunkers, a loan program wouldn't be a permanent drain on the Treasury.

HEADLINE: Thinking Cap: Angst Before High School

BYLINE: PATRICIA COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Harvard researchers find that elite high schools may not serve their students' long-term goals.

 BODY:

'EXAM HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM NEW YORK CITY' a working paper by Roland G. Fryer Jr., professor of economics and faculty director of the Education Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University, and Will Dobbie, a predoctoral research fellow at the laboratory.
THE QUESTION Each year millions of middle-school students nationwide spend angst-filled months waiting to hear if they scored high enough on an entrance exam to attend a selective public high school. In New York City alone more than 27,000 students apply for precious spots in the three best-known schools: Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Technical and Bronx High School of Science. What Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Fryer wanted to know was just how much of a difference attending one of these high schools makes in the long run for students with similar equal admissions test scores. Some proponents say the benefits of an environment of high achievers, more advanced coursework and higher expectations are obvious. Skeptics counter that these gifted and motivated teenagers would have done well no matter where they went. Students in these schools with low class ranks may even be less competitive when it comes to college admissions. They might be better off in less competitive environments or in schools with a wider range of student abilities. Because there are so many applicants of similar ability and achievement who are not accepted to these New York institutions, the authors were able to compare the average outcomes of students who graduated from different high schools. "We provide the first causal estimate of the impact of attending an exam-high school in the United States on later outcomes," they write.
THE FINDINGS Mr. Fryer and Mr. Dobbie were surprised by their results: "The impact of attending an exam school on college enrollment or graduation is, if anything, negative. There is also little impact of attending an exam school on SAT reading and writing scores, and, at best, a modest positive impact on SAT math scores." The results were the same for both boys and girls, and for those who came from different types of middle schools. "Our analysis of exam schools suggests that students are encouraged or pushed to take harder course work, but that their actual human capital essentially remains unchanged."
The one exception, Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Fryer wrote, was borderline students: "Attending an exam school increases rigor of the marginal student's high school course work, and makes the marginal student more likely to graduate from high school with an advanced diploma." The authors pointed out that the only measures they looked at were SAT scores, college enrollment and graduation. "Without longer-term measures such as income, health, or life satisfaction," they note, "it is difficult to fully interpret our results."
WHAT DO YOU THINK? Does attending a selective high school make a significant difference? Are parents and children needlessly stressed? Post a comment below or e-mail me at pcohen@nytimes.com; follow me on Twitter at PatcohenNYT.

HEADLINE: Michael Lewis's Piece is a Luftnummer, and That's not a Compliment

BYLINE: STEPHAN SEILER


HIGHLIGHT: A German's response to Michael Lewis' Vanity Fair piece, "It's the Economy, Dummkopf."

 BODY:
Editor's note: 
Michael Lewis's piece in the September , "It's the Economy, Dummkopf," is what we Germans call a - "a lot of hot air." Why, exactly, does Germany own Europe? Well, partly, Lewis argues, it's because Germans like excrement. "Germans longed to be near [it], but not in it an excellent description of their role in the current financial crisis." According to Lewis, Germans have been obsessed with excrement for a long time: Mozart used fecal imagery in his letters; Hitler liked his girlfriends to defecate on him. To substantiate his bizarre analysis, Lewis relies upon a controversial book by the folklorist Alan Dundes, who argued that the German national character was essentially anal-erotic. That, and Lewis's chauffeur's recollection of common idiomatic uses of the vulgar word for excrement. Perhaps not the most reliable sources. (And not to nit-pick, but Mozart and Hitler were born in Austria and lived much of their lives outside Germany.)
Lewis indulges in other, similarly suspect stereotypes: that Germans are punctual and rule-following; that German patriotism is taboo; that Germans are still plagued by antisemitism. "The only financial disaster in the last decade German bankers appear to have missed," he writes, "was investing with Bernie Madoff (perhaps the only advantage to the German financial systems of having no Jews)." In fact, he repeatedly strains to link the Holocaust to the financial crisis, writing that "the streets of Berlin can feel like an elaborate shrine to German guilt. It's as if the Germans have been required to accept that they will always play the villain."
But the Germany Lewis describes is not one that I recognize. In the last couple of years, the country has changed enormously. We are liberal, open-minded, and multicultural. Our head of state is a woman; our minister of state is gay. Berlin and Leipzig have become centers for the arts, attracting many Americans - and not just because it's so affordable to live there. How could he have missed all this during his reporting trip? His story does go a long way in explaining the failure of two years ago (which cost Conde Nast 50 million euros, or around $70 million at the current exchange rate): they simply do not understand us.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and Around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The arrival of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has livened up the Republican presidential race -- and reshaped it, particularly for Mitt Romney and Representative Michele Bachmann, Jeff Zeleny reports. Mr. Perry breezed through the state with such confidence on Monday that he even blew kisses into a camera when asked about Mr. Romney. "Give him my love," Mr. Perry said.

        
Has Texas caught a few lucky breaks on its economy, or has the state benefited from exceptional leadership? The answer to that question is central to Mr. Perry's candidacy. Clifford Krauss assesses the evidence.

        
President Obama kicked off a three-day bus tour of the Midwest, urging audiences in Minnesota and Iowa to tell their elected officials they will no longer tolerate the partisan gridlock on display in the recent debt-ceiling talks. The campaign-style, three-state swing is an effort to appeal to moderate and independent voters after a dismal summer in which he was stymied on the debt talks, then rebuked with a downgrade of America's credit rating, Mark Landler reports.

        
More than 80 members of the House are visiting Israelthis month as guests of the American Israel Education Foundation. The number reflects both the size of the freshmen Congressional class, and the enduring efforts of Israel to court its most friendly ally, the American Congress, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Federal investigators released a new report on Monday, saying Medicaid gets much deeper discounts on many prescription drugs than Medicare. The study could be used by lawmakers trying to cut drug prices as Congress looks for ways to rein in the cost of Medicare under new deficit-reduction law, Robert Pear reports.
 
Around the Web

        
Mr. Perry says global warming was not a big part of Al Gore's presidential platform in 1988 when Mr. Perry was his Texas state chairman. An article by Politicosuggests otherwise. 

Happenings in Washington

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will depart Washington for an official trip to China, Mongolia and Japan.

        
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will participate in a conversation with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and CNN's Wolf Blitzer at the National Defense University.

HEADLINE: A Familiar Scent, Slightly Oniony, Will Soon Waft Away

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER


HIGHLIGHT: After 91 years of making bialys -- something like the hybrid of an onion bagel and an English muffin -- Coney Island Bialys and Bagels is closing.

 BODY:
Steve Ross says he was happy to take his bialys out of New York. But no one was taking the New York out of his bialys.
In 2001, Mr. Ross, the owner of Coney Island Bialys and Bagels, received an invitation to demonstrate authentic city baking at the Smithsonian Folklife Festivalin Washington. Organizers supplied the mixer and an oven. Mr. Ross insisted on only one ingredient: New York City water.
 "You can't make bialys without New York City water," said Mr. Ross, 51, who loaded six six-gallon jugs into his truck before the trip. "It's just the taste."
Next month, that taste will disappear from the streets of Brooklyn, 91 years after it arrived. A sagging economy and a changing neighborhood, Mr. Ross said, have left him no choice but to close his store, the borough's oldest bialy shop.
"All my family clientele are cutting back," he said. "Now, people make coffee at home and have a Pop-Tart."
The bialy, described in a cartoon on the store's register as the offspring of an onion bagel and an English muffin, arrived on American shores by way of Bialystok, Poland. So did Morris Rosenzweig, Mr. Ross's grandfather, who founded the business in 1920 as a wholesale operation in East New York, Brooklyn.
The company has remained in the family ever since, migrating to Coney Island Avenue in Sheepshead Bay in 1954. At age 8 and with his father, Don, now in charge, Mr. Ross was tasked with sweeping the bakery floor. By age 11, he had graduated to cash register duty, standing on a milk case to reach the buttons.
Bill Puetz, 59, who has known Mr. Ross since the two were boys, said the store was a remnant of an earlier time. Mr. Puetz is a partner at McGready's Auto Service, one of a handful of family businesses to share the block with the bialy shop for the past half-century. S & L Lumber Company, established in 1953, owes its second letter to Leo Wisel, whose sons are now co-owners. David's Glass Works, stationed on Coney Island Avenue since 1947, was founded by David Schoenfeld, father of current owner, Simon.
All recalled the scent of bialys wafting from their neighbor's oven - and the crowds these fragrances attracted from as far as Staten Island and New Jersey.
"There were lines, double-parked cars -- it was always busy," Mr. Schoenfeld said. "It's like a family on the block, and these businesses keep dropping one by one."
After The New York Post reported on the shop's plans to closelast week, customers from across the city made pilgrimages to the site.
"This is a true, essential New York experience," said Bob Holman, proprietor of the Bowery Poetry Club, who visited the store for the first time on Friday. Consuming a bialy with whitefish, Mr. Holman noted the chewy, but dense, texture. The garlic and onion, he said, announced their presence just enough, without being overwhelming.
"I know from bagels, and I know from whitefish," he said, mulling a second order. "This is the most delicious bialy I've ever seen."
Newcomers to the neighborhood, Mr. Ross said, did not seem to agree. If they entered his store at all. According to the owner, many of the Russian immigrants who have moved into the area have not embraced his products.
"They're not buying what a traditional Jewish family was buying," he said.
Some local residents said the store likely suffered a business hit when a handful of Jewish families became upset that Mr. Ross chose to remain open on Passover in recent years. Mr. Ross said these families rarely shopped at Coney Island Bialys and Bagels anyway.
The store's perceived flirtations with non-kosher products - it created a stir many years ago for carrying a bagel sandwich with egg and a kosher bacon imitation - had already estranged the most observant Jews, he said.
Mr. Ross, a volunteer firefighter who lives in Manalapan, N.J., said he was not sure what he would do next. He says he hopes to keep the store open through the Jewish holidays this fall, but is unsure if he will be able to do so while still paying his vendors.
The owners of the block's neighboring businesses said they would miss the familiar sight of the bialy shop more than its contents. Mr. Wisel, an owner of the lumber business across the street, used to get his coffee from Mr. Ross's store every morning, but stopped recently.
"A co-worker brings coffee from Dunkin' Donuts now," he said, shrugging. "It's better."

HEADLINE: The Tech Audit: Trying to Get I.T. Systems to Work Together

BYLINE: DAVID H. FREEDMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's no longer enough to be good at your craft, says one business owner. You also have to understand what's happening with technology.

 BODY:
Another in an occasional series on how business owners are succeeding and struggling with technology.
The business: Artisan Electric, in Lafayette, Ind., is a five-person electrical contracting firm specializing in updating the wiring in historic homes and buildings. Artisan also installs high-end home entertainment systems, as well as wind- and solar-power units and back-up generators. It sells some of these products online, too.
The owner: Chris Voglund was working for a large contracting company eight years ago when it suddenly folded, leaving him out of a job. Determined to never again count on someone else's business for his living, he founded his own. Having seen that competition for routine electrical contracting jobs was steep, he decided to focus on jobs that require special skills and care. "A run-of-the-mill contractor won't touch a complete wiring update of a 150-year-old home, where the customer wants preservation," he said. "They just want to go in, cut open walls and get out fast." Mr. Voglund is willing to put in the extra time, and customers have proved willing to pay for it.
Sources of I.T. expertise: Mr. Voglund has brought in local Web-design and programming pros on a contract basis. But he also discovered that some of the best advice could be had for free from local business owners who have become information-technology savvy getting their own companies up to speed and are happy to help out a friend and fellow merchant. The owner of a local security firm has helped guide Mr. Voglund's e-commerce efforts, for example, and a photography-store owner has advised him on social media. Now Mr. Voglund says he's becoming fairly savvy himself -- because he's had to. "When I started I hired a lawyer and an accountant and figured I'd just pay attention to my craft," he said. "Now it's not good enough to be good at your craft. You have to understand what's happening with technology." 
What's working: One investment Mr. Voglund beams about is the $300 he put into a fireproof backup hard drive from ioSafe. "I have 650 active clients in my database," he said. "It's half the value of my company now, and losing any of it would be catastrophic. I back up online, too, but I like knowing my data is safe inside a metal loaf of bread bolted to a desk in my office." He's got everyone at Artisan using iPhones that are set up to notify them immediately of any new customer contacts on the Web site, so someone can respond right away -- even when the office is empty. He also sings the praises of Magento, a freely available software package designed to make it relatively easy to set up and maintain an e-commerce site.
What the company has figured out: When his sales plunged with the 2008 economic crash, Mr. Voglund decided to listen more closely to his business-owner friends about the importance of social-media marketing. "We really threw ourselves into it," he said. He and his employees spent countless hours building contacts on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. They also made sure his profile appeared on Yelp and other sites that list local services. Artisan set up a blog and a YouTube channel with how-to videos. (The clips are often shot on an iPhone.) The company also started selling generators and other equipment online. "If you had told me three years ago I'd be running a Web store, I'd have laughed," he said. "But the opportunity to bring in revenue without having to be physically present has turned out to be huge for us." He largely credits these online efforts with the 20-percent annual gross-profit growth he's seen the past two years.
What's still causing pain: Mr. Voglund would like to have his invoicing, payment-processing, parts-ordering and accounting systems all working together seamlessly -- so that when he's at a customer site he can order a part on his iPhone and have that automatically reflected in his books and invoicing. But in spite of having hired a programmer to try to hook up his Intuit QuickBooks online accounting system to his PayPal-based payment system, he still feels far from his goal. He's hoping that a new online system put up by one big supplier will provide a lot of that linkage for him. "I don't want to spend a lot on custom programming," he said. "That's really cash out of my pocket."
Well, maybe one of his local business-owner friends will figure it out for him. Or maybe you have a suggestion?

HEADLINE: Groups Ask Cuomo to Extend Fracking Review

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Environmental organizations and some state lawmakers are seeking a six-month public comment period on proposed drilling rules.

 BODY:
Environmental groups and some legislators are asking Gov. Andrew Cuomo for a longer public review of a New York State plan to permit a controversial method of natural gas extraction that combines hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling.
More than 70 groups sent a letter on Monday to both Governor Cuomo and Joe Martens, the commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, requesting a round of public hearings and an extension of a public comment period on the plan to six months from two months.
The groups said that two months was "wholly inadequate" for reviewing the revised draft of regulations prepared by the state. Their letter said that communities also needed a forum in which they could voice their concerns about increased industrial activity in their areas.

The regulations, which are in their second draft, would govern drilling in the rich natural gas field known as the Marcellus Shale and in other areas of the state. 
The request for an extension drew support from the chairmen of the environmental conservation committees in the state Senate and Assembly -- Senator Mark Grisanti, a Republican from Buffalo, and Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney a Democrat from Lindenhurst -- and from Assemblyman John J. McEneny, an Albany Democrat. 
State officials have yet to release the full draft document, although they have made much of it public. 
Natural gas industry representatives oppose the idea of more delays in granting drilling permits. 
"The natural gas industry has waited more than three years to move forward with development of the Marcellus Shale," the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York said in a statement. "Clearly, this is a tactic to delay the issuance of drilling permits in New York's southern tier and is not intended to facilitate a meaningful discussion."
The association noted that a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that a plurality of New York voters favor increased natural gas development. 
It was close: the survey found that voters liked the potential economic benefits of drilling in the Marcellus Shale more than they feared possible environmental concerns by a 47-to-42 percent margin. Support was stronger upstate, where drilling is expected to create jobs, than it was in New York City: upstate voters favored it by a 51-39 margin, whereas New York City voters opposed it by a 50-38 margin.

HEADLINE: Tighter Qualifications for School Bus Drivers

BYLINE: FERNANDA SANTOS


HIGHLIGHT: A new law expands the number of crimes that prevent people from qualifying to drive school buses.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed legislation on Tuesday expanding the kinds of criminal convictionsthat bar people from driving school buses.
The list includes several sex crimes, like predatory sexual assault, disseminating indecent materials to minors, sex trafficking and persistent sexual abuse. In all, convictions for 26 felonies will become automatic disqualifying factors, raising the number of crimes for which a conviction would warrant a permanent ban from school-bus driving to 58.
The law also makes the ban permanent rather than temporary for those convicted of vehicular manslaughter, aggravated vehicular homicide or promoting prostitution.
Its path from bill to law was relatively short. In January, David Moraca, a member of the New York Association for Pupil Transportation and the transportation director at the Onteora Central School District, which serves parts of the Catskills region, wrote a letter to a local newspaper, The Daily Freeman of Kingston, asking for the changes. State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who represents the area, read the letter, and one month later introduced the bill in the Senate. 
Unlike other laws intended to protect children from predators, this one was not inspired by any specific event. Instead, it was prompted by Mr. Moraca's complaint that the laws governing criminal background checks for prospective bus drivers had not been updated since 1986, before the enactment or tightening of certain laws that specifically address sex crimes against children.
 "This must be done, for the safety of our children," Mr. Moraca wrote to the newspaper.
The new law takes effect in 180 days. In a statement, Mr. Cuomo said that "by signing this legislation, we are putting in place additional precautions that will help protect our students."

HEADLINE: Tax Policy Change Would Bring Cash Piles Abroad Back Home

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase estimated that 519 American multinational corporations had $1.37 trillion outside the United States. The Deal Professor offers a way to repatriate some of that money.

 BODY:
Apple has a cash problem. It's not just that Apple has too much cash, $76 billion as of June 30. It's rather that the bulk of that pile, estimated at $41 billion, is held abroad.
Apple does not want to bring it back to the United States for several reasons, primarily because of the tax consequences, but also because of its own growing foreign presence. Apple is not alone - this problem is an increasing one in corporate America. And the answer may not be more big, all-cash acquisitions, like Google's $12.5 billion offer for Motorola Mobility.
In an analyst report in May, JPMorgan Chase estimated that 519 American multinational corporations had $1.375 trillion outside the United States. The problem is particularly acute among technology companies, which historically tend to hoard cash because of the cyclical nature of their business.
A recent Moody's report noted that Microsoft held $42 billion abroad, or more than 80 percent of its cash. Cisco Systems has $38.8 billion, or almost 90 percent of its cash. Google - at least before Monday's deal - had nearly $40 billion in cash, with more than 43 percent of it held abroad
Tax policy is driving much of this trend. For multinational corporations, cash earned abroad cannot easily be remitted to the United States. If it is paid back to the United States, it is subject to a dividend tax that can rise to as much as 35 percent. Companies are loath to pay this tax because while they can offset it with taxes paid abroad, the companies still end up paying a relatively high tax rate.
Yet it is not just a tax issue. Many United States companies want to keep cash abroad to focus on high-growth regions for investments and acquisitions.
A recent Standard & Poor's study found that 50 percent of sales by companies in the S.&P. 500-stock index are outside the United States. Interestingly, the report also found that these companies paid more in foreign taxes than to the United States government. For Apple, 60 percent of its sales are abroad, and like these other companies, its foreign sales are expected to only go higher.
So, for those who expect that a change in tax policy would prompt Apple and other companies to put their cash piles to use in the United States, don't be so sure. Even if there were no dividend tax, a large portion of this cash would stay abroad as these companies focus on higher growth overseas for investment.
Still, the current tax policy clearly distorts the practices of United States companies. One of the reasons Microsoft acquired Skype was because it was located in Luxembourg. Microsoft could use its foreign cash to make this acquisition without having to first repatriate it to the United States.
More broadly, many American companies return the cash every quarter to the United States, but then send it back abroad by quarter-end to avoid it being counted as a deemed dividend. The current tax laws thus encourage these companies to engage in cash manipulation and keep too much cash abroad.
In 2004, Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act, a tax holiday for companies to repatriate cash. The dividend tax was reduced to 5.25 percent from 35 percent. In exchange for this reduction, Congress required that any cash repatriated be invested in the United States. The cash could not be used for dividends or stock repurchases.
Alas, cash is fungible. A study of this tax holiday, entitled "Watch What I Do, Not What I Say: The Unintended Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act," found that in the year following the act, repatriations increased by $230 billion from the previous year, to $299 billion.
Five companies alone - Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson and I.B.M. - repatriated $88 billion, But the repatriation did not result in increased investment. Instead, companies largely repatriated the money and used their current United States holdings to pay out dividends or engage in share repurchases. This was contrary to what Congress had intended.
While the cash was not used for investment, this does not mean it did not have an overall positive effect on the American economy: shareholders went on to spend this cash. The study's authors acknowledged this, stating that "presumably these shareholders either reinvested these funds or used them for consumption, thereby having indirect effects on firm investment, employment or spending."
The tax holiday may therefore have stimulated the economy, although a Congressional Research Service report found that the companies that repatriated the most money actually cut jobs from 2004-6.
Still, the act also had a pernicious effect. American companies now accumulate cash and wait to repatriate these holdings, knowing that Congress will probably declare another tax holiday eventually.
Why engage in this game every few years? Congress could permanently modify United States tax policy to set the rate at a lower amount. This would be recognition that Apple and its like are multinational companies and that this problem is not going away. The world is global, and fencing off cash like this for our best companies is unrealistic.
More important, although these companies will still leave some cash abroad, more of it will come back to the United States. If it were invested, that would be terrific but not necessary as it would also end the distortions that drive even more investment abroad.
Google provided a recent example only this week with its Motorola Mobility acquisition. Google has more of its cash in the United States than other comparable technology companies since it is not a retailer like Apple.
Google is also more willing to take on debt in the United States to finance acquisitions, having completed in May a $3 billion debt raise. This was done to provide it more United States cash. Google provides anecdotal evidence that ending this distortion will end the foreign cash bias.
A permanent tax reduction would not only cut taxes but actually raise revenue, allowing for Republicans to vote for it. And it should be a holiday without restrictions - trying to force companies to invest the money rather than pay dividends is a useless exercise that will create only more bureaucracy.
Even if the money were largely spent on buybacks and dividends and a large portion were kept abroad, it would still be reasonable to expect $300 billion to $600 billion to be repatriated. This money would flow into the economy, making the dividend tax cut a stimulus package that Democrats could support.
A 2008 simulated analysis by Decision Economics found that such a reduction would raise about $50 billion a year for the federal government from the tax received and the increased growth, over a five-year period. Economic growth would be increased by up to $62 billion a year.
The Obama administration has previously been negative on such a tax reduction, but it might want to reconsider. This is the rare tax policy move that both Democrats and Republicans should be able to easily support. It is one that would allow Apple and other big American multinationals to spend money more freely, something needed in a troubled economy. It may even push Apple to finally put to use some of its gigantic cash pile.

HEADLINE: BlackBerry Maker RIM Again Subject of Takeover Talk

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: As Google moves to buy Motorola Mobility, RIM, already under pressure from declining market share, is still an attractive prospect for takeover.

 BODY:
OTTAWA - Ever since the introduction of its first BlackBerry more than a decade ago, Research in Motion has defied expectations that it would be gobbled up by a larger rival and has effectively created the market for smartphones.
But as Google moves to buy Motorola Mobility, RIM, already under pressure from diminished prospects and declining market share, is once again the subject of takeover talk.
Since the Motorola acquisition was announced on Monday, shares of RIM, which have suffered for much of the year, have shot up more than 10 percent, mainly on speculation of a sale.
"For a long while the market cap of RIM prevented any kind of takeover," said Adam Leach, a London-based analyst with Ovum. "I'm certainly not writing them off now, but they have got a tough job."
Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman for RIM, said the company does not "comment on rumors and speculation."
The Motorola deal, which has the potential to shake up the mobile industry, comes at a difficult time for RIM.
After pioneering wireless e-mail, RIM has slowly ceded control to Apple's iPhone and to handsets that run on Google's Android operating system. The current lineup of BlackBerrys relies on technology that dates back to the first models of the smartphone.
RIM has moved to spruce up its technology. In 2010, the company bought QNX Software Systems of Ottawa and the Astonishing Tribe, a Swedish user interface design house, to recreate the BlackBerry platform.
But the results have been disappointing so far. The BlackBerry Playbook received a weak reception this spring when it lacked important features like an integrated e-mail application. Last week, Sprint dropped plans to offer a forthcoming model of the tablet computer that would have connected to the carrier's network.
RIM does not seem in a rush to introduce new Blackberry phones based on the QNX software, either. The models will not be available until later next year, and the company is offering no further specifics.
Still, RIM has plenty to offer suitors. Despite reducing financial forecasts, the company remains firmly profitable. In the latest quarter, the handset manufacturer reported net income of $695 million, down from $769 million in the quarter a year ago.
BlackBerry, too, remains a valuable brand, even as its market share declines.
It is the device of choice for corporate customers in important industries like financial services and law enforcement, which depend on the unique features of the BlackBerry to safeguard their e-mail. The security stems from RIM's proprietary global network, a system that is hard to duplicate and also generates recurring revenue for the company.
While analysts have speculated in the past that Microsoft could be interested in BlackBerry, that seems less likely in light of the Motorola acquisition, said Al Hilwa, an analyst with IDC in Seattle. If some handset makers that use Google's Android system switch to Windows Mobile Phone 7, Microsoft's mobile technology, then a perpetual also-ran could become a serious competitor. In that case, a deal for BlackBerry would be less necessary.
"Microsoft is the party that stands the best to gain out of this," said Mr. Leach.
A more likely buyer, said Mr. Hilwa, would be a large software company that, like Google, sees wireless as an important component in its future growth.
Alternatively, a cash-rich Chinese handset maker like ZTE or Huawei could view RIM as a way to expand beyond generic, low-profit phones.
Another possibility, if more remote, is the prospect of a better-known Asian manufacturer such as Samsung or HTC buying RIM to distinguish its products from the Android and Windows Phone competition.
A deal for RIM, though, faces significant hurdles.
For one, RIM's co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, are the company's largest shareholders. Neither seems interested in losing control. And they will not readily back down from a fight, as the executives demonstrated during a protracted patent battle several years ago that the company eventually lost.
The Canadian government, which must approve any takeover, has also been reluctant to sign off on deals for companies it views as strategic assets. Last year, the country's regulators blocked the purchase of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan by BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company. Politicians and commentators have portrayed an acquisition of RIM as an economic doomsday outcome for Canada.
But while a takeover seemed unthinkable during previous debates, the prospects for a RIM deal may be less distant in the current environment.

HEADLINE: Breaking the Tax-Talk Taboo?

BYLINE: VERA TITUNIK


HIGHLIGHT: Will Warren Buffett's Op-Ed yesterday begging Congress to raise his taxes start a movement? It's kind of fun to imagine the 8,274 Americans who earn more than $10 million a year marching on Washington carrying signs: "Slash the Deficit! Raise My Marginal Tax Rates!"

 BODY:
Will Warren Buffett's Op-Ed yesterday begging Congress to raise his taxes start a movement? It's kind of fun to imagine the 8,274 Americans who earn more than $10 million a year marching on Washington carrying signs: "Slash the Deficit! Raise My Marginal Tax Rates!"
Buffett's Op-Ed was at least partly directed at the Congressional supercommittee that is supposed to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion. For anyone interested in other ideas to chip away the deficit, I recommend Roger Lowenstein's article"Who Needs the Mortgage-Interest Deduction?" Back when we published the story, in 2006, no one was talking about the deficit - we were too busy buying houses with interest-only loans. But Lowenstein's argument feels more relevant than ever.
Before reading Lowenstein's article, I (like many people) viewed the mortgage-interest deduction as unassailable, apple-pie policy to encourage homeownership; that it dovetailed nicely with my own interests at tax time was a pleasant coincidence. But he slew a number of my assumptions providing evidence that 1) the deduction does not encourage homeownership, 2) it is incredibly costly - an estimated$131 billion in 2012 and 3) the people it benefits most are wealthy and capable of buying a home without it. (Under current law, you can deduct mortgage loans up to $1 million.) As he wrote: "The deduction might help some people (like me) to purchase bigger homes than they otherwise would. And it certainly helps people who are selling mansions to get a higher price. But it is hardly the democratic subsidy people think. In fact, it's patently regressive."
So one way to look at the mortgage-interest deduction is this: It is a housing subsidy for people who make enough money to itemize their taxes.
Some other recent calls for "revenue enhancement" are discussed here and then there are those from Alan K. Simpson (former Republican senator who was co-chairman of Obama's deficit reduction committee), who ends a Business Week article with this:
Many conservatives quote Ronald Reagan, saying how he's their hero. I knew Reagan well. Loved the man and spent a lot of time with him. And you know what? He raised taxes 11 times in his eight years. He did it to make the country run. These bomb throwers take great pride in saying they will never, ever compromise. Reagan was a master of compromise. Read your history, guys and gals. You're on the wrong side of it.

HEADLINE: It's the Aggregate Demand, Stupid

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The best tool available to create jobs and stimulate growth would be an increase in the money supply by the Federal Reserve, an economist writes.

 BODY:
With the debt limit debate temporarily set aside, the Obama administration is talking about finding some way to create jobs and stimulate growth. But the truth is that there really isn't much it can do and it knows it. There may be some small-bore things it can do without Congressional action that may help a little, but the operative word is "little." The only policy that will really help is an increase in aggregate demand. 
Aggregate demand simply means spending - spending by households, businesses and governments for consumption goods and services or investments in structures, machinery and equipment. At the moment, businesses don't need to invest because their biggest problem is a lack of consumer demand, as a July 21 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York documented.
The federal government could increase aggregate spending by directly employing workers or undertaking public works projects. But there is no possibility of that given the political gridlock in Congress and President's Obama's desire to appear moderate and fiscally responsible going into next year's election.
That really leaves just consumers as a potential avenue for increasing spending. But that will be difficult as long as unemployment remains high, thus reducing aggregate income, and households are still saving heavily to rebuild wealth, which was decimated by the collapse in housing prices. Saving is, in a sense, negative spending.

Changes in wealth affect spending because people will spend a percentage of their increased wealth. And they are more likely to raise their spending when the wealth increase is perceived to be permanent rather than transitory.
Historically, people have viewed increases in home equity as more permanent than increases in stock market wealth because they know the latter is more volatile. A recent Federal Reserve Board working paper estimated that the long-run increase in spending from an increase in housing wealth may be as high as 9.1 percent per year.
As home prices increased, many people came to believe they had no real reason to save since they could always tap their home equity - which banks were more than happy to help them do - in the event that they needed funds. Thus the personal saving rate fell from 3.5 percent in the early 2000s to just 1.4 percent in 2005 at the peak of the housing bubble.
Home prices roughly doubled between 2000 and 2006, according to the Case-Shiller index, and many homeowners talked themselves into believing they would continue rising indefinitely. Thus they increased their spending and reduced their saving based not only on actual price increases, but also on expectations of future increases.
A prescient 2007 Congressional Budget Office study explained how this would affect spending and growth in the economy. It said that if people were expecting a 10 percent rise in home prices and instead they fell 10 percent, the impact on spending would be equivalent to a 20 percent fall in prices. The budget office estimated that this might reduce growth of gross domestic product by 2.2 percent per year. Since actual home prices have fallen by about a third, this suggests that G.D.P. may be $500 billion less this year than it would be if home prices had simply remained flat since 2006.
One way that the rise and fall of spending can be visualized is by looking at the velocity of money. This is the speed at which money turns over in the economy. When velocity rises, more G.D.P. is produced per dollar of the money supply. When velocity falls, the economic impact is exactly the same as if the money supply shrank by the same percentage.
The chart below comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and shows velocity as the ratio of the money supply (M2) to nominal G.D.P. It rose from 1.85 in 2003 to 1.96 in 2006. It has since fallen to a current level of 1.66. Thus one can say that each $1 increase in the money supply produced almost $2 of G.D.P. in 2006 and only $1.66 today.
This suggests that the Federal Reserve could have offset the decline in spending and velocity resulting from the fall in home prices with a sufficient increase in the money supply. And it tried. Since 2006, money supply has increased by about $2 trillion. But velocity fell faster than the money supply increased as households reduced spending and increased saving - the saving rate is now over 5 percent - and banks and businesses hoarded cash.
Nonfinancial businesses are now sitting on close to $2 trillion in liquid assets that could be invested immediately if there was an increase in sales, and banks have $1.5 trillion of excess reserves that could be lent as well.
Fiscal policy could raise velocity and growth by getting money moving throughout the economy. But since that is not feasible, the Fed is the only game in town. Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist, says that it should immediately increase the money supply by $2 trillion and promise to keep increasing it until the economy has turned around.
But the Fed is already under pressure to tighten monetary policy from its regional bank presidents, three of whom dissented from last week's Fed decision to keep policy steady. They fear that inflation is right around the corner. But as the Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff has argued, a short burst of inflation would do more to fix the economy's problems than any other thing. One reason is that inflation raises spending by encouraging consumers and businesses to buy things they need immediately because prices will be higher in the future.
The right policy can be debated, but the important thing is for policy makers to stop obsessing about debt and focus instead on raising aggregate demand. As Bill Gross of the investment firm Pimco put it recently: "While our debt crisis is real and promises to grow to Frankenstein proportions in future years, debt is not the disease - it is a symptom. Lack of aggregate demand or, to put it simply, insufficient consumption and investment is the disease."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Front-Runners Offer Contrast in Styles

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: There are stark differences in the styles of the three leading Republican candidates for president.

 BODY:
As the Republican campaign for the presidency begins to come into focus, a lot of attention is going to be paid to what the candidates say.
But it is also becoming clear that there will be stark differences in how they say it.
The three candidates now considered to be leading the Republican race - Mitt Romney, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann - offer a contrast in styles, and their efforts to reach voters with their stump speeches will help to determine whether one of them gets the chance to face President Obama next year.
As the campaigns head toward the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, it will become more and more important to connect with voters in the states, often in small groups and intimate settings. Already, these candidates have proved that their approaches will vary.
More Relaxed
The most striking thing about Mr. Romney's 2011 style is the effort he makes to be more relaxed. It has been noted before, but his lack of a tie and jacket on the stump make him seem far more approachable than the 2007 version of him.
Mr. Romney also seems to be more willing to mix it up with his audience, a decision that makes him seem less aloof but also makes his appearances a bit more risky.
At the Iowa State Fair, he put one foot up on a hay bale and leaned forward into the crowd as a heckler accused him of trying to do away with Social Security. Mr. Romney engaged the heckler directly - creating a potential problem down the road by insisting that corporations "are people, too."
But after the confrontation, Mr. Romney was quite effective at turning the confrontation into a rallying moment for the conservative voters in the small audience.
Longtime friends of Mr. Romney's are well aware of the critique that has long followed him: that he is wooden and awkward with voters. But they insist that he is not that way in private, and they are hoping that his changes in style can show through this time around.
It is not clear that they will. His speaking style still has none of the Southern charm of Mr. Perry's, nor any of the authentic randomness of Mrs. Bachmann's. He remains in some ways the wonkish businessman that is at the heart of his campaign rationale.
In that way, perhaps, his style may fit the campaign that he is running. Mr. Romney is trying to convince voters that he has the private-sector experience and know-how that Mr. Obama lacks when it comes to finding a way to turn around the nation's economy.
But in Iowa and New Hampshire, voters expect to interact with candidates repeatedly before they vote. And some of Mr. Romney's critics say that the more people see Mr. Romney, the less they seem to like him.
Howdy, Y'all!
Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, has only given a handful of stump speeches as a presidential candidate. But he already has a highly polished style that is straight out of the Lone Star State playbook.
He enters a room with "aw shucks," "howdy, y'all" and "this is just awesome!" folksy charm. He's got big, beefy hands that are always reaching out to shake another with a firm grasp.
Once inside, he is all about working the room. At the Electric Park Ballroom in Waterloo on Sunday, where and Mrs. Bachmann spoke, he arrived well before his appointed speaking time, chatted with reporters on his way in, and then went from table to table, introducing himself to as many people as possible. 
On the stump, he starts slow and quiet, spending the first few minutes on his personal biography and a few anecdotes. But he becomes more aggressive as he moves into the substance of his argument, not only going after the president in strong terms but also challenging his Republican opponents more pointedly than some of his rivals. After just a couple of days on the trail, he was already attacking Mr. Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts.
In his first Iowa appearance, he started with a "yeah, howdy!" and then told a story about how he married his wife 24 years after first meeting her at piano lessons when he was 8. "It kinda goes to tell you that sometimes it kinda takes me a while to get into something. Like this presidential race," he said, his voice rising. "But let me tell you, when I'm in, I'm in all the way!"
Mr. Perry also has a big-budget bus - with "PERRY" painted huge on both sides. And he arrived at the Waterloo event in a three-S.U.V. motorcade - a bit reminiscent of the disdained tendency of George W. Bush to campaign through Iowa and New Hampshire at arms-length.
Intensity and Flair 
Mrs. Bachmann bursts into rooms with intensity and flair. At the Electric Park Ballroom on Sunday, she delayed her entrance until she was announced twice and then waded in from the back of the room, prompting murmurs and craned necks.
"Gotta have style," her campaign manager, Ed Rollins, said after the event.
Her stump speech is laced with plenty of "thank you's" and "I love you all" and "God bless you all." And she doesn't start slow -- it's more like one loud burst of sustained speaking from beginning to end. 
She will, however, sometimes whisper to emphasize a point. At those moments, she will often cross her hands over her breast, lower her voice and bend forward a bit, as if to get closer to those in the room.
"Let me tell you," she will say, going on to make her point.
Mrs. Bachmann is a fan of the gimmick or the kitschy moment. At the end of her remarks at the Iowa straw poll, she invited her supporters to "follow her" to the voting area to cast their ballots with her - even though as a non-Iowa resident she herself could not vote. 
At the end of her speech in Waterloo, Mrs. Bachmann suddenly produced an apple pie that she said she "just happened" to pick up on the way to the speech. She offered to give it to the "oldest Republican mother" in the room, which just happened to be a 100-year-old woman. The result? A motherhood and apple pie moment - literally.
And after the event, Mrs. Bachmann's staff produced boxes of white "Bachmann for President" T-shirts and posters. She stood on the stage to sign them for the crowd for at least 15 minutes. She then held a highly controlled mini press conference, which included exactly three questions from preselected reporters.
Mrs. Bachmann's style is somewhat less polished than her rivals, and she has been known to make factual errors in her speeches, which could cause her trouble over time. She likes to talk about how she is "authentic." But her big-budget bus and her tendency to arrive late could grate on audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire, who expect timeliness.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney, Political Surfer

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney knows the importance of catching a good wave, politically speaking.

 BODY:
BERLIN, N.H. -- So, just what did Mitt Romney learn while he was running for president four years ago?
That politics is a lot like surfing, for starters.
"Someone said to me that politics is like surfing, and I said, 'Well, what do you mean by that? How is politics like surfing?' " Mr. Romney said at an evening town hall gathering here Tuesday. "And they said, 'Well, to be successful in politics, you have to be a good politician and you have to catch a good wave, just like surfing.' "
And the wave he hopes to ride all the way to the White House this time around is the economy.
"That's what I know, that's in my wheelhouse," Mr. Romney said. "And so one of the things I've learned is that what America needs and what I know have come together in a way that will help me, I believe, be successful in getting the nomination, and ultimately being successful in replacing our president with someone who knows how to get the economy going."
Mr. Romney was publicly making a point that his campaign staffers have also made over the past few weeks - that the 2008 race became a referendum on the war in Iraq, and the Republicans nominated their war candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona. This time, Romney advisers say, the election will turn on jobs and the economy, and they believe that Mr. Romney, having spent 25 years in the private sector before being elected governor of Massachusetts, is the Republican candidate best equipped to handle the current economic climate.
Mr. Romney said the second thing he learned was to "make sure people understand what I stand for and what my values are."
"And that's why you'll see on all of my signs I believe in America, believe in America," he said. "I believe in this country. I believe in the principles that made this country great."
(Presumably, he will be rolling out more specific policy proposals this fall).
But despite the lessons he picked up four years ago, Mr. Romney still has a long slog ahead of him, especially coming out last weekend, when Gov. Rick Perry of Texas declared his candidacy and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota took first place in the Ames Straw Poll.
At the Littleton Diner earlier in the day, where Mr. Romney had stopped by to chat with voters, a woman told Mr. Romney that she expected him to be his party's nominee and looked forward to voting for him for president.
"I have a ways to go," Mr. Romney said.
"I know you do!" the woman replied, to laughter. "I feel sorry for you."

HEADLINE: Ambitious Plans for a Building Where Sears Served Atlanta

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- As large as 20 Wal-Mart stores, the cavernous former Sears building now known as City Hall East towers above a motley assortment of restaurants, underground dance halls and a strip club a few miles northeast of downtown. The building, which at 2.1 million square feet is the largest brick structure in the South, according to its owners, has been mostly vacant since Sears left in 1989.
But now there is a plan to salvage the space. A prominent Atlanta-based developer, Jamestown Properties, which owns Chelsea Market in Manhattan, bought the building from the city last month for $27 million. It expects to spend $180 million to convert it to a mixed-use cluster of restaurants, apartments, office space and perhaps even a rooftop amusement park, all renamed Ponce City Market, by early 2014. 
''That's a big hunk of building, and it's been dead space for so long,'' said David F. Haddow, a consultant and architecture professor at Georgia Tech. ''But it's not going to be easy.''
Others have tried before. The city bought the building for $12 million in 1990 -- ''the deal of the century,'' Maynard Jackson, the mayor at the time, said -- but ended up using only 10 percent of the space, mostly for police offices and storage. Then, in 2006, a well-connected former state lawmaker introduced a plan to build apartments there, but that idea fell victim to the economy.
The real estate market in Atlanta is still sluggish. But supporters say the project has a better chance than most. City Hall East is at the junction of four fashionable neighborhoods: Midtown, Virginia-Highlands, the Old Fourth Ward and Inman Park. In a city known for glittery newness, the 1926 building is raw, historic and authentic.
So the conventional wisdom among civic leaders is: right building, right place, right developer. But is it the right time?
''There are clearly challenges,'' said David Bennett, a senior policy adviser to Mayor Kasim Reed who helped broker the deal. ''There is a 20 percent vacancy rate in Atlanta in the office market, the condo market is in disarray and even the commercial market is down quite a bit.''
The city is so invested in the outcome that Mayor Reed spoke at the purchase ceremony, predicting that a successful development could have a $1 billion economic impact. A kickoff celebration in October will feature a concert by the Indigo Girls and catering by a who's who of Atlanta chefs.
''We see this as being transformational for that area of Atlanta,'' said Ernestine Garey, the executive vice president and chief operating officer for the Atlanta Development Authority. ''It is a huge, huge opportunity.''
Early blueprints make Ponce City Market look not unlike Chelsea Market, the renovated biscuit factory that leases space to the Food Network and other technology and media companies. It will contain high-ceilinged office space, a range of restaurants, a food market, apartments, exhibition spaces, a skywalk and perhaps even an amusement park, Jamestown says.
The plan calls for reducing the building's square footage by nearly half, to 1.2 million square feet, constructing a parking garage with at least 2,000 spaces inside the structure and demolishing many internal walls and ceilings. But Jamestown says it will preserve the exterior and as much equipment as possible from the original Sears department store and distribution center. A giant electrical panel will become the backdrop for a bar, and a train trestle will be repurposed as a pedestrian walkway.
''We think the history is really central to the culture we're trying to create,'' said Michael Phillips, a managing director of Jamestown. ''We're trying to keep the spirit of this place alive and to keep it true to its Southern roots.''
In its heyday, Sears shipped to customers across the Southeast. Older Atlantans remember picking up furniture or clothes there. ''That's where everybody shopped,'' Trudie Wade, an Atlanta resident who worked at the Sears in the 1970s, says in a video that Jamestown produced about the building's history. ''It was huge. I was like, 'Oh my God, it's such a huge store that we're going to get lost in here.' ''
Other cities have refurbished Sears stores and distribution centers. In Seattle, a former Sears is now the headquarters of Starbucks. In Dallas, one has 400 apartments and a nightclub. In Boston, one has an REI, a Best Buy and a movie theater.
But Atlanta's Sears center has its own difficulties because it was vacant so long. The city spent months removing and auctioning the office equipment that had piled up inside over the years, raising more than $100,000.
Architects are still figuring out how to avoid damaging a sewage system from the early 1900s that runs directly through the building's lower floors. Although it retains its elegant maple flooring and tall glass windows, parts of the building have fallen into disrepair.
''The office spaces quite literally looked like terrorists had run in the front door and people had fled out the back door in a panic,'' Mr. Bennett said. But Jamestown says it has faced obstacles with historic buildings elsewhere: Chelsea Market; the former Port of New York Authority at 111 Eighth Avenue, now owned by Google; and Warehouse Row in Chattanooga all required substantial overhauls.
For the 64 years that Sears owned City Hall East, the building was treated ''like a Rolls-Royce,'' said Jim Irwin, a vice president at Green Street, a subsidiary and development arm of Jamestown.
Tenants are already signing up. Anne Quatrano, an Atlanta chef and restaurant owner who has worked with Jamestown before, said she planned to open a po-boy shop at Ponce City Market.
''It's a little scary,'' Ms. Quatrano said of the building's uncertain prospects. But if you like the building, the developer and the history of the neighborhood, she said, then you have to trust that customers will come.

HEADLINE: A Bull Market in Tech Patents

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Google was willing on Monday to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in no small part because of its stockpile of 17,000 patents. The patent portfolio, some analysts estimate, could represent more than half of the value of the deal, or more than $400,000 a patent.
If so, it was a relative bargain. In June, Apple and Microsoft teamed up with four other companies to pay $4.5 billion for the 6,000 patents held by the bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. That works out to $750,000 a patent or nearly four times the average price for computer, software and telecommunications patents over the last few years, patent experts say.
In a stumbling economy, stocks languish in a skittish funk and real estate remains depressed. But technology patents look downright bubbly.
This patent gold rush has a darker side. It is diverting money for innovation from industries crucial to the economic future of the United States, analysts say. Patents were created as an incentive for innovation, giving inventors a temporary right to commercialize their ideas, without others copying them. While the recent blockbuster patent deals may make sense for the companies, analysts say, they are fed largely by legal considerations -- asserting patent claims or defending against claims -- rather than economic ones. 
So the very innovation patents were intended to encourage, they say, suffers in the patent wars. ''You'd much rather see Apple spend some of that $4 billion on new inventions, and Google invest that $12 billion to generate new knowledge,'' said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. ''It's a transfer of wealth from innovators to bondholders and stockholders who have no motivation to innovate. It's disturbing.''
Patent investment firms, lawsuits, weakened patent overhaul legislation and the fierce competition among well-heeled rivals have also fanned this inflation. The patent legislation that emerged from the House and Senate, and which may well be enacted in the new session of Congress, has been scaled back. It no longer includes proposals that would have sharply curbed damage awards and the freedom of patent-holding companies to file patent infringement lawsuits. Another provision that was dropped would have limited the ability to file patent claims in known plaintiff-friendly courts, notably those in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Tyler, Texarkana and Marshall.
Large technology companies championed those patent suit restrictions. But they were cut from the legislation after resistance from interests that rely on strong patent protection, like pharmaceutical companies, individual inventors and patent-buying firms like Intellectual Ventures, a multibillion-dollar fund run by Nathan Myhrvold that owns more than 35,000 patents.
Without tougher legislation, said Mr. Lerner of Harvard, companies are left to settle disputes on their own in the courts and at the bargaining table, which tends to lift prices.
The result is that it now pays to sue over patents as a routine business practice. The smartphone business, for one, is rife with suit and countersuit. The better-known cases involve large companies. Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, in different cases, have accused Google or the companies that use its Android smartphone operating system, like Motorola and HTC, a Taiwan handset maker, of infringing on their patents.
But there are other suits by small patent-holding companies that have aimed at developers of software applications that run on Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS, which powers its iPhones. So the larger companies, like Google and Apple, are often forced to step in with legal assistance to help their business partners, even single-person applications developers.
The result, said Brian Kahin, a senior fellow at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group, and a White House technology policy adviser in the Clinton administration, is ''a huge surge in the monetization of these patents.''
Some industry executives doubt whether the recent high prices amount to a patent bubble. John A. Amster, chief executive of RPX, a start-up founded in 2008, which has bought more than 1,600 patents, said the Nortel and Motorola deals were mainly special cases. The high prices, he said, reflected not only an assessment of the value of the patents, but the much larger objective of trying to gain the upper hand in the smartphone business.
In the Nortel auction, RPX worked with a group of companies that came up with a bid of more than $1 billion, Mr. Amster said. That level, according to RPX, was the estimated value of the patents -- but far below the $4.5 billion Apple, Microsoft, Research in Motion and their partners were willing to pay.
In the case of Motorola, Google was under pressure from its big handset partners, including HTC and Samsung, to protect them from patent-infringement suits based on their use of Google's Android software. And Motorola has an impressive collection of mobile phone patents, a powerful weapon in patent negotiations.
''What you're seeing in Nortel and Motorola are prices determined by broad strategic interests, and there aren't many of those deals,'' said Mr. Amster. His company, RPX, charges clients yearly fees for licensing its patent portfolio, which reduces the companies' risk of being sued.
Handset makers and mobile carriers are certainly hoping that Google's purchase of Motorola will ease tensions in the smartphone market -- a patent armistice among rival powers. Verizon on Tuesday welcomed the deal as a move that might well ''bring some stability to the ongoing smartphone patent disputes,'' John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel, said in a statement. Verizon Wireless, owned by the Vodafone Group and Verizon Communications, sells both Android-powered phones and iPhones.
Fierce patent disputes in young, fast-growing industries are anything but new. In 1895, George B. Selden, a patent lawyer and inventor, was granted a broad patent on the automobile, covering a machine with four wheels powered by a gasoline engine. Henry Ford and other early automakers fought the patent for years, and it was eventually pruned back in 1911.
The early patent battles over the airplane were so bitter and complex that the government stepped in during World War I and negotiated an agreement that required the companies to cross-license their patents, opening the door to innovation in the aircraft industry.
Patents, experts note, work well when an invention can be clearly defined, as in the patents that cover new chemical compounds -- a new drug or petrochemical, for example. But a smartphone, they add, is a bundle of information technology, including hardware, software and techniques for sending and receiving voice, data and video.
In a recent blog post, David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote that a modern smartphone might be susceptible to as many as 250,000 potential patent claims, depending on how broadly those patents and claims were interpreted.
''The trouble is that in this industry so often a patent is not a clearly defined property right, but a lottery ticket of uncertain value,'' said Scott Stern, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''That uncertainty can carry a lot of risk and cost.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Glean Profit In Slow Sales

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Even as worries grow about another economic downturn, major retail companies continue to report strong earnings, thanks to tough lessons from the recession.
Some retailers turning a solid profit are doing so despite sluggish sales, including Wal-Mart, which said on Tuesday that same-store sales in the United States had declined for the ninth consecutive quarter. Still, the company, the country's largest retail chain, reported that net income had increased 5.7 percent because of what it called ''strong expense management,'' among other things.
Retail analysts said results reported over the last week by a broad cross section of retailers -- including Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Kohl's -- suggested that whatever happened with consumer spending, the retail sector was better equipped to cope than it was when the recession hit. 
Among the lessons learned, said Bradley Thomas, a retail analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, are keeping inventories lean, using marketing dollars strategically and quickly marking down slow-moving items so they do not have to be priced later at rock-bottom clearance prices.
''Companies are doing more with less,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''The downside risk is not as great as it was in 2008.''
The slate of results reported on Tuesday showed varied sales numbers. Saks Fifth Avenue had a large same-store sales increase of 15.5 percent for the quarter. Home Depot's sales were strong; the discount retailer T. J. Maxx had a good sales quarter; and Wal-Mart said its same-store sales in the United States had declined by 0.9 percent.
All four retailers posted profits better than Wall Street had expected, and all except Saks raised their full-year profit projections. In explaining the results, retail executives said that although the economy was volatile, they had been through ups and downs like this before.
''If we do experience a prolonged downturn, we'll approach it in the same way we did in the past, focusing on controlling what we can control: expenses, capital spending and inventory,'' Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, told investors Tuesday. He said Saks was better positioned than in 2008 because of ''carefully controlled'' inventory, a stronger balance sheet, decreased capital spending and the closure of seven full-line stores in the last year and a half.
Retailers of all stripes said they had not yet seen outsize effects among shoppers from the recent stock market swings, but the higher-end retailers expressed greater confidence about sales in the future than did the lower-end ones.
''Our August comp sales are in line with our comp sales forecasts for the fall season,'' Mr. Sadove said. He added that full-price selling was now more prevalent than it had been before the recession, and that he expected that trend to continue.
Mr. Sadove's comments echoed those last week from executives at Nordstrom and Macy's, which owns the higher-end Bloomingdale's. Like Saks, both companies posted strong sales and higher-than-expected profits. Both also raised their profit outlook for the year.
At Nordstrom, full-price items are also selling well, even as prices climb, executives said. And at Macy's, nonsale items were also big sellers, and ''our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business, as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment,'' Karen M. Hoguet, the chief financial officer, said. Macy's said it had its best second quarter in more than a decade.
At the lower end of the retail world, the mood has been more subdued. At Wal-Mart, executives said Tuesday that shoppers were under as much economic pressure as ever, and that the job market was now worrying them even more than high gas and food prices.
''They're trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,'' Michael T. Duke, the chief executive, said.
Those worries among customers contributed to the continuing slide in same-store sales, but Wal-Mart posted a higher-than-expected profit nonetheless. Net income at the company increased to $3.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, a penny better than analysts had projected. Its revenue rose 5.4 percent to $109.3 billion.
In addition to ''strong expense management,'' Mr. Duke said, Wal-Mart was getting inventory levels under control, while better sales at Sam's Club and Wal-Mart's international division also contributed to the healthier bottom line.
Wal-Mart said its full-year profit should be higher than expected, at $4.41 to $4.51 a share, versus the $4.35 to $4.50 guidance it had previously given. That again seemed to be based on expense controls and growth overseas and at Sam's, not on strong domestic sales.
''Negative headlines don't help consumer sentiment at any level of income, but our customer, also just from a job perspective and a real income perspective, is really stretched,'' Charles M. Holley Jr., the chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters. ''The unemployment is actually a lot higher for people who have less education and had less income to begin with -- it's much more severe as you go down the economic scale.''
At Kohl's, which caters to shoppers who are generally better off than those at Wal-Mart, Kevin Mansell, chairman and chief executive, said he was not happy with the sales. Kohl's profits, though, beat expectations. Kohl's same-store sales were lower than the 2 to 4 percent increase the retailer had projected, coming in at 1.9 percent. Yet the retailer nevertheless posted a 17 percent increase in profit, which it attributed to controlling expenses, stocking more profitable private brands, and keeping inventory levels modest.
Dillard's, another midrange chain, said last week that its profit for the quarter more than doubled from a year before, rising to $17.6 million from $6.8 million a year before. Same-store sales rose 6 percent for the quarter. Over the last couple of years, Dillard's has closed stores and reduced its inventory.
J. C. Penney posted a quarterly profit of $14 million, or 7 cents a share, last week, about what analysts expected. Penney noted it was cutting $50 million from expenses.

HEADLINE: A Summer Of Italy, Music And Pasta

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
WHEN Barilla, the pasta company formed in Italy in 1877, was first nationally advertised in the United States in 1996, it turned out to be less an introduction than an invasion. In just three years, Barilla bested familiar brands like Ronzoni and Mueller's to become the top-selling dry pasta in the country. Even when the pasta category contracted at the height of the low-carbohydrate diet craze from 2002 to 2004, Barilla continued to boil over with year-over-year gains.
Now New Yorkers are beginning to see another Barilla invasion, this one called the Summer of Italy: a series of events, roving street teams and product sampling that will take place over the next six weeks. 
''We believe that we are more than pasta, we are more than sauce,'' said Giannella Alvarez, president of Barilla's Americas Group. ''We're about Italian culture and about sharing that Italian culture with family and friends.''
And with 8.4 million New Yorkers.
For the evening commute on Monday, a team handed out ''Spaghettata-to-go'' kits (pasta, sauce, lettuce, olive oil, vinegar) to passers-by. Plans called for the sampling to rove to other commuter hubs for the remainder of this week, including Pennsylvania Station and Columbus Circle, with distribution of about 20,000 kits.
Included with the victuals will be two tickets to Casa Barilla, a branded Italian food festival that will take place Sept. 13 through Sept. 16 in Central Park. Staged in a temporary structure, the festival will have cooking demonstrations, sampling stations and a play area where children can make macaroni necklaces. As many as 25,000 people are expected to attend.
On Sept. 15, Barilla will be the primary sponsor for the Central Park concert featuring the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, whose music has for years been featured in the brand's commercials. Barilla will be the exclusive food provider at the concert, which is expected to draw about 50,000.
The Food Bank for New York City will benefit from the promotions, with the brand donating all proceeds from the $5 Casa Barilla ticket price, $1 for every dinner kit it distributes, and 25 percent of proceeds from the food sold at the concert.
Barilla, which declined to reveal how much it was spending on the promotions, spent $26.9 million on United States advertising in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
One way that Barilla would like Americans to emulate Italians, of course, is in pasta consumption.
In Italy, pasta is consumed by 99 percent of households at an average annual household rate of 72.6 pounds, while in America it is consumed by 84 percent of households at an annual household rate of 12 pounds, according to Nielsen data provided by Barilla.
Pasta faced snubbing during the apex of high-protein weight loss plans like the Atkins diet, with total dry pasta sales in the United States dropping from 1.13 billion pounds in 2001 to 1.01 billion pounds in 2004, according to Nielsen. By 2010, sales had climbed back somewhat to 1.04 billion pounds.
Among consumers eating more pasta now, 65 percent are doing so because it is an affordable option during the economic downturn, according to Mintel, a market research firm.
Barilla has a 28.1 percent share of the $1.47 billion dry pasta market, followed by store brands, which account for 22 percent, and Ronzoni, with 8.8 percent, according to data from the 52 weeks ending July 10 from the SymphonyIRI Group. Its data does not include Wal-Mart, and lists noodles as a separate category from all other pasta.
While Barilla celebrates its Italian roots, all of its pasta sold here is produced at plants in Ames, Iowa, and Avon, N.Y., except for tortellini and oven-ready lasagna. (The impetus for the plants, which use Italian equipment, was avoidance of tariffs.)
In addition to the other Summer of Italy events, the head American chef for the brand, Lorenzo Boni, has been teaching Italian cooking classes since July 27 at Eataly, the Italian food hall in the Flatiron District. The classes continue through Sept. 7.
Five Barilla-branded Italian Fiat 500s will begin appearing throughout the five boroughs on Aug. 23. On Twitter (twitter.com/barillaus), the brand will reveal the Fiats' general vicinities; followers can then pinpoint locations on Foursquare. The first five people to check in to Foursquare will receive V.I.P. tickets to the Andrea Bocelli concert, while everyone who checks in will receive free tickets to the food festival.
Asked to review the Barilla promotions, Bryan Duffy, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Mktg Partners in New York, which specializes in experiential marketing, said they will ''create key touch points throughout the summer to keep consumers engaged and interested.''
Such an approach can be particularly effective for the company because ''eating food and listening to good music is all about a lifestyle and a culture, and the fact that it's brought to you by Barilla makes the emotional connection very authentic,'' Mr. Duffy said.
Ms. Alvarez said Barilla was considering similar programs in other American cities next year. ''It is sort of taking marketing out of the TV and into the streets, and taking the messaging into a one-on-one conversation with people,'' she said. ''When you have that very direct connection with people, you create advocates for your brand -- you create ambassadors.''

KENHORST, Pa.
This American summer, the heat is the least of it. A pummeled economy. A credit-rating embarrassment. More tarmac ceremonies for dead war heroes. Tornadoes, floods and other disasters, including Congress. Presidential aspirants stalking Iowa like Barbie and Ken zombies.
Clearly, the country needs to pull off the road and take a break. It needs to treat itself to a soft-serve cone, chocolate-dipped and melting so quickly as to demand a tongue's sculpting attention, while tiny tree creatures sing their carpe diem serenade, and reassurance comes with a stray evening breeze.
A tasty-twirly-twisty place has to be around here somewhere. There always is.
There's one. In the Kenhorst Plaza, just outside the small city of Reading, a Dairy Queen shares asphalt space with a Dollar Tree, a Sears hardware store, a Fashion Bug, a food market, a pawn shop and a few vacant storefronts. It is the neon beacon of comfort in a tired commercial tableau. 
Inside, though, this Dairy Queen seems different from the 5,000 others lighting up the country's summer nights. It has the standard freezer filled with Dilly Bars, and the black-and-white photographs evoking a past that includes the first Dairy Queen, in prison-centric Joliet, Ill., in 1940. But plaques and letters and children's handwritten notes cover nearly every inch of available wall, all praising someone clearly without Pennsylvania Dutch roots; someone named Hamid.
The Cumru Elementary School thanks Hamid. The Mifflin Park Elementary School thanks Hamid. The Brecknock Elementary School thanks Hamid. The Governor Mifflin intermediate, middle and high schools thank Hamid. The Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts, the soccer leagues and the baseball leagues, the Crime Alert program, the home for adults with mental retardation -- they all thank Hamid.
And here comes the owner, Hamid Chaudhry, in the midst of another 80-hour workweek, fresh from curling another soft-serve. As he makes his way to a corner table, customers hunched over chicken-strip baskets and sundaes call out his name, and he calls back theirs.
''Hi, Tracey; I have that check for you.'' ''Bye, Mrs. Brady. All good for the homecoming?'' ''Bye, Mr. Rush. How was the Blizzard? Want another one?''
With such familiarity, you might think that Mr. Chaudhry, 40, grew up rooting for the Reading Phillies and taking late-night rides up to the iconic Pagoda on Mount Penn. But in words inflected by his Pakistani roots and slight speech impediment, he explains that he has lived in southeastern Pennsylvania only since the uncertain year of 2002, not long after Sept. 11.
Then, as a couple of local officials he knows catch up by the window, and a former state police officer he knows picks up a frozen cake, and a Mennonite family, regular customers, eat his soft-serve out on the patio, Hamid from the Dairy Queen tells his American story.
He was the youngest of six in a Muslim family in Karachi. His father, an accountant, was physically and mentally damaged after being hit by a car; his mother, a schoolteacher, took care of her husband and insisted that her baby go to America for a better life. That meant Chicago, where a brother was driving a cab while studying to become a college professor.
Mr. Chaudhry took several years to earn a college degree in finance, partly because of language difficulties, and partly because he was always working -- mostly at the celebrated Drake Hotel. He was the unseen busboy, working his way up to assistant manager for room service and minibars, serving Caesar salad to President-elect Bill Clinton, delivering unsatisfactory apple pancakes to Jack Nicholson, tending to the dietary needs of a guest named Lassie. The Drake became an immersion course in Western pop culture.
He became an American citizen and started a career in financial-accounting software, eventually moving to New York, where he got fired. (''Wall Street wasn't for me,'' he says.) But he did meet a medical student named Sana Syed. Their first meeting was with her parents; the second was for a coffee at Starbucks; the third a brunch at a diner; and, finally, a dinner date at an Outback Steakhouse.
After they married in 2001, she landed a residency at the Reading Hospital and Medical Center. While his wife worked 90 hours a week, Mr. Chaudhry mustered the nerve to ask the owner of the local Dairy Queen, at Kenhorst Plaza, whether he wanted to sell. When he heard yes, Mr. Chaudhry scraped, mortgaged and borrowed to meet the asking price of $413,000.
He completed his classroom training at Dairy Queen's headquarters in Minnesota, where he studied everything from labor management to the proper way to hand a customer a Blizzard. On June 27, 2003, he finally opened the doors to his Dairy Queen, but he was so jittery, intent on making every customer feel extra, extra special, that one employee quit on the spot. Oh, and the soft-serve machine malfunctioned.
Once he found his footing, Mr. Chaudhry decided to give back to the community, and held an elementary-school fund-raiser in which he provided the parent-teacher organization with 25 percent of the sales. Though the $450 seemed a generous amount, the publicity he received did not seem right to him.
''It felt like I got more in return than what I was giving,'' he says.
Just like that, the Dairy Queen began to become the center of communal good, notwithstanding its contribution to the high obesity rate recorded among adults in Berks County. Mr. Chaudhry immersed himself in fund-raising, splitting everything 50-50 so that he only covered his costs. Good for promoting the business, yes, but also good for Hamid.
Fund-raisers for a father of four with cancer; for the Children's Miracle Network; for soccer teams and Little League teams and the widow of a deputy sheriff recently killed in a shootout -- he was a regular customer who liked Blizzards. Sponsorship of car washes and high school homecomings and blood drives four times a year. (Donate a pint of blood and get a $20 frozen cake.) Free parties held at every local elementary school, as well as at a Bible school run by the Mennonite church.
''My customers have made me well-to-do,'' Mr. Chaudhry explains. ''They patronize me, so why wouldn't I give back?''
He gets up to hand a check to Tracey Naugle, the president of one of the local parent-teacher organizations who sits at a nearby table, enjoying a chocolate cone. Typical Hamid, she later says. She recently helped to organize a modest fund-raising event at Dairy Queen for a children's swim team. ''Hamid gave me a check for $1,000,'' she says. ''And I know we didn't make $1,000 that night.''
Every community has its magnetizing place: a post office, a diner, a coffee shop. Here it is the Dairy Queen, Ms. Naugle says, mostly because of Mr. Chaudhry. He randomly shows up at schools with frozen treats for teachers. He once set up a petting zoo outside his store. He even bought his own dunk tank to use on the patio. He tries.
''He knows everybody and everybody knows Hamid,'' Ms. Naugle says. ''We're so lucky to have him.''
The soft-serve has been a welcome balm, but it is time to toss those balled-up napkins and get back on the nerve-rattling road. Time to say goodbye to Mr. Chaudhry, who can tell you that younger people prefer Oreo Blizzards and older people prefer dipped cones, but he cannot say more about his motives than that he is lucky, thank God.
Just living in Pennsylvania, he says, with a wife, two children, a thriving business, and many friends. Hamid at the Dairy Queen is home.

HEADLINE: Manchester United Nears Stock Sale On Asian Exchange

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Julia Werdigier and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Manchester United, the English Premier League soccer power that is already the most valuable sports team in the world, is preparing to sell shares on the Singapore stock exchange that could raise about $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the plan who declined to be identified before the details of the sale were made public.
Manchester United has been something of a paradox since the Glazer family took over the club in 2005. Fans feared that the American owners would run the club into the ground, and fretted about the tens of millions of dollars in debt they added to its balance sheet. Yet the club remains as popular and successful as ever, and revenue has continued to grow. 
If the Glazers get their way, their fans may be able to breathe a little easier.
Manchester United officials declined to comment on the potential share sale. But sports industry advisers say that the Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, would sell only a minority stake in the club and use some of the proceeds to pay off debt and reduce interest expenses.
The Glazers are looking to issue shares in Asia because so many of the club's fans are there, and the team's popularity would allow it to potentially raise more than it would if it issued shares in London. A listing in Singapore could fuel sales of merchandise, sponsorships and media rights in Asia.
''The owners know that a major new investment would put them in a better place and put their relationship with their supporters in a better place,'' said John Williams, the director of the Center for the Sociology of Sport at the University of Leicester in England. ''I can see this killing a number of birds with one stone.''
Most owners of sports teams avoid listing their teams on public exchanges because they prefer to avoid the increased scrutiny from regulators. Manchester United was publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange before the Glazers bought the club.
Despite criticism from some fans, the Glazers have denied that they are interested in selling the club. The club last year repaid about $350 million in high-interest loans without using the team's money. The club has been successful on the field, winning the Premier League title last year for the fourth time in five seasons and finishing second in the Champions League.
But competition remains fierce. Real Madrid and Barcelona, which can negotiate their own television deals, earn tens of millions of dollars more than Manchester United each year. In England, the free-spending owners of Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and other clubs have aggressively pursued the world's best players.
''All these clubs want to be the biggest brand in the soccer world,'' said Rob Tilliss, who advises some Premier League clubs for Inner Circle Sports.
It is unclear how Manchester United's share sale will be viewed by UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe. It has been trying to enforce rules for financial fair play to prevent teams from spending wildly on players.
For now, Manchester United remains the world's biggest soccer brand. Forbes valued the team at $1.86 billion, slightly ahead of the N.F.L.'s Dallas Cowboys. Revenues have grown steadily in recent years, with income from broadcasting, ticket sales and commercial sales each making up about one-third.
Manchester United's parent company, Red Football Joint Venture, however, said in March that it had a record pretax loss of $:109 million, or $178 million, in the year that ended in June 2010. The loss was 36 percent larger than what the company had reported in October, according to a public filing of its accounts.
Though a share sale is unlikely to happen before the end of the year, an infusion of cash would provide the Glazers with financial breathing room and perhaps ease tensions with their fans.
''If they go public, it solidifies their position as owners for at least another generation because it provides them with liquidity for the franchise,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a sports consultancy.

HEADLINE: Bringing Cash Piles Back Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Apple has a cash problem. It's not just that Apple has too much cash, $76 billion as of June 30. It's rather that the bulk of that pile, estimated at $41 billion, is held abroad.
Apple does not want to bring it back to the United States for several reasons, primarily because of the tax consequences, but also because of its own growing foreign presence. Apple is not alone - this problem is an increasing one in corporate America. And the answer may not be more big, all-cash acquisitions, like Google's $12.5 billion offer for Motorola Mobility.
In an analyst report in May, JPMorgan Chase estimated that 519 American multinational corporations had $1.375 trillion outside the United States. The problem is particularly acute among technology companies, which historically tend to hoard cash because of the cyclical nature of their business.
A recent Moody's report noted that Microsoft held $42 billion abroad, or more than 80 percent of its cash. Cisco Systems has $38.8 billion, or almost 90 percent of its cash. Google - at least before Monday's deal - had nearly $40 billion in cash, with more than 43 percent of it held abroad 
Tax policy is driving much of this trend. For multinational corporations, cash earned abroad cannot easily be remitted to the United States. If it is paid back to the United States, it is subject to a dividend tax that can rise to as much as 35 percent. Companies are loath to pay this tax because while they can offset it with taxes paid abroad, the companies still end up paying a relatively high tax rate.
Yet it is not just a tax issue. Many United States companies want to keep cash abroad to focus on high-growth regions for investments and acquisitions.
A recent Standard & Poor's study found that 50 percent of sales by companies in the S.&P. 500-stock index are outside the United States. Interestingly, the report also found that these companies paid more in foreign taxes than to the United States government. For Apple, 60 percent of its sales are abroad, and like these other companies, its foreign sales are expected to only go higher.
So, for those who expect that a change in tax policy would prompt Apple and other companies to put their cash piles to use in the United States, don't be so sure. Even if there were no dividend tax, a large portion of this cash would stay abroad as these companies focus on higher growth overseas for investment.
Still, the current tax policy clearly distorts the practices of United States companies. One of the reasons Microsoft acquired Skype was because it was located in Luxembourg. Microsoft could use its foreign cash to make this acquisition without having to first repatriate it to the United States.
More broadly, many American companies return the cash every quarter to the United States, but then send it back abroad by quarter-end to avoid it being counted as a deemed dividend. The current tax laws thus encourage these companies to engage in cash manipulation and keep too much cash abroad.
In 2004, Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act, a tax holiday for companies to repatriate cash. The dividend tax was reduced to 5.25 percent from 35 percent. In exchange for this reduction, Congress required that any cash repatriated be invested in the United States. The cash could not be used for dividends or stock repurchases.
Alas, cash is fungible. A study of this tax holiday, entitled ''Watch What I Do, Not What I Say: The Unintended Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act,'' found that in the year following the act, repatriations increased by $230 billion from the previous year, to $299 billion.
Five companies alone - Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson and I.B.M. - repatriated $88 billion, But the repatriation did not result in increased investment. Instead, companies largely repatriated the money and used their current United States holdings to pay out dividends or engage in share repurchases. This was contrary to what Congress had intended.
While the cash was not used for investment, this does not mean it did not have an overall positive effect on the American economy: shareholders went on to spend this cash. The study's authors acknowledged this, stating that ''presumably these shareholders either reinvested these funds or used them for consumption, thereby having indirect effects on firm investment, employment or spending.''
The tax holiday may therefore have stimulated the economy, although a Congressional Research Service report found that the companies that repatriated the most money actually cut jobs from 2004-6.
Still, the act also had a pernicious effect. American companies now accumulate cash and wait to repatriate these holdings, knowing that Congress will probably declare another tax holiday eventually.
Why engage in this game every few years? Congress could permanently modify United States tax policy to set the rate at a lower amount. This would be recognition that Apple and its like are multinational companies and that this problem is not going away. The world is global, and fencing off cash like this for our best companies is unrealistic.
More important, although these companies will still leave some cash abroad, more of it will come back to the United States. If it were invested, that would be terrific but not necessary as it would also end the distortions that drive even more investment abroad.
Google provided a recent example only this week with its Motorola Mobility acquisition. Google has more of its cash in the United States than other comparable technology companies since it is not a retailer like Apple.
Google is also more willing to take on debt in the United States to finance acquisitions, having completed in May a $3 billion debt raise. This was done to provide it more United States cash. Google provides anecdotal evidence that ending this distortion will end the foreign cash bias.
A permanent tax reduction would not only cut taxes but actually raise revenue, allowing for Republicans to vote for it. And it should be a holiday without restrictions - trying to force companies to invest the money rather than pay dividends is a useless exercise that will create only more bureaucracy.
Even if the money were largely spent on buybacks and dividends and a large portion were kept abroad, it would still be reasonable to expect $300 billion to $600 billion to be repatriated. This money would flow into the economy, making the dividend tax cut a stimulus package that Democrats could support.
A 2008 simulated analysis by Decision Economics found that such a reduction would raise about $50 billion a year for the federal government from the tax received and the increased growth, over a five-year period. Economic growth would be increased by up to $62 billion a year.
The Obama administration has previously been negative on such a tax reduction, but it might want to reconsider. This is the rare tax policy move that both Democrats and Republicans should be able to easily support. It is one that would allow Apple and other big American multinationals to spend money more freely, something needed in a troubled economy. It may even push Apple to finally put to use some of its gigantic cash pile.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: White Picket Fence? Not So Fast

BYLINE: By VIRAL V. ACHARYA, MATTHEW P. RICHARDSON, STIJN VAN NIEUWERBURGH and LAWRENCE J. WHITE. 
Viral V. Acharya, Matthew P. Richardson, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh and Lawrence J. White are professors at the New York University Stern School of Business and the authors of ''Guaranteed to Fail: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Debacle of Mortgage Finance.''

 BODY:
THE United States spends more than $100 billion annually to subsidize homeowners. Renters get no breaks; homeowners get tons of them. Their mortgage rates are subsidized through the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; they get a big deduction on federal income taxes for mortgage interest payments and for state and local property taxes; and they even get favored treatment on capital gains from the sales of primary residences.
Americans love the idea of a house and a white picket fence. The government encourages ownership through housing subsidies, believing that it stabilizes communities. Owners see their homes as their share of the American dream, and their best way to save money. 
But according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, these tax breaks add up to $700 billion in lost government revenue over the five-year period through 2014. As the government struggles to come up with spending cuts and revenue sources, housing subsidies are an obvious place to look.
Until recently, support for home ownership was untouchable because the programs were popular with voters and because of unrelenting lobbying efforts. The political right sold them as part of its ''ownership society,'' whereas the left used them to fight rising income inequality. But the policies have turned into a major disappointment for both sides.
According to data collected by Alex J. Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute, a comparison of homeownership among economically advanced countries shows that the United States is in the middle of the pack, which suggests that subsidizing housing with tax breaks is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a flourishing housing market. Rather, these subsidies enabled people to borrow more than they could afford so they could buy houses bigger than they needed, leading to a house price bubble. The policies encouraged homeowners to make highly leveraged bets on real estate that turned sour and wiped out nearly $8 trillion in household net worth.
Moreover, homeownership policies and mortgage subsidies in the United States benefit the rich a lot more than the poor. For example, the economists James Poterba and Todd Sinai recently estimated that the benefits from the mortgage interest deduction for the average homeowning household that earns between $40,000 and $75,000 were about 10 times smaller than the benefits that accrue to the average household earning more than $250,000. These policies increase income inequality instead of reducing it.
A better policy would be to gradually wind down Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and to scale back homeownership subsidies. We favor a long-term focus on rental assistance programs for the poor that are on budget and housed in the Federal Housing Administration, and whose costs are transparent to taxpayers.
That said, weaning housing finance off the government cannot happen overnight. We liken this to the way one would treat a patient with a drug addiction. One would not double the dose (which is arguably what we have been doing), but neither would one go cold turkey. Existing subsidies would be honored. And to minimize the system-wide shock of closing Fannie and Freddie and removing government support, we envision a decade-long transition from where we are today to where we need to be.
This new housing policy will lead to a different economy. As subsidies to the housing sector are removed, American households will take on less debt and there will be less overconsumption of housing. The private sector will shift its investments from the housing sector to areas of the economy that offer higher rates of return, like human capital, infrastructure projects and capital business projects in other industries. The long-term impact will be tectonic in nature, leading to higher economic growth and a more stable financial system.
Why is this relevant now? The budgetary problems of the United States are dire. Economic growth is anemic. Reforming the American housing finance system will improve the budget and stimulate growth and will make a real contribution to our future prosperity.

HEADLINE: A Suburban Town Sees Housing Where Retail Rules

BYLINE: By JAMIE DUFFY

 BODY:
MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- Jordan Eppolito has taken a liking to his new home here in the Morris County seat, about 30 miles west of New York City. Mr. Eppolito, a 28-year-old entrepreneur who plans to open a pizza shop this fall on South Street, lives in a new condominium overlooking the Morristown Green, the historic park at the center of town.
It is an urban style of living -- Mr. Eppolito can walk to two coffee shops for his morning brew -- that he compares to Manhattan or Hoboken. His condominium, called 40 Park, is part of a burst of development and redevelopment that has brought more than 500 new residential units to Morristown in the last three years, attracted young professionals and well-to-do baby boomers, and ignited interest in the town of about 19,000, said Mayor Timothy Dougherty, who was elected in 2009.
''We're very fortunate in this economy that people still want to come here and invest,'' said Mr. Dougherty, 52, who is the chief engineer at the Prudential Center in Newark. ''We have a huge younger population moving in. I have people every day wanting to meet in my office and wanting to talk about different ideas.'' 
Now the town is hoping the recent residential growth around the Green and the train station will carry over to Speedwell Avenue, where a mixed-use project that would displace small businesses and a number of 19th-century homes in a largely Latino neighborhood has met with a less-than-ecstatic reception.
Over all, Morristown seems to be doing relatively well in the economic downturn. Of approximately one million square feet of ground floor retail space available in Morristown, just 4 percent is vacant, according to estimates from Jennifer Wehring, the director of marketing for the Morristown Partnership, which oversees a special improvement district formed in 1995 when big retailers like Woolworth's and Macy's were closing.
Recent privately financed residential projects include 217 one- and two-bedroom rental apartments at the Highlands at Morristown Station, billed as a ''transit village''; 36 luxury condominiums at the Vail Mansion on South Street, a main artery leading to the Green; 78 luxury condos and penthouses at 40 Park, a property overlooking the Green; and the Metropolitan, 130 apartments with upscale amenities behind 40 Park, connected by a brick plaza. The 40 Park project replaced Epstein's, a landmark department store on the Green for nearly a century.
Debra Tantleff, vice president for development of the Roseland Property Company, a developer that has invested more than $250 million in new construction in the town in less than a decade, said there was a huge appetite for new residential units. ''People want out of Jersey City, Hoboken and Manhattan,'' she said. ''The pitch we are selling is the lifestyle in Morristown.''
Among the lures are nearly 100 restaurants within walking distance of the Green; the Midtown Direct, a New Jersey Transit rail link into Manhattan; and a history that includes George Washington, who drilled his troops on the Green in 1777.
The Speedwell Avenue project, in the works since 2004, is planned to have 800 residential units in low-rise buildings on 11 acres, with 65,000 to 85,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. It will be built in four phases.
The first phase is to include 268 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments with underground parking on 2.3 acres, but the project has stalled because of the recession and haggling over the percentage of affordable apartments, a figure that went from 20 percent in the euphoric period before the crash to a more economically manageable 10 percent, Mr. Dougherty said.
Phase II, on a site adjacent to the first, has been designed on about 3.5 acres to include two apartment buildings with up to 200 rental apartments, a two-acre ''mini Green'' and 14 town house units, although the exact mix has not been decided.
The developer of the first two phases, Richard Murphy of Mill Creek Residential Trust, has proposed a plan for Phase I estimated to cost $50 million that calls for tearing down the town's Department of Public Works building and several 19th-century homes and paving a road, but it contains no retail space.
Mill Creek Residential Trust is a spinoff of Trammell Crow Residential, the original developer of the project; Mr. Murphy is a former Trammell Crow executive.
''No question that the ability to finance new retail is very, very difficult right now,'' Mr. Murphy said.
Ms. Tantleff of Roseland said that despite the low vacancy rate in the downtown area, where retail rents range from $20 to $45 per square foot, the company had not filled any of the 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space at the Highlands near the train station and had not leased all the retail at 40 Park. Along Park Avenue, 17,000 of the 25,000 available square feet that Roseland controls has been leased, to AT&T, Roots Steakhouse, Urban Table, Qdoba and Starbucks.
The company still has 25,000 square feet available below ground and 11,000 square feet along Market Street, a side street off the Green. Rents for the new space are from $40 to $55 a square foot.
''Nobody has come to us and said, 'Can we please build retail?' '' said Phil Abramson of the Jonathan Rose Companies, which is the town planner. ''We have developers coming to us all the time,'' who want to build ''20 units, 100 units'' of housing.
But on Speedwell Avenue, retail is strong, and that has fueled some of the resistance to the project. Just past the 14-story Headquarters Plaza, a 700,000-square-foot Class A office complex with four black glass towers -- Mr. Abramson described it as ''a very oppressive building; people cross the street not to walk under it'' -- is a thriving, mostly Latino community where one- and two-story buildings offer low rents.
''It's a flourishing commercial area,'' said Marion Harris, a former chairwoman of the Morristown Historic Preservation Commission, who has been objecting to the proposed redevelopment there for years. ''It's just not trendy.''
Mrs. Harris and the current chairman, Kenneth Miller, were instrumental in getting Preservation New Jersey, a nonprofit group, to designate the area around the Speedwell redevelopment plan as one of the state's 10 most endangered historic places in 2008, a purely symbolic distinction but one that draws attention to the project.
''The new plan is better than the old plan,'' said Mr. Miller, a retired New York banker who lives in a historic house in town. ''Affordable retail is what Speedwell has been for more than 100 years, a transitional neighborhood. It's been sort of the melting pot of Morristown and Morris County. Ma-and-pa-type businesses simply cannot afford new construction.''
The latest plans for Phases I and II, designed by Dean Marchetto, an architect in Hoboken, tries to borrow from the existing architecture by turning the original plan ''inside out,'' according to Mr. Marchetto, Mr. Murphy and others involved in the project.
''It was 'Anywhere, New Jersey' before we got our hands on it,'' said Mr. Abramson. Instead of wrapping residential apartment blocks around small ''doughnut'' courtyards, there will be a two-acre park between Phase I and Phase II and a woonerf, a Dutch term for a pedestrian-oriented, tree-lined street, leading into the park from Speedwell Avenue and Early Street.
The facades of the proposed five- and six-story buildings, Mr. Abramson said, would be broken up with architectural elements like cornices, lintels, different-colored brick and brick patterns influenced by existing and historic Morristown architecture.
Plans to realign Spring and Early Streets within the redevelopment area to ease rush-hour traffic have been scrapped for now as too costly and too destructive.
Once the Town Council agrees to the amended plan -- expected to occur late this month or in September -- Mr. Murphy will seek approval from the planning board.
''I'd like to see the shovels in the ground in the spring,'' Mayor Dougherty said.
Ms. Tantleff said: ''Morristown is hot. There's a demand for it. You've got to maximize on that. You've got to come to a meeting of the minds and get on with it.''

HEADLINE: Co-Op's Old Crank Finds a Fresh Spirit

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
To live is to kvetch, to kvetch to live, for the cranky title character in ''Olive and the Bitter Herbs,'' the acidly funny but decidedly ramshackle new play by Charles Busch that opened on Tuesday night at the 59E59 Theaters in a Primary Stages production.
The neighbors next door are a veritable plague to Olive Fisher, portrayed as a venom-spewing gargoyle in a housecoat by Marcia Jean Kurtz. But then they may just be an improvement on the dreadful woman who used to thunder about upstairs, now dead, and good riddance. And that fancy new upgrade of the lobby? A scandal, according to Olive.
''This is an apartment house,'' she gripes. ''Not a Tuscan villa.'' 
Olive is an elderly actress whose best days are behind her, although she recently shot an episode of a police procedural, ''Manhattan Coroner,'' that's about to appear. Her minor fame rests on a decades-old series of sausage commercials that have lived on in the collective consciousness, much to her expressed irritation and secret pride.
Although her friend Wendy (Julie Halston) tries to nudge Olive into improving her shrunken life -- a little yoga, perhaps? -- she is content to marinate in her own bile. Her only source of entertainment is the guerrilla campaign she wages against assorted neighbors and the co-op board running the apartment building where she lives, the aggrieved last surviving renter in a sea of entitled owners. (The precisely observed set design by Anna Louizos describes her downgraded economic condition and middlebrow bohemian tastes to perfection.)
Olive is, in short, anything but a blithe spirit, which makes the arrival of a supernatural presence in her living room mirror an unusually unlikely occurrence. This spectral visitor remains unseen and unheard, his advent heralded only by the spooky sound of chimes and a pulsating neon glow. But Olive's intuition tells her his name is Howard, he used to live in Key West and he worked in real estate.
These mundane details strike oddly familiar notes not just with Olive and Wendy, but with Olive's neighbors, a somewhat fractious gay couple, Trey (Dan Butler) and Robert (David Garrison), whom Wendy invites over to visit Olive in the hopes that a simmering feud can be defused before it escalates. The spirit in the mirror proves to be an unlikely source of mutual fascination for Olive and in particular Trey, an unemployed children's book illustrator with a gin-dry wit to match Olive's, a taste for wine and too much time on his hands.
Mr. Busch is best known as a playwright for his series of inspired old-movie spoofs in which he also played the leading lady. His latest, the sublimely silly ''Divine Sister,'' closed in the spring after a healthy run Off Broadway.
Mr. Busch remains offstage in ''Olive and the Bitter Herbs,'' and I couldn't help wishing he'd make some sort of ectoplasmic cameo appearance as the mysterious Howard, who was known, after all, for a mean Phyllis Diller impersonation. (But Howard? Oy, what a dreary name for a ghost, as Olive might say.)
For despite regular seasonings of acerbically funny one-liners, ''Olive and the Bitter Herbs'' isn't a particularly satisfying play. Although it shares a lively sourpuss spirit with ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' another Buschless comedy by Mr. Busch about a woefully beset Manhattan Jewish woman, memorably played by Linda Lavin, it is nowhere near as cleverly constructed or cogently written.
A collective curiosity about the mysterious Howard provides a gossamer-thin pretext for the characters' continual assembling in Olive's apartment. The addition of a romantic subplot between Olive and Sylvan (Richard Masur), the father of Olive's nemesis on the co-op board, feels perfunctory.
Mr. Busch is perhaps equaled only by Paul Rudnick in his ability to churn out well-turned, archly funny zingers, but the play meanders from subject to subject as Mr. Busch works hard to shoehorn in the varied comic fodder for his target practice: the dullness of the Kips Bay neighborhood, the horror of Secret Santas, the ritual curiosities of the seder (hence the bitter herbs), the sexual curiosities of gay relationships, the ideological perversities of gay Republicans.
The cast members assembled by the director, Mark Brokaw, are excellent, but they tend to bang out their laugh lines as if hitting gongs. Many are quite funny -- there's a wicked Sondheim joke, and a good Kindle one too -- but the overall effect often feels mechanical and Neil Simonish, as does the play's jerry-built plot.
I can never get enough of Ms. Halston and was sorry not to get all that much of her here in her put-upon sidekick role. But she reaches a delightful histrionic pitch in her aria of emancipation when, in a fit of fatigued irritation, she vows to give up forever her part-time career as a do-gooding caretaker of elderly actresses.
''For at least the next 15 years,'' she rants, ''I never want to hear the phrase 'I'm getting a chill' or 'I feel the humidity in my bones.' ''
Mr. Garrison deftly sidesteps gay stereotype in his role as the ex-children's book editor Robert, the more even-minded of the couple next door. Mr. Butler enthusiastically embraces same in his more florid role as the sniping, wine-swilling Trey. Mr. Masur employs his teddy bearish quality to fine effect as the genial Sylvan, although it remains pretty preposterous that he would dote so warmly on a woman who greets his affectionate attentions with lines like, ''The cuddly Jewish grandpa shtick, I find it cloying.''
In fact, if anything in ''Olive and the Bitter Herbs'' actually cloys, it is Olive's own peevishness, strangely enough. Ms. Kurtz isn't really allowed to inflect the character with much in the way of humanizing vulnerability or warmth. Olive remains so reflexively and relentlessly bitchy, at least until the play's very last moments, that she is not really good company, even at her funniest, or, for that matter, convincingly human.
Mr. Busch whips up a dizzying batch of coincidental revelations to tie together the various loose ends in the play's plot, as one character after another recollects a fateful (or sexual) encounter with the late Howard. These spiraling stories are entertaining in their absurdity but don't provide a particularly coherent rationale for Howard's emergence from the afterlife as a spiritual guide for Olive et al. Then again, ghosts don't have to obey the demanding laws of satisfying dramaturgy, as we expect playwrights to.

HEADLINE: On Economy, Raw Data Gets A Grain of Salt

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the government announced in April that the economy had grown at a moderate annual pace of 1.8 percent in the first quarter, politicians and investors saw evidence that the nation was continuing its recovery from the depths of the financial crisis. The White House called the news ''encouraging'' and the stock market extended its bull run.
Three months later, the government announced a small change. The economy, it said, actually had expanded at a pace of only 0.4 percent in the first quarter.
Instead of chugging along in reasonable health, the United States had been hovering on the brink of a double-dip recession. 
How can such an important number change so drastically? The answer in this case is surprisingly simple: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, charged with crunching the numbers, concluded that it had underestimated the value of vehicles sitting at dealerships and the nation's spending on imported oil.
More broadly, politicians and investors are placing a great deal of weight on a crude and rough estimate that has never been particularly reliable.
''People want the best information that we have right now. But people need to understand that the best information that we have right now isn't necessarily very informative,'' said Tara M. Sinclair, an assistant professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. ''It's just the best information that we have.''
The growth rate that the government announces roughly one month after the end of each quarter -- news much anticipated in Washington and on Wall Street -- has been off the mark over the period from 1983 to 2009 by an average of 1.3 percentage points, compared with more fully analyzed figures released years later, according to federal data.
The second and third estimates, announced at subsequent one-month intervals, are no more reliable. The first quarter this year offers a typical example. The government estimated the annual growth rate at 1.8 percent in May and 1.9 percent in June before issuing its most recent estimate of 0.4 percent.
Perhaps more important, the government underestimated the depth of the recession by a wide margin, initially calculating that the economy contracted by an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 2008. It now estimates the contraction rate at 8.9 percent. Instead of an annual growth rate of 0.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2011, the government now estimates that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.2 percent during that period.
The basic problem is easy to understand: More than half of the ingredients in the first estimate are based in whole or in part on projections from past months. The government doesn't actually know how much people spend on their cellphone bills or how much companies spend on construction. It simply makes an educated guess based on past spending. Even in the third estimate, 22 percent of the data still comes from projections.
If basic assumptions start changing rapidly -- business failures during a recession, start-ups during a recovery -- the estimates can quickly lose touch with economic reality.
''When we most want timely information is when they're least able to give it to us,'' said Professor Sinclair. ''That's exactly when those historical patterns are breaking down.''
The Bureau of Economic Analysis, an arm of the Commerce Department, makes some efforts to warn users about these problems. It emphasizes transparency and is uncommonly open to public questions. It says it provides a valuable public service, but that the data reflects only the best available information. But policy makers, investors and the public continue to treat the data as highly significant.
''These are really not much more than educated guesses and yet the marketplace puts enormous weight on them because financial markets are high-frequency trading places based on immediate data,'' said Madeline Schnapp, director of macroeconomic research at TrimTabs Investment Research.
A growing number of economists say that the government should shift its approach to measuring growth. The current system emphasizes data on spending, but the bureau also collects data on income. In theory the two should match perfectly -- a penny spent is a penny earned by someone else. But estimates of the two measures can diverge widely, particularly in the short term, and a body of recent research suggests that the income estimates are more accurate.
Justin Wolfers, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, publicly predicted earlier this summer that the government would sharply reduce its estimate of first-quarter growth, simply by looking at the income estimate buried inside the bureau's initial release.
The income data also captured the depth of the recession much sooner.
''It is appalling how little attention we economists pay to measurement issues,'' Professor Wolfers said. ''The expenditure data looked bad but not dreadful. The income data was dreadful. And it subsequently turned out the absence of urgency among policy makers was largely a result of looking at faulty data.''
Professor Wolfers said that in his native Australia, the government estimates growth by averaging the two techniques with a third, related approach. Private firms use similar methods.
Officials at the bureau have said that measuring expenditures has proved to be a more reliable methodology. The estimates are very accurate in one important respect: it is exceedingly rare for the bureau to estimate that the economy is shrinking when it is actually growing, or that it is growing when it is actually shrinking. The bureau meets that standard 98 percent of the time.
What went wrong in the first quarter?
The largest change was because of an annual event. The Census Bureau completed an estimate of the value of vehicles awaiting sale in 2010, based on data collected directly from dealers.
Until July, the bureau had relied on an estimate from a private company, Ward's, which counts vehicles but estimates their values. Based on that data, the bureau estimated that inventories had declined by $30.3 billion in the fourth quarter as sales outpaced the arrival of new cars.
Last month, based on new data, it concluded that inventories fell by only $17.9 billion.
The bureau estimates that inventories shrank by an even smaller amount in the first quarter -- although it won't get equally accurate data until next July -- but the effect of the revision was to reduce the difference between the two quarters, and thus to reduce the rate of growth.
The bureau estimates that this change alone is responsible for nearly half the difference between its initial estimate of 1.8 percent first-quarter growth and its current 0.4 percent estimate.
A second major change involves the value of imported oil. The bureau announced a permanent change to its methodology last month to improve the way that it calculates the value of oil, and it concluded that spending on imported oil was higher than it had originally estimated. The details are byzantine but the result is clear enough: roughly 0.5 percentage points of growth vanished.

HEADLINE: Crashing the Tea Party

BYLINE: By DAVID E. CAMPBELL and ROBERT D. PUTNAM. 
David E. Campbell, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame, and Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard, are the authors of ''American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us.''

 BODY:
GIVEN how much sway the Tea Party has among Republicans in Congress and those seeking the Republican presidential nomination, one might think the Tea Party is redefining mainstream American politics.
But in fact the Tea Party is increasingly swimming against the tide of public opinion: among most Americans, even before the furor over the debt limit, its brand was becoming toxic. To embrace the Tea Party carries great political risk for Republicans, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.
Polls show that disapproval of the Tea Party is climbing. In April 2010, a New York Times/CBS News survey found that 18 percent of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of it, 21 percent had a favorable opinion and 46 percent had not heard enough. Now, 14 months later, Tea Party supporters have slipped to 20 percent, while their opponents have more than doubled, to 40 percent. 
Of course, politicians of all stripes are not faring well among the public these days. But in data we have recently collected, the Tea Party ranks lower than any of the 23 other groups we asked about -- lower than both Republicans and Democrats. It is even less popular than much maligned groups like ''atheists'' and ''Muslims.'' Interestingly, one group that approaches it in unpopularity is the Christian Right.
The strange thing is that over the last five years, Americans have moved in an economically conservative direction: they are more likely to favor smaller government, to oppose redistribution of income and to favor private charities over government to aid the poor. While none of these opinions are held by a majority of Americans, the trends would seem to favor the Tea Party. So why are its negatives so high? To find out, we need to examine what kinds of people actually support it.
Beginning in 2006 we interviewed a representative sample of 3,000 Americans as part of our continuing research into national political attitudes, and we returned to interview many of the same people again this summer. As a result, we can look at what people told us, long before there was a Tea Party, to predict who would become a Tea Party supporter five years later. We can also account for multiple influences simultaneously -- isolating the impact of one factor while holding others constant.
Our analysis casts doubt on the Tea Party's ''origin story.'' Early on, Tea Partiers were often described as nonpartisan political neophytes. Actually, the Tea Party's supporters today were highly partisan Republicans long before the Tea Party was born, and were more likely than others to have contacted government officials. In fact, past Republican affiliation is the single strongest predictor of Tea Party support today.
What's more, contrary to some accounts, the Tea Party is not a creature of the Great Recession. Many Americans have suffered in the last four years, but they are no more likely than anyone else to support the Tea Party. And while the public image of the Tea Party focuses on a desire to shrink government, concern over big government is hardly the only or even the most important predictor of Tea Party support among voters.
So what do Tea Partiers have in common? They are overwhelmingly white, but even compared to other white Republicans, they had a low regard for immigrants and blacks long before Barack Obama was president, and they still do.
More important, they were disproportionately social conservatives in 2006 -- opposing abortion, for example -- and still are today. Next to being a Republican, the strongest predictor of being a Tea Party supporter today was a desire, back in 2006, to see religion play a prominent role in politics. And Tea Partiers continue to hold these views: they seek ''deeply religious'' elected officials, approve of religious leaders' engaging in politics and want religion brought into political debates. The Tea Party's generals may say their overriding concern is a smaller government, but not their rank and file, who are more concerned about putting God in government.
This inclination among the Tea Party faithful to mix religion and politics explains their support for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Their appeal to Tea Partiers lies less in what they say about the budget or taxes, and more in their overt use of religious language and imagery, including Mrs. Bachmann's lengthy prayers at campaign stops and Mr. Perry's prayer rally in Houston.
Yet it is precisely this infusion of religion into politics that most Americans increasingly oppose. While over the last five years Americans have become slightly more conservative economically, they have swung even further in opposition to mingling religion and politics. It thus makes sense that the Tea Party ranks alongside the Christian Right in unpopularity.
On everything but the size of government, Tea Party supporters are increasingly out of step with most Americans, even many Republicans. Indeed, at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, today's Tea Party parallels the anti-Vietnam War movement which rallied behind George S. McGovern in 1972. The McGovernite activists brought energy, but also stridency, to the Democratic Party -- repelling moderate voters and damaging the Democratic brand for a generation. By embracing the Tea Party, Republicans risk repeating history.

HEADLINE: Accounting Board to Seek Comments on Rotating Auditors

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An accounting oversight board agreed on Tuesday to seek public comment on whether companies should be required to change their auditors every few years, a move that supporters say they believe would strengthen the independence and objectivity of accountants that inspect corporate ledgers for accuracy.
The regulatory body, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, voted unanimously to seek comment over the next four months on a concept known as mandatory audit firm rotation. The practice would limit the number of consecutive years that an accounting firm could audit the books of a publicly traded company. 
The proposal is the third significant measure that the accounting board, created in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has begun to examine in an effort to give investors greater certainty that auditors are in fact doing their job -- something that was not always clear after the 2008 financial crisis, the Enron collapse and other recent accounting failures.
''The reason to consider auditor term limits is that they may reduce the pressure auditors face to develop and protect long-term client relationships to the detriment of investors and our capital markets,'' said James R. Doty, the chairman of accounting oversight board and an advocate of the idea.
In part, he said, those pressures exist because of ''the fundamental conflict of the audit client paying the auditor,'' which could create incentives for the auditor to render a favorable, yet misleading, opinion.
Some other members of the five-person board voiced doubts about the concept, however, saying that the cost of getting new auditors up to speed on large companies every few years would burden both the company being audited and the accounting firms.
''I have serious doubts that mandatory rotation is a practical or cost-effective way of strengthening independence,'' said Daniel L. Goelzer, who is one of the board's two certified public accountants. While he recognizes the potential for auditor bias in favor of a client, Mr. Goelzer said, ''there are already powerful forces built into public company auditing to foster and maintain independence.''
The board has asked for comments on how to improve auditor independence to be submitted by Dec. 14. It also plans a public meeting to discuss the proposal in March. Any rule approved by the board also has to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission to take effect.
Mandatory audit firm rotation has been considered at various times since the 1970s. Most recently, in 2002, Congress considered including it in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, but decided instead to require a report on the topic by the General Accounting Office (now called the Government Accountability Office). The act did require auditors to rotate the partner in charge of a company's audit every five years.
The G.A.O. report, issued in 2003, found that ''mandatory audit firm rotation may not be the most efficient way to enhance auditor independence and audit quality.'' Firms also estimated that first-year auditing costs would rise by 20 percent as a new auditor got up to speed on a company.
But the report also said that the board would need to consider the results of its reviews of audits and auditing firms to determine whether more needed to be done, particularly in cases where a company had used the same auditor for decades.
Steven B. Harris, a member of the accounting oversight board, said the evidence showed that the Sarbanes-Oxley measures had failed to eliminate ''the strong incentives that lead some auditors to serve the interests of the company paying the bills rather than those of investors.''
Eight years of those reviews have revealed ''several hundred cases'' where ''the firm failed to fulfill its fundamental responsibility in the audit -- to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,'' according to the board's release.
In the most recent reporting cycle, ended last year, the board's inspectors ''have also identified more issues than in prior years.''
The board is seeking comments on whether mandatory audit rotation would enhance objectivity among auditors and make them better able to resist management pressure, and if so, what would be an appropriate term length.
Also of interest to the board is whether it might require rotation only for a subset of publicly traded companies, like the largest companies; whether there are enough qualified auditors to permit giant multinational companies to change regularly; and whether the practice would lead to opinion shopping.
Considering mandatory audit rotation is one of three changes in auditing practice that the board is considering. The other proposals also are still in the early stages. One of those, which has already finished its comment period, would require accounting firms to have the partner in charge of an audit sign the firm's report, much as a company's executives have to attest to its financial statements.
Another, on which comments are due Sept. 30, would expand the scope of the auditor's report, which now is little more than a boilerplate statement that the financial information fairly reflects the company's economic condition.

In 2001, Mr. Ross, the owner of Coney Island Bialys and Bagels, received an invitation to demonstrate authentic city baking at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington. Organizers supplied the mixer and an oven. Mr. Ross insisted on only one ingredient: New York City water.
''You can't make bialys without New York City water,'' said Mr. Ross, 51, who loaded six six-gallon jugs into his truck before the trip. ''It's just the taste.'' 
Next month, that taste will disappear from the streets of Brooklyn, 91 years after it arrived. A sagging economy and a changing neighborhood, Mr. Ross said, have left him no choice but to close his store, the borough's oldest bialy shop.
''All my family clientele are cutting back,'' he said. ''Now, people make coffee at home and have a Pop-Tart.''
The bialy, described in a cartoon on the store's register as the offspring of an onion bagel and an English muffin, arrived on American shores by way of Bialystok, Poland. So did Morris Rosenzweig, Mr. Ross's grandfather, who founded the business in 1920 as a wholesale operation in East New York, Brooklyn.
The company has remained in the family ever since, migrating to Coney Island Avenue in Sheepshead Bay in 1954. At age 8 and with his father, Don, now in charge, Mr. Ross was tasked with sweeping the bakery floor. By age 11, he had graduated to cash register duty, standing on a milk case to reach the buttons.
Bill Puetz, 59, who has known Mr. Ross since the two were boys, said the store was a remnant of an earlier time. Mr. Puetz is a partner at McGready's Auto Service, one of a handful of family businesses to share the block with the bialy shop for the past half-century. S & L Lumber Company, established in 1953, owes its second letter to Leo Wisel, whose sons are now co-owners. David's Glass Works, stationed on Coney Island Avenue since 1947, was founded by David Schoenfeld, father of current owner, Simon.
All recalled the scent of bialys wafting from their neighbor's oven - and the crowds these fragrances attracted from as far as Staten Island and New Jersey.
''There were lines, double-parked cars -- it was always busy,'' Mr. Schoenfeld said. ''It's like a family on the block, and these businesses keep dropping one by one.''
After The New York Post reported on the shop's plans to close last week, customers from across the city made pilgrimages to the site.
''This is a true, essential New York experience,'' said Bob Holman, proprietor of the Bowery Poetry Club, who visited the store for the first time on Friday. Consuming a bialy with whitefish, Mr. Holman noted the chewy, but dense, texture. The garlic and onion, he said, announced their presence just enough, without being overwhelming.
''I know from bagels, and I know from whitefish,'' he said, mulling a second order. ''This is the most delicious bialy I've ever seen.''
Newcomers to the neighborhood, Mr. Ross said, did not seem to agree. If they entered his store at all. According to the owner, many of the Russian immigrants who have moved into the area have not embraced his products.
''They're not buying what a traditional Jewish family was buying,'' he said.
Some local residents said the store likely suffered a business hit when a handful of Jewish families became upset that Mr. Ross chose to remain open on Passover in recent years. Mr. Ross said these families rarely shopped at Coney Island Bialys and Bagels anyway.
The store's perceived flirtations with non-kosher products - it created a stir many years ago for carrying a bagel sandwich with egg and a kosher bacon imitation - had already estranged the most observant Jews, he said.
Mr. Ross, a volunteer firefighter who lives in Manalapan, N.J., said he was not sure what he would do next. He says he hopes to keep the store open through the Jewish holidays this fall, but is unsure if he will be able to do so while still paying his vendors.
The owners of the block's neighboring businesses said they would miss the familiar sight of the bialy shop more than its contents. Mr. Wisel, an owner of the lumber business across the street, used to get his coffee from Mr. Ross's store every morning, but stopped recently.
''A co-worker brings coffee from Dunkin' Donuts now,'' he said, shrugging. ''It's better.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Albany, a Labor Pact Without Attacks on Unions

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- A day after the state's largest public-workers union agreed to accept wage and benefits concessions, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and labor leaders said the vote demonstrated that fiscally troubled states could cut work-force costs without attacking collective bargaining.
Members of the union, the Civil Service Employees Association, approved the contract 59 percent to 41 percent. The results of the vote were announced shortly before midnight on Monday. 
The contract, which union leaders and Mr. Cuomo had agreed to in June, includes significant cuts to wages and benefits and takes effect immediately. Mr. Cuomo told the unions that if they did not agree to help him reduce the cost of the state work force, he would have to fire as many as 9,800 workers.
Mr. Cuomo, in an interview Tuesday, contrasted his approach to labor negotiations with those of governors in other states. Mr. Cuomo said governors who have attacked collective bargaining and the cost of worker benefits had lost sight of the task at hand -- balancing budgets.
''I believed it could be done with the labor movement,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''as opposed to against the labor movement, or despite the labor movement.''
In his negotiations with the civil service union, which represents 66,000 state workers, Mr. Cuomo made significant demands. He ultimately won a three-year freeze on wages, followed by two years of 2 percent increases, and workers will pay more for their health insurance. But he also chose not to challenge collective bargaining rights or publicly attack the unions in the manner of other cost-cutting governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Chris Christie of New Jersey.
''They're saying, philosophically, the union and collective bargaining are bad, and we have to stop collective bargaining so we can reduce benefits and salaries,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
''Our point was, when the economy was going fine, you could pay a 3, 4, or 5 percent raise and you didn't have the philosophical debate,'' he added. ''So when the economy turned, they raised the philosophical question. I raised the economic question. In the end you may get to a point where you can't work out the economics, but first you have to deal with this as an economic issue.''
Richard W. Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell, said New York shared the same basic characteristic as other states where governors went to war with public unions -- namely, a budget to balance in the short term and large budget shortfalls projected over the longer term. He said the different approaches were determined by the governors' differing political ideologies.
''We had a governor who chose to respect the institution of collective bargaining and worked to negotiate a contract with the union that would address those problems,'' Professor Hurd said, ''and by all appearances, he has been successful with that.''
But Mr. Cuomo's strategy has not succeeded universally -- in Connecticut, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy negotiated wage concessions with labor leaders, but union members, using an approval process that was substantially more complicated than that in New York, then rejected the concessions, prompting a budget crisis in that state.
Denis M. Hughes, the president of the New York State AFL-CIO and the state's most prominent union leader, commended New York union members for approving a tough contract.
''At a time when collective bargaining is under attack all over the country,'' Mr. Hughes said, ''the C.S.E.A. vote demonstrates that collective bargaining can work for the common good.''
At a news conference on Tuesday, the president of the Civil Service Employees Association, Danny Donohue, said that given the state's finances, working with Mr. Cuomo was the only practical thing to do, and that union members were better off.
''Is it everything we wanted?'' Mr. Donohue said. ''Of course not. That's negotiations.'' But he added that, ultimately, Mr. Cuomo ''gave us what we needed to go to our members and say, 'We think we can live with this.' ''
The other major union of state workers, the 56,000-member Public Employees Federation, is scheduled to vote next month on a nearly identical contract.

HEADLINE: Industry Output Rose in July, Lifted by Auto Production

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's automakers rebounded in July to increase factory production by the most since the crisis in Japan. But builders broke ground on fewer single-family houses, leaving home construction at depressed levels. 
The mixed data suggest that the economy remains fragile but is not on the cusp of another recession.
Overall industrial production, which includes output by utilities, mines and factories, rose 0.9 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. That's the largest gain this year.
Factory output, the biggest component of industrial production, climbed 0.6 percent. It was the greatest increase since the March 11 earthquake in Japan disrupted supply chains and slowed production at some American auto plants.
The auto industry accounted for nearly all of the factory production gains. Motor vehicles and parts jumped 5.2 percent. Excluding that category, factory output grew only 0.2 percent.
Also driving industrial production higher was an unseasonably hot summer. That led more people to leave their air-conditioners running. Utility output jumped 2.8 percent, the most since December. Mining output also increased.
The strong rise in output ''suggests that the U.S. economy is not in a recession now, and it's a fairly encouraging sign that it won't slip into one, either,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.
Still, growth is likely to stay weak in the second half of the year; high unemployment and a dismal housing market will weigh on consumer spending, Mr. Dales said.
The Commerce Department said builders began work on a seasonally adjusted 604,000 homes last month, a 1.5 percent decrease from June. That's half the 1.2 million homes a year that economists say must be built to sustain a healthy housing market.
Single-family homes, which represent 70 percent of home construction, fell 5 percent. Apartment building rose more than 6 percent.
The industrial production report confirmed other data that show the United States economy strengthened at the start of the July-September quarter, after growing at a feeble annual rate of just 0.8 percent in the first half of the year.
Manufacturing had been one of the strongest sectors of the economy in the two years since the recession officially ended. It has weakened in recent months.
Economists had blamed the decline in part on temporary factors. The crisis in Japan caused a parts shortage for automakers and other manufacturers. High fuel prices left consumers with less money to spend on discretionary goods like appliances and furniture.
''The increase in manufacturing production suggests the economy is finally emerging from distortions posed by the Japanese production shutdowns, which wreaked havoc on the global manufacturing supply chain,'' said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Auto production will likely stay high this year.
Manufacturers are racing to replace inventories depleted by the Japan disruptions. That should also contribute to overall economic growth, said Michael Robinet, an auto industry analyst with IHS Automotive.
But housing is likely to keep dragging on the economy.
Just 413,000 homes are under construction, after accounting for seasonal factors. A decade ago, roughly 1.6 million homes were built.

HEADLINE: H.P.-Palm Deal Looks Wiser Now

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard's $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm last year suddenly looks smarter. Google's $12.5 billion deal to buy Motorola Mobility this week, and the earlier frenzied bidding for Nortel's patents, have revealed the riches in mobile computing intellectual property. And H.P. snatched one of the most important troves for a price that now looks cheap. Yet, it could be challenging for H.P. to cash in.
A big trove of patents allows the owner to demand royalties from rivals, prevent them from incorporating particular features or at least negotiate from a position of strength. On the simplistic metric of enterprise value per patent, H.P. paid about $750,000 for each of Palm's roughly 1,600, in line with what Apple, Microsoft and the others did for Nortel's collection. Google, meanwhile, paid slightly more than $550,000 for each of Motorola's 17,000-plus patents. 
But all patents aren't created equal. For a time, Palm's products dominated the market for personal digital assistants, precursors to today's smartphones. The company also later developed an innovative operating system for handsets.
So its patents sit in the mobile device sweet spot, whether related to displays, interfaces or other features. On average, those should be worth more than the wider range of Nortel's or Motorola's patents.
Also instructive is that Palm in its heyday appeared to enjoy needling Apple, though Apple was hesitant to take Palm to court. That suggests some important intellectual property leverage compared with, say, Motorola, a company Apple has sued. It's difficult to value patent portfolios but it seems likely the one H.P. apparently paid a full price for is now worth a good bit more.
Mark V. Hurd, the H.P. chief at the time, said he was buying Palm for its intellectual property, not its smartphone business. But H.P. has yet to reap much benefit. Its underwhelming tablet device is a case in point.
The operating system may yet gain traction, especially since H.P. has said it will bundle it with its computers and may license it out.
But even if H.P. ends up an also-ran to Apple and Google's Android, there's always the option of another patent auction.
High-Yield Hopes
It has been a while since high-yield bonds really lived up to their name. With markets volatile, typical American junk bonds are yielding more than 8 percent. That's tasty for investors starving on the Federal Reserve's zero-rate diet and paranoid about getting whipsawed in volatile equities.
Average risk premiums over Treasury yields for subinvestment grade credits fell as low as 4.5 percentage points in February when an economic recovery in the United States looked more assured and the European debt crisis averted. This spread is now 7.1 percentage points on average, for an American junk paper yield of more than 8.3 percent as of Aug. 15. That's tempting when five-year Treasuries yield less than 1 percent and the overall dividend yield on stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is around 2.2 percent.
Of course, junk bond yields have risen partly because investors have been withdrawing billions of dollars from risky corporate debt markets. Euro zone debt and slowing global economic growth are legitimate concerns. But traditional signposts for high-yield bonds suggest the sell-off has gone far enough to warrant another look.
The annual default rate, for one, is expected to end this year at just 1.5 percent. That's hardly recession territory. In 2009, it surpassed 10 percent. A prolonged closing of credit markets would trip up some overleveraged companies. But the extensive amount of refinancing over the past two years means even CCC-rated companies don't face large sums of maturing debt in the near term.
Only $5.3 billion of debt from such issuers will mature by the end of 2012, according to Fitch Ratings. At the end of 2008, roughly five times more was scheduled to be repaid over a comparable period.
There also isn't a big backlog of leveraged debt deals to tax investor demand. Bankers estimate as much as $40 billion of buyout-related debt is in the pipeline. When credit markets shut down in 2007, the figure peaked at nearly $500 billion.
Rising trouble in Europe could push prices still lower and yields higher. But with investors potentially stuck with the thin gruel of low official interest rates for a long time, high-yield bonds are once again looking almost nutritious.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall As Anxiety Over Europe Holds Sway

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Nicola Clark and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Financial stocks led an overall market decline on Wall Street on Tuesday after a meeting between the leaders of Germany and France to try to address the widening crisis in the euro zone.
The meeting brought to the forefront one of the main concerns of investors, who were also reacting to new euro zone data that raised concerns about unsteady global economic growth.
As attention shifted to the meeting in Paris between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the euro zone's two largest economies, investors waited to hear how the leaders would address the threat posed by low growth and unstable public finances in some euro member nations. Fears have recently also surfaced over France. 
Both leaders flatly rejected an idea that has recently gained currency among more economists: the creation of new government bonds backed by all the nations of the euro zone.
Mr. Sarkozy said he would not rule out euro bonds at some point in the future, but said greater coordination of economic policy among euro zone members was a necessary first step.
At the close, the American markets had shaved off some of the gains built up over the last three trading sessions that had propelled them to recover from losses in the wake of the Standard & Poor's Aug. 5 downgrade of America's long-term credit rating. The S.& P. 500-stock index was down nearly 1 percent or 11.73 points, at 1,192.76. The Dow, which was up 1.1 percent on Monday, declined by 0.67 percent, or 76.97 points, to 11,405.93, while the Nasdaq was lower by 1.24 percent or 31.75 points, at 2,523.45.
''It's Europe now; the focus has shifted,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist for Cetera Financial Group. ''I think it is not so much there is any bad news, but it is a continuation of the policy instability.''
''I don't think it is anything specific,'' he added. ''Just a lack of what is viewed as progress to medium-term solutions.''
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital, said that he believed the declines in the stock market had been set off by the remarks on euro bonds especially.
''The deceleration that we saw is disappointment, Sarkozy shooting down the idea of the euro bonds, and that I think is disappointing the market at this time,'' Mr. Cardillo said.
But he added: ''We are not seeing real panic in the market, and the fact that we opened up lower may have been more due to a technical reaction after three strong days of gains. Volatility is going to accompany this market for some time to come, but I think the market is going to discount the worst-case scenarios.''
Analysts said concerns over the economy in the euro zone and in the United States had weighed on trading, a negative tone only worsened by the downgrade.
Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to Eurostat, the union's statistics agency. Euro area growth was down from 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
Adrian Cronje, chief investment officer of Balentine, said that the markets needed to hear a forceful message that the troubles in the euro zone went beyond the sovereign debt crisis.
''What markets are sensing and are worrying about is that the resolution to the European debt crisis is going to be a timid, untimely and inconsistent response,'' Mr. Cronje said. ''Taxing financial transactions and playing with time is not facing up to the real issue,'' he added.
Financials and energy stocks were both down by more than 1 percent. Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were each down by more than 4 percent. Among individual stocks, Wal-Mart was up $1.94 at $51.92 after reporting a 5.7 percent increase in quarterly profit. Home Depot, which reported an increase of 14 percent in quarterly profit and raised its outlook for full-year income, was up $1.59, at $33.05.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 24/32 to 99 4/32, and the yield fell to 2.23 percent, from 2.31 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Romney View of Perry: Just Another Opponent

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
LITTLETON, N.H. -- Gov. Rick Perry has plans to eat his way through Mitt Romney's New Hampshire backyard this week -- a politics and eggs breakfast in Bedford on Wednesday, a coffee meet-and-greet in Portsmouth and a lunch in Dover on Thursday, as well as two tours of local businesses. Yet to watch Mr. Romney, who on the campaign trail brushed off several opportunities to directly challenge Mr. Perry, the Texas governor could not be further from his mind.
''We're going to shorten this president's term and let him only serve four years,'' Mr. Romney said at the Littleton Diner, keeping his ire directed squarely on President Obama. ''Two years has been long enough.'' 
Mr. Perry, who entered the race Saturday to tremendous fanfare and buzz, presenting himself as a passionate alternative to the current slate of candidates, wasted little time in taking on Mr. Romney, who many polls agree is the front-runner in the Republican field. Now, with Mr. Romney's perch atop that field possibly threatened, the Romney camp insists that it is not changing strategy, and that Mr. Perry is just another candidate, and one they will not be directly engaging until absolutely necessary.
''Candidates have come and gone,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney adviser, ''and through it all Mitt Romney has kept his focus on Barack Obama and his failures on the economy. That's the race we'll continue to run.''
While Mr. Perry has proved a formidable campaigner over the years, having yet to lose an election, aides to Mr. Romney note that he has never competed on the national stage, and they view the race at this stage as a golf game rather than a tennis match: instead of having to take on Mr. Perry, volley by volley, they believe that Mr. Perry must first prove himself against the long course, a la golf.
And they are quick to point out, as Mr. Romney did at a campaign stop in Litchfield on Monday, that there are three debates in September alone that Mr. Perry must navigate.
''He'll get a chance to be heard,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We'll have a lot of debates, and we'll see where it goes.''
To that end, the Romney camp has shied from engaging Mr. Perry, and his first days on the trail suggest some merit to that strategy, as the Texas governor was sharply criticized on Tuesday by other Republicans for suggesting treasonous actions by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The Romney campaign has tried to stay on message, with campaign stops where the news is that there is no news, where the message is jobs-jobs-economy-jobs, and where the main opponent seems to be President Obama, with sporadic comparisons to Jimmy Carter thrown in.
''We have unemployment which is higher than during the Jimmy Carter years; we have more people out of work than during the Jimmy Carter years,'' Mr. Romney said Monday at New England Small Tubes in Litchfield. ''I'm running for office because I believe that having spent my life in the private sector, meaning in business, that I understand what it takes to get business going again.''
Mr. Romney never voluntarily brings up Mr. Perry and, if pressed, offers casual praise. After all, publicly attacking Mr. Perry could simply elevate the Texas governor.
''Rick Perry's now getting in -- good guy, good governor,'' Mr. Romney said at a briefing Monday. ''So I wish Rick the very best, and as the process goes on, we'll see whose background and skill most fits the needs of the country at a critical time like this.''
But the Perry candidacy does present a threat to Mr. Romney, if only because the latter's perch atop polls may not reflect electoral reality. Mr. Romney largely skipped campaigning in Iowa and came in far behind in the Ames Straw Poll after not competing, and the map of nominating contests, with the South Carolina primary most likely coming soon after the New Hampshire contest, could pose a challenge.
The day after Mr. Perry declared his candidacy, The Boston Herald ran a large front-page headline, ''Mitt's Worst Nightmare'' -- a sentiment Republican strategists have expressed about Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor. And in an essay for The Daily Beast, Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, described Mr. Perry as a candidate who will say or do anything to win and concluded, ''Watch your back, Mitt.''
Many Republicans say they are watching to see how Mr. Perry performs before declaring their allegiance. But Republican strategists say a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses by Mr. Perry could help him compete with Mr. Romney there.
So, can Mr. Romney continue to ignore Mr. Perry?
''He can until he can't,'' said Jim Dyke, a Republican strategist.
Earlier in the race, the Romney campaign was expecting to have to take on former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, but his campaign fizzled. It is hoping for similar luck with Mr. Perry; Romney staff members suspect that Representative Michele Bachmann's campaign, and maybe even former President George W. Bush's supporters will help them on that front -- just as Bush allies did on Tuesday with some of the sharpest critiques of Mr. Perry's remarks on Mr. Bernanke.
Mr. Romney and his team also learned from his 2008 presidential run. Then, to get into the national conversation, Mr. Romney scuffled with everyone from Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Senator John McCain of Arizona to former Senator Fred Thompson of ''Law & Order'' fame.
Now, they insist they are paying less attention to the daily news cycle, recalling how Mr. Romney finally hit his stride talking about jobs and the economy in the lead-up to the Michigan primary, which he won.
While it is still up in the air how Mr. Perry's candidacy will affect Mr. Romney, some Republicans say that the final result will be good for the party no matter what.
''There's no question that with Perry getting into the race, whether it's Perry or Romney, we will have a better nominee,'' Mr. Dyke said. ''Barack Obama, without Hillary Clinton, would have been a completely different nominee.''

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Bloomberg's Approval Rating the Lowest in 6 Years

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's job approval rating among New Yorkers has hit its lowest point in six years, with residents conveying widespread anxieties about the city's economic prospects, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
Nearly 70 percent of city residents characterize the economy as being bad. And New Yorkers are chiefly interested in jobs and low-priced goods, even at the expense of neighborhood stores. Residents of the Bronx, for example, favor Wal-Mart's long-frustrated efforts to establish a store in the city; 79 percent liked the idea. 
According to the poll, 45 percent of New Yorkers approve of Mr. Bloomberg's performance, down nine points since the last Times poll, in October 2010.
Forty-three percent of New Yorkers disapprove of the mayor's performance.
Mr. Bloomberg's job approval rating was 43 percent in February 2005.
Martin Lacewell, a poll respondent, said in an follow-up interview, ''I think Bloomberg has been in there too long and has lost touch with the changing times.''
''People are losing jobs and can't afford some of the new policies put in place, like raising parking tickets,'' added Mr. Lacewell, 42, a child care specialist who lives in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
The poll numbers suggest that Mr. Bloomberg is significantly less popular than the state's other leading political figure, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has enjoyed high ratings in several polls during his first year. But the mayor is held in higher esteem than many elected officials across the country, who have watched their approval ratings nose-dive.
Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent who is approaching the midway point of his third and final term, is most well-liked by white New Yorkers and by residents in Manhattan; he is less popular with African-Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Bloomberg appears to be recovering from a difficult winter, when other polls found his approval ratings to be even lower in the wake of the city's lackluster response to a blizzard in late December, his selection of Cathleen P. Black as schools chancellor and alleged corruption in the administration's CityTime payroll project.
In response to the poll results, the mayor's spokesman, Stu Loeser, said, ''Despite a failing national economy, the mayor's numbers have improved from his post-snow lows because he is successfully managing this city by helping to keep crime low, create jobs and improve test scores.''
In follow-up interviews, many poll respondents did not blame the mayor for the economic doldrums. Indeed, New Yorkers are not as glum about the economy as the rest of the country; in a Times/CBS News poll earlier this month, 86 percent of Americans described the national economy as bad.
When asked whether New York would be a better place to live in 15 years, residents were split. Most New Yorkers with annual household incomes of more than $100,000 and those with post-graduate degrees said they believed that the city was headed in the right direction. But 54 percent of those queried said that ''things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track.''
''It's been a very difficult period of time economically in New York, but it's all relative,'' said Dawn Lester, 39, an Upper West Side resident who works in the advertising business. ''I don't know where we would be if we had a career politician as mayor, but I feel we are in a better place than we would be had it not been for him.''
Other respondents expressed an ambivalence about the mayor.
''I think sometimes he says stupid things,'' said Anne Slamka, 53, a saleswoman who lives in Brooklyn Heights. ''I wasn't crazy about the way he pulled off an additional term. But I'm glad he did because I think the alternative would have been worse than what we're dealing with now as far as the economy and other issues go. I know he won't pull that off again, and that makes me wonder what the next mayor will be like.''
New Yorkers seemed less concerned about the mayor's propensity for vacationing far from town. Asked whether they supported legislation requiring Mr. Bloomberg -- a billionaire who has been known to jet off to Bermuda and other locales -- and his successors to disclose when they travel more than 250 miles outside the city, 49 percent of New Yorkers polled said such a law was unnecessary.
The citywide telephone poll was conducted Aug. 9 through Aug. 15 with 1,027 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
For all of the unhappiness about the city's leadership, though, most residents would still rather live here than anywhere else. Residents of Manhattan and older New Yorkers were more likely to say that, looking ahead four years, they would want to remain New Yorkers; parents of young children and African-Americans were inclined to say they would rather live outside New York City.

HEADLINE: Perry Stands By Remarks on Fed Policy and Treason

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JACKIE CALMES; Jeff Zeleny reported from Dubuque, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
DUBUQUE, Iowa -- Gov. Rick Perry did not back down on Tuesday, but he did not repeat his suggestion that the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve were potentially ''treasonous'' and could warrant ''ugly'' treatment should the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, ever pay a visit to Texas.
''Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous -- or treasonous in my opinion,'' Mr. Perry said Monday, taking a voter's question about the Fed and criticizing the possibility of the central bank's taking further steps between now and the election to keep interest rates low. 
He added, ''I don't know what y'all would do to him in Iowa, but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas.''
The comments came at the end of a freewheeling and unscripted day of introducing himself to voters and highlighted Mr. Perry's penchant for provocative, hard-edged campaigning of the sort that speaks to certain conservatives even as it raises hackles elsewhere. A video of the remarks quickly circulated, prompting a round of recriminations not just from Democrats but from some Republicans -- a reminder of the old tensions between Mr. Perry and top advisers to former President George W. Bush.
Karl Rove, a longtime adviser to Mr. Bush went on Fox News to declare, ''You don't accuse the chairman of the Federal Reserve of being a traitor to his country, of being guilty of treason and suggesting that we treat him pretty ugly in Texas.''
Lawrence H. Summers, who was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and a top economic adviser to President Obama, said, ''This may be the least responsible statement in the modern history of president politics.''
''While there is room for sharp debate over many economic issues,'' Mr. Summers said, ''the economic thinking is primitive, the mention of treason is outrageous and the intimation of violence is abhorrent.''
The dust-up underscored the challenge facing Mr. Perry as he makes the transition from Texas governor to presidential candidate, where every phrase is parsed and ripe for criticism.
''Look, I'm just passionate about the issue,'' Mr. Perry said, as aides hustled him away from a lunch with business leaders in Dubuque. ''We stand by what we said.''
Mr. Perry did not directly name Mr. Bernanke, who was first appointed by Mr. Bush and reappointed by Mr. Obama, but he left no doubt that he was aiming his criticism squarely at him. He did not repeat his comments on Tuesday, but he renewed his assertion that the government should ''stop printing the money that's devaluing our dollars.''
The president, on the second day of a Midwestern bus tour, passed on the chance to criticize Mr. Perry, telling Wolf Blitzer of CNN: ''I'll cut him some slack. He's only been at it for a few days now.''
''I think that everybody who runs for president, it probably takes them a little bit of time before they start realizing that this isn't like running for governor or running for senator or running for Congress,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And you've got to be a little more careful about what you say.''
While advisers to Mr. Perry sought to brush aside the matter, a new air of discipline surrounded him on Tuesday. As he visited a roofing company in Cedar Rapids and a business luncheon in Dubuque, he kept his criticism confined to Mr. Obama's handling of the economy.
''Americans are tired of the overspending,'' Mr. Perry said. ''They are tired of the unpredictability in the business world. Just having a principled individual in the White House, from the standpoint of spending, would be a powerful message.''
In attacking the Fed, Mr. Perry was repeating a sentiment often heard by Tea Party activists and other conservatives worried about a permanent weakening of the American currency. Among them is another Texas Republican running for president, Representative Ron Paul.
At issue is the Fed's policy of ''quantitative easing.'' With interest rates -- its usual means of steering the economy -- already near zero, the Fed has resorted to an extraordinary effort since December 2008 of buying a huge portfolio of Treasury bonds and crediting money to the reserves of banks to encourage more lending at low interest rates.
Vincent Reinhart, an economist and former director of the monetary affairs division of the Federal Reserve Board, said Mr. Perry's comments highlighted the challenging position for the Fed. Mr. Reinhart said conservatives blame the Fed for facilitating federal deficits, ''tapping into the voting public's anger at deficits and debt.''
''Calling it treasonous,'' he said by e-mail, ''must be an appeal to the extreme segment of that view.''

HEADLINE: Obama Presses His Case in Crucial Iowa, but Perry Is Close on His Heels

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
PEOSTA, Iowa -- President Obama pulled up to a bucolic community college here in his $1.1 million black armored bus on Tuesday and spent much of the day closeted in a conference with farmers and small-business owners, hoping to sell them on his message that he could revive the listless job market.
Eleven miles away, a more colorful, less-fortified campaign bus deposited Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, the newest Republican presidential candidate, in Dubuque, where he told another audience of business leaders over lunch, ''I guess we've kind of got competing job tours, if you want to know the truth of the matter.'' 
The governor was quick to contrast his style with that of the president.
''His approach is to study these things,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We know what the problem is. We're being overtaxed, overregulated and over-litigated.''
Earlier, he said he wanted to restore military respect for the commander in chief.
Mr. Obama brushed off the remarks in an interview with CNN as beginner's errors. But the spectacle of a beleaguered president and a swaggering new rival circling each other in the cornfields of Iowa vividly illustrated the contours of 2012 election. And it may signal battles to come, as Mr. Obama fights to hold on to the region that put him on a path to victory in 2008.
The president faces a new, more challenging political and economic landscape in the Midwestern states that formed an early and deep core of support during his primary and general election campaigns. Unemployment has increased across the region, while his approval ratings in Iowa have sagged to below 50 percent.
In Peosta, on the second day of the three-day bus tour of Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, Mr. Obama defended his economic record and fired back at Republicans in Congress. He said they had stymied his efforts to revive the economy by refusing to put ''country ahead of party.''
''I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, independent, if you're not registered with any party,'' he said before the conference. ''I need your help sending a message to Congress that it's time to put the politics aside and get something done.''
The visit by Mr. Perry to this patch of northeast Iowa -- terrain that is often more fertile for Democrats -- may have represented a bit of gamesmanship by the governor, who is seeking a bold start to his own campaign. But it was also a reminder of the president's changed political fortunes.
''We don't have to settle for our current circumstances,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We have the power to change that.''
The president has no nominating battle of his own to worry about, though his advisers are closely following the Republican debate under way here. For months, the party's candidates have delivered a relentless day-by-day pounding of Mr. Obama, and his trip was intended to counterbalance that message.
The swath of the Midwest that Mr. Obama has visited in the last week -- he went to Michigan last week -- are four states that he easily won in 2008. But his popularity has flagged there, while Republican confidence has swelled after the party's midterm election gains last year in local, state and federal offices.
If the president is fighting hard to hold these states next year, Democratic analysts here say, his bid for re-election could be significantly complicated and the race would represent more of a traditional battleground map, rather than the expanded set of states that propelled him to victory .
Mr. Obama's senior aides insist that as difficult a situation as Mr. Obama faces, the Republican Party is in worse shape, with high disapproval ratings in the region. The White House scheduled the bus tour on the heels of the biggest burst of activity yet in the Republican campaign, with a televised debate last week, and both the Iowa straw poll and the addition of Mr. Perry to the race on Saturday.
''The administration tells us we're in a recovery,'' Mr. Perry said as his bus stopped at a roofing company in Cedar Rapids and a truck stop in Walcott, in addition to Dubuque. ''It sure doesn't feel like a recovery.''
Mr. Obama acknowledged that the economy continues to sputter, but he blamed bad luck compounded by political dysfunction in Washington. As part of the White House-sponsored rural economic forum, he announced initiatives to help lift rural areas, like doubling government investment in small businesses and increasing job search and training programs for people in rural areas.
The president said his administration was trying to make agriculture an economic driver, speaking earnestly of cattle grazing next to fields of solar panels and crops used in biofuels. He drew laughter when he praised a former state senator ''who's helping farms manage manure in creative ways.''
With no grand plans to offer, Mr. Obama is framing the race not as a referendum on his record but as a choice between competing visions for the country -- ''big and bold and generous,'' he said, or ''cramped'' and one that ''believes in a winner-take-all economy in which everyone else is left out in the cold.''
As the two men campaigned near each other, White House aides were not above their own digs at Mr. Perry, including his threat in 2009 that Texas might leave the United States.
''We should be able to disagree on important issues without questioning each other's patriotism,'' said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney. ''We may disagree with our political opponents, but we certainly believe they are all patriots, even those who wanted to secede from the union.''

HEADLINE: In Mobile Takeover Talks, RIM Resurfaces as Target

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA - Ever since the introduction of its first BlackBerry more than a decade ago, Research in Motion has defied expectations that it would be gobbled up by a larger rival and has effectively created the market for smartphones.
But as Google moves to buy Motorola Mobility, RIM, already under pressure from diminished prospects and declining market share, is once again the subject of takeover talk.
Since the Motorola acquisition was announced on Monday, shares of RIM, which have suffered for much of the year, have shot up more than 10 percent, mainly on speculation of a sale. 
''For a long while the market cap of RIM prevented any kind of takeover,'' said Adam Leach, a London-based analyst with Ovum. ''I'm certainly not writing them off now, but they have got a tough job.''
Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman for RIM, said the company does not ''comment on rumors and speculation.''
The Motorola deal, which has the potential to shake up the mobile industry, comes at a difficult time for RIM.
After pioneering wireless e-mail, RIM has slowly ceded control to Apple's iPhone and to handsets that run on Google's Android operating system. The current lineup of BlackBerrys relies on technology that dates back to the first models of the smartphone.
RIM has moved to spruce up its technology. In 2010, the company bought QNX Software Systems of Ottawa and the Astonishing Tribe, a Swedish user interface design house, to recreate the BlackBerry platform.
But the results have been disappointing so far. The BlackBerry Playbook received a weak reception this spring when it lacked important features like an integrated e-mail application. Last week, Sprint dropped plans to offer a forthcoming model of the tablet computer that would have connected to the carrier's network.
RIM does not seem in a rush to introduce new Blackberry phones based on the QNX software, either. The models will not be available until later next year, and the company is offering no further specifics.
Still, RIM has plenty to offer suitors. Despite reducing financial forecasts, the company remains firmly profitable. In the latest quarter, the handset manufacturer reported net income of $695 million, down from $769 million in the quarter a year ago.
BlackBerry, too, remains a valuable brand, even as its market share declines.
It is the device of choice for corporate customers in important industries like financial services and law enforcement, which depend on the unique features of the BlackBerry to safeguard their e-mail. The security stems from RIM's proprietary global network, a system that is hard to duplicate and also generates recurring revenue for the company.
While analysts have speculated in the past that Microsoft could be interested in BlackBerry, that seems less likely in light of the Motorola acquisition, said Al Hilwa, an analyst with IDC in Seattle. If some handset makers that use Google's Android system switch to Windows Mobile Phone 7, Microsoft's mobile technology, then a perpetual also-ran could become a serious competitor. In that case, a deal for BlackBerry would be less necessary.
''Microsoft is the party that stands the best to gain out of this,'' said Mr. Leach.
A more likely buyer, said Mr. Hilwa, would be a large software company that, like Google, sees wireless as an important component in its future growth.
Alternatively, a cash-rich Chinese handset maker like ZTE or Huawei could view RIM as a way to expand beyond generic, low-profit phones.
Another possibility, if more remote, is the prospect of a better-known Asian manufacturer such as Samsung or HTC buying RIM to distinguish its products from the Android and Windows Phone competition.
A deal for RIM, though, faces significant hurdles.
For one, RIM's co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, are the company's largest shareholders. Neither seems interested in losing control. And they will not readily back down from a fight, as the executives demonstrated during a protracted patent battle several years ago that the company eventually lost.
The Canadian government, which must approve any takeover, has also been reluctant to sign off on deals for companies it views as strategic assets. Last year, the country's regulators blocked the purchase of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan by BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company. Politicians and commentators have portrayed an acquisition of RIM as an economic doomsday outcome for Canada.
But while a takeover seemed unthinkable during previous debates, the prospects for a RIM deal may be less distant in the current environment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Now, Germany Flies Above Economic Storm

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- There is no one whose thoughts European officials would rather read than Chancellor Angela Merkel, who meets Tuesday at the Elysee Palace with France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, as they struggle to find a lasting solution to the European debt crisis.
The most common critique of Mrs. Merkel is that she lacks the necessary sense of urgency to restore confidence in the euro and calm the crisis. But a stroll through summertime Berlin makes clear why she remains so cool-headed. While the latest official figures on Tuesday showed German economic growth almost stalling in the second quarter, slowing growth across the euro zone, the streets are quiet and the cafes are full. Deeply tanned residents are returning to their jobs after vacations in fiscally compromised nations, like Greece and Portugal. 
Germany may be the only European nation that is large enough and rich enough to cover the debts of its struggling neighbors, but its citizens are reluctant to be the source of the bailout. Germany is in many ways in the eye of the storm, with barely a hint of the winds swirling nearby. There is no tear gas, as in Athens; no tires burning, as in London; no chanting crowds packing public squares, as in Spain. While much of the rest of Europe is struggling to pass harsh austerity packages, Germany is in the midst of a debate over cutting taxes by as much as $14.2 billion.
''It's as if there's this black cloud floating overhead but nothing has fallen on us,'' said Markus Ponick, 38, a teacher in Berlin, who on Monday was strolling down a tree-lined stretch of Bleibtreustrasse with a cup of coffee in his hand. The government had made cuts, Mr. Ponick said, but they had been ''cleverly chosen'' to spare the public pain. ''The effects of this crisis are imperceptible here,'' he said.
The only major protests to strike Germany have been over tearing down an old train station in Stuttgart or calling for the end of nuclear power. Animal rights and affordable Internet, rather than jobs and spending cuts, are more likely to cause people to take to the streets right now, and even then not in terribly great numbers.
The simplest explanation is jobs.
By one government measure, 706,000 more Germans were employed in May of this year than the year before, of which 415,000 were full-time positions and 289,000 part time. In terms of relative size, that would be roughly comparable in the United States to nearly 2.7 million more people with jobs in 2011 versus 2010.
With strong unions and legal protections for workers, Germany's labor market for years was compared unfavorably with the more flexible American one. Even after embarking on painful reforms, it suffered from high structural unemployment. In July, German unemployment was 7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent in the United States.
As Germany's population shrinks, some economists and policy makers are more concerned about a shortage of qualified workers than joblessness.
As for the young, the unemployment rate is the third lowest in Europe, behind only the Netherlands and Austria. Only 9.1 percent of people between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed here, less than half the 20.5 percent average in Europe.
''I wouldn't protest because I'm very content with my situation,'' said Kristina Kuhn, 21, a student out shopping on the upscale Kurfurstendamm boulevard on Monday afternoon. ''Young people can study, find jobs on the side and have opportunities for careers.''
A recent report in the daily newspaper Bild said that government experts expect the job boom to continue for another four years. In a survey of 1,800 Germans prepared for the business magazine WirtschaftsWoche by the Allensbach Institute for Public Opinion Research, a majority spoke of an era of increased insecurity, but a full 53 percent said they were optimistic about the next 12 months. Only 12 percent were pessimistic.
''They hear it on the news but for most Germans what they experience in their lives is completely different. The crisis is virtual,'' said Renate Kocher, the institute's director. ''What's decisive for most people is their own situation and for many people that has improved noticeably in the past three or four years.''
Still, for a country reliant on exports for growth, the possible slowdown in the global economy could have drastic and fairly sudden repercussions. No one can predict how the inward-looking Germans would react if things get worse here, as would happen if there were less of a market for their exports, but if the past is any guide, Ms. Kocher said, they are likely to be even stingier toward their neighbors and even less inclined toward the European Union in general.
In France, the second-largest economy in the European Union after Germany and that country's largest trading partner, consumer spending fell 0.7 percent in the second quarter, and growth was flat. Industrial production for the entire 17-nation euro area fell 0.7 percent in June.
''Germany is very dependent on its export markets and very dependent on world growth,'' said Stefan Bach, an economic researcher at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''But for now the job market continues to develop strongly in contrast to many other European countries.''
It was not clear how long that assessment would hold. According to Germany's state statistical agency on Tuesday, the economy expanded by only 0.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter -- an unsettling omen for the broader European economy that left the continent's stock markets edgy. The slowdown was caused by weak consumer spending and lagging investment in construction projects, the agency said.
In some ways Germany has already been down the bumpy road toward economic restructuring its European partners now find themselves on. Its competitiveness came at a cost. Under the government of Gerhard Schroder, Mrs. Merkel's predecessor, large-scale protests broke out in response to difficult labor-market reforms, including making it easier to fire workers. German workers suffered through offshoring and layoffs, and even many who kept their jobs saw years of stagnant wages. But now, from the looks of things, the pain has paid off.
Germany's strength is not an anomaly but rather evidence of how the euro plays to its advantage. Now that less efficient economies like Greece and Portugal are locked into using the same currency, and cannot devalue to make their products more competitive in terms of price, Germany can keep selling to them.
As a result, Mrs. Merkel is under increasing pressure from abroad to buoy the weaker states, facing accusations that she is risking the financial stability of the bloc and with it the world by endorsing only half-measures. At home, she faces sharp criticism for inching closer to what critics here call a transfer union, sending German funds to wastrel neighbors.
The struggles and sorrows of their fellow Europeans are all over the nightly news. Yet so far, German trust in the euro appears steady. A survey of 2,366 people conducted by the Enmid polling institute in early August and published in Sunday's Bild found that 65 percent of Germans expect the euro to still be there in 2021, versus 31 percent who do not.
Ms. Kocher from the Allensbach Institute said that one result from the survey had truly surprised her. Of those questioned, 52 percent said they felt empathy for the protesters in Greece, while 39 percent said they did not.
''You always hear in the media and even in private discussions that Germans have no sympathy for the Greeks,'' Ms. Kocher said. ''But people remember the difficult transition they went through in the last decade, and they know it isn't easy.''

HEADLINE: Syrian Enclave Of Palestinians Nearly Deserted After Assault

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID and ISABEL KERSHNER; Anthony Shadid reported from Beirut, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- United Nations officials said Tuesday that as many as 10,000 residents of a Palestinian refugee neighborhood in the Syrian port city of Latakia had fled during a four-day assault, as security forces carried out more arrests and intimidation in what residents said was a government attempt to rebuild a wall of fear in one of Syria's largest cities.
Latakia, on the country's Mediterranean coast, is the third locale to bear the full brunt of military and security forces this month, though the government has also persisted in its crackdown on the suburbs of Damascus and Homs, the third-largest city. The violence has provoked international condemnations that have grown sharper, but still stopped short of demanding that President Bashar al-Assad step down. 
On Tuesday in Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said it was more effective to forge international consensus against Mr. Assad -- as well as intensify economic pressure through sanctions -- than for the United States alone to lead the way.
''It's not going to be any news if the United States says Assad needs to go,'' Mrs. Clinton said at the National Defense University. ''O.K., fine, what's next? If Turkey says it, if King Abdullah says it, if other people say it, there is no way the Assad regime can ignore it.''
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which assists Palestinian refugees, said that it had no information on the whereabouts of the Latakia Palestinians. Activists have said many of the displaced have left for the countryside or Aleppo, Syrian's second-largest city, to the northeast.
''A forgotten population has now become a disappeared population,'' said Christopher Gunness, spokesman for the agency in Jerusalem, calling the situation ''very, very worrying.''
The refugee neighborhood, Raml, was set up after 1948, when Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes during the fighting at the creation of Israel. It grew into one of the city's largest neighborhoods, drawing poor job-seekers, but it still lacks some basic services. Demonstrations have erupted there and nearby since the country's uprising began in March, and activists there insisted that the crackdown would fail to quell the spirit of dissent.
''The residents in Raml will rally the same day the army pulls out,'' said one, Ahmed Bogdash. ''They are poor and they have nothing to lose.''
Mr. Gunness said forces had directed heavy fire into the neighborhood and that Syrian security officials had told some of the residents to leave, suggesting an impending military operation. By Tuesday, Raml was ''all but deserted,'' he added, citing latest reports from what he described as a broad range of reliable sources. The Syrian authorities have so far refused the refugee agency access to Raml, he said, leading to fears that some wounded or elderly residents could be stranded.
The reports from Latakia made headlines in Palestinian newspapers in the West Bank on Tuesday and prompted a strong response from Palestinian officials, though there was no evidence that the Raml neighborhood itself was a specific target of the crackdown.
''We urge the Syrian authorities to stop the attack on the refugee camp immediately,'' said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. ''It is unacceptable, we cannot accept it,'' he said.
Another senior Palestinian official, Yasser Abed Rabbo, has described the attack on Raml as ''a crime against humanity.'' Speaking on the official Voice of Palestine Radio on Tuesday, Mr. Abed Rabbo said that the Syrian government had ''lost rationality.''
Syria has long given residence to Palestinian factions opposed to Mr. Abbas, including Hamas and some splinter Palestinian groups, and many Palestinians recall Syria's decision to intervene decisively against them in 1976 during the Lebanese civil war. So far, Hamas has sought to avoid alienating the government in Damascus while stopping short of statements of support, like those from Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim movement and, even more pronounced, the allied Amal movement in Lebanon. In a pro-Hamas newspaper in Gaza, a columnist criticized the ferocity of the Syrian crackdown.
Gunfire was still heard Tuesday, though it seemed less intense. ''It's collective punishment against the people of Latakia,'' Mr. Bogdash said.

HEADLINE: Field Of Dashed Dreams

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
PEOSTA, Iowa
The president was in ''Afternoon of a Faun'' mode, a rural deity playing on his panpipes in the woods. Then, suddenly, he stood very still as he sensed electoral danger.
After assuring Obama that she was a supporter, an Iowa mother named Emily asked the president at a town hall at the Seed Savers Exchange in Decorah what had gone wrong.
Standing in a setting that was Martha Stewart-perfect -- a red barn with an American flag, surrounded by white pines, red cedars and pink zinnias -- the president looked breezy in khakis and white shirt. But he seemed to tense up as Emily spoke. 
''So when you ran for office you built a tremendous amount of trust with the American people, that you seemed like someone who wouldn't move the bar on us,'' she said. ''And it seems, especially in the last year, as if your negotiating tactics have sort of cut away at that trust by compromising some key principles that we believed in, like repealing the tax cut, not fighting harder for single-payer. Even Social Security and Medicare seemed on the line when we were dealing with the debt ceiling. So I'm just curious, moving forward, what prevents you from taking a harder negotiating stance, being that it seems that the Republicans are taking a really hard stance?''
The president defended himself with a tinge of resignation: If the crazed bullies put a gun to your head, you must surrender.
''Now, I know that people would like to say 'Well, just do something to get these guys under control,' '' he told Emily, adding: ''You don't want to reward unreasonableness. Look, I get that. But sometimes you've got to make choices in order to do what's best for the country at that particular moment.''
The answer must have seemed lame even to Obama because, on the spur of the moment, he felt backed into doing what many in his White House and party wish he had done long ago. He told Emily he would put forward ''a very specific plan to boost the economy, to create jobs and to control our deficit.'' (But not until September.)
Driving through Midwest cornfields in his opaque, black, custom-made, $1.1 million ''Matrix'' bus, our opaque president found himself in The Field of Dashed Dreams. If you don't build it, they may not come.
Dubuque's Telegraph Herald published a front-page editorial, suggesting to the president that he could have skipped the campaign-style trip and ''sent the savings to Dubuque County and Northwest Illinois, which were inundated by flash floods less than three weeks ago'' but didn't get federal assistance.
Obama spent Tuesday here in Peosta squirreled away in rural economic forums; he said afterward that they talked about such things as cows grazing next to solar panels and ''helping farms manage manure in creative ways.'' The president made his sobering case that America is still great while Gov. Rick Perry barreled past on his own bus, breaking creative new ground in volatility.
As Obama did dressage, Perry galloped through Iowa like an unbroken stallion in danger of cracking a leg.
The Texas governor called the president ''the greatest threat to our country'' and questioned his patriotism and sense of duty. The former Air Force pilot said the military and veterans would prefer a commander in chief who had been in uniform.
Perry said Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, would commit a ''treasonous'' act if he ''prints more money'' and threatened Lee Marvin justice. ''We would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas,'' he said.
Why do conservatives always have to brand people traitors? Why can't they just say ''You're mistaken''?
By the end of the day, it was a barroom brawl, with Karl Rove telling Fox News that it was not ''presidential'' to call the Fed chief, appointed by the second President Bush, a traitor. (When Team W. calls you a yahoo, you're in trouble.)
Obama batted away the Texan, as did Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, who told me: ''We may disagree with our political opponents, but we certainly think they're all patriots -- even those who wanted to secede from the union.''
While Perry was playing the retro trigger-happy cowboy, Obama was playing the retro henpecked husband.
In Cannon Falls, Minn., the president compared negotiating with House Republicans to negotiating with his wife.
''In my house,'' Obama noted, ''if I said, 'You know, Michelle, honey, we got to cut back, so we're going to have you stop shopping completely. You can't buy shoes; you can't buy dresses; but I'm keeping my golf clubs.' You know, that wouldn't go over so well.''
In Decorah, he said: ''Everybody cannot get 100 percent of what they want. Now, for those of you who are married, there is an analogy here. I basically let Michelle have 90 percent of what she wants. But, at a certain point, I have to draw the line and say, 'Give me my little 10 percent.' ''
Maybe Michelle should be the one negotiating with the Republicans.

HEADLINE: Should the Wealthy Pay Higher Taxes?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If Warren E. Buffett (''Stop Coddling the Super-Rich,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 15) wants to pay more in taxes, no one is stopping him. Federal and state income tax codes specify a minimum tax obligation on the basis of income. In other words, millionaires and billionaires like Mr. Buffett -- and any other taxpayer for that matter -- can pay more taxes to the government without waiting for Congress or their state legislatures to tell them they must.
But it won't make much difference. The Internal Revenue Service's own statistics indicate that if the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (households with annual income of more than $380,000) were taxed at a rate of 100 percent, it would net $938 billion, which would barely make a dent in the nation's multitrillion-dollar annual budget. 
The solution to our dilemma is not to increase tax rates but to increase the number of taxpayers, while reducing the national budget.
JACK LeMENAGER Winchester, Mass., Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Bravo, Warren E. Buffett, for expressing my feelings exactly about tax increases for the rich. Although not among the 400 wealthiest, my family is willing and able to pay more taxes to help our country emerge from its financial nightmare.
Although Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was ridiculed during the 2008 campaign when he declared that it was patriotic to pay taxes, I agree with him 100 percent and am ready to do my part if the legislators in Congress will stop placating Grover Norquist's demands for no tax increases and start working for the voters.
I find it incomprehensible that raising taxes on the very wealthy to help the middle class survive is a notion that is anathema. Thank you, Mr. Buffett, for being willing to share some of your wealth with those not as rich as you and for having the courage and wisdom to say so.
ANN G. BENZ Owings Mills, Md., Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Warren E. Buffett's self-deprecating Op-Ed article would be more sincere if he followed it up with action. Nothing is stopping him from sending a larger check to the Internal Revenue Service as if higher tax rates applied to him. But Mr. Buffett is too smart for this, because he knows he can better allocate his money than the government can.
The key point is that higher tax rates do, in fact, stifle economic growth. They may not significantly affect Mr. Buffett's large portfolio, but they do restrict the ability for average Americans to gain and amass their own personal fortunes.
ANDREW ROTH Vice President of Government Affairs Club for Growth Washington, Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Many Americans are beyond the point of debating whether to raise taxes for reasons of fairness or balance or Keynesian or supply-side economics. The core issue really is something that Warren E. Buffett understands quite well -- value. The American people are no longer getting appropriate value for the dollars that they ''invest'' in their government.
This situation should be treated no differently from how Mr. Buffett treats an investment in a company. When the returns from a company are insufficient, he does not throw good money after bad. He finds a way to liquidate his position at the highest price.
Many Americans have concluded that neither the price nor the performance of government is going to improve in the near future, and they don't want to invest any more of their tax dollars.
EDWARD MILLER Lawrence, N.Y., Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
I agree with Warren E. Buffett on increasing income taxes. In addition, I would urge Congress to consider creating a tax on assets. Taxing assets, intriguingly, does not violate Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which addresses income taxes. Investment companies routinely charge an annual fee that is a fraction of total assets under management. Perhaps the federal government should do something similar.
PETER McCULLOUGH Lutherville, Md., Aug. 16, 2011
To the Editor:
Warren E. Buffett is right when he calls on Congress to ''Stop Coddling the Super-Rich.'' But that's not going to happen when 60 percent of the members of Congress are millionaires or multimillionaires. And candidates for the presidency are also rich or super-rich.
Like it or not, America is now run by a moneyed aristocracy more powerful and less responsible than the landed aristocracies of old.
JOSEPH R. MARSHALL Guilford, Conn., Aug. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
Warren E. Buffett seems incredulous that our federal income tax system favors with lower rates those who ''make money with money'' over those who earn their livings from salary or services. The reason for this is simple: Ours is a capitalistic society, meaning that we reward those who employ capital to create more capital. Without capital creators, there would be nobody to pay salaries or consume services.
Capitalists rightly should be incentivized through our tax system to employ their capital, and those who earn their livings from salary or services rightly should be likewise incentivized to take entrepreneurial risk. Notwithstanding Mr. Buffett's selective statistics, we all know that tax rates and tax policy strongly affect investment decisions and economic behavior.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Mr. Obama: The president's anger is only a start

 BODY:
Faced with a divided Congress and an economy in desperate straits, President Obama tried bargaining with Republicans, he tried adopting some of their ideas and he pleaded with them for reasonable policies to help stave off disaster. For his efforts, he got nothing but a cold shoulder and the country got a credit downgrade.
Now, on a bus tour in the Midwest, he is bitterly pointing the finger at his opponents for their refusal to consider any new revenues to tackle the deficit and their insistence on deep near-term spending cuts that will only cause more economic pain. His anger is long overdue. But it would be much more effective if he combined it with strong ideas of his own for how to fix the economy, rather than the thin agenda he is now promoting. 
Fearing the real possibility of a default (something that never seemed to concern the Republicans), the president stayed largely mild-mannered through the whole debt-ceiling hostage ordeal. He even praised the bill that emerged, even though it cut spending excessively at a time when the fragile economy can't afford it.
But on a factory trip last week and again on his tour of Iowa and Illinois, he was far more candid. He accurately referred to the ''debt-ceiling debacle'' and pointed out that the resulting downgrade was an assessment that Congress cannot make necessary compromises. ''We've got the kind of partisan brinksmanship that is willing to put party ahead of country,'' he said.
He left no doubt of his target when he noted that Speaker John Boehner walked away from a more balanced deficit-cutting deal and that, in last week's debate, the Republican presidential contenders who participated unanimously rejected the possibility of a deal that cut spending 10 times as much as it raised taxes. ''What that tells me is, O.K., you've gotten to the point where you're just thinking about politics. You're not thinking about common sense.''
Mr. Obama has proposed a series of small-bore measures to reduce the jobless rate, chosen in the hopes that they are so obvious that even House Republicans would consider going along with them.
That was a mirage, of course. Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, dismissed the idea of extending the payroll tax cut as ''sugar-high economics,'' and others in the House said it was too piecemeal.
When Republicans reject even tax cuts, something else is going on, and Mr. Obama identified it on Monday. ''There are some folks in Congress who think that doing something in cooperation with me or this White House, that that somehow is bad politics,'' he said. It is, in fact, entirely about politics.
He also pushed back against the incessant government bashing by Representative Michele Bachmann and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. While Mr. Perry even accused the Federal Reserve of treason for increasing the money supply -- and shamefully threatened its chairman, Ben Bernanke, saying ''we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas'' if he does so again -- Mr. Obama said government is hardly broken. It houses people during emergencies, he noted, fights fires and crime, and (to Mr. Perry's annoyance) sends out pension checks.
That argument and that contrast would be much easier to make if Mr. Obama came up with policies big enough to match his newfound anger -- and big enough to get the economy growing again.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Mr. Obama: He needs to fight for an ambitious jobs agenda

 BODY:
Come September, President Obama's aides say he will roll out more programs to put Americans back to work. What we are hearing so far doesn't go nearly far enough. 
The gist: Continue the payroll tax cut for employees into next year. Reform the patent system. Pass trade legislation. At a stop in Decorah, Iowa, on Monday, he called for employing jobless construction workers to rebuild roads, bridges and schools across America.
Those are all sensible ideas, but most are not up to the urgency or scale of the problem: 25 million Americans -- 16.1 percent of the work force -- are out of work or working part time, and the economy is weakening anew.
Patent reform and trade deals won't have much near-term impact. The payroll tax cut and federal unemployment benefits are crucial for supporting demand in a weak economy, but extending them for another year will only help to prop up the distressing status quo.
Federal funds to hire construction workers could be a prodigious job creator -- construction and building repair generally create 10,000 jobs for every $1 billion spent. But when the president floated the idea this week, he did not so much embrace it as his own as mention it in passing. ''Congress should pass it and get it done,'' he said.
Congress, left to its own devices, won't get it done. Presidential leadership, daily and unrelenting, is needed. But as Binyamin Appelbaum and Helene Cooper reported in The Times, Mr. Obama and his advisers are still debating whether it is worth pushing any bold proposals, fearing that voters will see it as a failure if they don't make it through Congress. That is an excuse for not trying. It also underestimates the intelligence of the American people.
Another measure under discussion is a tax incentive for businesses to hire. A $13 billion hiring tax credit passed in 2010 is estimated to have led to 250,000 new hires. In contrast, a stimulus program that subsidized the hiring of low-income Americans generated 250,000 jobs for roughly $5 billion. That program deserves revival before more is spent on dubious hiring tax breaks. Another stimulus measure worth reviving that could create good jobs is a tax credit for manufacturing clean energy equipment.
A serious jobs agenda should also ensure that federal funds are available to rehire teachers, police officers and firefighters who have lost their jobs in state and local government budget cuts. It should include new programs to hire unemployed young people, say, in federal parks and in community centers and new financing for national service programs, like AmeriCorps, where applications have far outstripped openings. The longer young people are unemployed, the worse their future prospects become.
Mr. Obama needs to put forward a comprehensive plan and fight for it. If he loses to obstructionist Republicans, Americans will know who is to blame.

HEADLINE: Convicted Rioters Will Be Forced to Clean Up, Britain Says

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and ALAN COWELL; John F. Burns reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris. Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Rioters and looters convicted following the violent unrest that convulsed Britain this month will wear orange jumpsuits and help clean up areas affected by their actions, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Tuesday, as part of a ''riot payback scheme.''
Mr. Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, the junior partner in the coalition government, also announced an ''independent communities and victims panel'' to examine the causes of the widespread violence, burning and looting that left scars across London and several other major cities. ''It won't be a public inquiry, it won't be established under the Inquiries Act, but it will serve as a way in which victims and communities can have their voice heard,'' he said at a news conference. 
The measures have been widely seen here as a compromise between Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party, pushing a tough law-and-order response, and the opposition Labour Party, under Ed Miliband, which has urged the government to concentrate on the root causes of the unrest and declare a wider, judge-led public inquiry with the power to call witnesses.
There was growing discord, however, over harsh sentences handed down to convicted rioters. Last week a 23-year-old engineering student with no previous convictions was sentenced to six months in prison for looting $5 worth of bottled water. On Tuesday, two young men from the outskirts of Manchester were each given four years in prison for inciting others to riot via Facebook postings. The Guardian newspaper reported that the postings by the defendants, Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe, 22, did not in fact lead to any violence.
While judges and the police say those stiff sentences send an unmistakable message of deterrence, critics said they reeked of a double standard. Some compared them cynically to the more lenient punishments handed out in the 2009 expense account scandal involving members of Parliament, or the conspicuous absence of prosecutions over irresponsible banking practices that helped lead to the world financial crisis.
''Maybe I missed it, but during the M.P.s' expenses scandal I just can't recall any M.P.s demanding eviction, loss of benefits, maximum jail terms, naming and shaming and everyone held on remand,'' Roger Clarke, a columnist for The Birmingham Mail, wrote Tuesday in blog post titled ''Is it Just Me?''
The London police also disclosed on Tuesday that they had sent officers to guard the 2012 Olympic Village and two higher-end shopping malls on Aug. 8, the third day of the rioting, after having intercepted cellphone and social network communications by rioters intent on pillaging those sites. Scotland Yard's assistant commissioner, Lynne Owens, told lawmakers that because the police had monitored the messaging, ''we were able to secure all those places, and indeed there was no damage.''
New evidence of the ferocity of the unrest continued to emerge.
The police charged a 16-year-old boy with murder over the death of a 68-year-old retiree who was attacked during the turmoil. The boy's 31-year-old mother, arrested at the same crime scene, was charged with seeking to pervert justice, according to state prosecutors. Under British judicial rules, the boy's identity was kept secret.
He was charged with murdering Richard Manning Bowes, who died Thursday after being assaulted during the unrest that swept through the west London district of Ealing on Aug. 8. A postmortem examination showed that he died of head injuries. He was the fifth person reported killed.
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Miliband gave radically different speeches Monday on how to address the riots. Their responses suggested that Britain's political landscape would shake off a longtime uneasy consensus and take a form closer to that of Margaret Thatcher's heyday in the 1980s.
On Tuesday, Mr. Cameron toured the north London neighborhood of Tottenham, where the four days of rioting started Aug. 6 after a peaceful protest about the death of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old man of Afro-Caribbean descent who was shot and killed by a police officer under circumstances being investigated by the police regulator.
Mr. Cameron visited a recreation center used by 200 people made homeless by fires that tore through their apartments after rioters burned the stores below. At the same time, Theresa May, the home secretary, who is responsible for the police, said at a public meeting in central London that the police might be given powers to impose curfews. But Ms. May again rejected demands by senior police officers for their forces to be exempted from the government's deep cuts in public spending because of the country's debt crisis.
The ability of the rioters to coordinate their mayhem via Twitter, Facebook and instant messaging has emerged as a major theme in the four-day spree, and has led to government suggestions that it may exert temporary powers to suspend the use of Internet messaging services to thwart rioting in the future -- a step fiercely opposed by civil rights proponents.

HEADLINE: Sarkozy and Merkel Vow Fiscal Unity for Euro Nations

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Berlin and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, on Tuesday called for closer coordination of economic policy among the 17 countries that share the euro currency and proposed that they enshrine in their constitutions an obligation to balance their national budgets.
Amid a backdrop of official figures showing that economic growth in the heart of Europe is slowing and investors growing wary of a deepening debt crisis across the region, the two announced a series of proposals that they said were aimed at defending economic growth and strengthening the competitiveness of euro zone countries. 
Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy vowed to set an example for other euro zone members by harmonizing their national policies on corporate income taxes and to establish a common tax on financial transactions by 2013. In addition, they said, French and German finance ministry officials would meet quarterly to share economic forecasts and coordinate policy.
''We want to express our absolute will to defend the euro and assume Germany and France's particular responsibilities in Europe and to have on all of these subjects a complete unity of views,'' Mr. Sarkozy said at a news conference alongside Mrs. Merkel at the Elysee Palace following two hours of closed-door meetings.
The proposals came as the leaders of the euro zone's two largest economies faced mounting pressure to forge a joint approach to a widening economic crisis that has already engulfed Ireland, Greece and Portugal and threatens to pull in Spain and Italy as well.
In the United States, where stocks were still trading, the Standard & Poor's index of 500-stocks and other major indexes fell steeply as the two leaders held a news conference announcing the results of their meeting.
In what may likely be the most ambitious proposal, Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel outlined a plan for each of the euro zone governments to enact legislation that would constitutionally bind their governments to balancing their budgets. This ''golden rule'' would be expected to be enshrined in the constitutions of all euro members by the middle of next year, the leaders said.
France and Germany also proposed the creation of what Mr. Sarkozy called ''a true economic government for the euro zone'' that would be made up of heads of state of all of the 17 nations that share the European currency. This council, he said, would meet at least twice a year and would be led by a president who would serve for a term of two and a half years. He said he and Mrs. Merkel would jointly propose that Herman van Rompuy, a Belgian and the current president of the European Union, be the first to take on this role.
''Germany and France feel absolutely obliged to strengthen the euro as our common currency and further develop it,'' Mrs. Merkel said. ''It is entirely clear that for this to happen, we need a stronger interplay of financial and economic policy in the euro zone.''
The summit meeting came as European stock markets were in retreat Tuesday for the first time in four days and the euro slid against the dollar following fresh economic data that showed growth in the euro area fell more than expected in the three months through June as growth in Germany came almost to a standstill.
Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the previous quarter, according to Eurostat, the E.U. statistics agency. Euro area growth was down from 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
G.D.P. growth in Germany, which has been the region's economic locomotive, fell to 0.1 percent compared with the previous quarter, when the economy expanded 1.3 percent, the German Federal Statistical Office said. Analysts had expected growth of 0.5 percent.
Those gloomy statistics followed news on Friday that showed the French economy, Europe's second-largest after Germany's, did not grow at all in the second quarter. Slower growth means that tax receipts will also grow slowly, which will make it harder for Germany and France to support countries like Italy and Spain that are finding it increasingly difficult to borrow money at interest rates they can afford.
Greece is already in recession, while growth in Spain is slowing down more than expected this year. The Portuguese government expects the economy to contract 2.3 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast for a 2 percent decline.
German and Italian shares led a broad decline in European stocks Tuesday. Germany's DAX index closed down 0.45 percent, while the FTSE Italia index shed 0.87 percent. France's CAC 40 was 0.25 percent lower and Spain's IBEX slipped 0.40 percent.
The S.&P. 500 was down 1.40 percent in afternoon trading in the United States.The euro fell 0.48 cents to $1.4396.
Both leaders also flatly rejected -- for now -- an idea that has recently gained currency among a growing number of economists: The creation of new government bonds backed by all the nations of the euro zone.
''What we are proposing here is the means with which we can solve the crisis right now and win back trust, step by step,'' Mrs. Merkel said. ''I do not think euro bonds will help us in this.''
Mr. Sarkozy said he would not rule out euro bonds at some point in the future, but said greater coordination of economic policy among euro zone members was a necessary first step.
''Euro bonds can be imagined one day, but at the end of the European integration process not at the beginning,'' Mr. Sarkozy said.
Euro bonds are a deeply controversial idea among both economists and ordinary Europeans. Critics say that they would not solve the financial crisis, and might create unbearable political tension instead. Voters in stronger countries would balk at assuming the obligations of less-prudent members. Some critics argue that euro bonds would unfairly raise borrowing costs for countries like Germany, and, rather than protecting the euro, could lead to the breakup of the currency union.

HEADLINE: Modern-Day Gold Rush

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Sarina Finkelstein's photos of gold prospectors paint a somewhat 19th-century vision of California. Yet her subjects are very modern: retirees, war veterans and job seekers.

 BODY:
Are today's volatile stock market and wobbly global economy presaging a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis? Or is the Great Depression of the 1930s more apt analogy
Looking at the photographs of Sarina Finkelstein, one might draw another parallel: California's Gold Rush of 1848.
Ms. Finkelstein, 30, a Brooklyn-based photographer, documented a new wave of prospectors who are panning, sluicing and dowsing in the very same regions that James Marshall and his progeny explored a century and a half ago.
The resurgence of gold hunting comes amid a worldwide frenzy for the precious metal, which investors have long considered a refuge from weak financial markets. The price of gold - which last week reached a record-high nominal price of $1,813 per ounce - has skyrocketed in recent years, fueled by hedge fund speculators and governments' central banks.
Yet Ms. Finkelstein did not discover the likes of George Soros or Zhou Xiaochuan in them thar hills. She found, instead, a hodgepodge of prospectors from all walks of life. There were the California jobless. Retirees from Indiana looking for an adventure. War veterans from New England hoping to rebuild their lives.
When she started working on "Prospectors," in 2009, Ms. Finkelstein, too, was looking to rebuild her life. Her mother had recently died, leaving her feeling unmoored and directionless. All around her, in the depths of the recession, friends were losing their jobs.
"I became drawn to photographing people who were facing obstacles and struggling to overcome serious losses of their own," she said.
Ms. Finkelstein started with portraits of laid-off workers at a shuttered General Motors plant in Moraine, Ohio. After reading an article about prospectors, she traveled west to Angeles National Forest and the San Gabriel Mountains, immersing herself in a small but passionate community of gold seekers.
"There is this psychological feeling of gold fever out there, and they're completely hooked," she said. "Even their finding the littlest piece propels them to keep going."
Many prospectors are not motivated only by money. Among Ms. Finkelstein's subjects is Martin Jennings of Hallsville, Mo., a town 10 miles from her hometown of Columbia. Mr. Jennings sold his farm at age 50 and moved to California to live in the wilderness with a friend. He left his wife and children behind.
When Mr. Jennings discovers gold, he dispatches others to sell it for him. The proceeds go toward prospecting supplies.
"It's all about the digging - the work, the search, the continued potential for discovery," he told Ms. Finkelstein. "The river, the mountains - this is my front yard."
Ms. Finkelstein believes such an ethos springs from the search for rewarding work in challenging economic times. Her views, she said, were influenced by "Shop Craft as Soulcraft," a 2009 book by Matthew Crawford that espoused the beauty and dignity of manual labor.
"These people prefer the prospecting life to cubicle culture and staring at a computer screen all day," she said. "They're getting their hands dirty. Blood, sweat and tears."
Still, despite the strand of Emersonian self-reliance running through these communities, Ms. Finkelstein said many of her subjects are driven by potential financial rewards.
"The income isn't steady, but sometimes they find a $5,000 nugget," she said. "In a way, I guess that's not so different from the life of a freelance photographer."

HEADLINE: Court Ruling Offers Path to Challenge Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Opponents of Dodd-Frank are looking to pursue legal battles after a federal court struck down an S.E.C. rule that would have made it easier for shareholders to nominate company directors.

 BODY:
A new front has opened in the behind-the-scenes battle over financial regulation.
Industry groups have been examining legal challenges to the Securities and Exchange Commission's new corporate whistle-blower program and a provision surrounding the extraction of oil and natural gas from foreign countries, people briefed on the talks said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's plan to curb speculative trading is also under fire.
The catalyst has been a federal appeals court decision in July striking down an S.E.C. rule that would have made it easier for shareholders to nominate company directors. The so-called proxy access rule stemmed from the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping regulatory overhaul enacted in the wake of the financial crisis.
In recent weeks, lawyers and Wall Street trade groups have gathered in Washington to ponder the next big case. Lawyers branded one meeting, held by the United States Chamber of Commerce, as "Dodd-Frank Excesses," according to two people who were notified of the meeting.
Until now, Wall Street relied largely on an army of lobbyists to chisel away at 300 new rules flowing from the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, among other agencies. But while lobbying might yield the occasional loophole, judicial rulings can halt new rules altogether.
"I would hope the agencies are taking to heart the potential consequences for Dodd-Frank rules," said Eugene Scalia, the lawyer who won the proxy case on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce.
Hal S. Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School and a director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group that has been a critic of Dodd-Frank, said, "I do see lots of challenges coming down the pike."
Regulators, reluctant to give in to industry pressure, are rushing to safeguard their rules from legal action. The commodity commission, having already delayed several Dodd-Frank rules for six months, is now studying the proxy case and considering adjustments to some proposed regulations, according to a person close to the agency. Earlier this month, the agency dispatched several staff members to meet with S.E.C. officials about the recent court decision.
For its part, the S.E.C. is weighing an appeal of the proxy ruling. The S.E.C. is also adding economists, planning to hire eight over the next two years, after the appeals court rebuked the agency for not fully evaluating the proxy rule's economic effects.
The legal challenges are rooted in a 1996 law that requires the S.E.C. to promote "efficiency, competition and capital formation." The law enabled the financial industry to build lawsuits around the economic costs of a rule, regardless of its merits.
In 2005, the Chamber of Commerce was the first business group to invoke the law, using it to successfully challenge certain S.E.C. rules for the mutual fund industry. The chamber later gained momentum with a string of similar victories in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Altogether, the appeals court has tossed out three financial regulations in the last six years, including the proxy rule.
Mr. Scalia, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn and the son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was on the winning end of each case.
Banks and corporations, rather than challenging the rules directly at the risk of alienating regulators, turn to seasoned litigators like Mr. Scalia and influential trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce to lead the fight. For more than 30 years, the chamber has had a separate litigation center, which operates as its own law firm in Washington.
"It is usually not in the interest of a single business to mount a claim," said Brian G. Cartwright, the S.E.C.'s former general counsel who now works at the law firm Latham & Watkins. "You need some cut-out man or organization that speaks for broad groups."
The industry has shied from mounting a broader challenge to Dodd-Frank itself, finding it cheaper and easier to gradually chip away at the law's fiercest provisions. Lawyers say a single lawsuit contesting the constitutionality of Dodd-Frank could take years - and millions of dollars - to wind through the courts, with little chance of succeeding.
"Dodd-Frank is not one thing but many," said Margaret E. Tahyar, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk. "There is no reasonable constitutional or statutory challenge on the whole - only on the bits and pieces."
By some measures, the proxy rule was an unlikely choice to challenge on economic grounds. The S.E.C. produced 60 pages on a cost-benefit analysis of the rule and spent 21,000 staff hours drafting it over two years, Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said in a recent letter to Congress.
That the proxy regulation still did not pass muster does not bode well for several other Dodd-Frank rules that received considerably less explication, sometimes only 25 pages, on their economic effects.
"The proxy case makes all the rules open target to challenge," Mr. Scott of Harvard said.
Financial trade groups, according to several lawyers, are now considering suits against the S.E.C.'s corporate whistle-blower office, which opened last week. The chamber, at least, argues that the whistle-blower program allows tipsters to undermine internal compliance departments.
Industry groups are also looking at claims against a few more obscure Dodd-Frank provisions. One S.E.C. regulation requires companies to disclose whether they manufacture goods using so-called conflict minerals like gold from Congo.
Tiffany & Company argued in a letter to the S.E.C. that the proposed rules "would violate the First Amendment," laying the groundwork for business groups to mount a constitutional challenge.
Some letters are even blunter, as groups invoke the proxy case as a cautionary tale.
Royal Dutch Shell wrote the S.E.C. this month about "our expected costs" stemming from a proposal about oil extraction. Shell filed the letter, it said, "in light of the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals."
The commodity commission has received a barrage of hostile letters, too, some foreshadowing legal action. In March, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to scrap its plan for reining in speculative commodities trading, saying it "may be legally infirm."
Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency who has championed tough position limits on oil, corn and the like, sought feedback on the plan from the CME Group, the nation's largest futures exchange. But at CME's Chicago headquarters last fall, executives declined to discuss the proposal with Mr. Chilton, saying the Commodity Futures Trading Commission lacked the legal authority to impose trading limits.
With the industry firing such warning shots, regulators have spent months shielding their rules from litigation.
In May, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's general counsel and chief economist issued a memo spelling out guidelines for cost-benefit analyses. The memo and other efforts to slow down the Dodd-Frank rules later drew rare praise from the agency's internal watchdog, which said the commission "has taken proactive steps to address concerns."
Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner at the futures trading commission, also called for the agency to re-examine every cost-benefit analysis drawn up for Dodd-Frank. "The commission does not have the final word, as the S.E.C. has recently learned," Mr. O'Malia warned this month.
Still, most regulators are hesitant to strike the panic button.
"We hear about potential lawsuits with some frequency," Mr. Chilton said in an interview. "There's an old saying in Washington that, if you're not part of the solution, there's plenty of money to be made being part of the problem."

HEADLINE: Are Young Entrepreneurs Getting Enough Help?

BYLINE: YOU'RE THE BOSS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Is there more that Washington could do?

 BODY:
We've just published an interview with Neil Blumenthal, a young entrepreneur who recently went to Capitol Hill to talk about how important young entrepreneurs are to the economy. One of the founders of Warby Parker, an online eyewear company based in New York, Mr. Blumenthal and Hannah Seligson discussed, among other things, what politicians don't understand about business, what he had to promise the Small Business Administration he wouldn't do with his borrowed money, and what the Bloomberg administration is doing right.
At one point, Mr. Blumenthal noted that his company had struggled to get a loan backed by the Small Business Administration because the company did not yet have two years of tax returns.
"Isn't that a reasonable request when you're talking about using taxpayer dollars to guarantee a loan to a private company?" Ms. Seligson asked.
"I understand where the banks are coming from," Mr. Blumenthal responded. "It probably was necessary to implement hard and fast rules to stop the bleeding when the crisis hit, but they should be looking at the policies and thinking: does this make sense now?"

HEADLINE: New York Fringe Festival Report: 'Yeast Nation'

BYLINE: JASON ZINOMAN


HIGHLIGHT: "Yeast Nation (the triumph of life)" takes a satirical look at the rise of yeast from the ocean floor to start a new life form.

 BODY:
Put the weird sisters from "Macbeth" into a giant pot, add a smidgen of the blind prophet Tiresias from Greek myth and mix in spare parts from sketch comedy and a Broadway belter, and you have the majestically silly performance of Harriet Harris in "Yeast Nation (the triumph of life)," the new musical by the creators of "Urinetown" that, thematically, is something of a prequel.
Since it's about the community of life forms that first emerged out of the primordial soup, you might call this crowd pleaser the ultimate prequel. Ms. Harris is playing Jan the Unnamed, the narrator and leader of a kind of Greek chorus of salt-eating yeasts. (Ms. Harris won a Tony Award in 2002 for her performance in "Thoroughly Modern Millie," which opened on Broadway the same season that saw the unlikely commercial transfer of "Urinetown.")
When not interrupted by a smarty-pants kid poking holes in her story, Jan the Unnamed guides the audience through the tangled thickets of plot filled with power plays and romantic triangles pushed along by single-cell Machiavels. Her language is littered with quotes from "Macbeth" and Greek tragedy. 
Critics and producers have been searching for the next "Urinetown" at the New York International Fringe Festival for so long that it seems like some kind of mythical beast, a theatrical Big Foot. But the reason this musical may get closer than any other Fringe production has since the 1999 "Urinetown" is how it sustains its satirical style. The jokes veer from broad to brainy, and Mark Hollmann's music is rock pastiche, but this is the rare satire that knows precisely what it's sending up and commits to it.
Those copying "Urinetown" usually focus on the silly name and meta-jokes, but what made it work was the affection and irreverence displayed toward a certain twisted version of Social Realism agit-prop. In this new work Greg Kotis, who wrote the book (he and Mr. Hollmann wrote the lyrics), takes aim at classical sources with the gusto of a graduate student pulling an all-nighter. It would be easy to stray off topic to get an easy laugh, but this show admirably resists.
"Urinetown," you might recall, was about an environmental crisis that ended with a salute to Malthus, the early-19th-century economist who theorized that the world population could grow to unsustainable levels. It was a cautionary tale about waste and overconsumption. Exploring the origin of the same theme, "Yeast Nation" focuses on the moments after life emerged out of rock and sea.
The humble yeast society remained on the ocean floor, not reproducing and standing still. Jan the Wise (played with delightful oily charm by Manu Narayan) celebrates the virtue of staying put and following the "strictures" in the very funny tune "Stasis Is the Membrane." His rival, Jan the Second (Erik Altemus, whose deadpan earnestness is pitch-perfect), argues for change and freedom, to expand the ranks. Evoking "Jesus Christ Superstar," he sings, "It's a buzz to have a mission."
The temptation to branch out leads some yeasts to rise to the top of the ocean to feed, and before long a new life form arrives. The New One (Kimiko Glenn) talks like Frankenstein's monster and looks like a gymnast from Cirque du Soleil gone berserk. Her entrance is a coup de theatre. At first she represents a new hope and then the chaos and overconsumption that eventually lead to the apocalyptic landscape of "Urinetown."
The high marks of "Yeast Nation" - at La MaMa, where it has sold out its four remaining performances - arrive at the start of the second act with two charming duets, by the power-hungry plotters (Mr. Narayan and Joy Suprano, who plays Jan the Sly) and the bickering lovers (Mr. Altemus and Emily Tarpey as Jan the Sweet). Staged by Mr. Kotis, the mountain of plot eventually drags down the show toward the end, and some numbers, like "Life Goes On," seem choreographed on the fly. Were it to transfer, it could use some sharper jokes at the start and a more focused plot. Yet generally speaking the production is far more polished than most at the Fringe.
As new life forms rampage over the old, a pointed allegorical subtext emerges that speaks to the state of the festival itself. The scrappy early yeasts were as pure as those storied early days of the Fringe are reputed to have been by some critics. And the temptation to rise above the ocean floor and expand could be read as a metaphor for how the commercial success of "Urinetown" forever changed the expectations of the festival, now in its 15th year.
But Mr. Kotis has a skeptic's perspective toward idealized notions about salad days. Curiosity is human. And ambition is essential to growth, but it has a price. This is another musical about the circle of life, though as opposed to "The Lion King" this one is darkly ironic and morally complex. Evolution, it seems to suggest, can be ugly and bleakly violent, and while its benefits make it worth the pain, just barely.

HEADLINE: Malpractice Anxiety

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Most malpractice claims do not lead to any payment from doctor to patient, but they still affect medicine. A new paper in The New England Journal of Medicine has details.

 BODY:
Amitabh Chandra, a Harvard economist, is a leading expert on medical malpractice, and his work does not fit neatly into either the American Medical Association's camp or the trial lawyers association's camp. Sometimes it comforts one side. Sometimes, it comforts the other. I used Mr. Chandra's research extensively in writing an overview of malpractice in 2009. 
 Now he and three other researchers have a new paper, to be published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Among its findings is that a large majority of malpractice claims do not lead to any payment from a doctor to a patient. Either the patient drops the case, or a court dismisses it. 
 In every medical specialty the researchers studied, at least three out of four claims led to no payment. In many specialties, about 9 out of 10 claims led to no payment.
 Over all, about 7 percent of doctors faced a claim in a given year, and fewer than 2 percent made any payment relating to a claim.

 These patterns, the authors note, may help explain why doctors' concern over malpractice suits is very high even in states that limit such suits, like Texas. As the paper notes, doctors' self-reported worries about malpractice vary little across states, even though malpractice laws vary greatly. The researchers write:
Our results may speak to why physicians consistently report concern over malpractice and the intense pressure to practice defensive medicine, despite evidence that the scope of defensive medicine is modest. Although these annual rates of paid claims are low, the annual and career risks of any malpractice claim are high, suggesting that the risk of being sued alone may create a tangible fear among physicians.
The perceived threat of malpractice among physicians may boil down to three factors: the risk of a claim, the probability of a claim leading to a payment, and the size of payment. Although the frequency and average size of paid claims may not fully explain perceptions among physicians, one may speculate that the large number of claims that do not lead to payment may shape perceived malpractice risk. Physicians can insure against indemnity payments through malpractice insurance, but they cannot insure against the indirect costs of litigation, such as time, stress, added work, and reputational damage.
These findings seem consistent with earlier research suggesting that malpractice reform is nothing like a magic bullet for high medical costs. But malpractice does weigh heavily enough on doctors' minds that a more efficient accountability system for doctors - one in which avoidable errors were more likely to be punished and decent care was less likely to be subject to lawsuits - could both improve care and have some effect on costs.
In addition to Mr. Chandra, the paper's authors are Anupam B. Jena, Seth Seabury and Darius Lakdawalla.

HEADLINE: Never Mind a Tiger in Your Tank: How About An Alligator?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: In a new study, scientists describe experiments in which they converted alligator fat to liquids that would be usable in biofuel.

 BODY:
Researchers at the Lafayette campus of the University of Louisiana are looking for green substitutes for diesel fuel. The prime one now in use is soybeans, which are used to make biodiesel oil. But soybeans are also needed for human consumption and animal feed. The United States uses 45 billion gallons of diesel a year; making just one billion gallons from soybeans would use up 21 percent of the American crop, the scientists point out. 
Now the researchers think they have identified a potential source for biodiesel that currently goes straight to landfills: alligator fat, about 15 million pounds of it every year. 
Alligators are grown and harvested for their meat and for their skins before the fat heads to landfills, noted Rakesh Bajpai, a professor of chemical engineering at the university. They are not endangered or threatened. (Crocodiles are, but those are not part of the researchers' equation.)

And alligators are plentiful in the wild, Dr. Bajpai said. "If you start seeing alligator roadkill, you've arrived in Louisiana,'' he said. 
The fat has very limited uses. "When I talk to local people, they say, 'Grandma used to use it for every purpose,'" he said. Often, Dr. Bajpai said, it was used as a cure-all like cod liver oil. But even that use has died out, he said. 
That is in contrast to alligators' skins, which are fashioned into wallets, belts and shoes, or their meat, which is commercially available and which shows up on restaurant menus, often as a deep-fried appetizer. "They say it's very good,'' Dr. Bajpai said. "I don't know. I am a vegetarian.'' 
In a paperpublished on Wednesday in the journal Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research, Dr. Bajpai and five collaborators report on lab experiments in which they converted 61 percent of the alligator fat to liquids that would be usable in biofuel. 
Some 15 million pounds could become 1.25 million gallons of fuel, with an energy content about 91 percent as great as that of petroleum diesel. A large plant could produce the fuel at $2.40 a gallon, Dr. Bajpai said, not counting the cost of the fat, which would presumably be zero, or the cost of transporting the fat to the plant. 
And for each gallon of biodiesel produced, the refinery would also make a few ounces of glycerol, a chemical valuable in industry, he said. 
That would appear to make alligator fuel competitive with commercial diesel, which sells for a little more per gallon than gasoline. And various quotas and credits are available to encourage biodiesel use.

HEADLINE: Parents Choose Cohabiting Over Marriage

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: More children live with unmarried parents than with married ones.

 BODY:
American children are more likely to have parents who never married than parents who are divorced.
That is one finding in the latest report from the National Marriage Project, which is based at the University of Virginia and which conducts research on marriage and family in the United States. Specifically, the report says, 42 percent of children have lived with cohabiting parents by age 12, while only 24 percent have lived with a parent who had divorced.
A twelvefold increase in the number of cohabiting households over the last four decades is of concern, the report's 18 authors say, because marriage is better for children. Studies find that children in cohabiting families perform worse in school and are less psychologically healthy than children of married parents. Rates of child abuse are lowest in families with two married biological parents, and highest when there is an unmarried unrelated partner in the home.
But is it true that marriage stabilizes a family? Or is marrying a reflection of an existing feeling of permanence and stability? If it is the first, then the answer is that everyone should just marry. But if it's the latter? (And I think it's pretty clear that it is ...)
In her article on the report in The New York Times, my colleague Sabrina Tavernise quotes Sheela Kennedy, a research associate at the Minnesota Population Center, which conducted some of the demographic studies cited in the report. "There's growing evidence that families that would be unstable anyway are just skipping marriage," Ms. Kennedy tells her.
And the reason that those families are unstable? Poverty. Lack of education. Unemployment. As June Carbone and Naomi Cahn, both family law professors, parsed the data in the last week:
A half-century ago, marriage rates did not vary much by education, and college-educated women were less likely to marry than those without college degrees. Today, the likelihood of marrying, staying married and raising children within marriage correlates strongly with education. Indeed, for white college graduates the non-marital birth rate has stayed at 2 percent; for African-American high school dropouts, it's 96 percent. In between is a steeply slanted line that links family form to education, income and race.
In other words, what some might paint as a "rejection" of marriage, and the moral connotation that comes with that interpretation, is more accurately a far more practical problem. They conclude:
Marriage rates by themselves have a variety of meanings, but class-based increases in family instability have one overriding consequence: the creation of a less-just society with diminished prospects for a large percentage of our children. What we really need to do is increase our investments in children, employment stability and healthy communities and stop pretending that family structure is simply a matter of morals or will.
Where to start? Not by working to increase marriage rates as an end in itself, but to strengthen relationships. Not to lament that the institution has somehow been "diluted" by including same-sex couples, but to celebrate its expansion. Not by preaching that marriage is synonymous with family, but by teaching teenagers "family values" that include how not to have a family until they are feeling stable and permanent, whether married or not.

HEADLINE: Should Rich People Have to Pay More Taxes?

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: What are the arguments for and against Warren Buffett's position that the mega-rich should bear a greater tax burden?

 BODY:
In his Op-Ed, "Stop Coddling the Super-Rich," Mr. Buffett argues that he and his "mega-rich friends" have not been called to sacrifice a greater percentage of their wealth to help the economy:
I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn't mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.
Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country's finances. They've been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It's vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country's fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.
Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can't fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.
But for those making more than $1 million - there were 236,883 such households in 2009 - I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more - there were 8,274 in 2009 - I would suggest an additional increase in rate.
My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It's time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice. 
Students: Tell us what you think about Mr. Buffett's ideas. What are the arguments both for and against his position? Why do you think Congress has not enacted his suggestions? Do you think it should? Do you think it will? Would you like to see the very wealthy contribute more to the economy in the form of taxes? If you were super-rich, would you be willing to be subject to a relatively high tax rate, as Mr. Buffett is?

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
President Obama and Gov. Rick Perry spent much of Tuesday speaking to separate audiences in Iowa, presenting their cases for growth in the listless job market. The spectacle of a beleaguered president and his confident new rival circling each other in the cornfields of Iowa may signal battles to come, Mark Landler and Jeff Zeleny report, as Mr. Obama fights to hold on to the region that put him on the path to victory in 2008.

        
With Mitt Romney's front-runner status being threatened by Mr. Perry's candidacy, the Romney camp insists that it is not changing strategy. To Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry is just another candidate - one he will not be directly engaging until absolutely necessary, Ashley Parker writes in a Political Memo.

        
Backlash over Mr. Perry's comments about Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, underscored the challenge facing Mr. Perry as he makes the transition from Texas governor to the national stage, where every phrase is parsed and ripe for criticism. Mr. Perry calling Mr. Bernanke's decision to print more money "treasonous" highlighted his penchant for provocative, hard-edged campaigning that speaks to certain conservatives even as it raises hackles elsewhere, Jeff Zeleny and Jackie Calmes report.
        
Politicians and investors are always eager to get the latest number on the economy's estimated growth rate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But, Binyamin Appelbaum explains, the number is a crude and often unreliable estimate. And the more rapidly things are changing in the economy, for better or for worse, the estimates can quickly lose touch with the reality.

HEADLINE: Pondering Perry's Electability

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican establishment seems to want to hedge its bets against Gov. Rick Perry.

 BODY:
The speech by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to announce his presidential candidacy on Saturday got generally favorable reviews, but it did not take long for some influential Republicans to become overtly skeptical about what Mr. Perry might do for the party in November.
The Wall Street Journal editorial board lumped Mr. Perry into the same category as Michele Bachmann and questioned his appeal to swing voters. Karl Rove critiqued Mr. Perry's impolitic remarks about the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
And in perhaps the clearest indication that the Republican establishment wants to hedge its bets against Mr. Perry, there were renewed calls for another heavyweight candidate -- like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin -- to enter the race.
All of this is understandable, particularly if you take a party-centric view of the nomination process. The entire campaign has been about the Republican Party searching for a candidate who is (a) capable of running a strong race against Barack Obama, (b) conservative, and (c) actually interested in running.
The search has not quite gone as planned. Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana seemed to meet the first two criteria, but would not throw his hat into the ring. Mike Huckabee had reasonably strong favorability ratings with general-election voters. But he received little encouragement to run, perhaps because his positions were perceived as being too heterodox on economic policy.
Representative Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin meet the conservative criterion, but not the electability one. Newt Gingrich was already on tenuous grounds on electability, and when he dared to critique Mr. Ryan's Medicare plan, he was shunned by the party.
Mitt Romney is still very much in the running -- and has adopted essentially down-the-line orthodox Republican positions. But the party looks at his record in Massachusetts and does not seem persuaded that he is a movement conservative at heart.
The candidate who had seemed like the best hope for meeting all three qualifications was Tim Pawlenty. But he was vetoed by the Republican voters.
Enter Mr. Perry. He is running now and with plenty of popular support, already having pulled into the lead in one poll of primary voters.
It is worth watching Mr. Perry's announcement speech, in which he served up more red meat than an Austin barbeque joint, making a forceful and direct case against Barack Obama. Whereas Mr. Romney calibrates his message to his audience with all the elegance of a station wagon, Mr. Perry gives the impression of bulldozer with just one setting -- full speed ahead.
But is Mr. Perry electable?
Let's be careful about that term. Electability exists along a spectrum, rather than in absolutes. Mr. Romney could defeat Barack Obama under a wider variety of circumstances than, for instance, Christine O'Donnell. But if the United States were suffering from Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation in which all liquid wealth in the country was destroyed every 24 hours, I would start to like Ms. O'Donnell's chances against Mr. Obama, too.
Now that we have cleared that up: there is not yet a lot of hard evidence about Mr. Perry, in large part because he is not very well known to voters (his name recognition is about 50 percent outside of Texas). Just two firms have polled so far on his favorability rating, and although both found slightly more Americans holding a negative view of Mr. Perry than a positive one, most respondents in the polls had not yet come to a firm view of him.
We could also look at head-to-head polls between Mr. Perry and Mr. Obama. Those do not look particularly good for him: in an average of eight national polls conducted since July 1, Mr. Perry trails Mr. Obama by an average of 11 percentage points.
However, polls for candidates with low national name recognition can be misleading since many voters will not vouch for a candidate with whom they are not yet familiar, instead describing themselves as undecided. It may be marginally more useful to look at the number the incumbent receives, which is less sensitive to these effects. Those numbers are also not great for Mr. Perry: Mr. Obama gets at least 50 percent of the vote in several of the recent polls against him, which means that even if most of the undecideds are really latent votes for Mr. Perry, he would still lose. Another troubling number is the partisan breakdown in the polls: Mr. Obama leads Mr. Perry by an average of 46 percent to 36 percent among independent voters, while trailing 38 percent to 45 percent against Mr. Romney.
Still, given that Mr. Perry is a fresh face to many voters and that head-to-head polls so early in the election cycle have a spotty track record, we are really just guessing about whether this data has much meaning. There is also a broader issue, which is that Mr. Obama's head-to-head polls have held up fairly well against Republicans given his approval rating -- but that question applies to the whole field as much as much as to Mr. Perry. (Mr. Pawlenty, for instance, had similar overall numbers before he exited the race, although he did a tick or two better than Mr. Perry among independents.)
One alternative is to look at Mr. Perry's performance among voters who do know him -- the good folks down in Texas.
Mr. Perry has never lost an election, a rarity even for candidates who go on to become president. Some victories early in his career are impressive: for instance, defeating the incumbent Democratic agriculture commissioner, Jim Hightower, in 1990, a point in time at when Texas still often voted Democratic at the state level. (Mr. Perry was himself a Democrat until 1989.)
Nowadays, however, Republicans in Texas essentially never lose a statewide race, so the fact of Mr. Perry's re-election alone does not tell us all that much. Instead, we need some kind of a control group.
One choice is simply to look at how other Republicans running for statewide office in Texas fared in the years that Mr. Perry was running. In 2002, for example, when Mr. Perry was elected to his first full term after succeeding George W. Bush, his margin of victory was 18 percentage points. That holds up pretty well against other Republican candidates for statewide office that year (excluding those who did not draw a Democratic challenger), who won by an average of 15 percentage points.
Mr. Perry's performance in 2006 was much more tenuous: he was re-elected with just 39 percent of the vote in a complicated, four-way race. Even if we ignore that and instead look at Mr. Perry's nine-point margin of victory over his nearest rival, Chris Bell, a Democrat, it compares unfavroably to other Republicans on the ballot that year, who won by an average of 15 points. (2006 was a very Democratic year nationally, but not so much in Texas.)
Last year, Mr. Perry was re-elected to another term, defeating Bill White, a Democrat and the former mayor of Houston. But his 13-point margin of victory is underwhelming for such a Republican state in such a Republican year. Other Republicans on the Texas ballot last year won by an average of 27 percentage points instead.
Over all, Mr. Perry has won his three elected terms with an average victory margin of 13 percentage points. That's certainly not a disaster, but it lags the 19-point margin for other Texas Republicans running in those years. In the most recent two elections, Mr. Perry was losing quite a few voters who were voting for Republican for almost every other office.
I know, it's not the most overwhelming evidence: every election and every state is different. A more empirically grounded line of research, which we'll address in a separate piece, is how much a candidate's ideology affects the presidential race over all.
Still, you have an interesting contrast between Mr. Perry, who won a lot of elections in an exceptionally Republican state, and Mr. Romney, who won just one election in a very blue state. When Mr. Romney was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he was practically the only Republican in the state to have won that year; Democrats took the races for United States Senate, attorney general, secretary of the commonwealth, state treasurer, and state auditor, none being especially close. They won all 10 United States House seats, 33 of the 40 State Senate seats, and a 136-to-24 majority in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.
Most other candidates who have won their party's nomination have at least one such overachieving performance. Barack Obama won election to the United States Senate in 2004 with an overwhelming 43-point margin, albeit against a very weak opponent. George W. Bush was elected Texas governor by 37 points in 1994. Bill Clinton ran for governor of Arkansas six times, losing once, but winning on three other occasions by at least 25 percentage points. Ronald Reagan defeated Pat Brown, the Democratic incumbent governor of California, by 15-point margin in 1966; although California was not as blue then as it is today, it is fairly rare to defeat an incumbent governor by that margin under any circumstances. Lyndon Johnson won his three Senate terms by an average of 40 points. Results like these are more the hallmark of having a mass-market brand.

HEADLINE: A More Subdued Perry on the Trail in N.H.

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry is less strident in New Hampshire a day after making controversial remarks about the Federal Reserve.

 BODY:
BEDFORD, N.H. -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas sounded like a sheepish schoolboy at the Granite State's Politics & Eggs breakfast on Wednesday morning, when he told a bipartisan crowd of 200 that he'd gotten a real talking to the day before.
 "I got in trouble talking about the Federal Reserve yesterday," Mr. Perry said, to laughter, referring to his sharply criticized comments suggesting that the actions of Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, were potentially treasonous. "I got lectured about that yesterday."
 But, Mr. Perry continued, the Federal Reserve "should open their books up."
"They should be transparent, so the people of the United States know what they're doing, how they're doing it," Mr. Perry said. "And frankly I think the mistrust that is there today, if they would simply open up and be transparent with the American people, I think it would go a long way towards either finding out whether or not there is some activities that are improper or that they've been handling themselves quite well."
He added: "But until they do that, there will continue to be questions about their activity and what their true goal is for the United States."
 Mr. Perry also used his 45-minutes at the podium to address the White House spokesman Jay Carney's admonishment Tuesday that presidential candidates should be careful with their words.
"You know yesterday the president said I needed to watch what I say," Mr. Perry said. "I'd just like to respond back, if I may: Mr. President, actions speak louder than words. My actions as governor are helping create jobs in this country. The president's actions are killing jobs in this country. It's time to get America working again."
It was a refrain Mr. Perry echoed again and again throughout the morning, repeating a half-dozen odd times that "we need to get America working again."
But in addition to offering his message about jobs and the economy, Mr. Perry also fielded questions on everything from the debt-ceiling compromise (he would not have signed it, had he been president) to climate change.
Saying that the cost of carrying out anticarbon programs would be "billions if not trillions of dollars," Mr. Perry acknowledged that "yes, our climate has changed," but said he was skeptical that global warming was the cause.
"I don't think from my perspective that I want America to be engaged in spending that much money on still a scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question," he said.
That answer did not sit well with Jim Rubens, 61, a Republican activist and high-tech investor from Etna, N.H., and the man who posed the question. 
"He's a very impressive candidate, but he was factually wrong on the earth's climate getting warmer," Mr. Rubens said. "You have to deal with technology and science as it is, and for him to say that the National Academy of Sciences is wrong and to say that the earth is getting cooler calls into question the entire scientific discovery process."
Still, Mr. Rubens added, "it's factually false - but he's a great candidate."

HEADLINE: Obama Plans Jobs Speech After Labor Day

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A major jobs speech by the president could help set his campaign narrative as Republicans increasingly attack his handling of the economy.

 BODY:
President Obama plans a major jobs speech after Labor Day in which he will lay out new proposals for jump-starting the economy and specific plans for legislative efforts to cut spending, White House officials said.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said on MSNBC's "Daily Rundown" that the president will lay out two proposals -- one to jolt short-term job growth and another to guide the Congressional committee charged with deficit reduction in the fall.
"In early September, we will put forward proposals for jobs-creating ideas and economic growth ideas," Mr. Carney said Wednesday morning. "We want to be aggressive with deficit reduction that helps pay for things you need to do in the near term to grow the economy."
A major jobs speech by the president could help set a campaign narrative for Mr. Obama as this Republican challengers increasingly focus their attacks on his handling of the economy. Top aides to the president are eager to show that his ideas are being stymied by a recalcitrant Republican Congress.
"They are more interested in politics than they are in solving the problems," Mr. Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview Wednesday.
The speech comes amid a growing clamor from the president's liberal base for him to be more aggressive in pushing his own jobs agenda to counter the conservative debt-cutting philosophy.
And the speech follows repeated criticism from Republicans throughout the debt fight earlier this summer that Mr. Obama has failed to lay out his own plan for turning around the economy.
The White House has said for weeks that the criticism is unfair. Every time the president has given remarks recently, he has laid out a series of relatively small proposals that he says Republicans have refused to act on, including trade deals and an extension of a payroll tax cut.
White House officials have said the president's speech -- to be given soon after Labor Day -- will contain new ideas that go beyond those he has made in the past several weeks.
