HEADLINE: Low Pay and Closed Doors Confront Young Job Seekers

SERIES: Staying Afloat: Work in the 90's -- First of four articles.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
Andrew Flenoy has ironed his white shirt until there are sharp creases down the sleeves. His hands are folded in his lap, his back is ramrod straight, and his feet jiggle nervously as he begins his fifth job interview in as many weeks -- this one at Sprint, the long-distance telephone company that is Kansas City's largest private employer.
Mr. Flenoy, 21, comes across as nervous and sweetly sincere as he tells the interviewer how much he wants the $17,274-a-year job selling long-distance service. 
 Mr. Flenoy, a high school graduate who completed a year-and-a-half training course at a business trade school, is scrambling for a foothold in a work world that has turned inside out. Even in an economy that has created three million new jobs in the last three years, career positions -- the old-fashioned jobs offering benefits, vacation and room for advancement -- are increasingly hard to come by.
 
Hard Reality
 For millions of people across the country, young and old, economists' predictions of the late 1980's have now hardened into the reality of daily life. While there are still plenty of good jobs for computer engineers, nurses and others whose skills fit the changing economy, other workers have had to reconcile themselves to a job market that has little use for them.
The recovery started almost three years ago in this heartland metropolis of 1.6 million people. In its demographic makeup and economic indicators, Kansas City closely mirrors the national average -- and these days, it is an exemplar of the profound changes that have transformed the American workplace for young workers like Mr. Flenoy, including these:
*Once-reliable employers like T.W.A. and Sears have dumped workers, and executives with master's degrees remain as vulnerable to layoffs as production-line assemblers. The unskilled castoffs of shrinking industries, used to earning $20 an hour, are finding that the new labor market offers them no more than $6. Many now work two or three jobs, without matching their former salary or benefits.
*Temporary jobs are at their highest levels ever. There are 24.4 million part-time and temporary workers, representing 22 percent of employed Americans. In Overland Park, Kan., a well-off suburb of Kansas City, one branch office of Manpower Inc., a large temporary employment agency, filled out 4,500 W-2 forms in 1993 for employees who had worked anywhere from a day to a full year -- 30 percent more than the previous year.
*For some skilled workers, the increasing flexibility of the work world is a boon, allowing them to change jobs at will, work when and how much they want, and earn more as employers compete for them. This group includes not only the computer engineers and other bastions of the changing economy, but also electricians and other blue-collar workers whose skills remain in demand.
*With the layoffs of so many men whose paychecks once kept the family afloat, women are not merely bolstering household incomes -- their salaries have become essential to maintaining a tenuous grasp on a middle-class life style. And even though women streamed into the work force during the 1980's, the median household income in Kansas City was $31,637 in 1980 but had slipped to $31,613 by 1990.
While the public's perceptions of the national economy may have improved in recent months, Americans' insecurity about their own jobs is substantial and widespread, according to The New York Times Poll. Two-fifths of the work force voiced worry that during the next two years they might be laid off or forced to take pay cuts. And in the last two years, 24 percent said that in the last two years they have personally experienced layoffs, pay cuts or reductions in hours, according to the poll, taken in mid-February.
For economists and workers alike, the big question is whether the recovery will eventually spur the creation of plenty of good new jobs. Some experts say that is bound to happen, now that the explosive growth of temporary jobs has flattened.
But others say the American work force has undergone such basic structural changes that many high-paying jobs -- from factory foremen to office supervisors and professionals -- are gone for good.
 
Their Market
Amid a Recovery, More Layoffs
 Whatever the future, the "downsizings" and "rightsizings" that began in the recession are continuing, as the largest companies here, as elsewhere, keep pruning payrolls in 100- and 1,000-worker sweeps.
Last year, Sears Roebuck here closed a distribution center, leaving more than a thousand people jobless. Other companies have also shrunk their work forces, including Marion Merrell Dow, a pharmaceutical company; Allied Signal Inc., which makes nuclear bomb parts here; Hallmark Cards, renowned around town as a benevolent employer; Colgate-Palmolive and A.T.& T.
Even a young, growing company like Sprint, with 9,000 local workers and 50,400 nationwide, had a round of layoffs in August, cutting 1,000 workers nationwide, 120 of them in the Kansas City. Overall, the telecommunications industry laid off 60,000 workers in the country last year.
Certainly some businesses are adding full-time, well-paying jobs with good benefits. Twentieth Century Services Inc., a mutual fund company here, has seen its work force grow from fewer than 300 eight years ago, to 1,900 now, and there are plans to add 300 to 400 this year.
Transamerica Life Insurance and Annuity Company of Los Angeles is moving 500 jobs here, and hundreds of small businesses are picking up abandoned workers and keeping the unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent last year, below the national average of 6.8 percent. And at least one employer, Ford, is adding people to its 4,000-worker plant to make the new Contour and Mercury Mystique, the successors to the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz.
But new jobs are not coming on stream the way they did after previous recessions. Frank Lenk, the senior economist at the Mid-America Regional Council here, calculates that in the three years since the last recession ended, the Kansas City region has gained about 20,000 jobs -- compared with 93,000 jobs created after the previous downturn in the early 1980's.
 
Their Jobs
$6 an Hour, 7 Days a Week
 To their bitter disappointment, Mr. Flenoy and most other young workers are finding that "McJobs" -- jobs that pay $6 an hour or less, and offer little in the way of a career path -- are about the only openings around.
"It just seems really difficult for my generation," said Mr. Flenoy, the oldest of six children in a rural Arkansas family.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirm that impression: in the last decade, the average wage has fallen 5 percent, adjusted for inflation. And median full-time weekly earnings for those aged 20 to 24, expressed in 1982 dollars, dropped to $199 in 1993, from $215 in 1989.
As a placement director at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Maria Manuel has watched graduates with high expectations struggle in the job market. "Almost everyone is having a hard time finding jobs," she said. "Some of them go out there thinking they should be able to find something paying $25,000 a year, and we have to tell them $17,000 is probably more like it."
There are some young people, those who have specialized skills in fields like nursing or auto mechanics, who have employers clamoring for their services.
Jason Walters, who like Mr. Flenoy is 21, has had no trouble finding his way in the work world. He began working on cars as a sophomore in high school, for $5 an hour. These days, after getting a degree in automotive technology at Longview Community College, he is earning $9 an hour, and planning to be married in May.
"I love my work, and I feel pretty secure in it," said Mr. Walter, who works at Cooper's Automotive. "There are plenty of jobs for me. I know because I see how hard it is for them to hire anybody here. But my dad is a fair wrench-turner, and I always knew I wanted to be a mechanic. I didn't run around with the in crowd in high school; I just worked on cars all the time."
But most others have a string of disappointments to recount. Some are mailing dozens of resumes a month, and getting nothing but form-letter rejections. Others wonder why, with more education than their parents, they still cannot find work anywhere near as stable or well-paying as their parents have.
 
Internship Pays Off
 Reese Isbell is one of the luckier ones: He found work he liked just a month after graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1992.
But these days, even lucky young people are likely to land in part-time jobs, if not internships or temporary assignments.
"I had an internship my last semester of college, working 20 hours a week in the public affairs office at Planned Parenthood, and I really liked it," said Mr. Isbell, who was a sociology major. "My father couldn't believe I would have any trouble getting a job when I graduated. He thought there would be all kinds of people recruiting me. But there weren't. I went to a temporary agency, and got a data entry job, but I hated it so much that I quit after two days."
So Mr. Isbell leapt at the chance for a paid job at Planned Parenthood -- still 20 hours a week, but now earning $8 an hour. To make ends meet, he also took a $7-an-hour weekend job as an admitting clerk at a hospital, a position he has kept even as the Planned Parenthood job expanded to 30 hours, and soon, to full time.
"I'm working seven days a week but I know I'm really lucky, and it wouldn't have happened without the internship," said Mr. Isbell, 23. "My father is a computer programmer, which used to be a shoo-in, but a couple years ago he lost his job and was out there pounding the pavement at the age of 40."
 
Their Prospects
When College Is Not Enough
 "Reality Bites," the current movie about twentysomethings, reflected young workers' profound uneasiness about their job prospects. The heroine graduates as valedictorian of her college class, then is promptly dismissed from a television job where she had been warned that she could be replaced by an unpaid intern. Her boyfriend has been dismissed from 12 jobs, and, she says, is "on the inside track to Nowheresville, U.S.A."
Her mother urges her to get a job at a burger place. Her best friend tries to recruit her to work at the Gap -- and is offended when she says she is not interested. And when she applies for media jobs, she is rejected as overqualified at one, underqualified at the next.
"It all sounded very familiar," said Dan Wulf, a graduate of Wesleyan University in Connecticut who came to Kansas City a year and a half ago to set up a summer program for children. He now works as a secretary at the University of Kansas Medical Center during the week, and at Kinko's copy center from 2 P.M. to 11 P.M. on weekends. On Sunday mornings, he teaches Hebrew school.
He and Mr. Isbell have both concluded that to get more challenging jobs -- and avoid seven-day workweeks -- they will have to go to graduate school.
"We're getting more college graduates than we are college-level jobs," said Dan Hecker, an economist for the labor statistics bureau. "About 20 percent of the college graduates end up in non-college-level jobs."
The number of college graduates working as street vendors or door-to-door-salespeople grew from 57,000 in 1983 to 75,000 in 1990, the last year the statistics were compiled, according to the bureau. In the same period, the number of truck or bus drivers with college degrees grew from 99,000 to 166,000.
 
From Carhop to Paralegal
 For those without college degrees, the struggle for a good job is even tougher: Renda Rush married at 17 and had her first child the following year. She began working as a carhop at Sonic Drive-In two years later and stayed there -- with breaks for the birth of two more children -- until the end of 1992.
"What started me thinking was seeing a lot of high school girls, home for the summer, working at Sonic," said Ms. Rush, now 26. "Then in the fall, they'd go on to college, or whatever, and I'd still be there. And I finally thought, they're moving on and I've been here five years, I've got kids, and I'll be left behind forever if I don't do something about it."
Ms. Rush went back to school, choosing a two-year paralegal training program at Penn Valley Community College. And she is on her way to a career: She started as a receptionist at a personal-injury lawyer's office, but is now doing paralegal work too.
Ms. Rush, who earned $4.85 an hour at Sonic, earns $7 an hour, with the understanding that her pay will rise when she gets her degree later this year.
 
Their Fallback
A Generation Of Temps
 In the recession, many employers, here and elsewhere, tried to keep their costs low by increasing their use of part-timers and temporaries, who work only during busy periods and usually get no benefits.
According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment with temporary agencies accounted for 15 percent of the new jobs created last year and 26 percent the year before -- compared with less than 3 percent of the new jobs created in 1989.
In dozens of interviews with young workers in Kansas City, temping seemed to be an almost universal experience: Mr. Wulf had a weeklong job in a real-estate office through a temporary agency; Mr. Isbell had his data-entry job, and Mr. Flenoy did a market-research project surveying theater-goers.
And for some young people it becomes a way of life. For a year and half now, Cabrenna Clark, 24, has been working for Kelly Services, a temporary employment agency, earning about $6 an hour, plus some overtime. But every six months, she sends out a round of resumes for the business jobs she covets.
"I work every day, and there always seems to be another assignment when one ends," said Ms. Clark, who has completed a year and a half of college and plans to return later this year. "I've had a couple places call me back as a temp. But it seems like right now, people are more interested in working with temps than hiring for permanent jobs."
Ms. Clark said her parents, both civil servants -- her mother working for the state, her father for the Federal Government -- tell her she is wasting her time working as a temp.
"I don't think they understand how hard the job market is," she said. "If you're in Kansas City, and you're not in medicine or telecommunications or the military, you can just forget it. Temping is what I can do right now. "
 
Their Disappointments
Another Day, Another Interview
 For Mr. Flenoy, what started as a temporary job has become more permanent than he ever intended. He was hired as a temporary dishwasher at Myron Green, a Kansas City company that runs cafeterias and catering in offices and schools. After 90 days, he was offered a permanent dishwashing job, for $5.50 an hour, then was quickly promoted to cafeteria line server ($5.75), grill cook ($6.00) and catering manager ($6.25).
Mr. Flenoy, the first in the family to go beyond a high school education, has come tantalizingly close to several good permanent jobs in the last two months. He was almost hired as a secretary-administrator for a church, and was one of the two final candidates for a corporate data-entry job.
But the Sprint job was the one he coveted, both because it paid more than the others, and because the company offers a generous benefit plan including tuition reimbursement that Mr. Flenoy hoped to use to further his education.
At the interview at Sprint, Mr. Flenoy began to relax as the recruiter, Mary Reiter, worked through her list of printed questions, asking him to talk about a time he tried hard and failed, a time he was too persistent, how he knows if he has done a good job. Ms. Reiter smiled encouragingly as Mr. Flenoy told about making a special effort to arrange a beautiful food tray, and thinking he had done a spectacular job -- until he heard the customers' reactions.
"Normally in interviews when they ask questions, I'm completely blank, but this time it just flowed along," Mr. Flenoy said after the interview.
 
Thinking of New Towns
 But a good interview was not enough: on Sprint's multiple-choice telemarketing aptitude exam, Mr. Flenoy scored too low to win another interview. So for the time being, he must stay at the food-service job.
"I'll do it as long as I have to," Mr. Flenoy said one recent morning, as he took a break from arranging a taco-bar luncheon. "But I really want some kind of business job. My resolution for 1994 is that if nothing comes along, I'll relocate and start from scratch somewhere else."
Mr. Flenoy said he knew from the time he was in high school that he wanted to leave Marianna, Ark., where his only job prospect seemed to be packing cotton or farming. He always wanted a career in business. After a semester at a community college, he moved to Kansas City, where he had relatives, attending Wright Business School in the mornings and working in the evenings.
Now he is tired of the burgundy and black uniform he must wear, and of the sense that he works every day from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. just to earn enough money so that he can come back and work some more the next day.
But he does not tell his family how disheartened he is. He does not want to discourage his younger siblings.
"I'm trying my best to be very, very positive for them," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Hypocrisy On Trade

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's top trade negotiator today denounced the Europeans for criticizing toughened American policies toward Japan. He said the policy was already showing signs of progress, with word that Japan was close to agreeing to increase Motorola's access to the lucrative Japanese cellular-telephone market.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the apparent Japanese willingness to open more of its market to Motorola "could be a portent of things to come and is a movement in the right direction" with regard to other major trade disputes with Tokyo. 
 In a speech at a trade conference here sponsored by the Economic Strategy Institute, Mr. Kantor vented some of the Clinton Administration's bitterness over what it views as dishonest and sanctimonious criticism by European officials of Washington's get-tough policy with Japan, at a time when the Europeans are quietly using some of the same tactics to protect their own manufacturers.
 
'Sit on the Sidelines'
 "The Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we can go out and get our noses bloody," Mr. Kantor asserted. "What we don't look for is criticism from those who sit on the sidelines and who are not willing to get into the game."
United States officials were particularly peeved at Peter Sutherland, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for remarks he made in New York last week that seemed critical of some American trade tactics in opening Japanese markets, suggesting that they were close to "managed trade."
Mr. Sutherland, who heads the Geneva-based organization that governs world trade, never specifically mentioned the United States, but American officials said they had no doubt as to whom he was talking about.
 
Spirit of GATT Accord
 They privately communicated their anger to him and to members of the European Union, who were warning that the American quest for numerical indicators to determine whether Japan's markets were being opened violated the free-trade spirit of the recent world trade accord.
"It's interesting that there have been some voices in the union that have said our approach is managed trade," Mr. Kantor said today. "First of all, I'm not sure what managed trade is. Is managed trade when you have a voluntary restraint on automobiles and trucks at 16 percent in Europe, including transplant production? Naw, that wouldn't be managed trade, would it? No, because the Europeans did it."
The audience of economists and business people from around the world laughed. Senior Administration officials said that Mr. Kantor's contempt for European criticism was shared by President Clinton.
"Now when they do it," Mr. Kantor said, "that's protecting their markets and making sure it's fair. When we do it -- the largest open market in the world, who led Bretton Woods and GATT, have kept their markets open since the Second World War, who've led global growth, who have a President who made sure there was an Uruguay Round, who made sure there was a Nafta, who made sure we're trying to open up Japanese markets -- that's not good enough."
He referred to the role played by the United States in forming the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at a conference in Bretton Woods. N.H., half a century ago; to the global trade talks that concluded in December, and to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the pact widely known as Nafta.
 
Just What Is 'European Culture?'
 The Europeans, Mr. Kantor continued, "have a broadcast directive which says you have to have at least 50 percent European content on television to protect European culture."
"Well, it's interesting. Are we protecting British culture, or Portuguese or German? I'm trying to figure out what European culture is. So every time the United States wants to go out there and make sure we lead global growth or we try to open markets, and the Europeans believe they sort of can come in in our wake, they don't want to stand with us. Every time it's in their interest, of course, to engage in behavior which is not opening their markets, that's justified."
Turning to American complaints that Japan has obstructed the import of Motorola cellular telephones, Mr. Kantor said, "I can report to you this morning that there is movement in the Motorola case."
The Motorola dispute is based on an American complaint that Japan has not fulfilled a 1989 agreement to insure that Motorola is not locked out of the lucrative Tokyo-Nagoya cellular phone market, an area as large as the market from Washington to Boston. Motorola has been allowed to compete freely outside this area, and has earned about a 50 percent market share elsewhere. But in Tokyo, because of restrictions imposed by the Japanese Government to help Japanese companies, Motorola has only a small fraction of the market.
Last month, the Clinton Administration set a deadline of March 17 for Japan to open its market further to Motorola or face the prospect of punitive tariffs on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Japanese exports to the United States.
American negotiators say that in the talks being conducted in Tokyo, the Japanese Government and phone companies have signaled a willingness to build the base stations and install the switching equipment, by a specified date, that would make it possible for Motorola to compete fairly in Tokyo. The complicated deal has not yet been nailed down.
[Motorola and its Japanese partner have roughly agreed on a plan under which the Japanese company, Nippon Idou Tsushin, would build more relay stations by March 1996 to expand services for Motorola-type phones in the Tokyo-Nagoya region, The Associated Press reported on Thursday, quoting the Japan Broadcasting Corporation.]
 
Optimism at Chrysler
 In another industry where trade tensions between the world's two largest economies might be eased, Chrysler said in Detroit today that it expected Japan to allow it to increase exports of its popular Jeep Cherokee. Some Japanese auto companies have also signaled a willingness to purchase more parts from the United States.
"It should not escape any of our attention," Mr. Kantor said, "that this progress comes after the President said no to a cosmetic agreement that would paper over the differences in the framework talks, and it comes after the reinstitution of Super 301," the legal provision revived by Mr. Clinton that gives him the authority to quickly impose strong trade sanctions against a nation that is imposing unfair trade restrictions.
"It gives us some reason to believe that the Japanese, knowing the ball is in their court, will come back with something," Mr. Kantor added.

HEADLINE: The Nation's Economy Has Moderate Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Despite the harsh winter in the East and Midwest and the earthquake in California, the nation's economy "expanded moderately" early this year, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Most respondents to the latest Fed survey of regional business conditions said the little disruption that had resulted from the weather and earthquake would be temporary, and activity would rebound later in the year. And, they added, the economic growth was producing little inflationary pressure. 
 The survey, which was concluded on Feb. 24, was conducted by the Fed's 12 regional banks for a March 22 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's panel that sets monetary policy.
After its meetings on Feb. 3 and 4, the Fed nudged the Federal funds rate up to 3.25 percent, from 3 percent, in what analysts said was a move to stem any inflationary spiral before it got started.
 
Higher Rates Expected
 Some analysts maintain the central bank will probably raise rates further as the year progresses. The Federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for short-term loans.
The survey found manufacturing activity increasing in most regions, with the biggest strength coming from automotive and construction-related sectors.
"Durable goods and construction account for most of the advance throughout the nation," the survey found, although Cleveland and San Francisco reported that military and aerospace were damping their economies.
Although bad weather depressed retail sales in some areas, other regions reported consumer spending rose steadily.
 
Merchants Optimistic
 "Almost all district reports suggest that merchants expect solid sales growth in coming months," the survey found.
"Real estate markets continue to improve, despite severe winter weather in many districts," the summary said. "Residential sales activity is strong or growing in over half the districts, and three-quarters observed positive developments in construction.
"The Los Angeles earthquake will increase demand for residential repair services over the next six to 12 months, and freeway repair will push into 1995."
"Over all, only limited price pressures are reported," the survey found. "Prices of building materials, selected metals and some chemicals are said to be rising, but prices of manufactured products and consumer goods generally are not experiencing upward pressure."

HEADLINE: U.S. Remarks Over Kashmir Anger Indians

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 9

 BODY:
India has reacted with anger to recent statements by the Clinton Administration over possible abuses of human rights in the Government's efforts to put down a rebellion in Kashmir.
American officials say there has been no change in United States policy on the issue, which calls for India and Pakistan to settle their long dispute over Kashmir in talks. Nevertheless, Indian officials charge that the Administration statements amount to a shift toward support for Pakistan's claim to the territory. 
 Newspaper headlines here regularly accuse Washington of new attempts at "interference" in a domestic issue, and Indian leaders say that relations with Washington are at a low point.
 
Statement on Kashmir
 Among the comments that have riled New Delhi was a statement last month by President Clinton while accepting the credentials of Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's new Ambassador to the United States, that the United States shared Pakistan's "concerns on the abuse of human rights in Kashmir."
Kashmir is India's only state with a Muslim majority and has been coveted by Pakistan since Britain partitioned the subcontinent in 1947. Since then India and Pakistan have gone to war twice in Kashmir, and India charges that Pakistan is now fomenting the rebellion among Muslims.
Beyond the anxieties relating to the remarks about Kashmir, senior Indian officials are angry over the Clinton Administration's failure to send an ambassador to New Delhi. The post has been vacant for more than a year.
Senior officials in Washington have said recently that Mr. Clinton will move soon to nominate former Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat who is well-known here, and generally liked among senior Indian officials, from his tenure as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
For now, the practical effects of the Indian Government's unhappiness seem minimal, although Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has shelved plans to visit Washington soon.
But in a sign of the sour mood, some of the country's best-known politicians have won desk-thumping ovations in Parliament for speeches accusing the United States of sinister motives in Kashmir, with some charging that Washington wants an independent Kashmir for use as a military base.
To officials in the United States Embassy here, the issue seems overdrawn. They say that remarks by President Clinton and by the Administration's senior official dealing full time with issues on the Indian subcontinent, Robin Raphel, have not changed United States policy on Kashmir.
 
The U.S. Position
 In essence, the United States position calls for India and Pakistan to settle the dispute over the divided territory, taking into account the wishes of the predominantly Muslim population.
India has become less critical of Western influence and has stepped up its drive to introduce reforms that have unleashed powerful market forces. Last year, new investments by large American companies, including A.T. & T., Coca-Cola and General Electric, pushed American investments here to more than $1 billion, more than all American investment since 1947.
Trade topped $7 billion, the highest ever, and kept the United States as India's largest trade partner.
 
10,000 Deaths
 Indian officials acknowledge improvements in economic ties, but say that those are outweighed by the risks inherent in American pronouncements on Kashmir. Since 1990, the two-thirds of Kashmir ruled by India has been convulsed by a Muslim uprising.
At least 10,000 people have died, mostly Muslim civilians. International human rights groups have supported accusations by Muslims of atrocities by Indian security forces, and the Indian Government has suspended the elected government in the state, substituting direct rule from New Delhi.
The Indian reaction had been primed by remarks in Washington by Ms. Raphel, who was named last fall to the newly created post of Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs.
At a briefing in October, Ms. Raphel was quoted as saying the United Statesregarded the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir as "disputed territory."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Pakistan Loses a Plea
 GENEVA, March 9 (AP) -- Pakistan lost a hard-fought bid today to send a United Nations team to investigate allegations of rights abuses in Kashmir. After finding itself isolated in the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Pakistan dropped a resolution condemning "gross and consistent violations" in the territory.
Iran led an appeal by more than a dozen countries to persuade its Islamic ally not to push for a vote, citing India's readiness "to facilitate a visit by a group of ambassadors from Muslim countries to Jammu and Kashmir."
To stave off a vote, India agreed to let the Red Cross visit detainees in Kashmir.
The Indian Foreign Minister, Dinesh Singh, said in a statement today, "We are grateful to countries like Iran which have prevailed on Pakistan to see reason."
Pakistan's delegate, Iqbal Akhund, reluctantly said he would drop the proposal. But he later said Pakistan had not formally withdrawn the resolution.
"It is not a bilateral issue," he said. "If large numbers of people are being killed, it's no more bilateral than Sarajevo."

Bond Prices Are Lifted By the Fed's Beige Book

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's "beige book" report painted a portrait yesterday of a moderately expanding economy, not the robust one that many market participants had feared. As a result, bond prices bounced off their lows of the day.
Traders said the market, which has been concerned about further Fed moves to force up rates, has been jittery since the last rate increase. Yesterday was no exception, as investors and traders were prepared to read the report for signs of price pressures and possibly building inflation that could prompt the central bank to push short-term interest rates higher. 
 The Fed's beige book, which describes business conditions in each of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional districts, is used to brief members of the Fed's Open Market Committee when they meet periodically to set monetary policy. The committee is scheduled to meet March 22.
 
Long Bond's Price Up
 In yesterday's session, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond went from trading down about 3/16 point to rise 11/32 , reaching a price of 9222/32 and yielding 6.83 percent late in the day. It was a decline of three basis points from Tuesday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
John Ryding, a senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that with traders fearing discomforting inflation comments, the market sold off to new high-yield levels before the release of the beige book.
He also noted that the market, which had initially opened up 1/4 point in price on the long end, was down about the time the news services carried a comment from a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare. The Dow Jones News Service quoted him as having said he did not expect a repeat of last year, in which the economy slowed significantly in the first quarter after surging in late 1992.
"Anytime you get comments from Fed officials in a market that is trending down, it seems to bring out selling," one head trader said.
 
Fed Governors Comment
 Mr. LaWare's comments were the second by a Fed governor to move the bond market. On Tuesday, the market responded positively to remarks in a speech by Lawrence B. Lindsey, another Fed governor, that short-term interest rates would remain at "three something." The Fed later dismissed the comment as a joke, and the market saw a selloff.
Mr. Ryding said, "Over all, the beige report was pretty much in line with judgments about the economy." When the report reached traders, it produced a short-covering rally in the bond market, he added.
"We're not expecting strong pressure on consumer prices yet," Mr. Ryding said. "Right now the market is more concerned with input prices at the wholesale level."
Mr. Ryding believes price pressures will push inflation into the area of 3.5 percent, or a little more, later in the year, when the inflation numbers finally do appear in consumer prices. For that, he said: "We think the Fed will have to take the Federal funds rate to 4 percent later to get to a more neutral position. At the same time bond yields will go up to 7.25 percent on the long end."
 
Short Positions Squeezed
 Yesterday's report did not give the market momentum for a rally, but instead squeezed the short positions, Mr. Ryding said.
Retail sales will be the big number this week, and economists expect the figures to give the market some momentum.
But next week is another matter. The market is likely to see a lot of volatility, as several economic reports are released that could move the Fed into some action if the numbers are too unsettling.
Next week's data include business inventories and the Atlanta regional Fed index of manufacturing activity, the producer prices, industrial production, consumer prices and housing starts.
Some market watchers are expecting essentially lower prices and higher yields before setting the basis for a sustained rally in the market.

On Macho Trade Issues, Economists Turn Chauvinist

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S still war out there, only the terms of battle have changed.
A decade ago the object was to get the Russians out of Afghanistan and keep them out of Europe. Now the enemy is Japan and a dozen mini-Japan's ready to suck us dry of advanced technology and good jobs. . . . 
 The idea that nations are in perpetual competition is intuitive and, in a perverse way, comforting: Americans, after all have always done best when they face a common enemy. But in the view of Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "the obsession with international competitiveness is both wrong and dangerous."
Mr. Krugman is hardly alone in his concern. "There's just not much intellectual dispute" that competitiveness is a phony issue, concurs Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution and an official in the Carter Administration. Unlike many of his colleagues who have confined their misgivings to the seminar room, however, Mr. Krugman is now openly challenging the popular wisdom. And those who read his provocative new book, "Peddling Prosperity" (Norton) or his undiplomatic article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine may indeed wonder whether the economists have let the country down by playing footsie with the chauvinists.
People compete and businesses compete. National economies are made up of people and businesses. Why, then, is it wrong to think that economies also compete?
The simplest explanation, Mr. Krugman suggests, is that even in a world of relatively open trade, most of what Americans consume is made in America. Thus living standards are largely determined by the productivity of American farms, factories and offices.
Trade might still have a disproportionate (if hard to predict) impact on the success or failure of high-technology, high-profile industries. Indeed, Mr. Krugman is one of the intellectual parents of "strategic trade theory," which amounts to a clever catalogue of ways in which being first or most aggressive in world markets might yield benefits beyond those generated simply by producing cheaply and well. If, for example, there is room for only one efficient manufacturer of jumbo jets in the world, the first company off the mark (Boeing) will reap an exceptionally high return.
But the numbers just don't justify the concern with strategic factors in trade. Mr. Krugman calculates that America's global advantage in technology and marketing between 1959 and 1973 -- America's gain in terms of trade with other economies -- raised the average annual growth of living standards from 1.85 percent to 1.87 percent. That may have been enough to determine the fate of a business here and there, but is hardly worth the current fuss.
Then, too, there is the question of who actually reaps the rewards from successful strategic trade initiatives. Contrary to intuition, trickle-down in the form of better jobs or lower prices for American consumers may be small or even negative. "If General Motors does well in global markets at the expense of foreign producers, it doesn't help me particularly," Mr. Bosworth said.
Why, then, have economists who know better been slow to take issue with the Clinton Administration's posturing on trade in high-technology products? For that matter, why has the Administration itself, which is loaded with economic talent, been inclined to go ballistic with the Japanese on who sells the most cellular phones in Tokyo and who builds the new airport in Osaka?
Mr. Krugman's answer is a "mixture of hope and fear." The hope part is that the belief that political hormones stimulated by talk of competition can be channeled to virtuous ends such as investment in education, higher savings and elimination of parasitic Government subsidies. The fear part is the age-old worry about telling the emperor he has no clothes.
Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic Development, adds a realpolitik explanation for the silence of the economic doves. Posturing with Japan may in the end do little harm since the alliance is so firmly rooted in mutual self-interest. And it might even do some good if it goads Japan to stimulate its way out of recession or to open its markets more rapidly. Don't forget, too, that the macho talk may serve Mr. Clinton's interests by robbing Republicans of their traditional political advantage as the tough guys on foreign policy.
But the hope that the White House "may get it right for the wrong reasons" doesn't allay Mr. Ooms's concern that confrontation with Japan will damage the alliance that has guarded the political stability of the Pacific for a half-century. Nor does it satisfy Paul Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, who has long championed the idea of selective government aid in science and technology as a means of increasing productivity.
"The Clinton Administration may end up damaging the case for sophisticated intervention," he said. "This could set back progress toward better growth policy for years."

HEADLINE: Gov. Weld Will Run Again

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mass., March 9

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld announced today that he would seek re-election, asserting that Massachusetts would revert to "the terrible misguided mistakes of the past" if the Democrats regained the Governor's office.
Mr. Weld, elected in 1990 after a bitter contest with his Democratic opponent, John N. Silber, the president of Boston University, is the first Republican Governor of Massachusetts in nearly two decades. 
 With the cooperation of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, he dealt with a large budget deficit that had caused the state's bond rating to fall to one step above "junk" status.
Mr. Weld, a former United States attorney, called for tougher measures to fight crime, including sending violent criminals to prison for life after three convictions. He also pushed for tax cuts, term limits and a welfare overhaul emphasizing jobs.
Mr. Weld, 49, is considered likely to win re-election, although Democratic contenders say they plan to hold him accountable for the state's still-sputtering economy.
"Where are the jobs?" asked one Democratic hopeful, State Representative Mark Roosevelt of Boston. " His economic record has been abysmal."
Another Democrat seeking his party's nomination in the Sept. 20 primary is State Senator Michael Barrett of Cambridge.

HEADLINE: Rally in Capital Protests a Rise In Smoking Tax

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Granted, this sounds peculiar. But to protest President Clinton's plans for financing his proposed overhaul of the health care system, some of the nation's biggest tobacco companies virtually stopped making cigarettes today.
Instead, they shuttered their factories and bused their employees -- and tobacco farmers, leaf processors, cigarette-carton makers and a throng of other industry workers -- to Washington and the biggest pro-cigarette rally in political annals. 
 From 16,000 to 20,000 demonstrators gathered on the frigid, sodden Ellipse to denounce Mr. Clinton's proposal to finance his health care plan with a 75-cent increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes, to 99 cents from 24 cents a pack.
Later, they marched past the White House. And later still, they stormed Congress, divvying up an 800,000-signature anti-tax petition according to the hometowns of its signers, and dropped off relevant pages at many of the 535 legislators' Capitol Hill offices.
 
Plan to Raise $56.6 Billion
 The White House says the tax would raise an additional $56.6 billion through the year 2000 to help finance a system of guaranteed health insurance for the entire population. The cigarette industry, and its workers, said today that the tax increase would throw 274,000 people out of work and strangle the economy, or at least that of tobacco states. The estimate is from an analysis by the Tobacco Institute, the industry's lobbying arm.
"You kill tobacco, you kill the whole East Coast," Leon Harris, 51, a worker at a Greenville, N.C., company that cleans and chops up tobacco leaves for cigarette makers, said as he huddled under a thick jacket at the rally today. The industry's many critics argue that it is cigarettes that do the killing. By the Surgeon General's latest estimate, 419,000 people died in 1990 from cancer, heart disease and respiratory ailments caused directly by smoking.
Smoking deaths and illnesses cost the economy about $65 billion a year in lost workdays and medical expenses, the Government estimates.
The vast crowd of protesters, clustered under a Washington Monument looming behind them like a huge unfiltered Camel, would have nothing of that today. They wore Winston rain slickers and Marlboro hats and Salem and Vantage windbreakers. They waved plastic cigarettes big as baseball bats, handed out bumper stickers reading "I smoke and I vote," and wore buttons labeled "Tobacco pays my bills."
To a man, and woman, they maintained that the $48 billion-a-year tobacco industry already pays more than its share of taxes, and that a threefold increase in the tax is little more than a Federal attempt to stub out an industry that individual smokers -- 50 million adults, at last count -- believe they have a right to patronize.
"It's jobs, man," said Jonas Grant, 45, a leaf processor at the Philip Morris U.S.A. plant outside Richmond. "Seventy-five cents a pack is too much."
"We've been taxed enough," said Terry Jernigan, a payroll clerk at a P. Lorillard Company cigarette plant in Greensboro, N.C., who was selling buttons at the rally. "Cigarettes don't cause any more disease than anything else. Let's talk about alcohol. Let's talk about mind-altering drugs. Let's put a tax on the pollution from these cars, and all the other things that make people sick."
"More people drink than smoke," Mr. Harris said, adding that he no longer smoked. "I had some lung problems, a long time ago. I quit before I had any more."
Maura Ellis, a spokeswoman for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, said the notion of a protest first arose last May, when about 1,500 Reynolds workers drove to the capital to protest what was then being billed as a $2-a-pack tax increase. That June, she said, they formed the Tobacco Action Coalition, now a group of about 2,000 tobacco workers and smokers who, she said, organized today's rally.
With some help, of course: Lorillard's Greensboro factory and Philip Morris's Richmond plant, which by itself makes 500 million cigarettes a day, were all but idle today. Fully 7,000 of Richmond's 9,000 Philip Morris workers boarded buses before sunrise to attend the rally.
At the big and mostly deserted Reynolds plant in Winston-Salem, N.C., it was a day for cleaning and routine maintenance, Ms. Ellis said.
But smoking opponents are not getting the backhanded victory of a dip in the nation's cigarette supply. A Philip Morris official said production would be increased on other days to make up the shortfall. "Our manufacturing planning team made the necessary adjustments to see that before or after, we could continue to meet our customers' demand," said Jay S. Poole, the company's director of government and community relations.
Attendance at the rally was voluntary for most, if not all the workers, but many, including Philip Morris employees, were paid a day's wages for their appearance and bused to the capital at company expense.
Whether it all will make any difference in Congress is not clear. Political sentiment has drifted steadily and quickly against smoking in recent years, even in some tobacco-growing states. Maryland officials announced on Tuesday that the state had labeled smoking an occupational hazard and planned to ban cigarettes entirely from all workplaces in 60 days.
 
A Beleaguered Industry
 The industry has been battered this winter by a barrage of Federal attacks on smoking, including suggestions by the Food and Drug Administration that it will seek to regulate cigarettes for the first time as an addictive drug.
One Republican legislator and a former tobacco grower, Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, predicted in an interview today that any health plan approved by the Congress would contain a far smaller smokers' tax, if any at all. And it is true that tobacco-state lawmakers, many with years of seniority, hold enormous political power in Congress.
But Mr. Clinton's proposal so far seems to have the support of the two lawmakers who count: Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who heads the Senate Finance Committee. Their panels are drafting the health-care legislation that will eventually come to votes on the House and Senate floors.
Indeed, the industry's battle in the Finance Committee, if anything, is even tougher after the rally. Among those trapped in traffic jams when the cigarette marchers shut down Pennsylvania Avenue today was Mr. Moynihan, who was late to an appointment at the White House.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aides Report Compromise on Sea Mining

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
After more than a decade of opposing the Law of the Sea treaty as hostile to free enterprise, United States officials said today that Washington would probably sign the treaty this summer, now that they have negotiated major changes.
Washington's backing would greatly strengthen the treaty, which governs the world's oceans. It is scheduled to take effect this November, having been ratified by the required 60 nations among the 159 that signed it. 
 The Reagan Administration heatedly denounced the treaty in December 1982, saying it would sabotage private enterprise by requiring companies that mine the seabeds to pay hefty royalties to help third-world countries that could not afford to do such mining.
But Clinton Administration officials said today that they were close to signing the agreement, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, after intensive talks with third-world nations won their agreement to make it less onerous for mining companies.
For example, the companies would pay far lower royalties and would not be required to turn over their mining technologies to competitors from poorer countries. And production limits on mining companies would be removed.
One potential complication is that the revisions must now be submitted to the countries that signed the original document. But United States and United Nations officials say this should not be a problem.
Noting that many third-world nations are no longer as opposed to free markets as they were a decade ago, a State Department official involved in the negotiations said, "The international community has agreed that we need to take a more market-oriented approach to the whole subject."
Under the treaty, all nations would have full sovereignty over the seas within 12 miles of the shore. But in an important provision for the United States and other military powers, the treaty grants airplanes and ocean vessels the right to pass over straits.
The treaty would give nations control over fishing rights and oil- and gas-exploration rights within 200 miles of their shores.
The treaty could not go into effect until 60 nations ratified it. In November, Guyana became the 60th to sign.
 
A Long Dispute
 The treaty has fueled disputes between rich and poor nations because of its underlying premise -- that the oceans and the sea bed are part of the "common heritage of mankind" that must be shared through "a just and equitable economic order."
The treaty called for a global mining consortium that would enable poorer countries to compete with industrial nations. The money this consortium collected -- partly from royalties paid by mining companies -- was to be distributed to poor nations. United States officials said today that as part of the recent talks, the consortium would lose much of the royalties.
"We already have virtual agreement on all substantive issues," said Satya Nandan, a United Nations negotiator. He voiced optimism that the industrial nations that have not signed -- the United States, Britain and Germany -- would do so soon.
One State Department official said he was confident the treaty would win two-thirds backing in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Whitman, in Office, Still Campaigns;
Governor Tries to Build Support as a Fight Over Cuts Looms

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 8

 BODY:
After seven weeks in office, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is showing every sign that she intends to maintain the kind of high public visibility that she displayed on the campaign trail.
While the capital has fixated on the politics of the 5 percent income tax cut signed into law on Monday, Governor Whitman has often forsaken the State House and the company of the Republican legislative majority. Instead, she has conducted an almost daily round of public appearances in the state, showing a sunny personality and communicating a stern political message to the public. 
 One day recently, it was a street soccer match at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark to mark New Jersey's role in this summer's World Cup soccer competition. At a boat yard in New Gretna, on the Jersey Shore, she sold tax cuts as an elixir for business investment. Opening a conference on Women's History Month at Rowan College, at the south end of the state, the Governor called for more women to take their places in public life.
 
First Major Battle
 If Governor Whitman is acting as if her victorious campaign over Jim Florio has never ended, it may be because she knows that her first real fight is still to come. It begins on March 15, when she must divulge how she intends to pay for her $243 million tax reduction and for the $1.2 billion in additional cuts she has promised to enact over the next two years, as well as the immediate problem of a $1.5 billion built-in deficit.
The base of public support that Governor Whitman is building may become crucial when she begins apportioning the pain of budget cuts in less than a week, said Neil Upmeyer, head of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues, a policy-study organization based in Princeton.
"We always complain about the difficulty of communicating with the voters in New Jersey, and she has apparently concluded that that is how she will succeed, by touching every base in the state," Mr. Upmeyer said. "That was always Florio's problem. When things got tough for him, he didn't have any political capital to fall back on."
It may be working. A poll by The Star-Ledger and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University found that more than a third of the public knows something about the town meetings and call-in shows that the Governor has used to sell her message that New Jersey's tax-heavy, highly regulated economy must be changed.
Meanwhile, in Trenton, where Mrs. Whitman holds one or two news conferences a day, the Governor only on Friday filled out her Cabinet by choosing a Labor Commissioner. Numerous sub-Cabinet positions remain unfilled.
 
A Small Inner Group
 As for paying for her tax cuts, Mrs. Whitman only hints that it will be painful. How painful even her allies, the leaders of the Republican majorities in the Assembly and Senate, have been kept guessing.
Indeed, Governor Whitman's public appearances, with the opportunities to communicate directly with voters, contrast with her neglect of her nominal allies, the Legislature's Republican majority. She ignored their maneuvers to find jobs for their friends in her Cabinet, and she has so far spurned their pleas for a sense of how her budget will affect their constituents.
"She keeps very close counsel with a very small group of people, but I think it's too early to say that this is wrong, because it gives her a lot of freedom," said Stephen Salmore, a political science professor at Rutgers who is also a Republican campaign consultant.
Those insiders are by all accounts within the same circle of family and old friends who helped guide her to an improbable victory last fall: her husband, John; Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the publisher; Hazel Frank Gluck, a lobbyist, and Judith Shaw, her chief of staff and Ms. Gluck's former partner.
No one in her administration has yet suggested how the Governor will handle other problems soon to come to roost on her desk; they include a court-ordered reformulation of state aid to local schools that adds $400 million annually in aid to city systems; payment of some $900 million to motorists with claims against a state-backed auto insurance pool and a court-ordered solution to overcrowding in state prisons.
 
A Meeting With Senators
 When some senators publicly balked at the Governor's policy of cutting taxes before specifying ways to make up the lost revenues, the Governor's office obligingly invited the Senate Appropriations Committee down to the Governor's wood-paneled office for a chat.
No, the senators felt constrained to object: As an equal branch of government, the Legislature expected the governor to come to it. Governor Whitman and her Treasurer, Brian W. Clymer, readily agreed, and at the meeting two Thursdays ago the senators expected to have their fears of budget chaos put to rest.
"That's not what happened," said Senator Dick LaRossa, a Republican who represents Trenton and is a member of the budget-writing committee. "They did not say, 'No, that's the case, don't worry about it.' They did not say, 'Here's how we're going to do it.' They just acknowledged our concerns and said the budget process itself is where all those issues will be resolved."
The lawmakers know that could leave them fighting among themselves over allocating the pain of the budget cuts. Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Republican Senate President, with evident frustration, issued his own declaration that school and municipal aid will not be cut under the Governor's budget, whatever it turns out to be.
Senator LaRossa, with many worried state workers among his constituents, refused to vote for the cuts and abstained. The measure passed easily on Thursday.
 
Making Promises
 Sometimes the Governor herself succumbs to the temptation to promise money she may not have. In a weeklong inspection of the state's juvenile justice system last month, she called for earlier intervention for troubled youth, more drug treatment and more follow-up on released juveniles. She has promised to keep public higher education affordable, but warned that state aid to colleges will be cut. She has criticized the mandatory sentencing that has jammed the state prisons but endorsed life sentences for felons convicted of three violent crimes.
As the state's first female governor, Mrs. Whitman also displays a rugged feminist streak. She is particularly conscious of her role as a model for girls.
"She feels very strongly about it," said Ms. Gluck, her friend. "When people come to say hello, and they bring their daughters with them to see the first female governor of the state, she feels she has a responsibility that goes beyond just being Governor."
The question of roles came up not long ago when Mrs. Whitman invited the State House reporters to tea. "You're not actually going to serve us, are you?" asked one reporter, fumbling for small talk.
"You wouldn't even ask that if she weren't a woman," one of the Governor's aides rejoined.
Under her breath, the Governor muttered, "That about goes to the heart of it."

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Seeks to Ease Home Buying

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The organization that stands behind many of the nation's mortgages is taking broad steps to make home ownership easier for lower-income Americans, particularly recent immigrants and minorities, people involved in the effort said today.
Under the new rules, banks would have more flexibility in lending to people who already owe a considerable amount of money or who cannot afford a down payment equal to 20 percent of the price of a home, the people said.
 
Tuesday Announcement
 The change is to be announced on Tuesday by the Federal National Mortgage Association, popularly known as Fannie Mae. Officials at Fannie Mae would not comment on the plan. 
 President Clinton is tentatively scheduled to attend the announcement. The Administration is urging that loans be more broadly available to poor and lower-middle-income Americans.
In addition to changing its guidelines, Fannie Mae plans a national educational campaign that will seek to teach recent immigrants and minorities how to obtain mortgages. The campaign will be aimed particularly at immigrants in a dozen "gateway" cities where the percentage of home ownership has been declining.
The long-term goal is to broaden the economic and ethnic diversity of homeowners. About 70 percent of white households now own their homes, compared with 40 percent of black and Hispanic households.
 
Two Million Excluded
 Mortgage experts have estimated that up to two million American households are excluded from buying homes now because of conservative mortgage lending standards. These include Americans with minor blemishes on their credit records, for such things as changing jobs repeatedly or failing to pay utility bills on time. Most mortgage experts assume that even people who fall behind on other bills will struggle to make mortgage payments lest they lose their homes.
"Mortgage-lending criteria have been very conservative, and we have a lot of people who should be creditworthy and have been cut out," said Thomas H. Stanton, a former Fannie Mae lawyer.
It is not clear how many of these households might be covered immediately by Fannie Mae's changes in mortgage guidelines.
Fannie Mae and the much smaller Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac, are publicly traded enterprises that were created by the Federal Government to help provide more money for mortgages. They have issued or guaranteed securities made up of about $1 trillion worth of mortgages bought from lenders.
Freddie Mac loosened its guidelines for low-income mortgages a few weeks ago. But Deepak Bhargava, the legislative director of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a New Orleans-based group of affordable housing advocates, said that Freddie Mac's guidelines remained more restrictive than Fannie Mae's.
Next week's changes in Fannie Mae's guidelines will probably widen the gap between the two institutions' policies, Mr. Bhargava said. Freddie Mac officials did not return phone calls made to their homes and office this evening.

Realty Appraisal Shift
 WASHINGTON, March 9 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The Federal Reserve loosened lending regulations today on bank holding companies by requiring fewer appraisals of property involved in real estate loans.
The rules exempt banks from conducting a real estate appraisal for loans of $250,000 or less, raising the threshold from the previous $100,000.
Appraisals on some loans are required by the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, though Congress gave Federal banking agencies the power to set a threshold to exempt smaller loans from the requirements.
Three banking regulators -- the Fed, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- proposed raising the threshold to $250,000 last June. The Fed is the only agency so far to approve the proposal.
In its proposal, the Fed staff said raising the threshold would increase the availability of credit and ease the regulatory burden on banks without endangering the safety and soundness of the banking industry.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance on Fed Economic Report

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Probably surprising even itself, the stock market chose to believe the Federal Reserve Board yesterday when the central bank reported that in January and February the American economy was moderately robust, yet showed no signs of inflation.
The Fed's message cheered the bond markets and thus helped the stock market to rally, but just barely and in only moderate trading. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.69 points, to 3,853.41. Still, the rise was significant since stocks seemed to be heading downward after lackluster sessions Monday and Tuesday. And today's session may build on yesterday's small rally if traders continue to take good news on inflation at face value. 
 The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, also helped. He said yesterday that the United States and Japan were close to an agreement on the fractious issue of Motorola's entering the Japanese cellular telephone market. Many economists would see that development as a major signal of improving trade relations with Japan that would reduce American inflationary pressures.
 
 
Tentative Reactions
 But the tiny creep upward for stocks was an indication of how tentatively traders react to good news about inflation. Traders have spent weeks talking themselves into believing that the Fed is about to raise short-term interest rates a second time, thus hurting both stocks and bonds. The Fed raised short-term rates one-quarter of a percentage point on Feb. 4.
The stock market has been largely driven by the bond market, stock traders say. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond has risen more than half a point since Feb. 2 and two-thirds of a point since Jan. 12.
"Bonds have a very, very strong influence on stocks and now the nervous money has been taken out of the market," Thomas Gallagher, a senior officer in the equity trading department of Oppenheimer & Company, said. "Everybody who wants to sell bonds has sold them."
The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.30 point, to 258.78, on volume of 309.8 million shares. But declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,098 to 1,034. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined 0.89 point, to 466.79.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 1.18 points, to 467.06, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.93 point, to 793.05.
Yesterday, the Fed reported the good inflation news around noon in its so-called beige book survey of economic conditions, but it took many stock traders more than 90 minutes to digest the news.
The S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq index did not rise convincingly until shortly after 1:30 P.M. The Dow did not rally in earnest until 3 P.M.
 
 
Computer Trading Program
 By then, a huge computer-driven trading program was beginning to affect prices, according to Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., equity research firm that tracks such program trading. A computer buy program involving as many as three million shares was executed around 2:28 P.M., Philip H. Smyth, a Birinyi analyst, said. He estimated the buy program lifted the Dow by eight points yesterday.
Such computer programs often affect the Dow industrials because the programs involve the nearly simultaneous purchase of 50 stocks culled from the S.& P. 500 and which include most, if not all, of the 30 Dow component stocks. The programs are set to buy or sell, most recently on how traders bet on short-term interest rates.
Whose computer program affected trading will not be known until stock brokerage firms release their trading records weeks or months from now.
The most active stock yesterday was Telefonos de Mexico, whose American depository receipts fell 1 7/8, to 65 1/8, on volume of six million shares. Each A.D.R. represents 20 ordinary common shares.
Telmex is such a large stock that it is often used by portfolio managers as a proxy for the Mexican stock market.

HEADLINE: Inflexible Structure Hinders the Power Authority

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
More than 50 years ago, Gov. Alfred E. Smith envisioned a state power authority that would harness the energy of Niagara Falls and the St. Lawrence River and bring the blessings of electricity to homes, farms and small factories around the state, no matter how remote.
It worked well for a long time, but not lately. 
 The New York Power Authority, which boasts of being the largest state-owned public power agency in the nation and of saving New Yorkers hundreds of millions of dollars a year on electricity, is in trouble, and some customers are wondering if it saves them anything at all.
For years, for example, utilities and industries have coveted contracts with the authority. But at the end of this month, Consolidated Edison will let one such contract lapse because Con Ed believes it can get power elsewhere for less.
The authority's largest customer, New York City, is also looking into buying power elsewhere to save money.
The underlying problem is that recession has cut the demand for power just as independent power producers are bringing new plants on line, creating a glut of electricity and the collapse of prices. That leaves the authority selling power, supposedly cut-rate, at prices higher than some private companies. For now, the authority is able to sell its power, and balance its books, but if it cannot continue to, there is a possibility that taxpayers will have to make up the difference.
 
Management Problems Cited
 In a view echoed by many, Lindsay P. Audin, the manager of energy conservation at Columbia University, said that all utilities in New York face that problem right now. The Power Authority's difficulties, he said, are compounded by "serious management problems that put its other difficulties into a higher profile."
Its biggest management problem is that its nuclear power plants run fitfully or not at all; Indian Point 3, in Buchanan has now been closed for a year because of bad management, but it is still running up high maintenance and payroll expenses.
The authority's hydroelectric plants work as well as ever, and since they are mostly paid for, their power is very cheap. But critics say that the system of distributing power -- fashioned years ago -- has greatly favored some upstate communities and offered large subsidies to some industries while leaving downstate communities paying some of the highest rates in the nation.
Many of the authority's other problems stem not from Governor Smith's concept of electrification and economic development, which was signed into law by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt, but by a later idea approved by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller when the state used the Authority to rescue Con Edison, which had overbuilt.
Two decades ago the authority bought from Con Edison the Indian Point 3 nuclear plant and a conventional plant in Queens, then called Astoria 6 and later renamed for Charles Poletti. Those plants are two sources of trouble now, because their generating costs are not competitive and because the authority can not blend their expensive power with its cheaper power.
S. David Freeman, who became president and chief executive of the authority on March 1, is to talk about the authority's problems and how to solve them at a news conference this morning.
 
A Major Producer
 Whatever the authority does it is likely to be felt around the state; the agency is a whale in the state's power pool, boasting that it supplies one-quarter of the electricity used in the state. Part of the power it distributes is bought from Hydro-Quebec for Con Edison. But the authority's own generating stations are huge, and its transmission lines stretch 14,000 miles. The authority is the lifeblood of scores of upstate industries. Through about 150 contracts for cheap power, it provided what amounts to operating subsidies to companies that employ a lot of people or are in high-technology fields that offer the promise of growth. It can do this with power from old dams.
And, the authority provides cheap power to residences upstate. Critics said the cheap power offers no incentive for residents to conserve or for industry to modernize and use less.
"Every time you use one of those cheap kilowatt-hours, somebody else, who is the last person on line, has to pay the highest price," said B. Robert Piller, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, a public interest law firm based in Albany that represents low-income utility consumers.
In 1984 Mr. Pillar studied the contracts and the size of the subsidy per job saved; in some cases, he said, it was $60,000 or $70,000. If the state had sold the power at market rates, he said, surely it could have used $70,000 to create more than one job.
The system of allocations has since become more rational, said Mr. Pillar, but it is still "outright unsound." But he and other analysts say that many of the allocations are mired in politics and unlikely to change.
John Dyson, who was chairman of the authority from 1979 until 1985 and is now a Deputy Mayor of New York City, said, "The politics is that these industries located in the Niagara Frontier and Massena because of the promise of this power, and to change it now unemploys large numbers of people."
 
Restless Customers
 Meanwhile, downstate governmental customers, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the New York City Housing Authority and various local governments, are supposed to be getting moderately-priced power, under an unusual deal struck 20 years ago in which the Power Authority took over Indian Point 3 and the conventional plant in Astoria. Along with the plants, the Power Authority also got Con Ed's governmental customers, which was essential to the authority because it could not finance the purchase with tax-free bonds unless the power went to public agencies.
But now the authority is having trouble keeping those customers satisfied, because they pay more for their bulk purchases than utilities do on the open market.
"The situation is not a very happy one," said Mr. Freeman. "We're going to have to hustle."
The authority has already cut its staff by 400 full-time positions, to about 3,400. Last year the authority promised its New York City-area customers a rate freeze through 1996, but that has not been enough to keep all of them happy.
Some problems are largely outside the authority's control.
"Right now, because of low fuel cost and low interest rates, new plants can generate power cheaper than the Power Authority's average cost," said Ashokh Gupta, a senior energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former staff member at the city's Department of Telecommunications and Energy.
According to Mr. Freeman, with surplus capacity, some suppliers are happy to offer power to the general market at anything above the cost of their fuel, and right now fuel costs are very low.
Mr. Freeman said that one of his tasks would be to determine what would happen if he wanted to retire some power plants. The Power Authority has an unusual structure, with bonds tied to individual projects, so it is not clear how the bonds would be paid off. The authority paid more than $600 million for the plants, and has invested additional amounts, especially at Indian Point 3.
This structure, Mr. Freeman said in an interview, makes the authority "an economist's dream but a manager's nightmare." An economist could tell quickly, he said, which plants are competitive and which are not, because their power is marketed individually. But any other utility, he said, could blend its high- and low-priced sources together, producing an average price that is still quite reasonable. The power authority, however, because of the laws that established it, must sell power from each project at prices that reflect the cost of that project.

Dollar Rises Against Yen, Buoyed by Hopes on Trade

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, buoyed by new hopes for possible easing of the trade frictions between the United States and Japan.
The dollar received early help after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said progress had been made in a cellular phone dispute with Japan. He said an agreement, which has yet to be announced, would bode well for future trade relations. 
 "We got a decent move up in the dollar, triggered by Kantor's comments," said Jim Phoenix, foreign exchange dealer for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The dollar rose to 105.80 yen in late New York trading, from 105.30 yen on Tuesday.
Mr. Kantor's comments came on the heels of the move by President Clinton last week to reinstate his authority under a measure known as Super 301 authority, which would enable him to impose strong trade sanctions quickly.
 
Deal 'Looks Possible'
 "A cellular phone deal looks possible and would smooth over some of the ill will between the two countries," Mr. Phoenix said. "It looks like a move in the right direction and Kantor's comments provided an opportunity to buy dollars against yen."
But the dollar remained in a slump against the German mark and other major currencies after the Bundesbank shaved its repurchase rate just three basis points, to 5.94 percent.
Dealers said the dollar fell as the Bundesbank's move made it less likely that German interest rates would drop this year.
"The dollar's having difficulty penetrating the upside due to concerns about German rates going higher," one dealer said.
The dollar eased to 1.7070 German marks in late New York trading, from 1.7148 marks on Tuesday. In London, it fell to 1.7084 marks, from 1.7185 on Tuesday.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the most active April gold contract gained $2.40, to $380.10 an ounce.
The dollar barely moved on the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report on American business conditions. The beige book, which Fed officials use as a basis for periodic discussions on money and credit policy, said the economy was growing and that consumer prices were steady.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Rutgers and West Virginia Are Invited to Join Big East

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
The Big East invited Rutgers and West Virginia to become full-time members yesterday in a compromise that expanded the basketball conference to 12 schools and averted a split that had threatened its future.
After voting down proposals of expansion to 13 or 14 members, which could have added Temple and Virginia Tech to the basketball league, the presidents of the 10 Big East schools approved the two-team expansion by a vote of 7-3, the minimum required under conference regulations. 
 The Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the president of St. John's and newly elected chairman of the conference presidents, said that the new members would join the basketball league no earlier than the 1995-96 season, in part not to disrupt next season's schedules. The Big East will retain a one-division format, with teams playing each of the other members at least once and in some cases twice.
After weeks of discussion, in a process that Mike Tranghese, the Big East commissioner, considered the most serious crisis in the league's 15-year history, Big East presidents preserved the conference by establishing equality between the interests of members that play Division I-A football and those that do not. That balance helped secure the decisive support of St. John's, the only school voting in favor of expansion that does not play major-college football and is not contemplating a move to that level.
"There was a strong, strong sense, from football as well as basketball schools, that we wanted to do everything we could to keep the Big East together," the Rev. Harrington said last night. "We wanted to see if we could preserve this."
By adding Rutgers, which had reportedly discussed the possibility of joining the Big Ten, the Big East prevents that league from establishing a presence in the New York market. The Atlantic 10 will lose Rutgers and West Virginia, but keep Temple.
The complex discussions leading to yesterday's decision, made during a meeting in midtown Manhattan, resulted from a problem not faced by older, more traditional conferences. The Big East, which sponsors 10 men's sports and nine women's sports, became divided by dramatic differences in the levels of commitment to football. Such a dichotomy existed from its beginnings in 1979 and intensified when the conference added Miami in 1990 and established a football league the following year.
Four of the league's full-time members -- Boston College, Miami, Pittsburgh and Syracuse -- had threatened to combine with the four football-only members -- Rutgers, West Virginia, Temple and Virginia Tech -- to form a separate all-sports league if expansion was not approved. They had negotiated a five-year, $65 million contract with CBS that takes effect in 1996.
Their departure would have forced the schools without major football programs -- Connecticut, Georgetown, St. John's, Seton Hall, Providence and Villanova -- to reestablish their identity in a scaled-down Big East, possibly with the addition of Notre Dame. As discussions dragged on -- through a Feb. 25 meeting in Boston in which the presidents were unable to arrive at a conclusion -- the destructive threat of a potential imbalance became clear. The basketball schools feared that a 14-team league, with eight schools playing Division I-A football, would create a perpetual 8-6 vote favoring football interests.
 
A Two-Step Solution
 Two actions by the presidents helped solve the problem. They voted to change the minimum number of votes for approval in the future from two-thirds of the membership to three-fourths. The presidents also secured the support of Connecticut and Villanova by determining that members could elevate their football programs to the I-A level by declaring an intention by 1998 and meeting N.C.A.A. requirements for participation at that level by 2002.
That provided Villanova and Connecticut, which have both considered upgrading their programs to the I-A level, an opportunity to join the conference's football membership after a reasonable amount of time to prepare for that step. Those two votes, combined with those of Boston College, Miami, Pittsburgh and Syracuse, left the expansion proponents one vote short of approval.
St. John's became a decisive factor in the compromise when the Rev. Harrington determined, after a series of meetings with university officials, that the preservation of the league would be in the school's best interests if a balance between football and basketball interests could be achieved.
The Rev. Harrington said the compromise of a 12-team league was first raised when the presidents initially met in Boston. "Some, perhaps legitimately, believe football and basketball cannot coexist," he said.
St. John's did not support the proposal to expand to 14 because of the imbalance favoring football and the logistical problems a basketball league of that size would have created. Once that proposal failed, the major football schools were left with an economic decision.
Tranghese said a departure from the league would have required each school to make a withdrawal payment of at least $1 million and forfeit a share of conference revenue from the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, a total that could exceed $5 million after the 1994 tournament.

HEADLINE: To 3 R's, Some Add Emotions

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN 

 BODY:
ANGER, disgust, fear, joy -- a kaleidoscope of feelings washes over the faces of a class of fifth graders at the Troup Middle School in New Haven. Locked in concentration, they are mimicking the expressions on faces pictured on a handout about the specific facial-muscle recipes for each emotion. It's an exercise in empathy: they practice the expressions and talk about the feelings that go with the face. 
 While this may seem a rudimentary lesson in emotional literacy, it is one that some children fail: schoolyard fighters, researchers find, typically interpret benign expressions as hostile and, so, react to provocation where none was intended.
While there have long been courses in values and moral development, or programs warning against perils like pregnancy and drugs, there have only recently been any meant solely to foster emotional abilities like empathy, impulse control and social problem solving.
"People are clamoring for violence prevention," said Tim Shriver, a pioneer in the emotional education movement who directs the social development program for the New Haven schools, which the Troup pupils are following. "We had a war on drugs, and before that, one on teen pregnancy." Saying the nation doesn't need any more such "wars," he added, "What we need is to build basic competencies in kids that work for all these specific battles and leave them with essential skills for living."
A University of Vermont study released in December found that the last two decades had seen a steady and sometimes precipitous climb nationwide in rates of violence and problems ranging from depression and anxiety to disobedience, vandalism and violence among children of all economic levels.
Thomas Achenbach, who directed the study, and other experts on family life point to a range of causes, including a drop in the time parents spend with their children because of work and other pressures, and a rise in the number of single-parent homes. As a result, children spend more time on their own, looking to other children rather than to adults for basic emotional lessons, like caring about how other people feel.
For the last 12 years, Mr. Shriver has been a fixture at Hillhouse High School, a sprawling 1950's building in a dying neighborhood of New Haven -- an area where many schoolchildren live in poverty, a number have parents with AIDS or are themselves infected, and shootings are routine. In this decaying urban core, Mr. Shriver has spearheaded a citywide effort to increase the social and emotional skills that children need more than ever to navigate the perils they face on their journey to adulthood.
For five years now, the 18,000 students in New Haven's 45 public schools have been studying such essentials for life as how to handle their grief and anger, how to negotiate rather than fight and how to cooperate in the classroom, on the playground and at home.
The curriculum, developed by a team of New Haven educators and Yale University psychologists, starts in kindergarten and continues through high school.
The specifics vary depending on the emotional lessons children are able to learn at a particular age. For example, when children start school, social emotions like jealousy and pride come to the fore, while in later grades, friendship skills are of crucial importance. The idea is to offer every child emotional coaching, which otherwise, parents, even in stable families, may or may not have provided effectively.
Some education experts, while acknowledging the urgency of the problems, balk at the new courses.
"There is an urgent need to create a climate of civility in schools," said Dr. Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Commissioner of Education under President Jimmy Carter. "But I don't think we should assume every problem needs a separate course instead of weaving it into existing ones. The curriculum is getting stretched beyond belief."
Recognizing the problem, the life skills curriculum -- like many other such programs -- is partly folded into existing courses like physical education and history. But teachers also say they do not mind the added topics, because of the effect on their classroom itself.
"I find the life skills course helps me deal with confrontations and handling problems that come up with my students," said Joyce Andrews, the Troup School fifth-grade teacher whose class was studying facial expressions.
Based on comparisons with students who have not received the programs, there is evidence that there are measurable benefits from the handful of existing emotional education programs -- not just in New Haven, but in hundreds of other schools from Seattle to the Bronx. The benefits include, for instance, a 34 percent drop in suspensions in the New Haven schools, a more congenial classroom atmosphere, fewer fights and disruptiveness, and an increase in children's ability to think before they act and to pay attention and learn.
Perhaps more telling is the recent tale of a sixth grader at Troup who passed her social development teacher a note about her best friend, an eighth grader who was planning suicide because she was pregnant. The girl said she did this because she knew the teacher cared.
Encouraged by the solid signs of success, Mr. Shriver, 34, has taken a decisive step: last month, he established the Center for the Advancement of Emotional and Social Learning at Yale to help teachers and school administrators across the nation who want to set up similar programs.
"Many educators are waking up to the fact that it's not enough just to suspend kids for fighting," Mr. Shriver said. "That it's better to improve the relationship between teachers and students to prevent dropouts and that all students need a solid core of emotional skills in life."
The center will act as a national clearinghouse of information not only about the New Haven program, Mr. Shriver said, but also about a spectrum of similar programs.
The fledgling movement has emerged in part from the wreckage of earlier classroom efforts aimed at isolated problems, with violence prevention being the cause of the moment. A five-year study commissioned by the W. T. Grant Foundation weighed measures of the problems the programs were supposed to prevent, like drug abuse. It concluded that some programs were worthless, and that those that worked best included a broader and prolonged training in basic emotional skills like impulse control and solving conflicts.
Schools are increasingly seen as one bastion that can help take up the slack in socializing the young, and the center is a tacit recognition of the need to expand the mandate of schools beyond academic skills.
Mr. Shriver's center is housed in the Yale Child Studies Center, which has incubated other influential programs in education. Notable among them is the successful model for schools of Dr. James Comer, which seeks to improve the climate of schools through teams of parents, educators and community leaders.
Mr. Shriver is himself a disciple of Dr. Comer, a psychiatrist; in keeping with the Comer approach, the emotional education course is matched with a range of complementary after-school programs. One, for example, recruits adults as mentors for schoolchildren who are foundering.
"A student may confide to his mentor that he's thinking of running away from home because he fights with his mother," Mr. Shriver said. "The mentor can say, 'Why don't you stop first and think of some alternative ways to deal with this, like you've been learning in class?'
"One thing is clear: the proving ground for social problem solving is the cafeteria, the streets or home."

Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat, heads the House subcommittee in charge of Medicare. So it comes as no surprise that his idea of health-care reform is to shove as many Americans as possible into Medicare, making him czar over an industry almost as large as the Italian economy.
But while Medicare-for-all might be the right prescription for Mr. Stark, it is the wrong reform for the rest of us. Medicare has demonstrably failed to control costs and provide first-rate care. Building reform on the Medicare model would send health care careering in the wrong direction. 
 Mr. Stark would open Medicare -- the Government plan that pays hospital and doctor bills for the elderly -- to the uninsured of any age. The new program, which he calls Medicare Part C, would charge premiums to cover its costs. That is unlike existing Medicare, which charges enrollees only 10 percent of their medical cost (a fact that explains the program's popularity among the elderly).
Mr. Stark rejects the reforms of Mr. Clinton and Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, which are designed to control costs by forcing large health plans to compete against one another. He would, instead, attempt to control costs by slapping price controls on doctors and hospitals. That is the system that Medicare uses now. And it fails. Medicare costs spiral out of control because while Washington can control prices, it cannot control volume -- how many office visits, tests and procedures doctors provide patients.
The Stark plan is dismayingly backward-looking. Price controls, he proposes, would be based on how much Americans have spent in the past on individual health services. But in a system in which, as studies show, perhaps one-third of expenditures are wasted, such a calculation would lock in bad practice.
Medicare's fee-for-service coverage, which reimburses doctors for nearly anything they do, rewards doctors and hospitals for providing unneeded procedures. In attempting to control that problem, Washington has been forced to impose incomprehensibly complex regulations. The result is a system that does not constrain costs and drives providers toward procedures that patients do not need but that involve risk.
A better way to achieve high-quality, affordable health care is the creation of integrated networks of doctors and hospitals that are paid a fixed annual fee for taking care of enrollees. That way doctors have incentive to keep patients healthy, with ample doses of preventive care, and to weed out unwarranted procedures. That is the approach adopted by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Cooper. Mr. Stark wants to push health care back to the past.

HEADLINE: U.S. TIGHTENS RULES TO HELP INVESTORS IN MUNICIPAL BONDS

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
In an effort to help the millions of Americans who own municipal bonds, the Federal Government issued new rules today intended to make it easier for them to keep track of the value of their bonds, which are often a major part of their life savings.
American households own $488 billion worth of municipal bonds directly and an additional $414 billion through mutual funds and other investment vehicles, making individuals by far the dominant investors in the $1.2 trillion market. Investors increasingly choose these securities because they do not have to pay taxes on the interest they receive. Over the last 10 years, individual ownership has jumped to nearly 75 percent of the market from less than 45 percent. 
 But buyers of tax-exempt municipal bonds sold by large cities like New York or tiny agencies like the Sterling Independent School District No. 3 in Oklahoma have had no assurance that they could learn about important financial developments: a ballooning budget deficit, for example, or the missing of an interest payment. Either development would make the bonds much less valuable.
 
Notification of Trouble
 Under the proposal issued today by the Securities and Exchange Commission, state and local governments and authorities would have to issue annual financial reports after the initial sale of a new bond, some of which do not mature for 30 years. There is currently no such disclosure requirement.
In addition, governments that sell bonds would also have to notify investors if they run into the kind of financial trouble, like a lower credit rating, that could instantly undermine the value of the tax-exempt bonds investors own.
Though these new regulations remain far less strict than those governing corporations that sell stocks and bonds to the public, they mark a radical change in the huge, lightly regulated tax-exempt bond market, which has been rocked by political and financial scandals in the last few years.
 
Role in Most Mishaps
 "It's been hard for investors to evaluate individual issues, given the quality of disclosure," said John Markese, research director for the American Association of Individual Investors. The S.E.C. plan could prevent the problem, he said, "where you buy a bond and 20 years later a default or a ratings change hits the individual out of the blue."
As new investors move billions of their dollars into municipal bonds, directly and through mutual funds, the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., said, "it becomes particularly imperative that this vital constituency understand what they are buying and what they are paying for."
S.E.C. officials say inadequate disclosure of financial data has played a big role in most municipal bond market mishaps since the New York City fiscal crisis in the 1970's. These include the largest tax-exempt bond default ever, by the Washington Public Power Supply System, as well as a series of small defaults by nursing homes across the country.
The S.E.C. is also concerned that investors with information about problems in a bond issue have taken advantage of the lack of generally available data "and unloaded the bonds on unsuspecting retail investors," said Richard Y. Roberts, the S.E.C. commissioner who has been a leading critic of municipal market practices.
The problem is particularly acute in the case of issues that governments sell on behalf of private companies to generate economic development or promote local projects like hospitals and nursing homes, said Richard A. Ciccarone, senior vice president of Kemper Securities in Chicago.
"Though these situations are in the minority rather than the majority, they are common enough to be concerned about," he said. Last year, for example, holders of an $8.6 million issue sold by the Bartlesville, Okla., Industrial Development Authority saw the price of their bonds fall, but the authority refused to release any information that would explain the decline. Bondholders were left worrying that the project might default on the bonds and are still in the dark, Mr. Ciccarone said.
The proposed disclosure rules are one of two big changes being made in the operation of the municipal bond market. The other is a broad restriction on political contributions from the municipal industry to local and state officials in an effort to win lucrative contracts to underwrite, or sell, municipal bonds.
The municipal industry has already put into effect a voluntary ban on such contributions. And a Government rule backing up this ban, supported by the S.E.C., is expected to go into effect this spring.
In general, governments should be able to comply with the new disclosure rules without much trouble, said Jeffrey L. Esser, executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association in Chicago. Many already produce annual audited financial statements, which the new regulations will require, he said.
As for the requirement that governments tell investors about material problems like defaults on interest payments or a finding that bonds are not tax-exempt, Mr. Esser said, "those happen rarely to any issuer" and should be reported.
 
Costlier for Governments
 The trade organization for the mutual fund industry, the Investment Company Institute, said its members support efforts to improve the information available about municipal bonds. Fund managers, who are now the largest buyers of tax-exempt securities, say better disclosure will help them value bonds properly and protect fund shareholders.
While large issuers like New York City, which was the biggest seller of bonds last year, probably will not feel much effect from the new regulations, they may have more impact on taxpayers in smaller cities and towns, which may find it more expensive to borrow the money they need to buy school buses, fix sewers and build bridges because of the cost of periodic financial disclosure. "This will materially increase the cost of issuance for small issuers," warned Leo C. O'Neill, the president of Standard & Poor's ratings group.
Mr. O'Neill said the new increased disclosure would not have much effect on his firm, which now rates about 80 percent of the municipal bonds outstanding. But, he added, "it will be an additional incentive for the governments and may make things a little easier for us: we may not have to keep sending out all those letters" requesting financial updates.
Although government and market participants were reluctant to endorse the S.E.C. plan today because they had not seen the details, they had been closely involved in the writing of the proposal.
"We are encouraged that the S.E.C. proposed rule amendments reflects many of the ideas contained in a statement we issued jointly with the Government Finance Officers Association and other issuer and industry groups last December," said Heather Ruth, the president of the Public Securities Association, which represents municipal bond dealers.
 
Industry Changes Attitude
 What Mrs. Ruth did not say in her statement was that the praise for the S.E.C. move reflected a change in attitude of the industry, which had been generally opposed to such new disclosure requirements as recently as last year.
Congress has never given the S.E.C. direct power over state and local governments, which sell municipal bonds. The agency will instead enforce the new rules using its power over investment firms.
Investment banks will no longer be able to sell new bonds for local and state governments if the issuers do not agree to provide investors with continuing financial information by sending audited annual reports to a central depository. Governments must agree to inform a registry at once if they have a serious, material problem, like failing to make an interest payment.
In an effort to insure that investors get the benefit of the newly required disclosure, brokers will be barred from recommending bonds outstanding to clients unless they have reviewed the most recent financial data available.
 
Final Version in 4 Months
 The commission will not adopt a final version of these requirements for four months, giving investors, government officials, bond dealers and others time to comment on the plan. But Mr. Levitt made it clear that the changes would go into effect. As of now, these rules will apply only to bonds sold in the future.
"To a significant degree, the debt markets operate based upon traditions, many are going to view these proposals as disruptive since they call for a change in traditional practices," Mr. Levitt said. "I intend to pay close attention to the comments. But, over time, I believe that these innovations will be viewed as anything but disruptive."
In an additional measure to bolster investor protection, the S.E.C. plans to require bond dealers to inform buyers if a bond is not rated by an independent agency. Brokers will also have to disclose in many cases how much of a profit -- or markup -- they are charging customers when bonds are traded. Mr. Levitt said he feared that many investors were like his mother, who did not realize that she was paying a markup. Because she was told she did not have to pay a commission on the transaction, Mr. Levitt said she thought she was getting a bargain.
The least onerous of the new regulations are steps the S.E.C. says governments can take to make it easier for them to defend themselves against accusations of securities fraud in the future. These steps, which are suggested but not required, include disclosing potential conflicts of interest and financial ties among government officials and brokerage firm executives that sell their bonds.
The new disclosure regulations will probably exempt governments that have sold less than $3 million of bonds in the last four years and have less than $10 million outstanding. But the S.E.C. may modify or limit that exemption because many of the bond issues that have burned investors in recent years have been small deals done for nursing homes and hospitals.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on March 10 about new financial disclosure rules for the municipal bond market misstated the position of the Public Securities Association. The association, which represents municipal bond dealers, has supported the need for issuers of bonds to report regularly on their financial status after the initial sale of the bonds.

A Corporate Hybrid of New Cereals

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company, the nation's largest maker of breakfast cereal, said yesterday that it had agreed to produce a new line under the Healthy Choice brand name in a licensing deal with Conagra Inc.
The arrangement is a first for both companies. Kellogg has never licensed a cereal brand from another company, nor has Conagra let another company use its Healthy Choice name. Financial terms of the joint venture were not disclosed. 
 "It's very unusual," said Lawrence Adelman, a food analyst for Dean Witter. The alliance creates some potential economic advantages for both companies, but whether it pays off with consumers will take longer to determine, he said.
Kellogg's shares, which had risen 87.5 cents Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement, fell $1 yesterday, to $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"The hype was not justified," Mr. Adelman said.
Conagra shares rose to $28, up 75 cents, also on the Big Board.
 
Out of Space
 Conagra has 300 products under the Healthy Choice label, including soups, frozen dinners and ice cream, but only egg substitutes in the breakfast area. The brand line, which was started six years ago, accounted for $1 billion of Conagra's $21 billion in sales last year. But the company, which is based in Omaha, does not have the manufacturing capacity for all its Healthy Choice products, many of which are made in plants of private-label producers.
The alliance with Kellogg gives Conagra a relatively inexpensive means to broaden its product line. "The cereal business is very capital-intensive from a start-up basis," Mr. Adelman said.
Kellogg has an opportunity to bolster its 37 percent share of the $8 billion cereal business by adding three varieties to the 45 brands it produces. "They will get a jump-start because of the brand name," Mr. Adelman said.
Karen MacLeod, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, said, "This will bring the Healthy Choice consumer into the breakfast category."
The cereal, which will have the green Healthy Choice packaging along with the red Kellogg name, will be available in June for $2.50 to $3.50 a box, in sizes ranging from 11.5 ounces to 16.5 ounces. It will come in three varieties: flakes, squares and multigrain clusters. Consumers gave the cereal high scores in taste tests, Ms. MacLeod said.
The cereal is to be marketed to adults, who can already choose from shelves full of rival brands, like Nabisco Shredded Wheat, General Mills' Total and General Foods' Fruit & Fiber.

HEADLINE: 7 Chinese Intellectuals Appeal For End to Political Repression

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 10

 BODY:
Challenging the Government's latest crackdown on dissidents, seven leading scientists and intellectuals appealed in writing today to President Jiang Zemin for an end to repression of free speech and for the release of all political prisoners.
The appeal, which coincided with the opening session of the National People's Congress, was made available to Western journalists a day before Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to begin an official visit. It is believed to be the first petition to the Chinese Government on human rights from a group of eminent intellectuals since the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989.
 
Arrests Are Protested
 The group said it was protesting the arrests and intimidation of dissidents during the last week in advance of Mr. Christopher's visit and the opening of the Chinese congress. 
 "We appeal to the authorities to bravely end our country's history of punishing people for their ideas, speech and writing, and release all those imprisoned because of their ideas and speech," said the petition, signed by seven intellectuals. The group was led by Xu Liangying, a 74-year-old historian of the Academy of Sciences who helped translate Albert Einstein's collected works into Chinese.
"People of insight, who are concerned with the fate of the nation and who are dedicated to our country's modernization, feel shocked and at the same time upset and worried," the statement said, adding, "To talk about modernization without mentioning human rights is like climbing a tree to catch a fish." [Text of appeal, page A10.]
The tone and spirit of the statement recalled the popular movement that rose in the winter of 1989 and gathered momentum that spring, first among intellectuals, then among students and workers. Their protests in favor of democracy paralyzed Beijing and seized international attention for weeks until the movement was crushed by tanks and machine-gun fire in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
 
Petition Mailed to Officials
 Mr. Xu said he mailed the petition today to President Jiang and to Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament. Official Chinese news organizations have not yet reported the appeal, but its existence is likely to become widely known here through foreign radio broadcasts beamed to China.
Providing a copy of the petition to The New York Times, Professor Xu asked that it be conveyed to Mr. Christopher and expressed a desire to meet with him during his three-day visit, which begins on Friday.
Mr. Christopher, speaking during his visit to Tokyo, sought to play down expectations that he might meet with Chinese dissidents, saying he had no "plans to do so at the present time." [Page A10.]
The other signers were Ding Zilin and Jiang Peikun, philosophy professors whose son was killed during the military crackdown four years ago; Shao Yanxiang, a poet; the writer Zhang Kangkang; Liu Liao, a physicist; and Professor Xu's wife, Wang Laili, a historian.
All are well known and command great respect in Chinese society, which prizes its intellectuals.
Professor Xu's reputation among the Chinese is also based on his long service to the Communist Party, the persecution he suffered after criticizing Mao Zedong's purges and finally, his break with Marxism.
Rehabilitated in the late 1970's after Deng Xiaoping came to power, he formed a alliance with other intellectuals and reignited what became known as the "science and democracy" movement.
In an interview in his apartment in Beijing's university district, Professor Xu sharply criticized China's leadership for zeroing in on the youthful leaders of a reinvigorated democracy movement this winter in Beijing and Shanghai.
"They are being detained or arrested only because of their speech," he said. "It is the responsibility of us senior intellectuals to defend them."
More pointedly, he said the petition showed "that the Chinese people have not died out; not everyone in China is dead. There are still some people who can petition for human rights."
President Clinton has warned China that it could lose its preferential trade status with the United States this June if it does not take concrete steps to improve its human rights policy.
 
Rights Campaign Planned
 In another challenge apparently linked to Mr. Christopher's imminent arrival, Wang Dan, a former student leader who has been detained twice in the last week, announced in an open letter to China's Parliament that he would begin a "legal and open" campaign to investigate human rights abuses in China.
"I will, on my own identity, conduct detailed investigations on some specific cases involving human rights," Mr. Wang said in a statement faxed to offices of Western news agencies.
"I don't avoid mentioning human rights issues," he said. "My opinions differ in many respects from the authorities but I don't want to impose my views on the Government. I only hope the Government could abide by the law when enforcing laws and truly safeguard the rights of the citizens, including those detained."
The statements are among the most vigorous and open challenges to the Communist Party's suppression of free speech in recent years. They were issued on a day when Prime Minister Li Peng, addressing the opening session of the National People's Congress, declared that "social stability" -- a code word for political repression -- would remain an "indispensible prerequisite" for economic development.
 
Signs of Defiance
 Around the capital, there were other signs of defiance.
Wei Jingsheng, the country's most prominent dissident, who left the capital last weekend after 30 hours of detention and interrogation, called other members of the dissident community today and told them to expect a "great event" during Mr. Christopher's visit.
Mr. Wei has been staying at a hotel in Tianjin since he was released last by security agents Saturday. He told security officials he was leaving Beijing for health reasons.
There has been wide speculation that American officials and Mr. Wei were making preparations for a meeting since Feb. 27, when Mr. Wei met for 90 minutes with the State Department's top human rights official, John Shattuck.
Beijing's diplomatic quarter seemed to be braced for a bruising exchange between Mr. Christopher and President Jiang, who has assured a series of American officials in recent months that China planned to take steps "within the framework of its laws" to respond to President Clinton's demand for "significant progress" on rights.
China has yet to deliver on the pledge, and some diplomats believe that any concessions from the Politburo will come in the final weeks or perhaps days before the June 3 deadline Mr. Clinton has effectively set.
For now Mr. Christopher's high-profile visit, his first to Beijing as Secretary of State, has given China's dissidents their greatest opportunity since 1989 to resurface and submit a new set of demands for civil rights and democracy to a Politburo accustomed to quieting its critics.
Professor Xu's credibility cannot easily be shaken by the authorities. He and Mr. Qiao, now one of the most powerful members of the Politburo, were part of the Communist underground together in southern China during the 1940's.
He received a prestigious academic appointment after the Communist victory in 1949, but his criticism of Mao's purge of intellectuals in the summer of 1957 led to 20 years of political persecution.
 
Letters Are Confiscated
 The New York-based group Human Rights in China said that security agents confiscated letters carried by one of its founders, Li Xiaorong, at Shanghai's international airport.
[Early Friday morning, the police in Shanghai detained Wang Fuchen, 39, the Secretary General of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights, Reuters reported.]
Ms. Li reported that the agents had seized a letter from Professor Xu that she was carrying back to New York. It appealed for financial aid to the families of students wounded during the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Also confiscated, the group said, were a personal letter from Mr. Wei to Liu Qing, the director of the human rights group, and a letter from Xu Wenli, a democracy campaigner released from prison last year, to a French magazine.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO ALLOW SALE OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR SPY SATELLITES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced today that it would allow companies to market sophisticated spy satellite technology to commercial customers around the world.
The decision marks a big change from the comparatively strict limits now imposed on satellite-imaging systems, and it caps more than a year of intense debate among the Commerce Department, the Pentagon and Government intelligence agencies. 
 The move, which could attract business worth hundreds of millions of dollars to American industry, also marks one of the clearest examples so far of the Administration's intention to emphasize commercial and economic priorities over more traditional cold war-era concerns about national security.
 
 
Change Raises Concern
 Some security experts questioned the decision to allow wider access to a technology that has been described as one of the most powerful tools in America's espionage arsenal. But others said that the technology was already becoming available in other countries and that American companies should be allowed to profit from the trend.
Under the new policy, American companies will be allowed to build and operate for-profit satellite systems that can photograph objects on the ground as small as one square yard, smaller than a subcompact car or a hot-dog stand.
Several American companies, among them the Lockheed Corporation, are hoping to set up satellite-imaging services for customers around the world. As envisioned by Lockheed, customers would be able to transmit instructions directly to the satellite, which would turn its cameras to the desired location and then beam the images back to the ground. Such customers might include oil and mining companies and environmental researchers, who want to map the precise characteristics of large swaths of land.
 
'A New Era'
 Administration officials said companies would also have greater freedom to export entire satellite systems to foreign countries, though such sales will still require State Department approval.
"This is 1994," David J. Barram, Deputy Secretary of Commerce, said in an interview today. "This is a new era. We believe national security and economic security are intertwined. In order to have national security, you have to have vibrant and competitive industries that are allowed to do what they do best."
But some experts warned that the decision could severely compromise national security by letting hostile countries use America's own spy technology to obtain detailed images of sensitive military installations in the United States or to plan military activities elsewhere in the world.
"The main customers for these systems will be the intelligence agencies of other countries," predicted John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a nonprofit group devoted to science and public policy. "They have fairly strong safeguards here. But in practice it is going to be difficult to prevent North Korea or Iraq from using a front company to gain spy satellite photos in the same way they acquired nuclear and chemical missile technology."
Numerous companies already market commercial satellite images, which can be used for mapping, geologic surveys and even agricultural purposes, like remote monitoring of cattle herds.
 
 
Best Current System
 But currently, the most sophisticated of these services is offered by Spot Image, a French company, and it cannot produce photographs showing land areas smaller than about 10 yards in diameter. And while the Spot system is being upgraded, it will still be unable to view areas smaller than five yards.
Lockheed and other American companies have been arguing for permission to operate systems that could depict objects about a square yard in size, a request that had been resisted by the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency.
 Despite the agencies' concerns, Administration officials said today that they fully intended to approve requests like those of Lockheed, and went on to argue that the higher-resolution images are essential if any significant commercial market is to be formed. The Commerce Department says that remote-sensing services, as they are known, currently make up a $400 million market worldwide; the market is expected to grow to about $2 billion by the year 2000.
Besides Lockheed, two other American companies have sought permission to operate high-resolution satellite-imaging services. One is the Orbital Sciences Corporation, a small rocket and satellite company based in Dulles, Va. The other is World View Inc., a start-up company in Livermore, Calif.
Administration officials said that while the companies intended to adopt the precise technology that has long been used on Government spy satellites, the new policy included a number of safeguards to prevent the technology from falling into the wrong hands.
As happens now, the Commerce Department must still approve each application to operate a commercial satellite surveillance system or to sell such a system within the United States -- or to market the services around the world. Sales of such equipment outside the country, however, will be subject to the export-control procedures already in place for products that have military applications, which means that each sale must be approved by the State Department and that sales to hostile countries will likely be blocked. But under the new policy, the Government would be much more likely to approve spy satellite exports.
 To prevent the misuse of satellite data sold by the new commercial services, the Government said the companies would have to maintain a record of every job the satellite had been instructed to carry out. Moreover, the satellites cannot scramble their transmissions with coding technology that the Government cannot decipher. An oil company could protect its business secrets - for example, by transmitting its exploration photos in scrambled form -- but the Government would have the right to decode them.
 
 
Government Intervention
 In addition, the new policy leaves room for the Government to shut down a satellite system during what an Administration statement described as "periods when national security or international obligations and/or foreign policies may be compromised." But industry officials who support the new policy said they had been assured by Commerce Department officials that the country would need to be in a "Persian Gulf situation" before it began shutting down systems.
Executives at companies that have pressed for more liberal rules said the new policy gave them virtually everything they wanted.
"We are very pleased that the Administration put together such a forward-thinking policy that allows the application of defense technology for commercial purposes," said Brian Dailey, vice president at the Washington office of Lockheed.
Gilbert Rye, corporate vice president at Orbital Sciences, echoed that view. "It's an outstanding development," he said.
 Today's decision was supported, at least in public, by the Defense Department and other agencies concerned with national security issues, despite earlier resistance. Two Central Intelligence Agency officials were present at a news briefing for reporters today, though they did not make any comments.
Some longtime national security experts said the new policy made sense, given the proliferation of satellite imaging technology around the world. "Inevitably, we're going to see a proliferation of systems, publicly available throughout the world, with this capability," said Martin Faga, who served under President Bush as director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the highly secret agency that builds spy satellites.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Offer by Northrop For Grumman Tops Martin Marietta Bid

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In what appeared to set off a bidding war, the Northrop Corporation offered late yesterday to purchase the Grumman Corporation, the Long Island warplane manufacturer, for $60 a share, or $2.04 billion. The Northrop offer came three days after the Martin Marietta Corporation announced that it would purchase Grumman for $55 a share.
The battle for Grumman underscores two aspects of weapons making in the post-cold war era. One is that Pentagon spending for weapons and research, projected at $88 billion this year, is still a very good business for the half-dozen or so manufacturers that survive as major military contractors. The other is that no matter which company -- Northrop or Martin Marietta -- wins Grumman, the new, merged concern will close plants and cut staff. 
 "We certainly need to rationalize the business as the defense market shrinks," Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop, said in an interview, using a euphemism to refer to cost-cutting, largely by eliminating duplicate operations. But his emphasis yesterday was on preserving Grumman. He said that if the merger went through, the new company would be named the Northrop-Grumman Corporation "to preserve the proud heritage of the Grumman name."
The issue of another reduction in Grumman's staff -- already down to 18,000 from 33,000 in 1987 -- seems likely to play a bigger role in this takeover battle than in previous ones involving military contractors. Grumman employees own a third of the company's stock, and this stake is managed by representatives of the workers. They will have to decide whether to tender their shares to Martin Marietta or to Northrop. Presumably they would take job security, as well as money, into consideration.
Whoever wins the bidding, the acquisition of Grumman would be the ninth major merger of two military contractors since 1990, when the cold war was clearly ending and big cutbacks in Pentagon spending for new weapons were getting under way. Martin Marietta has been the most aggressive in acquiring other companies and if it gets Grumman, it would emerge as the nation's largest aerospace-electronics concern. The Grumman bid is Northrop's first attempt at a major acquisition.
Martin Marietta had announced on Monday an offer of $55 a share, or $1.9 billion. The directors of Grumman and Martin Marietta had approved this offer, which came after Grumman in February had broken off talks with Northrop. The Northrop offer ups the ante by $5 a share. Northrop said that it would acquire the shares by drawing on a new credit of $2.8 billion that it had obtained from Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank.
The extra $760 million in financing beyond the $2.04 billion that Northrop offered yesterday suggested that the California-based company was prepared to go higher if Martin Marietta increased its bid, although Mr. Kresa, during a telephone news conference, declined to say how the extra financing would be used. Wall Street also anticipated a bidding war. Grumman's stock price rose by $6.75 a share, to $61.75, after the Northrop offer was announced. The New York Stock Exchange had already closed, but trading was still open in California.
 
 
'Read the Tea Leaves'
 Asked during the telephone news conference whether $60 a share would be Northrop's top bid, Richard Waugh, Northrop's chief financial officer, said: "I cannot comment on this. Read the tea leaves."
Mr. Kresa insisted that Northrop and Grumman fit easily together. Northrop, he noted, makes bombers, notably the B-2, while Grumman makes surveillance aircraft, mainly the Navy E-2C Hawkeye. Its most famous plane, the F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, is no longer manufactured, but the Pentagon pays Grumman millions of dollars to rebuild F-14's, primarily by hollowing out the airframes and installing new electronic gear.
"Northrop and Martin Marietta both want to get into this niche rebuilding business, which is lucrative, at a time when Pentagon spending on new weapons is shrinking," said Greg Bischak, executive director of the National Commission for Economic Conversion, a Washington research and lobby group. Mr. Waugh of Northrop described the aircraft rebuilding at Grumman as "a very sizeable piece of business."
The armed services spend $13 billion a year on rebuilding aircraft and other weaponry and also on the maintenance depots now operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force to overhaul weaponry. Military contractors are lobbying to shift this maintenance work from the armed services to themselves -- an additional source of revenue that would enhance the Grumman acquisition for Northrop or Martin Marietta.
 
 
Electronic Gear
 Both Northrop and Grumman also make various types of electronic gear, and it is in this area that plant closings and layoffs might occur, although Northrop executives insisted during the telephone news conference that a Northrop-Grumman merger, at $60 a share, would make money without any cutbacks. They said none was immediately planned.
Northrop, which is based in Los Angeles, now employs 30,000 people while Grumman's 18,000 workers are mostly on Long Island, near its Bethpage headquarters. Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., is mainly a manufacturer of space equipment and electronics, including various missile systems.
An hour or so after Northrop's announcement, Martin Marietta said in an angry press release that "the attack by Northrop degrades the entire character of the rational consolidation taking place within the United States' national security industrial base." The press release added that Martin Marietta "will respond to Northrop's action in an appropriate manner at the appropriate time."
Grumman had been seeking a buyer, and a spokesman said last night that the company was studying the proposal from Northrop. Mr. Kresa, in a letter to Renso L. Caporali, chairman of Grumman, announcing Northrop's offer, noted that Northrop and Grumman had been in discussions in January and February, but then Grumman abruptly excluded Northrop, without explanation.
"As early as Feb. 16, your representative asked Martin Marietta but not us to submit their highest and best offer," Mr. Kresa wrote. "We never received such a request. Never, in the entire process were we advised that you were in negotiations with another party, that a decision had been made to sell Grumman, or that we should submit our highest and best bid."
Mr. Kresa said that Northrop had told Grumman, in late February, that it was ready to pay $50 a share, if invited to bid. "At a certain point, we were told they were no longer for sale," Mr. Kresa said.
Grumman did not comment on Mr. Kresa's remarks.
Northrop said that its tender offer for Grumman shares would begin on Monday morning, although Martin Marietta might raise the bidding before then. Northrop stock ended up 62.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, closing yesterday at $41.25, and Martin Marietta stock gained 50 cents to close at $46.50.

HEADLINE: Family Struggles to Make Do After Fall From Middle Class

SERIES: Staying Afloat: Work in the 90's -- Second of four articles.

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
With two cars in the garage and a swing set in the backyard, Craig Miller and his family fell easily into the suburban rhythms of Johnson County.
He was a sheet-metal worker for T.W.A. His middle-class status was stamped on the pay stub: $15.65 an hour. And the shopping mall clerks didn't care if the paying customer wore steel-toe boots or tasseled loafers. 
 But the airline was troubled, and it laid off Mr. Miller off in the summer of 1992. When he began to search for another job, he quickly learned the market value of a blue-collar worker with a strong back and a good work ethic but few special skills: about $5 an hour.
Mr. Miller, a 37-year-old father of four, now works behind the counter in a McDonald's, hustling orders for Quarter Pounders and chicken fajitas and deferring to teen-age customers with "Yes, sir" and "Thank you, ma'am."
Mr. Miller also drives a school bus. And on the side he has started a small business, changing furnace filters. He printed up cards for the venture, "Sani-Max," but there hasn't been much demand for his service.
For the last eight years his wife, Susan, 34, has worked part time as a stock clerk at Toys "R" Us at night, when her husband can watch the children. She recently got a raise and now makes $5.95 an hour.
In most ways, the nation's economy seems to be racing ahead, evident here in the spiffy shops of Country Club Plaza and the big new crop of $200,000 houses sprouting in the corn fields on the outskirts of town.
 
New Jobs, but Not Enough
 Throughout the country, some two million new jobs were created last year. But for people like Craig and Susan Miller, who lack college degrees as well as coveted skills, the statistics on an increasing number of jobs offer little comfort.
"Sure, we've got four of them," Mr. Miller said, managing a chuckle. "So what? So you can work like a dog for $5 an hour."
In nearly three years since the 1990-91 recession, employers nationwide have taken on three million workers, but that is less than half as many as they hired after the 1981-82 recession. And many of the new jobs are part time or temporary.
At the same time, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen 8.3 percent from 1989 through February 1994. Tens of thousands of jobs have moved abroad; advances in technology have taken others.
As the Millers gaze into the future from their brick-and-frame house in Overland Park, Kan., they see an employment landscape shaped like a barbell. At one end are bankers and lawyers and accountants exulting in the high-flying stock market; at the other end are countermen at fast-food franchises and clerks at big discount stores struggling to pay the bills. The solid, working-class middle ground, where the Millers once stood, has meanwhile grown narrow -- and slippery.
Counting all their part-time jobs, the Millers will make about $18,000 this year, less than half what Mr. Miller earned as a union sheet-metal worker. They have found the fall difficult to fathom, and even harder to accept. They could probably qualify for food stamps but refuse to consider applying.
"We're middle-class people," Mr. Miller said. "It's just that we have a lower-class income."
 
The Daily Routine
 The work day starts in darkness. Mr. Miller, an Army veteran, crawls out of bed about 6 A.M., careful not to wake his youngest child, 3-year-old Amanda, who shares her parent's bedroom. By 7 A.M. he is behind the wheel of a school bus, stopping and going along tree-lined suburban streets of Overland Park. He will do it again in the late afternoon. The daily pay is $35, no benefits.
After completing the morning bus route, he stops back at his house to change into his blue McDonald's uniform with his "Craig" nameplate pinned onto it. His restaurant job starts at 9:30 A.M., in a strip mall on Highway 69.
The pay in a fast-food restaurant is low, but the work is relentless. Customers are often lined up six deep. Mr. Miller, a man who once fixed dents in the fuselages of jets and felt pride in his craft whenever a plane soared overhead, darts between the counter and the food pickup shelf, back and forth, a hundred times a day, careful not to misfill an order.
In the slower moments, he comes around the counter, dips a mop in a bucket and drags it across the floor. With the customers, he always tries to wear a polite smile, but he doesn't always meet their eyes.
"I still have some pride, you know," he said. "But what am I going to do? I think the needs of my children are a little more important than my ego."
When he took the job, Mr. Miller expected to be the oldest worker at McDonald's. He was surprised to find several people past 30.
Still wearing the McDonald's uniform, he climbs back in the school bus at 2:30 P.M. for the afternoon run. About 5, he arrives home.
Dinner is served right away, often pasta with ground turkey. The Millers never buy beef anymore.
Just before 6, Mrs. Miller leaves for her job, six hours of bending and lifting to stock the shelves with toys. It will be midnight by the time she returns home. She also works one day a week at the same McDonald's as her husband.
 
Battle With Bills
 Every time the telephone rings, the Millers instinctively fear that a bill collector is calling. They are $3,000 behind in medical bills. Mrs. Miller's part-time job provides health benefits, with the company paying 80 percent of medical bills and the employee 20 percent. But with four children, even paying just 20 percent adds up. And one child recently had surgery.
When a bill collector got huffy on the phone the other day, Mrs. Miller told him wearily, "Oh, get in line."
The couple buy one newspaper a week, for the food coupons, and only one light burns in the house at a time. When a child forgets to flip off the switch, Mrs. Miller chides gently: "Have you got stock in the electric company? Well, neither do I."
Not so long ago, such worries would have seemed absurd. The Millers were saving so they could exchange their rented house for one of their own. At backyard barbecues and church picnics they moved comfortably in a social circle that included college graduates, people who wore suits to work and were therefore deemed "professional" but who often earned no more than the Millers.
When a child in school boasted of a parent who was a doctor or a lawyer, 7-year-old Peter Miller was known to reply, "My daddy can fix planes so they can fly high in the sky."
A quarter century ago, Mr. Miller remembers feeling the same kind of pride in his own blue-collar father. But the rules and rewards were simple then: if a man wasn't afraid to sweat, he could succeed.
Mr. Miller had watched his father make good on the bargain, a factory worker who provided a two-story house, a decent savings account and summer vacations to the California redwoods and Yellowstone National Park.
 
'I Miss It a Lot'
 That was the kind of life that Mr. Miller had always planned for his own family. But now there doesn't seem to be much point in even talking about it.
"Oh, yeah, I miss it a lot," he said, referring to the old job, and perhaps to the old rules.
He clings to the hope that the fortunes of T.W.A. will improve and that the company will then re-call him and others who were laid off.
One recent evening, Mr. Miller pulled out some old work tools, grasping them in hands that are now much smoother, and explained the purpose of each.
On the floor next to the sofa was a two-year-old airline magazine, with a cover article titled, "How to make good landings." On the wall, an art print carried a quote from Isaiah: "We grope for the wall like the blind."
Mr. Miller doesn't care to talk much about McDonald's. He sat in the living room with a visitor for two hours one evening, never taking off the jacket that covered his McDonald's shirt. Finally, for a brief moment, he unsnapped the buttons to reveal the uniform.
"There, you see it," he said, with a blush of embarrassment and perhaps a glint of rage. Then he closed the jacket again.
 
Sad Stories Abound
 Now and then, Mr. Miller checks with some of his old buddies from the T.W.A. hangar, men who used to talk about rushing yardage and batting averages on coffee breaks. Now they share rumors about the latest threatened corporate "downsizing."
One of the men, Joe Tomczuk, could not find a job that paid more than $6 an hour. He moved back home with his parents, at age 39, and wondered if he should abandon the hope of ever getting married and starting a family.
"Women are just like me; they want security," Mr. Tomczuk said. "What are they going to see in me?"
Another former colleague is now a janitor in a school. Others seem to have disappeared.
In the months after T.W.A. laid off several hundred workers like Mr. Miller, some marriages collapsed. Alcohol took a toll. And union officials say perhaps a dozen men peered into the bleakness of the future and committed suicide.
Mr. Miller said some friends had encouraged him to move to a city where good blue-collar jobs were more plentiful. But where was that? Even at his father's old factory, in Muscatine, Iowa, a ketchup plant, technology was phasing out workers.
 
Keeping Up for the Children
 But moving is simply not an option. The Millers' eldest child, 11-year-old Jeremiah, has severe learning disabilities but has been making significant progress, which his parents credit to the top-notch teachers at the affluent Blue Valley School District. The couple will not consider risking Jeremiah's future in a mediocre school; nor are they willing to put him through the emotional strain of starting over in strange surroundings even if the schools were superior.
"We try not to tell the kids too much," Mr. Miller said. "This belongs on our shoulders, not theirs."
But some things are difficult to avoid. Not long ago, Jeremiah asked if he could take his friends to a restaurant for his birthday, a custom with many children at his school.
"We'll have to talk about that," Mr. Miller told the boy.
Mrs. Miller glanced toward the children and shook her head.
"I hope they choose their careers carefully," she said later. "Everything is geared to the college people anymore. If your job isn't sitting in front of a computer, watch out."
Mrs. Miller said she and her husband should have seen the writing on the wall. But when times were good, they seemed like they would last forever. Now she has scant hope that those days will ever return.
"For people like us," she said, "I'm afraid the good times are gone for good."
Next: Who's succeeding in the 1990's.

HEADLINE: After Skipping President's Talk, Giuliani Meets Clinton in Private

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
After several days of suspense over whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York would manage to clear his schedule for a meeting with President Clinton, the two met yesterday at the Sheraton New York Hotel and talked mainly about law enforcement and the President's crime bill.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Giuliani said he never had any intention of slighting the President by declining an invitation to attend a talk-show-style get-together on community policing and national service at Brooklyn College earlier in the day. 
 "It was a very positive meeting," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the two had talked for about 40 minutes. (The White House said it was 20 minutes.) "The President and I had a lot of time to discuss the economy, our gun strategy. We talked about policing and some lighthearted conversation, joking around. But these are the things you keep private."
Specifically, the Mayor said he asked Mr. Clinton for more details on his crime bill. "I think what has to happen in the crafting of this legislation is that we need to get more specific on the amount of aid being given, how long that aid is going to last," he said. "By making positive suggestions, maybe we can make it better legislation."
 
'It Wasn't a Snub'
 The two-hour meeting at Brooklyn College, a discussion of President Clinton's national service program and community policing, was attended by leading New York public officials, including the City Public Advocate, Mark J. Green; the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi; the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden; Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, and the State Attorney General, G. Oliver Koppell.
Mr. Giuliani said the President told him he was not disappointed that the Mayor had not attended the Brooklyn College event.
"He was very upbeat," the Mayor said. "Things move very fast and there can be misimpressions. This has been made into something other than what it was. It wasn't a snub. The President understood it."
The White House, too, said the meeting had been cordial. But some people who met with the President later said that Mr. Clinton seemed uncertain why the Mayor did not accept his invitation to attend the Brooklyn College function. "He was puzzled," said the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. "But he doesn't believe there was an intentional slight. Certainly the President will not deny anything to the city because of it."
Mr. Clinton also met with former Mayor David N. Dinkins in private. In addition, he met with more than 50 leading Democratic officials, fund-raisers and prominent New Yorkers at the Sheraton, including the former Manhattan Borough President, Percy E. Sutton, the developer Donald Trump and the State Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver.
 
'They've Got to Work With Us'
 On Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani said he had decided not to attend the Brooklyn College gathering, explaining that it did not "seem like the format for the most substantive discussion." He added, "It's really a format like 'Donahue' or 'Oprah.' " Mr. Giuliani had told reporters that he had a busy schedule and that he had conveyed to the White House that he had some free time in the late afternoon, if the President wanted to meet then.
One senior Giuliani official made it clear that the Mayor did not want to participate in a public event that the official said would be little more than a photo opportunity. "Rudy's a fighter for New York," said the official, who asked to remain anonymous. "We haven't seen a lot from Washington. They've got to work with us if they want us to cooperate."
The decision to meet in private, far from television cameras and reporters, came late Wednesday night, in a discussion between City Hall and the White House.
Mr. Clinton's appearance at Brooklyn College was interrupted by an unidentified man who walked into the aisle of the auditorium and began screaming at the President, saying he had not worked hard enough to develop treatments for AIDS. The President listened to the man and began chronicling his Administration's initiatives.
But the man continued screaming. "People are dying and you're doing nothing." Finally he was escorted out of the auditorium by security officers. The President continued speaking to the audience, seemingly unfazed by the event, when another man in the audience yelled to Mr. Clinton: "Welcome to Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: Christopher Unlikely to Meet Dissidents

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 10

 BODY:
Despite wide anticipation among Chinese dissidents that Secretary of State Warren Christopher would meet with them during his three-day visit to Beijing, he said today that he had no plan at the moment to do so.
Mr. Christopher gave no reason for his decision, which he disclosed at a briefing after meeting with Japanese Government leaders today. Asked by a reporter whether he would meet with political dissidents during the visit, his first to China as Secretary of State, he replied, "I don't have any plans to do so at the present time." 
 There has been considerable speculation in China that Mr. Christopher may use what is shaping up as a high-stakes trip to hold a symbolically important meeting with Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident.
But the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said that such a meeting is unlikely because Mr. Christopher does not want to divert attention from the main purpose of his trip, which is to impress upon the Chinese Government that it must improve its human rights record if the United States is to extend China's preferential trade status in June.
 
Putting Dissidents at Risk
 Mr. Christopher is also concerned that by holding such a meeting, he could put more dissidents at risk, Mr. McCurry added.
Asked whether dissidents who are viewed as potential candidates for a meeting with Mr. Christopher could find themselves at risk, Mr. McCurry said: "It's pretty clear that's what's happening. That's what Wei Jingsheng would conclude."
After John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, met with Mr. Wei last week, Mr. Wei was detained for 30 hours and interrogated.
Other senior officials traveling with Mr. Christopher said they had argued that such a meeting could be counterproductive because it could further antagonize the Chinese.
 
America Is a Crucial Market
 The World Bank estimates that preferential low tariffs affect 96 percent of China's exports to the United States. If China's preferential trade status were eliminated, its trade surplus with the United States, which was $18.2 billion last year and could reach $24 billion this year, would dramatically shrink, jeopardizing a cash flow that is crucial for China's expanding economy.
[In an expression of support for Mr. Christopher's difficult mission, 275 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter urging him to press for "substantial progress in human rights and full compliance with the President's executive order outlining conditions for renewal of most-favored-nation trade status."]
The Chinese have not demanded outright that Mr. Christopher refrain from meeting with dissidents, but have expressed their concern more subtly, the American officials said.
"They haven't made any threats; they have expressed a keen interest into what all of his meetings are," said one official. "They have said, 'We consider internal matters should not be part of the dialogue. How we enforce our laws shouldn't be part of the discussions.' "
China's leaders have rejected American pressure to ease political repression, arguing that it amounts to blatant interference in their internal affairs. But in mid-January, the Administration thought it was making some headway when President Jiang Zemin told a Congressional delegation that China was "going to make an effort" to meet American concerns about rights.
 
Planning Has Been Difficult
 Some of Mr. Christopher's senior aides have suggested that he consider canceling some of the meetings his delegation is planning or cut short his trip if it starts off badly.
Mr. McCurry indicated that planning with the Chinese had been so difficult that "they were still arguing about what type of car Christopher would drive in." He added that "some of the meetings are not coming together."
Mr. Christopher is also planning to spend part of Sunday on a sightseeing tour of the capital, but that could be canceled if he does not want to appear too friendly to his hosts.
Among the meetings that could be canceled or cut short are military talks that are to be conducted by Frank G. Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, senior Administration officials said. For now Mr. Wisner, who would be the highest-ranking Pentagon official to visit Beijing since before the 1989 crackdown against the democracy movement, intends to remain in China after Mr. Christopher leaves to discuss ways to upgrade the military relationship between the two countries.
Such links could include cooperative military efforts in peacekeeping, disaster relief and conversion of defense industries.
But Mr. Wisner's visit is also intended to open a channel for human rights discussions with the military establishment, another key constituency of the Chinese leadership, a senior State Department official said.
 
Lecturing Japanese Leaders
 Mr. Christopher spent much of his day in Tokyo lecturing Japanese leaders on the need for them to live up to the specific pledges they made last July to cut their trade surplus with Washington. But he did not engage in serious negotiating and made no headway in convincing the Japanese to take concrete action.
His visit to Beijing promises to be even more difficult because of the recent crackdown on dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai, which has left American policymakers baffled and disturbed.
Other Secretaries of State have learned the hard way that calling on the Chinese does not necessarily produce diplomatic victories.
During a farewell visit to Beijing in the summer of 1988, George P. Shultz was warmly told by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, "The door of China is forever open to you." But the outgoing Secretary of State failed to convince his Chinese hosts to curb their sales of missiles to the Middle East.
In November 1991, the last time a Secretary of State visited China, James A. Baker 3d ended talks without progress toward easing China's suppression of rights and left the country with the misimpression that the Chinese would adhere to pledges not to export missile technology in violation of an international accord.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Plan on Merchant Ships

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
President Clinton today sent Congress a proposal for a 10-year, $1 billion program intended halt the decline of America's merchant fleet.
Administration officials said the money was needed to prevent the extinction of the merchant fleet, which has steadily declined in the last decade because of high labor costs, Government regulations and high taxes. 
 The money would come from increased cargo fees paid by shippers. The legislation would replace the current Federal subsidy program for privately owned vessels sailing under the United States flag. That program has cost the Government an estimated $2 billion over almost two decades.
"This legislation represents an important step forward to assuring America's future as a maritime nation," Mr. Clinton said in a statement. "A modern merchant United States-flag fleet, with skilled U.S. mariners, will provide not only jobs and economic benefits, but also an important sea-lift capability in times of national emergency."
The privately owned merchant fleet in the United States totaled 384 vessels last year, against 573 a decade earlier, according to the Federal Maritime Administration. Last year, Sea-Land Service and American President Lines, the two largest United States merchant fleets, requested Government permission to shift a total of 20 vessels to foreign registries so save operating costs. The requests are pending.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a graduate of the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, L.I., who went to sea as a young man, said: "America is perilously close to losing its domestic flag fleet." The nation's maritime unions belong to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 
Providing $100 Million a Year
 The legislation would increase cargo fees that all merchant vessels entering United States ports pay the Federal Government by an additional $100 million a year. The Government would use the money to provide $2 million to $2.5 million annually to about 52 merchant ships that could also be used to transport military supplies and equipment. The vessels would have to have crews composed entirely of United States citizens. In addition, ships built in the United would have to be less than 15 years old and foreign-built vessels would have be less than 5 years old.
Representative Gerry Studds, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, today introduced the legislation in the House. Last November, the House approved a similar bill by a vote of 347 to 65.
Mr. Clinton's proposal is expected to supplant that legislation. The Senate has been awaiting the Administration's bill.
Mr. Studds called the legislation "a sea change in U.S. policy, and just in the nick of time." He said the legislation was needed to thwart "the absolutely unthinkable prospect of the last remaining superpower on earth without ships flying its flag."
Mr. Clinton's legislation was proposed as the current 20-year subsidy program for the merchant fleet was expiring. The Federal subsidies, which ranged from $250 million to $350 million a year, benefited 81 merchant ships. The current subsidy of $287 million a year declines until all subsidies end in 1997.
Last year Congress approved $50 million for loan guarantees to shipyards and a $30 million subsidy to improve shipbuilding technology.
 
'Simply Unthinkable'
 Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said, "With the resurgence of U.S. export trade and risk of heightened global trade tensions, it is simply unthinkable that there would be no U.S. merchant marine to carry American cargo. Without a U.S. fleet we would become wholly dependent on other countries. In the fierce competition of the world marketplace, any country forced to rely solely on others to move its goods is vulnerable."
The legislation was hailed by the shipping industry. "It's a great first step," said Peter J. Finnerty, vice president for public affairs of Sea-Land Service, which has 42 United States flag ships, making up the nation's largest maritime fleet. Sea-Land, a subsidiary of the CSX Corporation, also has 43 ships that bear the flags of other nations.
The Administration approach has been opposed by shippers, who would have to pay the higher fees. Shipping fees would increase to 24 cents, from 9 cents, for a net registered ton on vessels entering the United States from a foreign port in the Western hemisphere and to 71 cents, from 27 cents, from other foreign ports. This fee would apply only to the first five times a vessel entered a United States port each year. Net registered tonnage is a ship's total cargo capacity, regardless of the cargo actually on board.
Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the Merchant Marine Subcommittee of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said he planned to hold hearings on the bill shortly after the Easter recess. The Senator called the bill "the first complete maritime reform proposal since the days of President Roosevelt.'

HEADLINE: Keep Vows, Christopher Tells Tokyo

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, March 11

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher accused Tokyo of failing to live up to its promises to President Clinton on opening markets. He reminded them that "great nations keep their commitments."
Mr. Christopher's uncharacteristically strong words, delivered at a tense meeting on Thursday with Japanese leaders, were followed today by further tough remarks prepared for delivery to a senior business group. 
 Both were part of a continuing effort by the Clinton Administration to step up diplomatic pressure on Japan at the same time it is warning of trade sanctions. They came at the first top-level contacts between the two nations since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's mission to Washington last month ended in an unprecedented impasse.
In the speech, prepared for delivery to the executive group, the Keizai Doyukai, Mr. Christopher struck at Japan's greatest fear: that the trade tensions could spill over into other aspects of the country's alliance with the United States.
"For the world's two largest economies, agreeing to disagree is not good enough," he said. "We must not allow a situation to persist that might eventually erode public and political support for our overall relationship."
While he praised Prime Minister Hosokawa as a reformer, he made it clear that he was losing patience with the explanations Japan has offered for its slow pace of change.
"We cannot let political deadlock, or bureaucratic inertia, or outdated thinking stand in the way," the Secretary said. And he cited cases in which American competition has aided Japanese consumers by driving down prices, citing price cutting now under way here in personal computers because of the entry of Compaq, Apple and Dell, among others.
It was far from clear, though, that Japanese executives in Mr. Christopher's audience regard that competition, which has greatly cut into some of their profits, as an experiment they are eager to replicate.
On Thursday, Japanese Government officials had appeared unmoved, saying only that by the end of this month they would signal the "direction" of a series of voluntary market openings. In Washington, Mr. Hosokawa held out a somewhat similar prospect, and now, with his coalition Government enmeshed in political insecurity and infighting, officials here say that they do not expect a more specific plan to be ready until the July meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
A senior Japanese official said that Mr. Hosokawa, who had met with Mr. Christopher for an hour Thursday, "made no commitments" beyond expressing a desire to end the tension between the two countries soon.
Mr. Christopher's intense concentration on trade again underscored how dramatically his job has changed in the last year, to the point that a visit here from the Secretary of State has become almost indistinguishable from a visit by the Treasury Secretary or the United States trade representative.
While he spent some time discussing North Korea's nuclear weapons effort and prepared for a lengthy review of Japan's security needs, wherever Mr. Christopher went today, he reminded Japanese officials of their commitment to "significant decreases" in the trade surplus with the United States.
Mr. Clinton's decision last week to reinstate Super 301 provisions of the trade act, giving him the power to quickly impose sanctions against countries whose markets are closed, was never brought up, Japanese and American officials said.
"My presentation to the Japanese leaders today was straightforward and, I believe, candid," Mr. Christopher said a news conference Thursday night. "I said simply that great nations keep their commitments. In making the framework agreement last July, Japan and the United States made commitments. We agreed to cut our deficits and improve our competitiveness," he said, suggesting that the United States had already delivered on its pledges.
Areas of Special Concern
"No one would agree, I think, with the contention that Japan has met its commitments," Mr. Christopher pointedly added.
The accord he mentioned was signed in July by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa's predecessor, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. It is intended to address areas in which the United States says it needs far greater access to Japanese markets, from public works contracts to autos.
But officials on the two sides got bogged down in a circular debate over how to define "numerical indicators" of progress, with the Japanese accusing the United States of trying to manage trade by insisting on specific results rather than letting market forces work. It was that dispute, among others, that led to the standoff between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa, and little has changed since.
Mr. Christopher seemed eager to find a way to defuse the question of numerical targets, which he said had become "a fairly sterile discussion." He seemed to hint, though, that there was flexibility in the American demands, saying the two sides simply had to "find some way to achieve a set of programs that will produce some tangible results."
But he did not say what that would be. Nor was that expected: Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, said earlier this week that Mr. Christopher would not be in Tokyo "as a negotiator, because there is nothing to negotiate about."
Yet there have been some signs of modest progress. Over the last two weeks, the American Ambassador here, Walter F. Mondale, has opened a back channel of communication with Japan's most powerful politician, Ichiro Ozawa. Mr. Ozawa, who founded the Japan Renewal Party and serves as the governing coalition's chief strategist, is widely reported to be heading for Washington at the end of the month. It is unclear what message he might bring.
Mr. Christopher had considered using his trip to Asia to visit Vietnam, weeks after the United States lifted its economic embargo. He would have been the first Secretary of State to go there since the end of the Vietnam War. But in an illustration of diplomatic triage, he told reporters on Saturday that Washington had urgent business in Tokyo, and "it is a good time to be in Japan to underscore the President's desire to seek access to the Japanese market."
Despite all the tensions, Mr. Christopher's presence here was barely noted. Japanese television, accustomed to one after another American Cabinet member visiting to complain about trade, showed him only briefly, after reports on the latest scandal in Japan's construction industry and long lines forming to buy scarce bags of domestically produced rice.
Mr. Christopher acknowledged today that many of Japan's Asian neighbors, along with some in Europe, had denounced Washington's tactics in dealing with Japan, apparently fearful that these tactics might be used in dealings with other trade partners.
But he said he thought that governments would applaud the United States if the methods it is using prove successful. Defending the American approach in less colorful language than Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, used in Washington yesterday, Mr. Christopher said, "I think the rest of the trading world will be very relieved and pleased if the United States can take steps that will open the Japanese market."
Mr. Kantor had implied that European critics of the tough American policy toward Japan were dishonest and sanctimonious, and spoke of progress in opening the Japanese market to Motorola cellular phones. Today, a Motorola official, who was not identified by name, said his company and a Japanese concern, I.D.O., had reached a basic agreement that would expand Motorola's access to Japan's cellular-phone market and avert threatened sanctions.
Mr. Christopher, ever the pragmatist, said of America's critics, "I think whatever their position now, the rest of the world will applaud if we can achieve good results."

HEADLINE: Motorola Gaining Access to Japanese Market

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, March 11

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. and a Japanese company have reached a basic agreement that would expand Motorola's access to Japan's cellular telephone market, a Motorola executive said today, in a move that should avert threatened American sanctions against Japan.
The agreement would remove a serious dispute marring trade relations between the United States and Japan. But the cellular telephone issue is separate from a broader dispute over comprehensive trade talks that broke down last month. 
 "There is an agreement between I.D.O. and Motorola," the Motorola official said this morning, referring to the Japanese company.
"It's not signed, sealed and delivered," added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he said a formal announcement of the agreement was expected later today or by Monday.
 
More Signs of a Deal
 Japanese Government officials also indicated that an announcement of an agreement appeared imminent.
Takenori Kanzaki, Japan's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, said at a news conference this morning, "It's possible a formal agreement will be reached today." He said that if the two companies did reach an agreement, the governments of Japan and the United States would quickly reach their own accord and the threat of sanctions would be removed.
The agreement comes during the visit here of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who sharply criticized Japan on Thursday and today for failing to honor its trade commitments. Some officials on both sides were scrambling to arrange an announcement of an agreement while Mr. Christopher was still here, so his visit would end on a more positive note.
The United States has accused Japan of violating a 1989 trade agreement that called for Motorola to receive access to the cellular telephone market in the heavily populated corridor of Tokyo to Nagoya.
Washington was planning to publish by next Thursday a list of Japanese products that could be subject to retaliatory tariffs. The threat of sanctions seems to have led to big concessions from the Japanese side.
The root of the dispute is that the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, the company known as I.D.O., which provides cellular phone service in the Tokyo-Nagoya region, has not invested much in building base stations for a system using Motorola technology. Instead, it expanded a cellular system using technology developed by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.
Under the new agreement, I.D.O. will invest heavily to build 159 new base stations for the Motorola system over an 18-month period. That would give the Motorola system almost complete geographic coverage of the Tokyo-Nagoya region, making it much more attractive to potential customers.
I.D.O. will also transfer 1.5 megahertz of radio frequencies from the N.T.T.-based system to the Motorola system, meaning there will be more capacity to add channels for the Motorola system and less ability for the N.T.T. system to expand. After the agreement is put into effect, I.D.O. will devote 6.5 megahertz to each system.
 
 
 
The American U.S. Demand
 The United States Government and Motorola have also demanded that the Japanese Government somehow guarantee that the Japanese cellular company will fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Just how this will be done was still being worked out this morning, the Motorola official said. One Japanese official said there could be language to the effect that Japan "recognizes" the agreement between Motorola and I.D.O.
To finance its expansion of the Motorola system, I.D.O. is expected to get assistance from the Toyota Motor Corporation, a large shareholder. Other shareholders include Nissan Motor and the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation. There has also been talk that the Government-controlled Japan Development Bank would make low-interest loans to I.D.O.
The agreement could mean several hundred million dollars in extra sales for Motorola. But I.D.O. has been warning that if it has to build up more capacity for the Motorola system, which uses analog technology, it will be unable to spend as much on newer digital technology. That could hurt some companies, including the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which are trying to sell the digital cellular equipment here.
"If an agreement is made, certainly that will have a good impact on the overall environment," one Japanese trade official said.

HEADLINE: Rates Soar On Selloff In Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities plunged yesterday, pushing up the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.95 percent, its highest level in more than nine months.
Long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, are now more than a percentage point above the 25-year low reached on Oct. 15 and nearly three-quarters of a point higher than in early February. For the Clinton Administration, which has based its hope for steady economic growth on the lift from low long-term interest rates, the selloff in the bond market must be raising concerns. 
 Some traders sought to explain yesterday's selling by pointing to the uncertainty generated by the investigation into the Whitewater land deal and the political unrest in South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, which pushed up gold prices sharply.
 
 
Fears of Inflation
 But it appears that fear of inflation and uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates again are still the main reasons for the collapse in the bond market, which began when the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target a quarter-point on Feb. 4.
 Although many market analysts argue that the rise in interest rates has already been more than enough to offset another increase by the Fed, traders and analysts are still uncertain whether the rise has reached its peak. Many economists also argue that fears of inflation are overblown, given the current economic data and the apparent determination of the Fed to resist price increases.
With no fresh data to support the bond market yesterday, investors looked for an excuse to change their investment strategy or sell. Traders said investors who were selling long-term securities turned around and bought short-term Treasury bills, which are less volatile and risky when the market outlook is unclear.
 
 
A Shift to Shorter Maturities
 In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond fell 1 1/2 points, to 917/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, up from 6.83 percent on Wednesday and the highest since May 1993, when it was 6.98 percent. The rush by some investors to seek the shelter of the shorter maturities lifted the bill market. The three-month bill rate fell 3 basis points, to 3.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., said, "The fact remains that there is simply no demand for Treasuries with investors knowing that the Fed is going to hike interest rates soon."
He said traders and investors, by selling relentlessly last month, had pushed interest rates much higher than what could be justified by the economic outlook. He added that investors might be realizing that the inflation they were concerned about was not a problem for 1994, although it could be an issue in 1995 or beyond.
"We don't know yet if the economy will even be strong enough to produce inflation in those years," Mr. Fine said.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisers, said investors were in a selling mood yesterday and were looking for any excuse to sell. But he argued that "everything in market said you should have been a buyer, not a seller."
Mr. Battipaglia said a reference to gold as a gauge of inflation expectations by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in Congressional testimony last month had made gold a fashionable measure for investors. "And a spike in the price of gold like we had today might spook bond investors," Mr. Battipaglia said.
The gold contract for April delivery jumped $8.10, to $388.20 an ounce, in trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday.
 "The market is sending a clear message that the Fed has not done enough," Mr. Fine said.
"If the Fed moves quickly, I think the bonds can improve from where they are now. But if the Fed continues to drag its feet, any improvement will be limited because investors are waiting for further tightening by the Fed."
The faster the Fed moves, he said, the more the market will become convinced that the central bank is doing the right thing to stave off inflation in 1995, 1996 and beyond. "If it moves slowly, the Fed will have justified the market's concern that inflation is a problem," he said. The Fed moved at the right time in February, he said, but the increase was not big enough to calm the inflation fears of the bond market.
Some reports that should have helped the market yesterday included the weekly report on initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week that ended on Saturday. The number of Americans filing claims increased by 32,000, to 346,000. Today's report on retail sales for February may draw some attention, traders said, but it is next week's inflation numbers that are more important. The producer price and consumer price indexes for February will be released on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
China Bonds
 Elsewhere in the debt markets, the Bank of China, a bank owned by the Government of China, received an enthusiastic reception yesterday for an issue of five-year bonds, but an issue of 20-year bonds, the longest yet issued by a Chinese agency, did not do as well.
The $400 million issue of five-year bonds was priced to yield 6.819 percent, or 98 basis points above comparable Treasury securities. The initial sale was completed, and the lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley & Company, allowed the bonds to be traded freely.
The $100 million issue of 20-year bonds, which was priced to yield 8.281 percent, or 135 basis points above comparable Treasury securities, was bid by Morgan Stanley at a 140 basis point spread, a lower price.
Jim Pelgrift, a bond syndicate manager for Morgan Stanley, said some of the 20-year bonds remained to be sold.
Although not formally guaranteed by the Government of China, the bonds were priced as if they were, reflecting the Government's support of the bank.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Faults Weicker On Auto-Emissions Pact

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 10

 BODY:
Lobbyists for a company seeking a $150 million state contract influenced the Governor's office, winning the company a second chance after a state commissioner had selected its competitor, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said today.
Mr. Blumenthal, reporting on his inquiry into the hotly disputed selection of a contractor to operate Connecticut's auto-emissions testing program, said the result was "at the very least, an appearance of unfairness and partiality to the public and to the participants in the process." 
 Mr. Weicker's selection of the program's current operator, Envirotest Systems Corporation of Tucson, Ariz., as the preferred bidder for a new seven-and-half-year contract provoked a dispute in December when it became known that he had rejected the low bidder, a Connecticut company that was the choice of his Motor Vehicles Commissioner, Louis S. Goldberg, and of an evaluation committee Mr. Goldberg had formed to review the bids.
In defending his department's bidding process, Mr. Goldberg suggested to a legislative committee that the Governor's office had had improper contacts with Envirotest lobbyists. Two days later Mr. Weicker dismissed Mr. Goldberg, accusing him of being biased against Envirotest and of misrepresenting his evaluation committee's findings.
In his report today, the Attorney General said that nothing illegal or unethical had been found in the conduct of officials or lobbyists involved in the competition between Envirotest and the evaluation committee's choice for the contract, Environmental Systems Products, or ESP.
Under the state's lobbying law, which applies only to lobbyists trying to influence legislators, Mr. Blumenthal said, "ironically Envirotest's actions and the actions of its representatives did not constitute 'lobbying.' "
 
Based on Financial Strength
 In addition, he said, while Envirotest's lobbying won it a new hearing before the Governor and "set the agenda" for that hearing, it did not influence Mr. Weicker's ultimate choice, which was based on the bidders' financial strength.
But Mr. Blumenthal also concluded that Mr. Weicker made that choice based on inaccurate and incomplete financial data, and he recommended that the Governor reconsider his decision. He also said that Mr. Weicker's accusations against his commissioner had no merit.
The Attorney General praised Mr. Goldberg and the competitive bidding process he established for the testing contract, the largest ever awarded by a state agency. He recommended that the Legislature require a similar process for all large state contracts.
The report said, "The use of a competitive process where none was required by statute was in the best interests of Connecticut's residents, was a sound business practice and was an action which any 'smart shopper' would take."
 
Weicker Comments
 Mr. Weicker defended his actions today. "The Attorney General has concluded that lobbying had no effect on my decision as to an emissions test operator for our state," he said. "Additionally, he found no illegal or unethical conduct on the part of anyone in this administration."
He said he would review the financial data on the companies, as Mr. Blumenthal recommended, but that he would still base his decision on their financial strength. What was the point, he asked, of giving the contract to a company that didn't have the resources to carry it out?
"I cannot afford in tenuous economic times to have a $150 million contract go into weak fiscal hands," Mr. Weicker said. "Not only is it a $150 million contract, but if we don't perform under that contract, the state is subject to $300 million in fines."
The testing program is required in Connecticut and other states to comply with the Federal Clean Air Act.
 
Sees a Bias
 Mr. Weicker also defended his accusations against Mr. Goldberg, saying the commissioner had shown a bias against Envirotest.
"That came out loud and clear in all the discussions I had with the former commissioner," Mr. Weicker said. "I think I'm the best judge of when I can see bias, and that certainly was there, in addition to other remarks he had made to other persons."
Mr. Blumenthal, in a detailed report compiled from interviews with state officials and lobbyists and thousands of documents, suggested that the dispute resulted partly from the circumstances and strategies of Envirotest, an established company, and ESP, a company that had developed new testing technology but was looking for its first big contract.
ESP, wanting to cooperate with Mr. Goldberg's desire for a strictly competitive bidding process, made a decision not to lobby in its own behalf, his report stated. But Envirotest, in danger of losing its contract, decided to lobby heavily, using representatives from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to the head of United Technologies Corporation to the State Treasurer to make its points that it had experience, that it was financially strong, and that it was a minority-owned company.
When Envirotest succeeded in narrowing the competition to the question of financial strength, the report said, the data provided Mr. Weicker by his staff overstated what appeared to be ESP's weaknesses, such as a small amount of cash on hand. Many of those weaknesses, the report said, were simply the characteristics of a start-up company, which would become negligible once ESP had the revenue from the state contract.
Today Mr. Weicker said that he rejected that view of ESP's finances.

HEADLINE: From Coast to Coast, From Affluent to Poor, Poll Shows Anxiety Over Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY 

 BODY:
While Americans perceive that the economy has improved in recent months, their sense of insecurity about their own jobs is substantial and pervasive, with anxiety spread across all geographic regions and through all occupational levels, according to the latest New York Times Poll.
Two-fifths (39 percent) of workers interviewed in the nationwide poll expressed "worry," either a lot or some, that during the next two years they might be laid off, required to work reduced hours or forced to take pay cuts. 
 In the Northeast, 45 percent expressed such concerns, compared with 38 percent in the Midwest, 38 percent in the South and 31 percent in the West.
Forty-eight percent of blue-collar workers said they were nervous about layoffs, reduced hours or wage cuts, and so were 36 percent of those in professional or managerial occupations.
 
Anxiety at All Income Levels
 Forty-four percent of those with household incomes under $30,000 expressed worry, but higher-income respondents were only slightly less insecure. Thirty-six percent in households with income from $30,000 to $50,000 were concerned, as were 34 percent in households with incomes over $50,000. Forty percent of blacks were worried, as were 37 percent of whites.
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Feb. 15 to 17. The job insecurity questions were asked of 692 adults who were in the work force and whose current or most recent work was for an employer, rather than being self-employed. For that group, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
Many respondents had reasons to be anxious. A quarter of the work force (24 percent) said they had personally experienced layoffs, reduced hours or cuts in pay in the last two years.
Others observed the problems of people around them: 77 percent said they personally knew someone who had lost his or her job in the last couple of years. And 67 percent said loss of work -- layoffs, jobs moving away or jobs just disappearing -- was a substantial problem facing their communities in general.
When asked to characterize how secure they felt in their jobs, only 29 percent of workers said they felt "completely secure." An additional, 48 percent said "pretty secure," while 14 percent answered "not too secure" and 8 percent said "not secure at all."
 
Need for Extra Jobs
 The poll reflected other ways in which workers have been buffeted by changes in the economy. Nearly two-fifths (39 percent) said that "to try to stay even financially" during the last two years they had had to work overtime or take on extra jobs. Younger workers were especially likely to report this.
Many of these worried workers are trying to improve their job prospects. Two-thirds said they had got some retraining or taken other steps to improve their job skills in the last two years.
Many Americans may need those new skills. Asked to look toward the next 5 or 10 years, only 31 percent saw a "big future" in their line of work. Forty-nine percent said there was "some future," but 13 percent predicted "not much future" and 5 percent saw "no future at all."
Thirty percent said they "sometimes had serious regrets" about choosing the occupations they did, while 66 percent said they were satisfied with their decisions.
When asked to look further ahead, 69 percent said that if they had young children, they would recommend that they find a different line of work. Such a high figure probably reflects the natural wish of parents for a better life for their children as well as pessimism over their jobs.
The poll also revealed some fraying in the relations between employers and workers. Sixty-four percent said most employers show less loyalty to their workers now than in the past. Similarly, 55 percent said most working people today show less loyalty toward their employers than before.
The poll also found that 29 percent of workers received no fringe benefits, while an additional 19 percent received fringe benefits but judged them as only fair or poor.

HEADLINE: Girl, 4, Dies of Drug Dose; Father Is Charged in Death

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Leah O'Doherty's father was a drug addict who kept methadone in the refrigerator in a Gatorade bottle, the police say. Somehow, Wednesday night, the 4-year-old girl consumed three times the dose of the drug that would have killed an adult, and yesterday morning she was dead.
Her father, Kevin O'Doherty, 26, has been charged with second-degree murder, though investigators have not determined whether the death was accidental or whether Leah was given the drug. Leah's mother, Kelli, 25 -- who the police said was also a drug addict -- has been charged with criminally negligent homicide. 
 The girl died six days after moving back in with her parents in Jackson Heights, Queens; before that she had been staying with her grandparents, the police said.
She was pronounced dead at 7:20 A.M. yesterday at the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst, not quite 12 hours after her father called 911 to report that his daughter was unconscious, said a police spokeswoman, Detective Kim Royster. The police said Mr. O'Doherty did not have a prescription for methadone, which is usually used by heroin addicts to suppress their desire and to allow them to function normally. But some addicts become dependent on the drug.
 
Child Found Unconscious
 Anita Munoz, a neighbor who sometimes saw Leah with her puppy, said the little girl "seemed like a very happy, normal 4-year-old."
"She was very pretty, with long honey-blonde hair," Mrs. Munoz said. "The last time I saw her she was carrying a doll."
It could not be learned yesterday whether the New York City Human Resources Administration had been involved in the child's case.
Neighbors in the building at 87-11 35th Avenue said the police were called to break up a fight in January, three weeks after the couple moved into the fifth-floor apartment. "I heard Kelli saying to Kevin, 'Please don't do it, please don't do it,' like she was begging," said Aurelio Bastidas. Mrs. Munoz said, "Four policemen had to throw him down to the floor."
Officers responding to Mr. O'Doherty's 911 call on Wednesday found Leah unconscious. "The methadone was in a Gatorade bottle in a liquid form," said Sgt. Timothy Dowd of the 115th Precinct Detective Squad. "Based on her blood analysis, the doctors determined that sometime during the night she had three times the lethal dose for an adult."
The investigation showed, Sergeant Dowd said, that Leah had been alone with her father; the mother was out with a friend. "We know the baby spoke to her maternal grandmother around 6 o'clock, about the grandmother coming over the next day," the sergeant said. "So, she was conscious then."
 
Came From North Carolina
 Besides the murder charge, Mr. O'Doherty was also charged with second-degree manslaughter. Second-degree murder can include death resulting from depraved indifference.
The O'Dohertys, Sergeant Dowd said, moved to Queens from Jacksonville, N.C., in 1991. They have been married for five years, he said, and both are unemployed.
"He's not in a methadone program," Sergeant Dowd said. "Sometime recently he purchased it on the street." Detective Royster said drug paraphernalia was found in the apartment. "The father is a methadone abuser and the mother is a heroin addict," she said.
Dr. Beny J. Primm, director of the nonprofit Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation, said the lethal dose of methadone varies according to the tolerance of the addict. An adult dose could range from 30 to 100 milligrams.
"A child would not normally take methadone for any reason," Dr. Primm said. "Even a single adult dose could be lethal if ingested by a child."
A 60-milligram dose of methadone bought on the street usually costs from $10 to $20, Dr. Primm said. About 40,000 people are in methadone programs in the state, he said. "Perhaps he was treating himself, and if our capacity for treatment was expanded, then unquestionably all of these people who are out there buying street methadone could be in a program and would know how to safeguard their medication," Dr. Primm said.

HEADLINE: Power Agency Is Undergoing An Overhaul

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The new head of the New York Power Authority said yesterday that there was no point in his agency's continued existence if all it did was churn out electricity. And so, in his 10th day on the job, S. David Freeman began a major shakeup, both philosophically and practically, of the largest public power agency outside the Federal Government.
Mr. Freeman said the agency should be pioneering new technologies like the development of electricity from the wind and the sun and leading the nation toward the electrification of its transportation systems. 
 Dealing with the present, Mr. Freeman announced that within 90 days the authority would find cuts of $50 million in its operating budget of $487 million. He said he would cut staff at its nuclear plants despite their recent troubles and possibly close a major generating station in Queens.
Mr. Freeman, a former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, also said he was deferring a 4 percent pay increase that the authority's board of directors had approved for the authority's 37 top officials. He said he would cut his own salary of $200,000 by 4 percent as well, "to bond with these guys."
 
New Personnel Head
 In addition he eliminated radio advertising and the authority's Washington office, and said the Albany office and the travel budget would be cut back sharply.
Turning to personnel matters, he promised that "we are going to get affirmative about our affirmative action program."
Mr. Freeman said he was embarrassed to learn that there were no blacks among the top 100 of the 3,400 employees of the authority. He announced that he had hired a new personnel director, Deborah Perry Estrin, and said that her addition "nearly doubles" the number of women in top positions.
A spokesman said that none of the actions announced yesterday required approval of the trustees, although Mr. Freeman was keeping them informed.
In unusually blunt talk, Mr. Freeman said that nuclear power was "inherently dangerous" and that the Indian Point plant, which is 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan on the Hudson River, could not be built under today's licensing standards. "I think anybody who is not afraid of nuclear power ought to go to Chernobyl," he said.
In the 1970's, at the T.V.A., Mr. Freeman ordered the cancellation of several nuclear plants under construction, but supervised the completion of others. Yesterday, describing himself as "the last nuclear agnostic," he said that he favored continued operation of Indian Point 3 and the authority's other reactor, James A. FitzPatrick, near Oswego, if it could be done safely and competitively.
"This company cannot run on the basis of losing money on every kilowatt hour and making it up on volume," he said. He also announced that John H. Garrity, resident manager at the plant, who was brought in last April to clean things up, was being replaced by Leslie M. Hill Jr.
 
Operating Plants Jointly
 Mr. Freeman said that perhaps the state's five nuclear-power plants, which are run by four different entities, should be jointly operated, and that perhaps they should compete against one another, with the least efficient being closed. Some power experts have suggested that on that basis the first to go would be Nine Mile Point 1, owned by Niagara Mohawk, in Oswego.
He said the Charles Poletti Power Project, an 825-megawatt generating station that uses oil and natural gas, was so old that it might be obsolete, and needed $20 million to $80 million to comply with the Clean Air Act standards in the coming years. Rebuilding it or mothballing it were both possibilities, he said.
Indian Point 3 and Poletti, then known as Astoria 6, were acquired by the authority from Con Edison for $612 million in 1974, when they were both still under construction.
Mr. Freeman has arrived at a moment of crisis for the authority. The short-term problem is that some of its plants produce power at a price that is too high to sell; Indian Point 3, in fact, has been shut down for more than a year by management problems, while the authority pays 1,000 workers at the site.
In the longer term, the authority needs a new mission; when it was established 53 years ago by Franklin D. Roosevelt it was supposed to help electrify rural areas and to provide competition for investor-owned utilities, and to stimulate economic development. But rural electrification is long complete and Mr. Freeman said yesterday that competition in the wholesale electric market was a fact of life with or without public power. Critics say the authority's economic development program is expensive and ineffectual.
 
Backer of Electric Cars
 Instead, Mr. Freeman said, the authority should concentrate on the environment and electrification of the transportation system.
"We have this terrible problem that everyone's gone to sleep on: we import most of our oil," he said. Unless the United States moves to electric cars, trucks, buses, trains and trolleys, he said, it will "continue to send young men and women to war in the Middle East, or run the risk of having recessions" when oil exports from that region are interrupted.
In his last job, as general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Mr. Freeman was a major backer of electric cars and tried to incubate an electric vehicle manufacturing industry there; yesterday he said that he would do the same here.
He also said he would try to move the authority toward windmills and solar electric generation. "If you're just going to make kilowatt hours, and you don't care if it's clean or dirty, or if you back out foreign oil, who needs public power?" he said.

HEADLINE: Cement Prices Under Study

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Several cement producers and two industry trade associations said today that they had received requests for information from the United States Justice Department as part of an investigation into possible price fixing.
The department's antitrust division is looking into pricing practices in the cement industry nationwide, said Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman. She declined to be more specific. 
 The companies reporting that they had received inquiries were the Lafarge Corporation, Holnam Inc., the Medusa Corporation, Lone Star Industries, the Ash Grove Cement Company and Southdown Inc.
John Bermudez, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the inquiry arose from average price increases in 1993 of $5 a ton to a current level of $46 to $50 a ton. He said there had been basically no price increases for cement products for 12 years.
The analyst said the cement industry was experiencing a decline in manufacturing capacity and an increase in use to the point where American producers could not meet demand as the economy expanded.
The Portland Cement Association, of Skokie, Ill., also received a request for information on Feb. 28. The association represents 83 percent of the United States' manufacturing capacity. Bruce McIntosh, director of communications for the group, said the American Portland Cement Alliance, of Washington, had also received a request for information.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 22.79 Points on Slump in Bonds

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
With no good news on inflation to slow or stop its descent, the stock market dropped sharply yesterday. The decline hurt many different kinds of stocks, from Wal-Mart Stores to Ford Motor to Walt Disney, in moderately heavy trading.
Stock traders fumbled for explanations: weak aluminum prices that affected stocks in leading indexes, strong gold prices that exacerbated inflation fears, even a Whitewater rumor that appeared intended to undermine President Clinton. 
 But it was clear that the declining bond market was the major force behind slumping stock prices, with bond yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices, again reaching levels not seen since last summer. The yield of the Treasury's long bond rose to 6.95 percent yesterday. The market for the 30-year bond has closed down in price for 16 of the 25 sessions since the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates a quarter-point on Feb. 4.
 
 
Anticipating a Rate Increase
 Some analysts speculated that another quarter-point rate increase by the Fed was already reflected in 30-year rates and that rates have thus stabilized, limiting the stock market's decline.
But Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, said, "If the Fed raises rates more than a quarter- point, then the long bond's yield might even go down and thus help stocks."
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 22.79 points yesterday, to 3,830.62. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 3.16 points, to 463.90. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.96 points, to 789.09.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.56 points, to 257.22. Volume was heavy on the Big Board, with 369.4 million shares traded. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks, 1,486 to 688. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined 2.01 points, to 464.78.
Speculation about the Whitewater affair and the course of the special counsel's investigation circulated on trading floors yesterday as some White House aides testified before a grand jury. But most analysts said the speculation had little effect on stock and bond prices.
 
 
Sharp Rise in Gold
 The price of gold, which Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, described recently as an important barometer of inflation, surged yesterday, indicating a rise in inflation fears. It staged its biggest rise since September. Gold for April delivery rose $8.10, to $388.20 an ounce. Some traders cited the drop in bond prices as a reason for the gold rise, but also cited continuing violence in South Africa, whose large gold production might be disrupted.
Aluminum Company of America, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, dropped 1 3/4, to 73 1/8. The world's largest aluminum producer, Alcoa has been a favorite of institutional investors betting that aluminum prices will soon rise following a world glut of the metal. But reports by the London Metal Exchange and others indicated that the glut continued.
International Paper, another Dow component, also fell after executives cautioned Wall Street analysts that their first-quarter earnings estimates were too high. Shares of International Paper fell 2, to 69 1/2.
The two stocks dragged down the Dow by 8.4 points, while 21 other stocks, including General Electric, Sears, Roebuck and Exxon contributed to the rest of the decline.
Intel fell 1 1/2, to 70 1/8, after a rival, Advanced Micro Devices, won a major court victory. A Federal jury cleared Advanced Micro of Intel's claim that Advanced Micro infringed valuable copyrights governing the software critical to Intel computer chips. The ruling will help Advanced Micro sell similar chips and may eventually hurt Intel's sales.
After the market closed, Northrop announced a competing bid for Grumman, the Long Island military contractor. Northrop is offering more than $2 billion, compared with the $1.9 billion offered by Martin Marietta earlier this week. Before the announcement, Northrop rose 5/8, to 41 1/4; Grumman rose 6 3/4, to 61 3/4, and Martin Marietta rose 1/2, to 46 1/2.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts a Broad Drop; Uncertainty on Rates Cited

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and other currencies yesterday amid mounting worries about the Clinton Administration's role in the Whitewater affair.
Adding to the pressures on the dollar was the growing view in the currency markets that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to act soon to push up interest rates further. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar tumbled to 1.6790 marks, from 1.7070 marks on Wednesday. It also fell to 105.30 Japanese yen from 105.80 yen.
The dollar first came under attack in Asian trading overnight, and it was besieged by selling throughout the New York trading session.
 It tumbled on rumors that a Washington-based economic consulting firm was circulating damaging information about the Whitewater real estate affair. The talk rippled through financial markets, pushing bond prices sharply lower and causing stocks to fall in sympathy.
 Win Thin, international economist at MCM Currencywatch, said the Whitewater rumors were not the underlying cause of the dollar's fall but they fed into overall negative sentiment.
 "The market has been very jittery," Mr. Thin said. "There's a lot of uncertainty and this adds to it."
 Much of the selling in Asia took place in reaction to the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report on the nation's economy, which was released Wednesday afternoon. The report described price pressures as mild, dampening recent speculation that the Fed would act soon to tighten monetary policy.
 That prompted selling by many hedge fund managers and other large investors, who had been holding dollars in expectation that higher American interest rates would attract more buyers to the currency.
 Those players have been frustrated with the dollar's inability to make strong gains, dealers said.
 "People had been buying dollars on the dips," said Hillel Waxman, vice president at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York. "But now they are not bothering. The dollar doesn't seem to have any oomph."
 In New York, the British pound rose to $1.5035, from $1.4925 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: St. John's Triumphs, But UConn Awaits

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE 

 BODY:
St. John's extended its troubled season by one more game last night. The Redmen defeated Pittsburgh, 80-72, in the Big East tournament, and their reward is a quarterfinal game today against Connecticut, the No. 2 team in the nation according to the polls.
For the first time since 1989, St. John's was playing in the Thursday night doubleheader that opens the tournament at Madison Square Garden, the one matching the seventh through 10th teams in the final standing. 
 In the second game, Seton Hall, the seventh-place team, defeated last- place Miami, 69-51. The Pirates will play second-place Syracuse tonight, and in other games Villanova will meet Providence and Boston College will take on Georgetown.
Pitt gave St. John's a fight, but Miami was feeble against Seton Hall. By halftime, Arturas Karnishovas had as many points for the Pirates, 16, as the entire Miami team. The Hurricanes, losing for the 17th consecutive time, trailed by 35-16 and extended their non-winning record in the Big East to 0-19 this season.
St. John's had finished ninth with a 5-13 record in the conference, and over all it is now 12-16 in its first losing season since 1962-63. The Redmen did a nice job against the eighth-place Panthers, who lost for the ninth time straight time and finished their season with a 13-14 record.
 
Farewell Game for Evans
 The Panthers' leading scorer, Jerry McCullough, did not play because of a hand injury, and it was a farewell for the coach, Paul Evans, whose contract was not extended.
Charles Minlend had another strong performance and was St. John's leading scorer, with 22 points, for the fourth consecutive game. Derek Brown had 16 points, a season high, and Maurice Brown had 10 as the Redmen broke a six-game losing streak, the longest for the school in 75 years.
Derek Brown said: "We didn't have anything to lose because we haven't had a good season. So we came out to just have fun. It's good to get another crack at UConn."
What about Connecticut, a team that trounced St. John's on Saturday in Hartford, 95-80, and beat the Redmen at the Garden on Jan. 15 by 85-81 with Donyell Marshall scoring 42 points for the Huskies?
St. John's Coach Brian Mahoney said: "With their fast break and their shooting ability we'll have our work cut out for us. The problem is we had to spend a lot of energy tonight, and 2 o'clock game time comes pretty quick. So I want to get us back to the hotel as quickly as I can."
Derek Brown added: "We can't rush against their pressure. We have to concentrate on a transition defense and try to limit Donyell to not so many points."
Evans did not think much of St. John's chances against the Huskies. "Anybody's in trouble against them," he said. "They're 20 deep and rank second in the country." For St. John's to win, Evans said, "It's got to be a a fluke, like when Ohio U. beat them. But I don't think those guys are going to bothered by the sun like they were in Hawaii."
The reference was to UConn's defeat, one of only three, to Ohio University in the Christmas vacation tournament on the island of Maui.
 
'They've Been a Problem for Us'
 Seton Hall Coach P. J. Carlesimo was pessimistic, too, about the Pirates' chances against Syracuse. "They've been a problem for us," he said. "The matchups don't work out well for us."
The Orangemen beat the Pirates, 78-74, at the Meadowlands on Jan. 22 and 91-69 at Syracuse on Feb. 23.
Karnishovas, Seton Hall's ace, concluded with 21 points against Miami in a sloppy contest, and Darrell Mims was next with 10. The Pirates (16-11) won easily in spite of shooting only 33.9 percent from the field. Miami (7-20) shot 38.6 percent, 26.3 in the first half, and thus ended a season of misery. "One I wouldn't wish on anybody," said the coach, Leonard Hamilton.
Earlier in the day, Marshall received the Big East player of the year award at a pre-tournament luncheon at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. He led the conference in scoring, averaging 25.7 points per game.
The award for Big East defensive player of the year also went to Marshall by vote of the coaches. "That surprised me," he said.
Only Patrick Ewing of Georgetown, in 1984 and 1985, had received both Big East awards.
The awards piled up for Connecticut. Jim Calhoun was voted Big East coach of the year and Doron Sheffer, the 21-year-old freshman from Israel, was named rookie of the year.
Karnishovas won the award that goes to the best player and student. Karnishovas, an honor student in global economics from Vilnius, Lithuania, graduates in June and hopes for an N.B.A. career.

HEADLINE: Review/Film;
A Bumbler Not Quite Making Ends Meet

 BODY:
"Raining Stones" was shown as part of the 1993 New York Film Festival. Here are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2. The film opens today at Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village.
Ken Loach, the English film maker, is on a new roll. 
 Like "Riff-Raff," a bitterly comic response to the policies of Britain's Tory Governments, "Raining Stones," his new film, focuses on working-class folk who have somehow failed to benefit from trickle-down economic theories. The setting is a medium-sized city in the north of England where Bob (Bruce Jones), a youngish, balding man who's no better than he should be, is trying to make ends meet in a depressed job market.
When first seen, Bob and his pal Tommy (Ricky Tomlinson) are in a foggy meadow at dawn trying to steal a large, uncooperative sheep. After they have finally caught and trussed the animal, but failed to screw their courage to the point where they might either stick or bash it to death, they deliver it to a friendly butcher. "You said lamb," scoffs the butcher. "This is mutton. You can't give mutton away."
So it goes for Bob through a series of alternately hilarious and melodramatic misadventures in the world of self-help. When he tries to make a little money by going door-to-door cleaning drains, the only person who accepts his services is his pastor, Father Barry (Tom Hickey), a Roman Catholic priest who assumes it's Bob's contribution to the church. Stealing sod from a golf course for a landscape gardener is not much more profitable. A job as a bouncer at a disco lasts one night.
Behind Bob's increasing desperation is the forthcoming first Communion of his daughter, Coleen (Gemma Phoenix). Although both Anne (Julie Brown), his wife, and Father Barry point out that clothes do not make the Communion, Bob remains obsessed with the idea that Coleen must have a new wardrobe costing in the neighborhood of 150 ($224). His is a pride made terrible by poverty.
With a fine screenplay by Jim Allen and the wizardly camera work of Barry Ackroyd, Mr. Loach again shows himself to be in top form. "Raining Stones" is brisk, richly characterized fiction that cuts as deeply and truly as any documentary. The movie slides effortlessly from farce to melodrama.
Mr. Jones, an actor new to me, is splendid in the central role. Though intense and funny, the performance is free of mannerisms. Bob behaves like someone being trailed by a hidden camera.
Mr. Loach is not a fashionable director at the minute. He's an anachronism in a time when even politically committed directors are expected to stand at a distance from their material, in this way to protect their cool. Mr. Loach doesn't worry about that. Yet because he has such command of craft, his films leap beyond politics, beyond genre, to a life in what might be called pure cinema.

HEADLINE: Mining Law Change Reduces Tax Revenue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Gold in Our Hills" by Robert Redford (Op-Ed, Feb. 21) left a misinformed impression that mining has "savaged" the West and that Congressional efforts to rid mining from public lands would create jobs in a region where good jobs are few and far between. 
 Mining opponents, such as Mr. Redford, would actually cost Western states as many as 47,000 jobs and as much as $6.1 billion in lost economic activity, should they prevail in their attempts to place restrictive financial and regulatory constraints on one of the few industries that provide high-paying jobs in even the most remote sections of the West.
To say that the taxpayer "doesn't get a dime for the billions of dollars of minerals extracted" is to ignore the hundreds of millions of dollars mining companies pay in Federal, state and local production and income taxes. A recent study by the accounting organization of Coopers & Lybrand found that the House version of mining law reform legislation would actually cost the Federal Government $422 million annually in lost revenue. The Senate proposal, which has the support of the mining industry, would generate $53 million in Federal revenue annually.
Granted, mining law reformers are correct when they say their environmental cleanup programs would create jobs. But these jobs, by their very nature, would be temporary, pay slightly better than minimum wage and would in no way be able to replace the lost tax contributions that Western state governments, as well as the Federal Government, depend on from mining.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
West in Deal On Russian Oil Refinery

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation and ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. plan to announce an agreement today to license technology and help upgrade a major oil refinery in Russia.
Chevron would supply the Russians with the licensing and engineering support to build the first hydro-cracker facility using Western technology. ABB Asea Brown Boveri, based in Zurich, is one of the leading builders of refineries. The project, an upgrade of a refinery in Kirishi, about 70 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, is estimated to cost $500 million; the fees awarded to Chevron and Asea Brown Boveri were not disclosed. 
 Hydro-cracking, which converts heavy oil into fuels like diesel, jet fuel and high-octane gasoline, has long been used in the West. It is a highly efficient technology for refining oil.
Laurie Sachleben, a spokeswoman for Chevron, confirmed that the two companies would make an announcement in Russia today, but would not comment further.
 
Some Details Discussed
 Many of the final construction contracts still have to be negotiated, said a person with knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity. Some details of the venture were discussed by Percy Barnevik, the chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, at a news conference in Copenhagen.
What was left unclear was how the companies would be paid. A major problem for Western companies doing business in Russia is getting paid in currencies or commodities that can be converted or sold in the West.
Russia's oil industry forms the backbone of its exports and is the main way the country obtains Western currencies, which it needs to buy Western products and technology to rebuild its economy.
Russia's production of crude oil has been dropping and most of its refineries are considered backward by Western standards.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Russia Gets an Oil Loan
 WASHINGTON, March 10 (AP) -- The United States Export-Import Bank said today it would finance a $245 million loan to the Russian oil industry, its biggest loan to Russia and the first under a $2 billion program to promote oil and natural gas production.
The loan would be made to Permneft, a state-owned company in the district of Perm on the eastern slope of the Ural Mountains. The Export-Import Bank would guarantee the five-year loan from a private bank, which has not been chosen. The money would be used to buy equipment from United States suppliers.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 12, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A headline in Business Day yesterday about a Russian oil refinery deal referred incorrectly in some editions to the participation of the Chevron Corporation and the Swiss company ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. The two companies will be involved with the construction of the refinery; they are not making an investment in it.
In addition, an adjoining article from Redwood City, Calif., about the 3DO Company's game machines erroneously carried a headline from the oil refinery article in some editions. The article should have been headlined "3DO Adds to Builders of Its Games."

HEADLINE: Western Banks To Relieve 40% of Polish Debt

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 11

 BODY:
After four years of negotiations, Western commercial banks agreed today to a reorganization of Poland's debt that will reduce what the country owes by more than 40 percent and is likely to enhance its economic prospects.
Poland is the fourth-largest debtor among the world's developing countries, ranking after the big Latin American nations that have reached similar debt-reduction agreements -- Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
 The Polish deal is the second reached with Western bankers since the collapse of Communism, and it formally ends four years of default by Poland. Last year, Bulgaria received a 50 percent reduction in its outstanding debt.
 
Will Take Time to Achieve
 Bankers and diplomats said it would probably be 1995 before the first positive effects of today's agreement are felt in the Polish economy. Final details of the agreement will not be worked out until September, and the particulars must still be sold to more than 450 banks with loans to Poland.
Whenever the agreement is completed, the Warsaw authorities will be in a position to borrow for big capital projects that are already being designed. These include the renovation of power plants to make them more efficient and the construction of better roads.
Poland's infrastructure is broken down, and this has hindered Western companies with plants here, making it hard for them to set up distribution systems for their products.
Western diplomats here predicted that the agreement would increase the creditor banks' interest in establishing themselves in Poland. Until now, the Polish central bank has declined to issue licenses to foreign banks, hoping to first improve the health of Poland's weak banks.
William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank in New York, called today's deal "a very positive event for Poland because it will cut the country's cost of doing international trade and allow it to access the international capital markets when it needs to." Citibank was a member of the negotiating committee.
 
Overdue, an Economist Says
 Tomasz Telma, an economist with Planecon in Washington, a research company that specializes in the economies of Eastern Europe, said: "It is high time this has happened. It will help to reduce the burden of bad debts and open the way for the privatization of Polish banks."
It remains to be seen whether the Polish agreement proves to be as important as those from Latin America over the last five years.
The Latin deals, begun in the Bush Administration under a debt strategy put forward by Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, set the precedent for the granting of debt relief. They proceeded on the realization that the big debtor countries could not afford to pay their obligations under existing terms, and held out the hope that debt relief would stimulate economic growth.
The agreements reached with the Latin Americans were intended to cut outstanding debt burdens by about 35 percent. They were also tied to market-opening moves in the countries, and have helped attract foreign investment.
The Polish deal, which was hammered out in Frankfurt and announced here by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, was hailed by the Warsaw Government and by Western diplomats as a landmark for the Poles.
"This agreement now opens the way for servicing our debt and assures the growth of our economy," Mr. Pawlak said. "This is an event that will have a very important impact on our economic development."
Diplomats in Warsaw said that Poland appeared to have won a significant victory by achieving an overall debt reduction from the banks that appeared more favorable than those under the Brady plan.
According to rough calculations by these diplomats tonight, Poland won a net reduction of $5.9 billion, or about 45 percent. This reduces the total debt from about $13.2 billion to about $7.3 billion. The figures are not final, so the exact reduction is not yet known.
One reason the talks with Poland dragged on so long was the fear by the banks that a precedent set with Poland might force renegotiation of tens of billions of dollars of debts elsewhere.
 
Better Than Brady Deals
 A banker indirectly involved in the Polish negotiations and a veteran of the Latin American deals acknowledged that the overall reduction was larger for Poland. But he also noted that the two sets of deals were very different.
In the Polish deal, for instance, the Government is asking for a relatively small amount of new money as part of the package. The level of new loans, and thus the negotiating leverage for the bankers, was higher in the Latin American negotiations.
According to the World Bank, Poland's total debt, including that from banks and governments, was $48.5 billion at the end of 1992.
In 1991, the Paris Club of Western governments granted Poland a 50 percent reduction in the loans made by the governments, cutting its commitments to sovereign lenders to around $35 billion.
Brazil has a total debt of $121.1 billion. The Brazilians, who have both political and economic problems, are still trying to work out final details of their debt-reduction agreement with the bankers. Brazilian officials are scheduled to meet with the International Monetary Fund next week in an effort to get the endorsements needed.
Mexico owes $113.4 billion, and Argentina, $67.6 billion.
Poland's debt problems arose when its post-Communist Government in 1989 stopped making principal and interest payments on the short- , medium- and long-term loans that its Communist predecessors had taken on in the 1970's to provide housing and other needs for a consumer goods-deprived population.
The failure of Poland to pay back the billions lent by Western banks prevented it from tapping global financial markets for development loans and credits that would move it toward a market economy. Its pariah status on the financial markets had been considered a major inhibitor of its growth.
 
Choices for Banks
 Poland's chief negotiator at the talks, Krzysztof Krowacki, said he was particularly pleased that the banks had agreed to reduce both the total of loans that had to be paid back and the amount of unpaid interest owed. According to one banker, of the $13.2 billion in debt involved in the reductions, a little more than $8 billion consists of old loans and the rest is unpaid interest. Mr. Krowacki said Poland was the first country to win such a concession.
Under the terms of today's agreement -- reached in negotiations with a committee including the Dresdner Bank, Lloyds Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, the Bank of America, Barclays Bank and the Bank of Montreal -- Mr. Krowacki said Poland would pay less than $400 million each year for five years and then $500 million in the following years.
As in other debt-reduction agreements, this one gives banks a choice of how they want to cut Poland's debt obligations. One option cuts the principal owed by 47 percent but leaves the interest rate at market levels. The other leaves the principal owed unchanged but cuts the interest rate well below market levels. The effective debt reduction here is 42 percent.
Poland was one of three formerly Communist countries with heavy indebtedness to the London Club of banks. The others were Bulgaria and Russia, with the Bulgarians having had outstanding debts of $12.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Job Security That Is Based On Skills, Not the Economy

SERIES: Staying Afloat: Work in the 90's -- Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KANSAS City, Mo.

 BODY:
A year ago, Terri Welk, a 37-year-old airline worker with a new bachelor's degree in the emerging field of computer-based information systems, sent out a single resume. After an interview two weeks later, she landed a job paying close to $40,000 a year.
Behind these prosaic facts is an adventure story of one woman's escape from the trap doors and falling pillars of the economy of the 1990's. Mrs. Welk may not have struck gold, but she had seen disaster coming and stayed one step ahead. She is a winner in a world of work that for so many has become a world turned upside down.
 
A Night School Route
 Working as a telephone operations manager for Trans World Airlines here in the late 1980's, she watched as the airline began reducing its work force and reorganizing its reservations business. "I started wondering how secure my job really was," she said. 
 So she took classes at night and on Saturdays to earn her degree, and now she helps manage the telecommunications system of Twentieth Century Services, a rising company here that manages mutual funds.
There is no doubt that she made the right decision: since she left T.W.A., her former department has been moved to Atlanta.
Mrs. Welk survived the big-company purges of the last few years, in which the jobs of office clerks and assembly-line workers and middle managers were swallowed by automation and foreign competitors. In the new world of work, experts say, a skill that a worker can sell from employer to employer -- not a lifetime job with one employer -- is what confers security. Today, they say, you are less whom you work for than what you can do.
The experts say that for Americans to make themselves marketable and to stay employed they need computer literacy, a solid grounding in the three R's, apprenticeships for those who do not go on to college, and constant retraining to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and employers' needs.
But the experience of workers here and across the country shows that surviving the current job market also involves some luck. Skills that are in demand in some parts of the country go begging in others. For example, machinists, who are among the highest-skilled industrial workers, have been losing jobs at aerospace companies in Missouri, Connecticut and Southern California. But in Northern California, small and thriving companies in other industries have trouble finding enough machinists.
The value of some skills -- like aerospace engineering and aluminum welding -- has evaporated with cutbacks in the aerospace industry. And the value of other skills, like managing the hazardous wastes of closed military bases, has only recently become apparent.
Across the nation, factory jobs are still disappearing: There were 21 million such jobs, accounting for 23 percent of the work force in 1979, and only 18 million jobs today, accounting for 16 percent of the total. But skilled people like electricians and millwrights can still get factory jobs paying more than $20 an hour.
College graduates -- a quarter of all Americans -- earn 77 percent more than high school graduates, but they are not guaranteed stable employment. The growing emphasis on equipping workers with computers and encouraging them to manage themselves has squeezed out white-collar workers skilled in managing other people and paper flows.
"They were checkers checking the work of checkers," said Rick Lucas, head of the Kansas City office of Drake Beam Morin, which counsels laid-off executives on finding new jobs.
Mrs. Welk took the prescribed road to a fail-safe career by going back to school and acquiring new skills.
 
'A Noneducated Man'
 But the new job market also has room for people like Ron Coleman, 46, a heavy-equipment operator from Kansas City who has not set foot in a classroom since he was 15 years old. He runs a road-working crew that bores water and sewer lines under highways, work that has guaranteed him steady employment through recessions: $15 an hour, good benefits and, for each of the last three years, a $30,000 bonus.
"I'm a noneducated man," Mr. Coleman says. "But I can read dirt."
He and his wife, Linda, a registered nurse, made $90,000 last year, almost twice the national median for two-income families.
Mr. Coleman and Mrs. Welk are the buoyant survivors in today's world of work. Good breaks, like happening to be in a place that covets their skills, have helped a lot. But so has their initiative and grit.
 
<The Welks
Keeping Pace With Change
 One recent morning, Terri Welk was under a desk, pulling out the wires of a telephone, a fax machine and a credit card reader. She was helping to move a department of Twentieth Century Services to larger quarters on the sixth floor of the company's high-rise building in an affluent district south of downtown Kansas City.
"I'm learning about the nuts and bolts," she said. "I used to call, 'Why isn't this working?' My job now is to make it work." In this part of her job, she is like the old-fashioned telephone man.
Some of her day is spent scrolling through data on her computer, trouble-shooting the company's telephone circuits and its answering system, which directs thousands of customers each day to account managers. She programs the telephones and computers that make the company's telecommunications network run.
"Telecommunications is everywhere," she said. "In some capacity, I think I can find a job anywhere."
 
The Price of Automation
 She may be right. Many workers in telecommunications, however, are among the hardest hit in today's economy as automation replaces switchboard operators and telephone repair workers. Last year, 60,000 workers in the telecommunications field were laid off. But even automated telephone systems need workers -- people like Mrs. Welk, who have expertise in operating the technology that makes them run.
Mrs. Welk has worked hard to insure her survival. She first peered into the future of the job market in 1979, when she barely escaped a furlough from her first job as a clerk at T.W.A.'s administrative offices here and she was shifted to another clerical job. "I thought I should to go night school," said Mrs. Welk, who dropped out of college after her sophomore year to get married.
She noticed that T.W.A. was hiring more and more people with data-processing skills, so she took noncredit courses at a community college and was quickly promoted to positions installing software in the company's mainframe computers and managing its voice-mail system.
Then, four years ago, she sensed greater changes afoot as the troubled airline desperately looked for ways to consolidate its operations and save money.
 
A Greater Leap
 This time, she decided, the job market was changing so fast that she had to make a greater leap. With two years of college already completed, she began studying programming and other computer courses at Park College near here, getting up at 5 A.M. to study until she went to work at 8 A.M. Her effort paid off: she graduated summa cum laude three years later and walked into her job at Twentieth Century Services.
"This is the best thing that ever happened to me," she said. "I like doing this, and I think I'll like it for a long, long time."
Her husband, Cary Welk, 39, cannot say the same thing for his job on the assembly line at the Ford Motor Company plant here, where he has worked since 1977.
In these days of booming automobile sales, Mr. Welk is making a lot of money: $18.23 an hour for 40 hours, plus high overtime pay. Each hour on the line, Mr. Welk installs 50 Ford Tempo headliners -- the interior fabric on the roof, the visors and the bracket for the map light. "You can go almost into a trance," he said. "I can go to the Caribbean for 20 minutes."
But it's the uncertainty of the work, not the routine, that gets to him. Robots or lower-wage workers in Mexico, where Ford has a similar plant, could take his job some day. Laid-off, unskilled auto workers here can still find jobs, he said, but they pay only $6 or $7 an hour.
 
Living Well
 Still, he looks at the $1,000 a month he is earning now and at the travails his wife has been through, and says he is willing to run the risk that he and Ford will stay together. From a peak of 5,400 workers at the end of the 1970's, Ford cut back to about 3,000 during the last recession. With his lengthening seniority Mr. Welk has survived the cuts, and with sales surging again the company now has more than 4,000 workers.
The Welks, who have no children, live well in a $100,000, three-bedroom house that was built into the side of a hill on their three semirural acres at the north end of Kansas City. They heat their home with wood that Mr. Welk chops and splits.
On a trailer beside the garage is their 16-foot Hobie Cat boat, which they use most weekends on nearby Smithville Lake. For their 15th anniversary a year ago, they sailed the Virgin Islands for five days on a chartered boat. There is nothing, they say, that they really want except, perhaps, a bigger boat.
 
The Colemans
Hustling Early, Always Learning
 However unsettled the world of work has become, many blue-collar workers still thrive.
Ronald Coleman flunked algebra and dropped out of school in the ninth grade to work on the family farm in Iowa. His girlfriend, Linda Jacobs, got pregnant and dropped out a year later. Today, married 29 for years, the Colemans have the world on a string, sitting in their hot tub, roaring off to rallies with their reproduction 1924 Ford hot rod and their Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Mr. Coleman is a pipe layer, an occupation much in demand, according to the Labor Department. Hefty and lushly bearded, he is the foreman of a construction crew that bores water and sewer lines under rural highways.
Over the years, he has taught himself to run backhoes, boring machines and bulldozers. He learned welding in his garage with the help of books and tips from his brother-in-law.
 
Trophies of the Good Life
 Most years, Mr. Coleman works 44 to 48 weeks, with time off in bad weather, which is no hardship for him. Besides his $15-an-hour base salary, he has gotten a $30,000 bonus at the end of each of the last three years. His employer, Morris and Company of Marion, Iowa, provides health insurance for him and his wife, even during layoffs, and an ample retirement fund.
His wife, a nurse for 12 years, earns $21 an hour at a local hospital working part time as much or as little as she wants. Their daughter, Lorri, now 29, was so impressed by her mother's success that she is now studying to be a nurse.
In their house, the Colemans display the trophies of their labors. Mounted on the walls of the living room are a wild turkey, a deer's head, a dolphin fish and a hammerhead shark. Mr. Coleman shot the deer and the turkey on his own private game preserve, 100 acres in northeastern Missouri, that he bought two years ago for $21,000.
For all their trophies, toys and comfortable income, the Colemans are fairly frugal. They do not drink, smoke or, aside from the $56,000 remaining on their mortgage, borrow. They live in a working-class subdivision on the northern fringe of Kansas City in a split-foyer house with three bedrooms and two baths.
His work involves driving pipe laterally under highways. With a backhoe, Mr. Coleman and his helpers scour out an oblong pit eight and a half feet deep. "You've got to figure the grade before you dig the pit," he said.
People go to school to learn this work. "You have to know how wide to make your pit to make it safe to work in," he said. "It's like welding. You can read all the books you want on welding. We've sent boys to school for welding. And they still can't do it."
Mr. Coleman started a new project near Des Moines, Iowa, last week after a seven-week winter break
"When I was a kid," Mr. Coleman said, "I learned how to work. I paid attention to what the man was doing. I just paid attention to my job. They found out I was a hustler, so you just move up the ladder."
Next: Women bring home the basics.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker's Health Plan Caught in Crossfire

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
For 12 months, Representative Pete Stark took potshots at President Clinton's health plan. He said it was based on "a hope and a prayer and an untested theory." He likened it to a unicorn, "a beautiful animal in fairyland, but unseen on earth."
Now Mr. Stark, a California Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, is struggling to win votes for his own proposal, which is much different from the President's. And he finds that Democrats and Republicans on his subcommittee are taking potshots at his bill, which would expand Medicare to cover millions of people who have no other source of health insurance. 
 Mr. Stark, who has mocked the Clinton plan and its chief architect, Ira C. Magaziner, has been trying to explain and defend his own plan in three days of subcommittee sessions this week.
It has not been easy.
 
Plan Is Attacked
 On the panel, as in Congress as a whole, any proposal to guarantee universal coverage and control health costs faces a withering barrage of questions from the left, from the right and from unexpected places in between.
"Members are coming from every point of the compass," Mr. Stark observed today. "I do not have the answer to every question."
On the dais of his subcommittee, Mr. Stark is caught between two formidable critics: Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, on one side, and Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, on the other.
Mrs. Johnson is often described as a moderate Republican; she supports abortion rights. She has raised questions about Mr. Stark's bill with the persistence of a prosecutor interrogating a witness. She said the bill would disrupt the existing health care market, penalize "high-cost, high-wage states" like Connecticut and inconvenience employers who already offer health benefits to their employees.
"The private sector is reducing health costs at a far more rapid rate than the public sector," she said. But, she asserted, Mr. Stark's proposal would hinder the creative cost-control efforts of many companies and would enroll many of the uninsured in a public program that by her account has done a poor job of controlling costs.
Mr. Stark boasted that his proposal was "much simpler than the Clinton plan." But Mr. McDermott, with a wry, avuncular style, repeatedly pinpointed complex features of Mr. Stark's bill. And he said his own proposal for a "single payer" health program, like the one in Canada, would be much easier to understand and administer.
 
Concern About '2-Tier' System
 Mr. McDermott praised Mr. Stark for trying to find a compromise, but said the bill "institutionalizes a two-tier health care system," with a separate insurance pool for people who are poor or unemployed or cannot obtain private insurance. He said he feared that the proposed Part C of Medicare would be "a waste basket to catch all the problems and failures of the private health insurance system."
By contrast, he said, the single payer plan would create one program for all.
Michael O. Spivey, a lawyer who lobbies for the National Association of Public Hospitals, said Mr. Stark's proposal differed from other bills in that it could conceivably win approval from the subcommittee, the first panel to take up comprehensive health legislation this year.
Mr. Spivey described Mr. Stark's problem this way: "Some members of the subcommittee oppose any health insurance mandate on employers or individuals. Other members want a single payer Government-run system. How do you find a position that attracts support from both extremes?"
In an interview, Mr. Stark said his bill would slow the growth of health spending by authorizing "price controls that are more definitive and stricter than the President's."
Mr. Clinton would control health spending indirectly, by limiting increases in health insurance premiums. Under Mr. Stark's bill, the Government would establish "maximum payment rates" for doctors and hospitals if total private health spending exceeded national goals set by Federal law. The Government would, in effect, regulate private health spending with fee schedules like those devised for Medicare.
Mrs. Johnson asserted: "The Federal role in Mr. Stark's health care plan is far greater than the Federal role in the President's plan. The Government would have the power to impose a Federal fee schedule even on states that stayed within their budget caps."
 
Vow to Fight for Controls
 In response to such complaints, Mr. Stark said, "My bill could work without private-sector price controls." But he said the elimination of such controls from his bill would permit Medicare and other public programs to continue shifting costs to private employers and private insurers. Doctors and hospitals say they routinely increase charges to such private payers because the Government underpays them for treating people under Medicare and Medicaid.
Mr. Stark said he would fight to impose controls on private health spending. It would be "irresponsible, economically devastating, shortsighted and capricious" to delete such controls from the bill, he said. But he said he recognized that some Democrats and many Republicans opposed this part of his proposal.
Hillary Rodham Clinton met on Thursday with House Democrats and urged them to keep pushing health care legislation. Some Republicans have suggested that the inquiry into the Clintons' land deals may reduce Mrs. Clinton's effectiveness as an advocate for the legislation. But Mr. Stark said, "It certainly hasn't affected us here."
Mr. Stark, like Mrs. Clinton, would require employers to help buy health insurance for their employees. But Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said Mr. Stark's bill would impose more of a burden on small businesses, because it would not provide them with subsidies or limit their liability.
Mr. Stark said he saw no reason to try to appease small businesses because they would never accept an employer mandate. "That's like trying to feed dog biscuits to a pit bull," he said.

HEADLINE: House, With Little Passion, Passes Clinton Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
After a debate that was genteel by its usual standard of oratorical combat, the House of Representatives voted along party lines today to approve a rough outline for future Federal budgets that is almost precisely what President Clinton was seeking.
It was an utter turnabout from the last major vote of 1993, not four months ago, when scores of House Democrats ignored Presidential pleas and very nearly hacked $90 billion more from Mr. Clinton's spending plans. And it signaled that the deficit-cutting lather that propelled budget politics in Mr. Clinton's first year in office is dead. 
 Representative Timothy J. Penny, the Minnesota Democrat who led efforts to cut Federal spending late last year, said the fervor had "dissipated, both within Congress and across the country." The rising Federal debt seems less menacing this year, he said, in part because low interest rates have kept it from rising as fast as most people had feared.
Today the House voted, 243 to 165, to approve its Federal budget resolution, a spending blueprint that roughly states how much the lawmakers expect major Government agencies to spend in each of the next five years.
 
Republican Plan Defeated
 The plan anticipates spending $1.54 trillion in the fiscal year 1995, which starts next Oct. 1, and a total of $8.5 trillion through the fiscal year 1999. In the fiscal year 1995, discretionary spending -- that is, the spending that is not consumed by mandated programs like Medicare and Social Security -- would total $541 billion, or about $3 billion less than Mr. Clinton requested.
The vote came after House Democrats swatted aside a series of alternative budgets, including a Republican package that would have cut the five-year budget by an extra $147 billion and a proposal by the Congressional Black Caucus to shift $125 billion in military spending to social programs.
The Republican measure, which took up most of today's debate, lost by a vote of 175 to 223. The Black Caucus package was swamped, 81 to 326.
The resolution that prevailed essentially continues into a second year the White House package of tax increases and spending cuts, spread over five years, that Congress narrowly approved last summer.
The resolution would actually reduce next year's discretionary spending by $2.8 billion from 1994 levels -- the first real decline in that budget in 26 years.
 
Debate Without Passion
 The Congressional Budget Office projected in January that that package would lower the annual budget deficit from $223 billion in 1993, when Mr. Clinton took office, to $166 billion in the fiscal year 1996. The annual deficit would rise again after that, reaching $204 billion by the fiscal year 1999, the budget office predicted.
The issue today, as in budget debates last year, was whether the deficit has been cut enough. But unlike last year, the answer was never in doubt, and the passion of those past legislative battles was absent.
The Republicans, led by Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, had come up with an alternative plan with an eye on this year's midterm elections.
The proposal would have cut Federal spending by $266 billion more through 1999, including $55 billion from Medicare and Medicaid, and billions from such areas as student financial aid and grants to cities and counties. But some $120 billion of those savings would have been offset by gifts to voters in the form of a $500-per-child tax credit, a more generous version of the tax-free Individual Retirement Account program and adjustments in the capital gains tax.
The reasoning was simple: "Over the next five years, the Government will have $9 trillion to spend," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip. "We think the country is healthier when Americans get to keep their own money."
 
Gift to the Rich Charged
 Democrats called the spending cuts merciless and the tax breaks a Republican gift to the rich. The tax credit for children, for example, would not be available to poor families that owed no taxes but would exist for households with incomes of up to $200,000.
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington called that "exceedingly strange."
"If that is the other side's idea of fairness to families, then I am perplexed," he said.
For all that, the vote today binds no one; it merely sets targets for the House Appropriations Committee to meet when its subcommittees begin assembling a more detailed budget later this year.

HEADLINE: Beach Project to Pump Sand and Money

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEA BRIGHT, N.J., March 11

 BODY:
All those involved in the nation's most expensive beach restoration project, a long-delayed plan to rebuild beaches on New Jersey's severely eroded northern shoreline, refer to the endeavor in monumental terms. But that may be all they agree on.
Work on the initial phase of the enormous project begins this spring with the pumping of millions of cubic yards of sand to create 140-foot wide beaches at Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright. Then pumping operations will continue down the coast to Deal Lake just north of Asbury Park by 1998. 
 That first 12-mile installment alone is the biggest beach restoration project ever authorized by Congress and undertaken by the Army Corps of Engineers.
But it is the ambition of Congress, the Corps and New Jersey politicians to keep the sand pumping all the way down the coast to Seaside Park, altogether 33 miles of beach replenishing that Federal and state officials have likened to the digging of the Panama Canal.
 
Doubts on Costs and Benefits
 The plan has been trumpeted for its potential benefits to shore protection and to the state's $18 billion tourist economy.
But some environmentalists, academics and public advocacy groups question how much the public will benefit from a project expected to cost nearly $300 million in construction and engineering in this decade and conceivably $3 billion over the next half-century for all 33 miles.
The cost for the entire 50 years had been presented to the public as about $1.1 billion. But figures revealed this week by the Corps show that the cost will be $1.029 billion just to restore the first 12 miles of beaches, and keep them renourished as sand is swept away over five decades -- about $80 million a mile in long-term costs.
Long-term costs for 9 more miles of new beaches from Asbury Park to Manasquan Inlet, if financed by Congress and the state, are now estimated by the Corps to total $819 million, or $91 million a mile.
 
Protection or Hopeless Cause?
 "Our projections are that we will protect more capital than we spend on repairing beaches," said Bruce Bergmann, district planning director in the New York office of the Corps. "And there are also the untold environmental costs when the ocean breaches a barrier beach and flows directly into inland bays and rivers."
But D. W. Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a national coastal environmental group, counters that pumping sand on some vulnerable stretches of coast is like pouring tax dollars into the ocean. "The Atlantic is rising and ultimately will claim portions of the shoreline," he said. Indeed, the ocean has risen and shore sunk a total of one foot in the last century along the Atlantic seaboard, and geologists expect the trend to continue.
Mr. Bennett and others also ask whether supporters of the project have overstated how much the public will be able to use the beaches once they are restored. They especially question the first ones to be enlarged along the narrow strip in the Sea Bright-Monmouth Beach area, where most beaches in the past were the private playgrounds of clubs and summer cottage owners.
On paper, all the beachfront will be public. But in reality, the shortage or absence of public parking lots, toilets, drinking fountains, lifeguards and other amenities could keep the net gain in beach attendance to fewer than 1,500 a day along nearly five miles of brand-new beaches, critics say.
"Access at the Jersey Shore means parking," Mr. Bennett said. "If there's no place to park you don't have access."
Dignitaries tossed the first spadeful of sand in a ceremony on the beach near here last month. That spadeful is to be followed, beginning in May, by the pumping of millions of cubic yards of sand on the northern beaches. After that, pumping and grooming to a height of 12 feet near the seawall will move southward to rebuild beaches hurt by storms in Ocean County. The Federal Government is picking up 65 percent of the initial construction costs and the future replishment costs, and the state and localities will split the rest, said Bernard J. Moore, administrator of engineering and construction in the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. Most of the state's initial construction share will come from Economic Recovery Act funds.
 
More Funds Every 2 Years
 While there is optimism that the construction phase can be finished in 10 to 15 years, new funds for each stage most be approved as work progresses. The Sea Bright-Monmouth Beach phase, scheduled to be completed by 1996, is already financed. The next stage reaches past Long Branch. Then comes the rest of the county shoreline to the Manasquan Inlet, including the resort towns of Deal, Asbury Park, Belmar and Spring Lake. Congress must reallocate funds every two years.
Should Congress or state officials for some reason balk at providing money for any later stage -- which Army Corps officials say is unlikely -- the beaches rebuilt to that point might be quickly eroded, said Gilbert Nersesian, the Corps' chief district coastal engineer.
Mr. Bergmann was skeptical about support for the project in Ocean County. He said beaches were less sand-starved there and private property owners may be less likely to agree to public-access provisions than their northern neighbors.
Congress has actually appropriated only the first $40.6 million, covering intial construction for two years; a $19.6 million contract has been awarded to Weeks Marine Inc. of Cranford for the first three miles.
 
$1.5 Billion to Replenish
 Thomas Harnedy, the Army Corps project manager, said Thursday that new estimates come to $1.029 billion for the stretch of rebuilt beach extending from Sea Bright to Ocean Township. That estimate includes $88 million for engineering and management, $124 million for actual construction and $817 million for replenishing over the next half century.
A second section, running 9 miles from Asbury Park to Manasquan Inlet, will cost $819 million, Mr. Harnedy estimated. The figure includes $756 million for replenishment over 50 years. No estimate has been made of costs for the contemplated final stage, 12 miles in Ocean County.
The restoration, initially approved by Congress in 1958, languished for decades, hampered by a lack of Federal financing and objections from private property owners and beach clubs. But as powerful recent storms made protection of the shoreline a state political priority, state financing fell into place and the public access questions became more muted.
 
Public, but No Parking
 Still, even some architects of the beach restoration project say that as a practical matter, the new beaches being planned for Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach, two old summer resorts on narrow oceanfront strips just below Sandy Hook, will have only limited public access.
Gateway National Recreation Area on Sandy Hook, just across a short bridge from Sea Bright, has more than six miles of public beaches and 5,000 parking spaces. It still cannot handle the crush of beachgoers on an appealing summer day. On summer weekends, all the parking is taken and park gates are closed by 11 A.M.
Monmouth Beach, with one mile of oceanfront, plans to install only 80 new public parking spaces one block from the beach, according to Mayor Louis P. Sadano. Mayor Charles Rooney Jr. of Sea Bright said the town would eventually add 400 new spaces for cars at its existing public beach near the south end of town.
According to the mayors, Sea Bright will double the size of its lifeguard-protected swimming beach to a 400-foot width and Monmouth Beach will expand to 1,000 feet. In nearly six miles of new beaches, lifeguards will patrol less than one-quarter mile of shoreline, and that is where the only public toilets and drinking fountains will be put.
Two miles of new beaches in Sea Bright will have access paths spaced 2,500 feet apart with virtually no place to park, no public facilities and no lifeguards. Another half-mile is occupied by private beach clubs that were given the right to keep nonmembers off the new sand.
Only 12 public parking spaces exist along the two miles. Local people own the shoulders on both sides of the two-lane road and post "No Standing or Parking" signs along its length.
"My constituents get mad at me," said Mr. Rooney, "but the truth is they want the new beaches but they also want their privacy."
Mr. Bergman said that limited parking and concerns about local traffic bottlenecks would be overcome in part by a state plan to have shuttle buses between "satellite parking" at Sandy Hook and the new beaches. But the state official most intimately involved with the project, Mr. Moore of the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, said he knew of no plans to bus beachgoers after the Sea Bright part of the construction is completed.
 
No Protection for Public
 Nor did Mayor Sadano. "If the Feds bus bathers down to our beaches they'll have to send lifeguards along with them -- we won't be able to protect them," he said.
Mr. Moore disputed the estimate that 500 or so new parking spaces in Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach would bring in fewer than 1,500 additional beachgoers. People headed for the beach pack four or more to the car, he said, and cars could park on streets in Rumson and neighboring towns, within walking distance. He acknowledged, however, that the distances might be too much for people carrying equipment and babies.
The project's champions, however, say that the beach restorations will not only expand recreational opportunities, especially in oceanfront cities like Long Branch and Asbury Park, where there is little private beach ownership, but that it also will keep the encroaching sea from further damaging the Jersey Shore's multi-billion-dollar tourist industry.
"It's not just that we have beaches along these shores," Mr. Bergman said. "It's the density of population and infrastructure we now have living along this coast that needs protection that only a wide beach can provide," he said, referring to storms.
Edward Lloyd of the Environmental Law Clinic at Rutgers Law School, however, said that in high-hazard areas like Sea Bright, which has a year-round population of only 1,600, it might be less expensive in the long run for the public to buy private property and reroute traffic.
Dr. Stuart Farrell, a coastal engineer at Stockton State College and an authority on the New Jersey coastline, remarked: "The Army Corps can build a beach; there's no question about that. How long it stays there is another story. Some skeptics say six months, tops. My feeling is they will have to go back after three years and replace half of it."
Projected costs, however, are based on replenishment only once every six years, on average.
Mr. Nersesian, the Corps engineer, said the last few years were unusual for the number of winter storms slamming the coast. With calmer periods, repairs might be required only every 10 years or so, he said.
The plan in the Sea Bright area would put more sand beneath the water than on shore. The offshore slope is so steep that engineers must first rebuild a vast expanse of bottom, scraped clean of sediment, before beach-building can begin.
The worry is the new bottom will be unstable and shift in new storms, said Dr. Norman P. Psuty, associate director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at Rutgers University.
He also questioned why Sandy Hook, at the north end of the proposed project, and Island Beach State Park at the southern end, two of the largest public bathing beaches in the region, were not included in the plan, though both areas have suffered extensive beach erosion recently.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally Sharply, With the Dow Up 32.08

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks followed bonds again yesterday and rallied sharply. Startled by and then drawn to bond interest rates that almost touched 7 percent, traders began buying bonds again, and stock traders followed by bidding up stocks.
Stocks sensitive to a resurgent economy and interest rates benefited, including United Technologies, Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble and Citicorp. 
 Any concerns about gold, the trade frictions between the United States and Japan or the Whitewater investigation involving President Clinton that may have roiled markets on Thursday receded in the mighty movements of billions of dollars of bonds being bought and sold in worldwide markets.
 
Rate Near 7%
 And stock prices deferred to what bond traders saw on their computer screens: a spike in the yield on the 30-year Government bond shortly after 11:30 A.M. that brought the benchmark interest rate to 6.996 percent. By the end of the day, the yield had settled at 6.9 percent.
"People weren't looking for the yield to go up that high that fast," said Donald W. Kimsey, senior technical analyst for equity trading at Smith Barney Shearson. "So, they said 'that looks good, I'll take that' and they bought. The bears went out to lunch and the bulls pushed prices higher for a couple of hours."
Traders had expected this week to be a volatile one, with few market-moving economic reports. But next week may be particularly volatile with the scheduled release of the Producer Price Index on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index, the commonly accepted barometer of inflation, on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.08 points, to 3,862.70, yesterday and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.54 points, to 466.44. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.11 point, to 789.20.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.31 points, on moderate volume of 303.3 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining by 1,137 to 962. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.20 points, to 465.98.
For the week, the Dow Jones industrials moved ahead by 30.40 points.
Gold, a widely watched indicator of inflation sentiment, dropped significantly. Gold for April delivery dropped $2.10, to $386.10 an ounce, after a rise of $8.10 on Thursday.
The dollar dropped slightly against the yen in light trading, probably indicating little in terms of inflation sentiment or the market's concern about interest rates.
The Dow was lifted by 24 of 30 component stocks. Seven stocks rose by a point or more, led by United Technologies, which rose 2, to 69 3/4. Caterpillar, a favorite of institutional investors looking for economically sensitive stocks, rose 1 1/2, to 116 1/2.
Hanson P.L.C.'s American depository receipts were the most actively traded stock issue yesterday, at 25.8 million shares. Hanson rose 1/4, to 20 3/4.
Hanson, a British holding company for a variety of consumer and industrial products, often trades actively when it approaches its ex-dividend date, which is Monday. A current buyer of the issue will not receive a dividend until the next payment is declared.
The second- and third-most-active stocks were Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, respectively. Intel dropped 1 1/2, to 68 5/8, after its rival, Advanced Micro, won a big court victory against Intel on Thursday. Advanced Micro dropped 5/8, to 28 1/4, after rising 6 1/8, to 28 7/8, the day before. Typically, buyers sell stock after a fast rise in price to take profits.
In Tokyo, stocks rose slightly yesterday. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks rose 24.60 points, to 20,115.31.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending In Rebound

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Consumer spending bounced back in February from January's freeze and earthquake, reflecting greater confidence, more jobs and growing incomes.
Retail sales rose 1.5 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The gain was bigger than most economists expected and at first raised some fears of inflation among bond investors. 
 But the Government also reported that retail sales were much weaker in January than had been initially thought. They dropped 1.6 percent, not just five-tenths of 1 percent as reported a month ago.
 
Not 'Hog Wild Crazy'
 "It looks like spending is continuing to grow," said David Kelly, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economics in Boston, "but consumers haven't gone hog wild crazy in the first quarter."
Though retail sales figures are volatile and are often revised by large amounts, forecasters and investors closely follow the Government's report on sales because it tracks one-third of all the spending in the economy and thus can be a good indicator of how fast the economy is growing.
The severe winter weather this year has hurt retailers. Construction came to a near standstill in January and was still spotty in February. That showed up in steep declines in stores that sell building materials and supplies. Sales fell 6.6 percent in January and an additional 2 percent in February.
Restaurants and bars also lost considerable business in January, with sales shrinking nearly 5 percent, but they regained 1 percent last month.
 
Auto Sales Increase
 But consumers bought more of just about everything else last month. Sales by auto dealers shot up 3.2 percent in February, confirming earlier reports from Detroit of buying that has been well ahead of last year's pace of 8.7 million cars and light trucks.
Sales of other retailers rose a solid 1 percent last month after falling nearly 2 percent in January. Department stores and clothing stores did especially well. Department store sales rose 1.4 percent, on top of a 1.2 percent jump in January. And sales in clothing stores rebounded 3 percent after falling 3.4 percent in January.
Cabin fever may have sent many formerly snowbound consumers to the shopping malls in February. But consumers are also continuing to feel better, and their uneasiness about job prospects is gradually fading. Although the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence slipped in February to a reading of 93.2 from 94.3, it is still at the highest level since before the 1990-91 recession.
Indeed, consumer confidence plays an important role in spending decisions for big-ticket items like cars and appliances, and sales of these durable goods were up 2.1 percent in February after a 2.4 percent decline in January. All told, sales of durables goods were 16 percent higher than in February 1993.
Consumers are also in better financial shape. There are 1.8 million more jobs than a year ago. More important, incomes are up. Income after taxes and after adjusting for inflation is up 3.7 percent from last year, nearly as fast as consumer spending.
And the Mortgage Bankers Association reported yesterday that mortgage delinquencies fell to their lowest rate in 20 years. "It is not how much debt consumers have; it's how much easier it is to finance it at low interest rates," Mr. Kelly of Lehman Brothers said.
Higher interest rates -- a full point rise since last October -- could put a damper on spending increases this spring, economists said, if they hold down home buying, which goes hand in hand with purchases of appliances and furniture.
Most economists figure that consumer spending will rise at an annual rate of about 3 percent or 4 percent this winter and spring.

HEADLINE: Cold War's End May Give Life To a Shipyard

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, which is scheduled to close in 1995, may get an unusual reprieve: new work dismantling Russian warships.
Two Pennsylvania lawmakers, a Senate Intelligence Committee staff member and a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official worked out a proposal this week to keep the shipyard open for 10 years by converting much of the Russian fleet into scrap metal. 
 "This is a real win-win plan," said one lawmaker involved, Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican from Delaware County, outside Philadelphia. "What better way to dismantle the old Russian navy than with American workers?"
 
Hard Currency for Russia
 For Philadelphia, advocates of the proposal say, the plan would allow 1,000 to 3,000 workers to keep their jobs. It would give Russia a market to sell its scrap metal and raise badly needed hard currency to help retool its economy and build housing for thousands of soldiers leaving the Russian military.
It was unclear what effect a lawsuit pending before the United States Supreme Court might have on the proposal. Last week, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania argued the case in an effort to force the Navy to stop the planned closing of the shipyard in September 1995.
Many details remain to be resolved, but the plan received favorable early reviews this week from Defense Secretary William J. Perry, as well the chairmen of two powerful House committees, Ronald V. Dellums of California and John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Weldon said Mr. Perry told him he would discuss the matter with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of Russia when the Secretary visits Moscow next week.
The Pentagon has signed contracts for nearly $800 million to help Russia and the other former Soviet republics eliminate their nuclear and chemical weapons. But this new venture seeks to help both sides derive an economic benefit from dismantling their conventional weapons. It also prevents potentially hostile nations from buying Moscow's sensitive military technology.
Russian officials have responded positively to the plan, which was reported today in The Philadelphia Inquirer. "This project is not only a political gain for both countries, but a social and economic one as well," said Boris Ivanov, Russia's First Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry.
Dismantling ships is a much different business than building them, and shipping officials consider it one of the most dangerous industrial occupations. Workers are often exposed to asbestos, toxic paint fumes and other hazardous materials. Taiwan and South Korea have been the world leaders in shipbreaking, as the process is called, but much of the work is moving to underdeveloped countries with even lower labor costs.
As part of the arrangement, Russia would be prepared to sell aircraft carriers, cruisers, submarines and several other vessels. Russia has already sold some older submarines and ships to South Korea and Japan for scrap.
American officials said today that the plan's success would hinge on developing a procedure that is environmentally sound and consistent with existing environment regulations, and putting together a profitable business plan.
Any plan would have to cover the costs of buying from 40 to 50 Russian ships, towing them to Philadelphia and scrapping them. Mr. Weldon said scrap steel was selling for from $147 a ton to $800, depending on the kind of metal. "No one will do this unless there's a profit involved," said a senior Senate staff member.
Proponents say a private consortium or the authority established to oversee the reuse of the shipyard after it closes as a United States Navy complex would run the venture. For start-up financing, proponents might seek to tap a $50 million economic conversion fund Congress created for the shipyard or funds from the Nunn-Lugar initiative earmarked to help the former Soviet republics dispose of their nuclear and chemical weapons.
The plan came together over the last few days during a visit by Mr. Ivanov to Washington to discuss with lawmakers arms control issues and the disposition of excess Russian ships and submarines.
Mr. Ivanov met with Gary Sojka, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee staff, who told him the United States objected to Russia selling its sensitive military technology to potentially hostile third world nations. Mr. Ivanov said Russia needed to scrap more than 50 warships and 400 tanks to raise money to help rebuild its economy.
Mr. Weldon has proposed breaking up United States warships at the Philadelphia Naval Yard as a way to keep it open. Mr. Sojka said he remembered the proposal, contacted Mr. Weldon, and along with Mr. Specter, hammered out the proposal.
Mr. Weldon said he would lead a delegation of Philadelphia-area politicians and civic leaders to Moscow in the next few weeks to meet with Mr. Grachev to work out the details. In a letter he gave to Mr. Ivanov to deliver to the Russian Defense Minister, Mr. Weldon said, "It is clearly important to both sides that we nurture cooperative efforts on military conversion and elimination."

HEADLINE: Trenton Aide Says Economy Will Stay Flat for Next Year

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 11

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will not be able to rely on a growing state economy to help close a $2.4 billion gap and to pay for the next installment of her promised income-tax cuts, the State Treasurer said today.
At a briefing on projected revenue for the 1995 fiscal year, Brian W. Clymer, the treasurer, said he had expected better economic news. Instead, he said, the state's economy will remain flat in the coming year, with revenues expected to fall slightly below the $14.8 billion the state expects to receive this year. 
 It is the first time in recent history that revenue projections have fallen from one fiscal year to the other and it complicates Governor Whitman's plan to both balance the budget and to keep on schedule with a promised 30 percent income-tax cut during her first three years in office.
 
'Watch and Wait and See'
 The Governor had hoped that an economic turnaround would mean added revenue from sales and corporate taxes and reduce the need for budget cuts.
But Mr. Clymer said today, "We do want to be conservative and not be overly rosy or optimistic about where this is taking us, so we're going to watch and wait and see."
Mr. Clymer said that based on analyses of current and historical economic trends and factors, revenue for the 1995 budget year, which begins July 1, was expected to be $14.79 billion. He said a corporate tax cut passed in 1993 and the 5 percent cut in the income-tax rate that Governor Whitman signed into law on Monday had flattened what otherwise would have been a slight increase in revenue over 1994.
 
A Political Problem
 While Mr. Clymer said the administration was being conservative, some of the information he provided today was as troubling politically as it was fiscally for the Whitman administration, and Democrats moved swiftly to try to gain political capital from the news.
"During the campaign, Governor Whitman said her three-year, 3-percent tax cut would yield over 400,000 new jobs," said Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., the Democratic Minority Budget Officer. "In fact, these revenue projections suggest that the independent economists who criticized the Whitman tax-cut plan last fall were right when they predicted the tax cuts would produce, at best, 10 percent of the jobs that Whitman had promised."
Governor Whitman has said her budget will not cut aid to either municipalities or public schools, or force an increase in property taxes. She has said it will include some form of so-called "one-shot" revenue, a budget gimmick which she derided during the gubernatorial campaign last fall.
Gearing up for the anticipated partisan sparring over the budget, some legislative aides said today that they had been advised to start preparing campaigns pointing out that municipal and basic education aid was untouched.
Those same sources said the administration is considering cutting from education funding the so-called desegregation aid, a nebulous spending category that many school districts have tapped into to bolster their general fund.
 
Merger May Be Considered
 Governor Whitman is also said to be considering a merger of the State Department of Health with the Department of Human Services, a move that would likely lead to the elimination of hundreds of jobs.
The bulk of any tax cut that would be included in her spending plan would go to the middle class, those families earning between $30,000 and $80,000 a year, and would amount to as much as 10 percent, according to some legislative sources. Higher-income taxpayers might see another 5 percent tax cut.
But Governor Whitman, who is to deliver her first budget address on Tuesday, has kept details of her spending plan a closely guarded secret, relying on a tight-knit circle of Cabinet members and advisers that includes Mr. Clymer; the chief counsel, Peter G. Verniero; the acting director of the Office of Budget and Management, Brian Baxter; the chief of Policy and Planning, Jane M. Kenny; and several senior aides. So far, even the Legislative leadership has been kept in the cold on how the Governor intends to balance the budget as required by law, what cuts she might make and if or how big a tax cut she may offer.

 BODY:
The dollar finished narrowly mixed against other leading currencies yesterday, after recovering from an early dip against the German mark that followed a selloff Thursday.
Traders said technical factors and a rebound in the American bond market helped the dollar to rebound after it fell as low as 1.6735 marks. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6825 marks, up from 1.6820 marks on Thursday. 
 "Both the bond market and the U.S. dollar finally found support they could hang their hats on," said Randolph L. Donney, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group.
The firming of bond prices discouraged many investors from bailing out of Treasury securities and selling their dollar proceeds. Such sales had been hurting the value of the currency.
Still, the dollar slipped to 104.95 Japanese yen from 105.30 yen.
Traders said the dollar picked up some support as investors closed out "short" positions before the weekend. Investors with short positions sell a borrowed currency, expecting to repurchase the currency when its price drops and pocket the difference.
But traders said that with investors wondering about another rise in American interest rates and possible fallout from the Whitewater affair, there was no sign the dollar would gain much in value.
"A lot of people are just sitting tight at the moment," said Paul Alley, an associate at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in New York.
On Thursday, the dollar fell sharply as concerns about the Clinton Administration's political problems in the Whitewater affair spurred additional selling in a currency market already jittery about Federal Reserve policy.
Traders said the market yesterday shrugged off American retail sales figures for February. The unexpectedly strong 1.5 percent increase was offset by a downward revision in January's figures.
In other trading yesterday, gold prices fell after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $2.10, to $386.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $385.20 an ounce, down $1.30.
The British pound was quoted in New York at $1.5005, down from $1.5035 on Thursday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday rates, included: 1.4215 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155; 5.7243 French francs, down from 5.7315; 1,665 Italian lire, down from 1,666, and 1.3618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3573.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
Insurance on a Loan Can Be a Costly Item

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
AFTER falling out of favor with banks and borrowers in the 1980's, private mortgage insurance has more than tripled in the last three years, spurred by a surge of first-time home buyers.
Borrowers are often required to buy the insurance, which protects the lender in case of a default, if they make a mortgage down payment of less than 20 percent. But home buyers may not realize how much they are paying for the insurance. 
 "Generally, it is very expensive with interest rates approximating those of credit cards," said Paul S. Marshall, a professor at Widener University in Chester, Pa., and an authority in real estate finance.
Premiums depend on the size of the down payment and the length of the mortgage. Generally, the bigger the down payment, the smaller the premium. And premiums are usually lower for fixed-rate and 15-year mortgages than for adjustable-rate mortgages and 30-year loans.
The premium for a mortgage with 10 percent down might be 0.40 percent of the total loan in advance and 0.34 percent each subsequent year until the loan balance falls below 80 percent of the home's sale price.
Thus, someone who puts $10,000 down and borrows $90,000 for a $100,000 home will pay $360 in mortgage insurance initially, and $306 a year, or $25.50 a month, until the loan balance falls below $80,000.
Though the payments seem small, the accrued costs are not trivial, said Marc Eisenson of Elizaville, N.Y., who publishes The Banker's Secret Bulletin, a financial newsletter.
Even if a house's value appreciates 3 percent a year, someone who puts 10 percent down on a $100,000 home will pay $1,278 in mortgage insurance over three years before the mortgage balance falls below $80,000.
As Mr. Eisenson calculates, it is the equivalent of 12 percent interest on the $10,000 that the borrower lacked for a down payment. Here's how. The $1,278 is $426 a year for three years, or a 4.26 percent annual premium for the missing $10,000. Considering that the borrower is already paying an average 7.5 percent mortgage interest, the effective rate on that $10,000 is 12 percent until the equity in the home hits 20 percent. Moreover, mortgage insurance is not tax deductible, while mortgage interest is.
"If you are determined to buy and cannot come up with the full 20 percent, you have to realize that you are paying a very high price to the bank for essentially lending you part of the down payment," Mr. Eisenson said.
Mortgage insurance becomes more expensive, he added, if the home does not appreciate or if the lender requires payments until a home owner has accumulated 25 percent in equity.
Worse, lenders in most states are not required to notify borrowers that they can drop the insurance.
"In a lot of cases, the lenders have to be prompted by the borrowers to remove it," said Brian J. Moloney, a vice president at Consumer Loan Advocates, a nonprofit mortgage auditing firm in Lake Bluff, Ill. "Because removal isn't automatic, you have a lot of people who are carrying it and don't need it since they have enough equity built up."
If the house appreciates in value so that the insurance is no longer needed, the borrower will need to pay for an appraisal to cancel the policy.
 Aside from high costs, mortgage insurance adds a layer of bureaucracy to a lending process already clogged with middlemen and paperwork. Insurers, who are chosen by lenders, may reject a borrower's application after it has been approved by the lender. About 10 to 20 percent of these insurance applications are rejected, according to industry estimates.
"Unless you expect the value of the home to skyrocket, you would be better off waiting until you save up a down payment," Mr. Marshall said.

Stock Splits
 
Q. When a stock splits 2 for 1, does the share price automatically get cut in half?
LYNN AARON, Manhattan
 
A. Splits are usually announced by corporations after their stock has had a significant run-up in price, in the hope that a lower price will make it more attractive to investors. A 2-for-1 split halves the price of the stock, but doubles the number of shares you own. Frequently stocks rise on such an announcement, but most of the upward price movements from splits are not lasting. 
 "A reverse split would reduce the number of shares and increase the price per share," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. "If you held 500 shares of a $1-per-share stock, after the reverse split, you would have 100 shares of a $5 stock."
 
Annual Percentage Yield
 
Q. I've seen some banks advertise annual percentage yield? What does it mean?
MIKE BERMAN, Jamaica, Queens
 
A. Since last June, banks have been required by the Truth in Savings Act to standardize their deposit account terminology and use the annual percentage yield. This percentage reflects the total amount of interest paid on an account, based on the interest rate and frequency of compounding. Banks are also required to use this figure in advertising so that consumers can more readily compare returns.
"A.P.Y. is not the same as the interest rate," said Kate Barr, senior vice president of the Riverside Bank in Minneapolis. "Interest rate is the annual rate of interest paid on an account and does not reflect compounding."
 
Frozen 401(k) Funds
 
Q. At 70 1/2, how can I receive mandatory distribution from my 401(k) plan, since my funds are frozen because of an investment made by my former employer in a guaranteed investment contract with an insurance company that became insolvent?
HARRY THOMSON, Northport, L.I.
 
A. The Internal Revenue Code generally provides that retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, begin distributing annual benefits no later than April 1 following the year the employee becomes 70 1/2. The minimum distribution is based on the life expectancy of the employee or the combined life expectancy of an employee and a designated beneficiary, typically a spouse. If the distribution is less than the minimum, the participant is subject to a 50 percent excise tax on the difference.
Like yours, some plans that invested in guaranteed investment contracts, or G.I.C.'s, have been unable to make payments because the insurer is in delinquency proceedings.
"If the required payments cannot be made from the G.I.C., and if there are no other sources of funds in the participant's accounts in a plan to make the appropriate payment, the 50 percent excise tax would not apply," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner of Weber Lipshie, a New York accounting firm. "You should note that if and when payments are resumed, there are special makeup provisions."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Europe Looks Good, but Can Be Volatile

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Funds that invest in European equities are mostly quite young. Only 10 of the 28 funds have been around for five years or more, probably because few people wanted to invest in a Europe mired in recession.
But the economic outlook has changed in the last couple of years. The average Europe stock fund gained 25.6 percent last year, compared with a 9.9 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. 
 The strong performance last year came mainly from declining European interest rates, which still have room to fall. Because European markets tend to lag behind the United States market by about 18 months, the funds look more attractive to some than domestic stock funds, which have already had a good run, said Amy Arnott, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the fund research company in Chicago.
Because of their narrow focus, the Europe funds are volatile. For example, prices fell in early March when the German central bank made a smaller cut in interest rates than had been anticipated. And a strengthening dollar could hurt funds that are not sufficiently hedged, Ms. Arnott said.

HEADLINE: Iconoclastic and Busy Director: An Innovator or a Provocateur?

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
As a director, Anne Bogart resolutely probes behind the words, searching for fabric and context. If the play is a classic, she says, she wants to rediscover its "original energy" and learn "what we can see in it as people in the 90's." Each time out, she asks herself, "Who needs to see this, and also who needs to perform it?" In her process, she pans her eye 360 degrees around a play or a playwright.
Ms. Bogart pays a price for her iconoclasm. She has often been involved in controversy, splitting audiences as well as critics. Depending on the point of view, she is either an innovator or a provocateur assaulting a text. 
 In one of her boldest accomplishments, "No Plays No Poetry but Philosophical Reflections Practical Instructions Provocative Prescriptions Opinions and Pointers From a Noted Critic and Playwright," she staged the theories and criticisms of Bertolt Brecht, turning them into a playful, walk-through environment of ideas. The Bogart brand of direction has also given a visceral life to new plays like "In the Eye of the Hurricane," an Eduardo Machado exploration of a Cuban family's reaction to radical political change (presented several seasons ago at the Actors Theater of Louisville in Kentucky).
 
Trilogy Via Collaboration
 This season Ms. Bogart has been a whirlwind of activity, moving from play to play in New York and in regional theater. It is a prolific outpouring from a director who less than four years ago found herself out of work when her brief leadership of the Trinity Repertory in Providence, R.I., came to a sudden end.
The current centerpiece of her directing is a trilogy of plays based on American entertainment of the early part of this century. Drawing upon her interest in popular culture and such influences as Martha Graham and Giorgio Strehler, she has created "American Vaudeville," "Marathon Dancing" and "The Birth of a Nation" (about silent-movie acting). "Marathon Dancing," the first of the plays to be staged in New York, will open tomorrow at the Masonic Hall, 71 West 23d Street, Chelsea, under the aegis of En Garde Arts.
The trilogy, Ms. Bogart said, is an attempt to set the American oral and visual tradition against the European literary tradition. Each work comes out of a collaboration with theater artists; in the case of "Marathon Dancing," with Laura Harrington as writer and Christopher Drobny as music arranger.
For Gregory Boyd, the artistic director of the Alley Theater in Houston, which presented the premiere of "American Vaudeville," Ms. Bogart is at her best directing new plays or "inventing something new" like her trilogy, rather than when trying to reinvent a familiar play.
 
'A Very Angry Play'
 In her unconventional take on "The Women," by Clare Boothe Luce, this 1936 comedy leaped from pre-feminism to post-feminist commentary. "What I tried to do was not just treat it as a bitch fest," she said. She says she considers it "a very angry play" by an "exceedingly angry woman."
While Ms. Bogart is often acknowledged for her theatrical ideas, the execution can fall short of the concept. In his review in The New York Times on Jan. 13, David Richards said the production of "The Women" at Hartford Stage was "frequently surprising, occasionally illuminating and almost never funny." The director, he said, "has such an idiosyncratic vision of the script" that the author's contribution "seems altogether secondary."
This season in New York, Ms. Bogart also directed Regina Taylor's monodrama "Escape From Paradise" at the Circle Repertory Company and will soon take "The Medium" to the New York Theater Workshop.
She conceived and directed the play last summer at the Saratoga, N.Y., international theater institute she founded with Tadashi Suzuki. A collage of the theories of Marshall McLuhan "about how technology is changing our relationships," it is a kind of a companion piece to her "No Plays No Poetry."
That Brechtian collage was revived as the opening play in Ms. Bogart's single Trinity Repertory season. It was followed by a disembodied version of Gorky's "Summerfolk" (low on Gorky and even lacking in samovars) and a striking modernist variation on Brecht's "Baal" (directed by Robert Woodruff but bearing the Bogart stamp).
 
Equivalent of a Resignation
 The Providence experience proved to be part of her regretful past. Facing a severe financial crisis, the board asked for a 25 percent reduction in the budget. When Ms. Bogart refused to go along with the suggested cuts, the board accepted her decision as the equivalent of a resignation. John Howland, who was the chairman in 1990, insisted that it was economics, not art, that provoked the collision.
Richard Jenkins, a veteran company actor and director, was named to take Ms. Bogart's place. A search committee recently chose Oskar Eustis, associate artistic director at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, as Mr. Jenkins's successor.
Ms. Bogart's departure from Trinity was especially painful because she had grown up in Rhode Island and was inspired to make theater her career by Adrian Hall's Kabuki-style "Macbeth," which she saw at Trinity as a teen-ager.
From the beginning, Ms. Bogart and Trinity may have been a mismatch, or at least untimely. It was her misfortune to succeed Mr. Hall, the founder of the company and its sole director for 25 years. When Russell Baker assumed his role as host of "Masterpiece Theater," he said he would have preferred to be the man who replaced the man who replaced Alistair Cooke. Ms. Bogart might have found less hostility if she had been similarly distanced from Mr. Hall.
In any case, she says she is reluctant to return to her native state. If she went back, she jokes, she would "be lynched."
In retrospect, she says that she learned under fire and she contends that if she were a man she would have had a second season to use what she had learned. She points to the dismissal of JoAnne Akalaitis at the New York Shakespeare Festival and, recently, Josephine Abady at the Cleveland Playhouse as examples of what she considers to be prejudgment of female artistic directors. "You send the girls in to clean house, and then you get rid of them," she said. When it is mentioned that other women, including Mary Robinson, Tanya Berezin and Lynne Meadow, continue to run major theaters, she responds, "God bless them."
 
Eight Stanleys, No Brandos
 Ms. Bogart made her reputation 10 years ago with a revisionist production of "South Pacific" at New York University, setting the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical in a clinic for emotionally disturbed war veterans. In this context, "There Is Nothin' Like a Dame" became a shellshocked battlefront song about male bonding. Naturally, the Hammerstein estate raised an objection.
On another occasion, she directed a production of "A Streetcar Named Desire" with 8 Stanleys and 12 Blanches, one of whom was a man. Even for Ms. Bogart, that "Streetcar" was extreme, but it helped her confront a crucial question: "If you do 'Streetcar,' do you pretend that Marlon Brando never played Stanley?"
Compared with many of her directorial peers, Ms. Bogart regards herself as a collaborator rather than as an auteur. As Mr. Boyd says, during Ms. Bogart's stay at the Alley Theater, she "galvanized the company, unlocking the actors as clowns and dancers" in a play that was about performing. P. J. Benjamin, who plays the emcee in "Marathon Dancing," adds, "In 22 years, I've never had such a freeing experience; she makes you feel safe to make a fool of yourself," and to bring in ideas, in his case a marionette that he may or may not use in performance. Describing her method, he says, "It's like living on stage."
 
Homework Assignments
 Working with her "everything is made into an event," says Paul Zimet, who played a leading role in "No Plays No Poetry." For the Brecht piece, he said, she would give the actors the equivalent of homework assignments, encouraging them to research and develop their roles, "to create your act and bring it in; then she would be critical and appreciative in helping you to shape it." Lyn Austin, who produced some of Ms. Bogart's earlier work, credits her with fearlessness in tackling risky projects. Such forceful characterizations of her directorial personality are jarring when matched with Ms. Bogart's offstage demeanor, which is both composed and self-critical.
Ms. Bogart doesn't begin a piece with preconceived ideas and images. "It's usually in the crisis of a rehearsal that things become clear," she says, adding that her principal concern is with "the relationship between choreography and psychology." What is seen often seems at odds with what is said. For a model, she points to the scene in "Cabaret" in which "a beautiful blond boy stands up and sings 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me.' " While the audience may be seduced by the beauty of the singer and the song, it understands the horrific political implications of the moment.
Even as she diversifies, she plans to continue to scrutinize plays from America's recent theatrical past. These are, she says, "memory capsules of who we are." Repeatedly, she asks herself how she can capture the original energy of a play, and concludes, "The more cultural baggage a play carries, the more I have to go through the back door."

HEADLINE: Don't Sell Our Spy Technology

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's announcement Thursday that it will allow American companies to market spy satellite technology abroad points to a dangerous weak point in a generally sensible new export control policy.
In seeking to justify the sales, a Commerce Department official offered this glib and expansive explanation: "In order to have national security, you have to have vibrant and competitive industries that are allowed to do what they do best." Such as selling high technology that could end up targeting American troops or military installations? 
 This case is a sad exception to the otherwise sensible approach taken by the Administration in proposing a thorough revision of U.S. export control laws, the first since the cold war ended. If Congress approves the revision, Washington will have struck a balance between the desire of American manufacturers to relax U.S. restrictions and the need to keep militarily useful technology out of hostile hands. But selling high-resolution satellite imaging equipment, which previously could not be licensed for export, threatens to tip that fine balance.
Such sales will make it harder for the Administration to press other governments to adopt tough standards in order to curb the spread of arms -- a challenge made more difficult by the collapse of the common enemy.
The proposed new rules would require government approval to export items like supercomputers and composite materials; they exempt less advanced computers, machine tools, telecommunications equipment and satellite imaging services.
But the Administration went too far in liberalizing sales of satellite imaging technology itself, as well as of sophisticated machine tools and large-rocket technology, which are likely to be put to military use. And it missed a chance to require companies to disclose the sales now exempted from licensing, as well as the identity of ultimate buyers, enabling it to keep track of technology flows.
The U.S. cannot curb worldwide traffic in dangerous technologies on its own, so it needs to form what amounts to a cartel of like-minded states. Otherwise U.S. restraints will erode under pressure from American manufacturers who find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
An effective cartel is easiest to establish when there are only one or two supplier nations. A desk-top computer has many sellers; the Administration is right to ease restrictions on such products, where it is unlikely to get all other exporting nations to go along. In other cases like supercomputers and high-resolution satellite imaging, however, near-monopoly conditions prevail. Here the Administration needs to set tough export standards and persuade others to follow its lead.
Businesses have been quick -- too quick -- to criticize the restrictions that remain. They have gotten all they should get, and more.
The Administration has not just waived controls on many dual-use exports. It has also established new administrative procedures to expedite licensing decisions, which currently can take 120 days or more. Now, agencies that fail to provide timely objections will be deemed to concur with the Commerce Department, which generally favors exports. The agencies will have to agree on a decision within 90 days or refer the matter to the President. If they fail to meet the deadline, exporters will be allowed to proceed with the sale by default.
Those who complain that the export regulations unfairly discourage trade tend to exaggerate job losses. In 1992 just $24 billion in exports were subject to export controls. Licenses were denied for only a fraction of that, $790 million. In a $6 trillion economy, that does not add up to many jobs.
Still, this Administration, like others, may be tempted to waive restrictions for favored companies. And too often members of Congress engage in special pleading for constituents. There is a need for vigilance at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue if the U.S. is not to lapse into laissez-faire licensing.

HEADLINE: Recycling Has Shown Remarkable Success in Four Short Years

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We disagree with "Recycling Creates More Problems Than It Was Meant to Solve" (letter, March 2) by Mark D. Shantzis, chairman of Hi-Rise Recycling Systems. Recycling is one of several solid waste management solutions. And considering that mainstream recycling has been operating for only about four years, the results are remarkable. 
 Steel cans -- whether empty food, beverage, aerosol or paint cans -- are being recycled at increasing rates across the country. This is due in part to the broad markets for recycled steel cans, used to make a variety of new steel products, and to the country's growing number of efficient recycling programs.
To address several points that Mr. Shantzis makes:
* I don't see where cans, steel or aluminum, are piling up anywhere in the country. Steel cans must be made from recycled steel, like all other steel products. One reason recycling is part of the process is that the industry uses resources efficiently.
* As for the conjecture that consumers have not been encouraged to buy recycled materials, I can tell you as a member of the National Recycling Coalition's Buy Recycled Business Alliance, that efforts have been under way for some time to encourage consumers, businesses and public sector representatives to buy products made with recycled materials. In cases such as steel, the purchaser is always buying recycled.
* As for batch collection of recyclables, communities must design and implement recycling programs to meet their needs, whether mingled, or curb-separated, collection or drop-off collection. Curbside collection with separation at material recycling facilities is an efficient operation, as shown in cities across the country. Steel cans can be magnetically separated from other recyclables.
There is an economic value to diverting materials from municipal solid waste, as well as to using recycled materials as resources for new products. Communities implement programs as they can, and yes, Mr. Shantzis is correct, most are implemented with single-family residences first. But then multifamily dwellings, institutional and office programs may also be implemented.
Such inventions as Mr. Shantzis's computerized system for separating trash in high-rise buildings may help make recycling more efficient. But Mr. Shantzis's attitude could cripple programs that might spawn additional recycling breakthroughs.
It can't happen overnight. Whether it is enhanced collection systems, new material made from old or the steady drum beat of materials like steel being recycled over and over, we must cooperate to forge the way in recycling.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Bank Deposits Lack the Luster of Short-Term Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:
Although banks have raised mortgage rates sharply in recent weeks, the interest rates they pay consumers on deposits have barely moved. For conservative investors with a pot of cash, that means short-term Treasuries now have a substantial edge.
 The annual yield on three-month Treasury bills has soared almost three-tenths of a percentage point, to 3.48 percent, since the Federal Reserve nudged up rates on Feb. 4. Meanwhile, the average annual percentage yield on bank certificates of deposit has inched up six-hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.61 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, North Palm Beach, Fla. A year ago, the returns on these two short-term investments were much closer: 2.95 percent for the T-bill and 2.76 percent for the C.D. 
The gap is unusually wide," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chemical Bank. "Banks are not scrambling for consumer deposits right now because loan demand is relatively weak."
 The banks' delayed response is just part of the story. The Treasury market has factored in more than the Fed's quarter-point rise last month in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. "There are normally long lags before the rates banks pay on C.D.'s catch up with short-term interest rates," Allen Sinai, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, said. "But now the markets are anticipating more tightening and at least one more increase by the Federal Reserve."
 For the person who wants to invest $10,000, the smallest denomination of a T-bill, Treasuries are certainly the more attractive choice. Treasury securities of other sizes and types are also available at favorable spreads to bank deposits. The yield on a six-month T-bill is 3.76 percent, compared with 2.85 percent for a six-month C.D.; the yield on a one-year T-bill is 4.26 percent, compared with 3.16 percent for a one-year C.D.
 Treasury securities can be purchased at no charge in person or by mail at one of the 37 Federal Reserve banks or branches. Purchases through brokerage firms and banks typically incur a fee of about $50.
 Depending on the Fed's actions, it could take months for the gap to narrow. "Don't hold your breath until C.D. rates take off like a rocket again," warned Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: What if you had a stock exchange and nobody came?

BYLINE: By JILL BARSHAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, March 8

 BODY:
For the last two and a half years, Ukraine's market has been dressing up in high-grade new technology. A million dollars' worth of gleaming I.B.M. computers line the rows of the exchange's trading hall, where, in theory, shares can be electronically traded within seconds by modem from any remote village.
An investment of more than $5 million, most of it from France, has transformed a building that once housed a school for Communist Party officials into what might be a cutting-edge bourse, where the technology would be familiar in New York, London or Tokyo. 
 There is a problem, though: so far, there is virtually no financial market. Only two stocks, a shipping company and a bank, are traded on the computerized system for less than an hour each week. Ten or so other stocks trade by hand elsewhere in the building.
 
Narrow Choices Are Widening
 Meager volume is hardly unknown in the fledgling stock markets of Eastern Europe. The stock exchange in Hungary reopened in 1990, 42 years after the Communists closed it, with one listed company, a travel agency. By the end of 1993, there were at least 25 listed shares in Hungary, though a year before that, Budapest was still difficult terrain for stock markets.
A lively exchange in Poland trades in fewer than two dozen stocks. Russia's 57 exchanges now offer more than 1,000 stocks.
Ukraine seems to have deeper problems, which are reflected in its stock market. While Russia's state companies are privatizing at the rate of 900 a month, creating new securities, Ukraine has yet to begin selling its state companies in earnest. The two companies listed on its electronic exchange were privatized by special presidential decree.
Beyond that, start-up private companies in Ukraine are reluctant to go public for fear of having to open their books, because succeeding in business sometimes means dodging or defying layers of rules and regulations left over from the time of the Communist Government.
When President Leonid M. Kravchuk came to see the computerized stock exchange last month, he described it as "a barometer of the national economy," producing an unwitting double-take. In fact, Ukraine is better known these days for its rampant inflation, perilously low currency reserves and unproductive, debt-ridden state factories.
"If we're a barometer of the economy, the Government has a problem," said Valentin V. Oskolsky, the Ukrainian stock exchange's chairman. "We're waiting only for privatization and nothing more."
New attempts to push privatization could yet invigorate the Ukrainian market. Parliament's latest program calls for selling 8,000 state enterprises -- 28 percent of the total -- by the end of this year. President Kravchuk renewed his promises of economic change when he was in Washington last week.
As part of a $30 million proposal by foreign aid donors to make privatization a reality, the United States Agency for International Development will lead an effort to print the privatization certificates for 52 million Ukrainians and establish bidding centers in each of the country's 24 regions, where people can deal in the certificates. But the Government will be under pressure to streamline the bureaucratic process to get a state enterprise ready for sale of shares.
The Ukrainian exchange was set up with a French Government donation of $4.3 million in software and technical assistance in 1991.
 
Disillusioned Frenchman
 "At the time, everybody thought that Ukraine would have a fast development to the market and be the most important country" in the former Soviet region, said Philippe Pegorier, France's commercial counselor here.
"We were very excited and we were betting on the future. But now we are disillusioned. No one thought things would go so badly here -- hyperinflation, no privatization. How is it possible for a stock exchange to work when there is no economic reform?"
Without privatization or other large-scale movement toward a market economy, the Ukrainian stock exchange waits for a trickle of state concerns, like the Ukrrichflot Shipping Company of Odessa, to be sold, one by one, by executive decree.
"It's just a game right now; the sums are so low it's funny," said Dmitri A. Sapunov, one of 40 traders using the electronic hall. "But it's good to practice techniques, to learn how the mechanism works."
 
Dressing for Success
 Mr. Sapunov -- who dresses like someone's idea of slick American stockbroker, in a green suit and flashy silk tie -- represents Comex Inc. Comex started as a small import-export company four years ago and has grown into a conglomerate of 19 concerns, including a brokerage house.
Like some other brokers, Mr. Sapunov is not happy with the electronic system. "There's not a permanent supply and demand," he said. "Often there's only buyers, so you can't count on being able to sell next time at any price."
The 52 brokerage firms trading on the older, noncomputerized stock exchange have resisted switching because some brokers are uncomfortable using computers and prefer bargaining face to face. Beyond the one hour a week when that hall trades its 10 stocks, it is given over to a random antiques or art auction.
The cost of a seat on the Ukrainian exchange, with so little stock trading, has plummeted. Two years ago, Mr. Sapunov said, his company bought a seat for the equivalent of $4,000.
"We thought it made sense for the future," he said. Today, the same seat goes for $1,900.

HEADLINE: Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield

BYLINE: By Tim Weiner; Tim Weiner, a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The Times, has reported on Afghanistan since 1987.

 BODY:
UNDER A RELENTLESS SUN, NOOR AMIN traverses the lunar terrain of Afghanistan. A commander of the Islamic Party, Afghanistan's best-armed and most radical political faction, he has just finished a two-month stint running a military training camp outside the ruined village of Jaji.
Battling the wheel of his four-wheel-drive truck, he drives past miles of poppy fields where boys scrape brown opium into burlap sacks. To the east, inside mud forts in the mountains, laboratories turn the opium into heroin. He crosses the rutted highway running from the Khyber Pass to Kabul, the capital, past checkpoints manned by soldiers of the Islamic Party, their posts adorned with the grim image of their leader, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. 
 Heading north, he enters a ruined Eden, a natural paradise strewn with man-made disaster. Jade and silver rivers tumble through green valleys where every house, school and mosque is destroyed. Burned-out tanks litter the land like the carcasses of prehistoric beasts. The villages look like archeological sites. Hardly a stone stands upon a stone, save in the graveyards where thousands of slate shards are stabbed into the rocky earth. This is the last great battleground of the cold war, in which the Afghans, backed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, fought off the Soviet Union in the 1980's.
In the five years since the Soviets withdrew, tens of thousands of Islamic radicals, outcasts, visionaries and gunmen from some 40 nations have come to Afghanistan to learn the lessons of the jihad, the holy war, to train for armed insurrection, to bring the struggle back home.
For nearly a generation, blood and bones were sown into the Afghan dust by the weapons of the superpowers, and now the land bears a harvest of holy war and heroin. The sole field of victory for C.I.A.-backed "freedom fighters" in the 1980's has become an international center for the training and indoctrination of terrorists. The veterans of the jihad have taken their war abroad to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Sudan, Tadzhikistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Yemen -- and the United States.
"Yes, the whole country is a university for jihad, exactly as they say," Noor Amin declares proudly. He has come home to Asadabad, the ruined capital of Kunar Province, in northeastern Afghanistan. Inside a fortified warren of mud huts, he gently leans his automatic rifle against the wall of his one-room house.
"There are many formal training centers and the Islamic Party has many such schools," like the one near Jaji, he says. "We have had Egyptians, Sudanese, Arabs and other foreigners trained here as assassins."
As in any outlaw culture, guns, drugs and money are interchangeable here. Nonetheless, the unfailing wellspring of cash is the cultivation, sale and processing of opium from fields and labs controlled by rebel commanders. Government estimates vary, but Afghanistan now produces roughly a third of the heroin reaching the United States. Hundreds of tons of opium base are refined into heroin and shipped via Pakistan, Turkey and, increasingly, busy new routes in the Central Asian republics and the Balkans.
The heroin boom is not only predictable but necessary, say Afghan leaders and American officials. It is Afghanistan's only real cash crop, and no outside authority has the influence or muscle to prevent trafficking in what is essentially a lawless country. There is no civil law, no government, no economy -- only guns and drugs and anger.
And that rage is kindled every night in the campfires of the holy warriors. "The jihad, in the opinion of the the United States, was finished when the Communists were defeated," says Noor Amin, draining his tea and dashing the dregs in the dust. "But jihad has no end. It goes on forever."
MOST AFGHANS WANT nothing more than to end the fighting and try to rebuild their prewar lives. But they know that's not going to happen. "For us, Afghanistan is destroyed," says Abdul Haq, a politically moderate mujahedeen commander responsible for the Kabul region during the war. "It is turning to poison, and not only for us but for all others in the world. If you are a terrorist, you can have shelter here, no matter who you are. Day by day, there is the increase of drugs. Maybe one day they will have to send hundreds of thousands of troops to deal with that. And if they step in, they will be stuck. We have a British grave in Afghanistan. We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave."
In a sense, there are already at least eight American graves.
Afghanistan is where the man accused of assassinating two C.I.A. employees in the agency's driveway disappeared last year after fleeing the United States; where the men convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center, which killed six people, learned strategy and tactics; where the jihad called them and their spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric charged with conspiring to overthrow the United States. Several of those convicted, as well as defendants in another indictment charging a conspiracy to devastate New York with bombs and political assassinations, raised money for or studied jihad with Hekmatyar's forces.
The C.I.A. has a word for this: blowback, a poisonous fallout, borne by political winds, drifting back home from a faraway battlefield.
"It's quite a shock," says Charles G. Cogan, the C.I.A.'s operations chief for the Near East and South Asia from 1979 to 1984. "The hypothesis that the mujahedeen would come to the United States and commit terrorist actions did not enter into our universe of thinking at the time. We were totally preoccupied with the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. It is a significant unintended consequence."
The point isn't lost on Abdul Haq. "After the collapse of the Soviets, the biggest enemy of the U.S., what they hate the most is drugs and terrorism, yes?" he says. "Afghanistan is now the leader of the world in drugs and terrorism."
ABDULLAH JAN, THE GOVERNOR OF LAGHMAN Province, knocks back his sixth cup of after-dinner tea, pops a Russian candy in his mouth and mulls over the recent history of Afghan-American relations.
"So the C.I.A. says we are the University of Jihad?" He arches an eyebrow and smirks. "Why is the United States afraid? After all, it supported the faculty of this university." So it did, and it did so in one of the least morally ambiguous battles of the cold war.
The villagers of Afghanistan first encountered the wonders of modern technology in the form of Soviet jets, tanks and helicopters. Moscow's military juggernaut killed or maimed perhaps three million Afghans and sent six million fleeing west into Iran or east into Pakistan.
The Afghans took on the infidels. They died in uncounted numbers. They lived on stale bread and tea. They slept on stones in the mountains. And they drove the Soviets out. They fought their holy war with roughly $6 billion in weapons and materiel from the C.I.A., Saudi Arabia and an odd alliance of Iranian weapons procurers, Arab princes, Egyptian politicians and Chinese generals. Together, the Afghans achieved a famous victory. Some say it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.
"But the people of Afghanistan, we have gone from one jail into another jail," says Abdul Hakim Katawazi, commander of the state police under the last king of Afghanistan in the early 1970's.
The prison guards are a God-mad rabble, the foot soldiers of a new Islamic order who received their advanced training in jihad in the military camps that now dot the countryside. Roughly 20 such centers exist in eastern Afghanistan between Kabul and the Khyber Pass, mostly under the control of Hekmatyar and his commanders. The camps have grown up around abandoned villages and battered Soviet military garrisons. Sacks of flour, some purloined from donations by the United States Agency for International Development, are stacked like sandbags in simple huts. Weapons, a good many of them taken from C.I.A.-supplied caches hoarded during the jihad, are plentiful.
In these training centers, the foreigners learn about guerrilla warfare, antiaircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Much in demand, but too precious to fire in training, is the Stinger antiaircraft missile, supplied by the hundreds to the Afghans by the C.I.A. in the 1980's. An unknown number are missing and unaccounted for; the C.I.A. is spending $65 million trying to buy them back.
The men fly to the bustling frontier town of Peshawar, Pakistan, to the east, riding buses or trucks over the Khyber Pass to Jalalabad, in Afghanistan. The provincial capital serves as a way station for the new arrivals heading for the camps. Here are Palestinians exiled from their native land; cashiered Egyptian army officers; Moroccans, Algerians and Sudanese intent on bringing down their Governments, and from time to time, Americans from New York, Detroit, Chicago and other cities.
The Afghans who lead the training, like Noor Amin, are in high demand wherever radical Islam is at war, for their victory was the first triumph of Islamic warriors over an infidel army since the 16th century. "Their jihad credentials, religious and political, are impeccable," says an American intelligence official. "They beat one of the world's two superpowers and now they're working on the second."
THE DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF JIHAD, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, represents almost everything Americans hate, fear and misapprehend about radical Islam. The feeling appears to be mutual.
Talking with Hekmatyar is like listening to wind chimes tinkling on the porch of a burning building. A disarmingly feline man, he purses his lips and talks dispassionately of the death of millions. His aim is to build "a true Islamic republic," under his dominion, and he has the will and the weapons to fulfill that dream. If it takes another generation of war, so be it.
"We have already had one and a half million martyrs," Hekmatyar said in a 1992 interview. "We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic republic. We are ready to remain in the mountains for another 14 years."
Unique among the world's Prime Ministers, Hekmatyar has spent the past 22 months firing artillery shells and rockets into the capital of his own country. This act of political sadomasochism began the week the rebels took Kabul from the Soviet-backed regime. The barrage is aimed at the citizens of Kabul, whom Hekmatyar considers to have collaborated with the Soviet occupation, and at the armed forces loyal to Afghanistan's President, Burhanuddin Rabbani. It has killed more than 10,000 Afghans, driven hundreds of thousands into squalid refugee camps, created political chaos and blocked millions of exiles from returning.
Among the refugees is Mohin Ajan, a carpenter by trade, sent fleeing with his wife and seven children by Hekmatyar's missiles. "He rules us by the power of weapons," says Ajan, who lives in a tent amid several thousand other internal exiles on a dusty promontory outside Jalalabad. "He is the king of weapons, not the king of Afghanistan."
Hekmatyar's weapons, the source of his ministry, come mainly from the enormous arsenal sent by the C.I.A.. The United States and its allies gave him more than $1 billion in armaments: tens of thousands of assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, millions of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of the deadly accurate Stinger missiles. Hekmatyar put away enough weapons to make war for four more years.
No one doubts he will. Hekmatyar's jihad never ended. When he speaks of a true Islamic republic, he means a land without borders.
BY THE TIME THE SOVIETS LEFT AFGHANISTAN in February 1989, thousands of Afghan-trained volunteers were ready to carry on the war abroad. Thousands more took their place in the camps.
The militants took the torch of the Afghan rebels' holy rage and turned their energies to a greater battle. They saw the 1991 Persian Gulf war as a modern manifestation of the medieval Crusades, the Arab nations supporting the war as corrupt collaborators with Christendom and the United States and the United Nations as imperial knights with smart bombs. Their anger was focused on Arab leaders they saw as American agents, and on America itself.
By 1992, as Kabul fell into chaos at the hands of the holy warriors, posters of Saddam adorned Afghanistan's shops and bazaars, mounted next to heroic pictures of Hekmatyar. As freedom fighter fought freedom fighter over the nation's broken remains, the fire that fueled the jihad began to spread beyond the borders drawn by the 19th-century imperial powers, Russia and the British Raj.
To the north lay Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan. Tadzhiks and Uzbeks by the millions live in Afghanistan; tens of millions of their Muslim brothers live in the former Soviet republics. Some 20,000 people have died and a half-million have been forced from their homes as Islamic rebels battle the pro-Communist regime still in control of Tadzhikistan. Russia still has thousands of soldiers stationed there, fighting guerrillas on both sides of the Afghan border. The President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, says he expects the rebels to attack his country and Tadzhikistan this spring.
To the east, hundreds of Afghans allied with Hekmatyar have fought in the embattled state of Jammu and Kashmir, a territory disputed since the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. Thousands have died in the struggle. In China, where Islam has been periodically suppressed, Afghan veterans have fought in two western provinces, Uighur and Xinjiang, where they have armed and trained Chinese Muslim rebels.
To the west, Hekmatyar has sent 500 mujahedeen to fight in Azerbaijan with Iranian forces, according to Haji Abdul Qadr, the Governor of Afghanistan's Nangahar Province. Hundreds of Afghans have fought against Serbs and Croats in Bosnia.
Nowhere have veterans of the Afghan war made a greater impact on society than in Egypt and Algeria. Since 1992, when a junta nullified elections that would have brought Islamic leaders to power in Algeria, more than 2,000 people have died in a continuing campaign of terror and reprisal. The Islamic rebels in Algeria have led a two-year struggle spearheaded by guerrillas who are known collectively as Afghans, regardless of their nationality.
In Egypt, an unending series of assassinations, attacks on Government officials and local insurrections can be traced to the work of al-Gamaa al-Islamia, the Islamic Group. This organization, blamed for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, established headquarters in exile in Jalalabad and in Peshawar in the mid-1980's. One of the most prominent figures at those new bases was Mohammed Shawki Islambouli, the brother of one of Sadat's assassins. In 1988 and 1990, he played host to Sheik Abdel Rahman, a spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, who struck up a personal and ideological friendship with Hekmatyar.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed his relationship with the sheik in July. As one set of United States authorities weighed deporting the sheik and another prepared an indictment against him, Hekmatyar offered him political asylum in Afghanistan, calling the cleric "a leader of the Islamic nation."
Among the sheik's followers is Mohammed Salameh, a Palestinian who in addition to being convicted in the World Trade Center case, raised money for the mujahedeen in Brooklyn. His roommate in a Jersey City apartment was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Iraqi who fought in Afghanistan and arrived at Kennedy International Airport on a flight from Pakistan in September 1992. On that flight was Ahmad Ajaj, a Palestinian fresh from Afghanistan, whose suitcase bore bomb-making manuals. Ajaj was convicted in the trade center bombing, as was Mahmud Abouhalima, who also raised money for the rebels; friends say he went to Afghanistan to fight. Arrested in Egypt, he allegedly told Egyptian officials -- who may have tortured him -- that the World Trade Center bombing was planned in Afghanistan by veterans of the jihad, with the approval of Iranian intelligence officers and Rahman.
THE FURY OF HEKMATYAR AND HIS DISCIPLES may yet accomplish what Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, the armies of the Raj and the tanks and helicopter gunships of the Soviet Union could not. It may destroy Afghanistan.
After 60 centuries, the villages persist amid a lacework of rivers in a wilderness of stones, terraced fields of grain, orchards of apricots and oranges and mulberries. The people there are as strong and as beautiful as any on earth. A great many of those who have survived the war -- commanders, elders, headmen -- are trying, against great odds, to save the surviving villages. They are not terrorists or drug kingpins. They despise Hekmatyar and his eternal jihad.
In the shade of an arbor by the banks of the roaring Kunar River, Haji Rahmat Khan holds court. An ancient man with a long gray beard and glittering eyes, he tells a sad story often told in his province.
"It's a Kunar story, but it's the story of Afghanistan," he says, his hands plucking at his bandolier.
It is the story of Jamillur Rehman, once Hekmatyar's commander in Kunar Province and the most famous of the mujahedeen in these parts. In 1984, he was enticed to leave his command and join forces with well-financed fundamentalists called the Salafis, bankrolled by ultrareligious Saudis.
"He became a rich man," Haji Rahmat Khan says. "He took money from Saudi Arabia. All the Arabians gave him cars, money, everything." The money drew thousands of Arabs to the jihad, and today those men are fighting in Cairo and Khartoum and Algiers. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Salafis battled Hekmatyar's troops. The fighting destroyed most of what remained of Kunar Province. Jamillur Rehman was assassinated two years ago by Hekmatyar's forces.
"Those who killed him were not Russians or Americans," the old man says, his voice rising. "Afghans killed him. Those who killed him wanted the country for themselves. Now Hekmatyar and the rest of our stupid leaders are killing all our brothers, making them die like donkeys, not like heroes. We can't get rid of them -- we'd be killed or jailed.
"We didn't choose these leaders. The United States made Hekmatyar by giving him his weapons. Now we want the United States to shake these leaders and make them stop the killing, to save us from them.

Travel Industry Prepares For a Rush to Vietnam

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WITH the end of United States trade sanctions against Vietnam, the number of Americans traveling there is likely to increase markedly, whether they are motivated by business opportunity, family ties, historical interest or the imponderable attraction of old soldiers to battlefields they cannot forget.
Although it will take months for all the arrangements to fall into place, the travel industry is already planning for the rush. United Airlines and Northwest Airlines have applied for permission to fly from American cities to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. United would fly from Los Angeles, Northwest from Detroit via Tokyo. Continental and Delta are also considering providing service. 
 But the American companies cannot sell tickets until the United States and Vietnam work out aviation agreements, which, an official in the United States Transportation Department said, were unlikely to be completed by this summer. Until then, travelers from the United States must fly to some other Asian country, like Bangkok, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Tokyo, and take a foreign airline to Vietnam. Tour operators say they expect a steady increase in business, even though the embargo did not bar Americans from traveling there.
"Adventurous backpackers of the Vietnam and post-Vietnam generations have been going there in droves for the past two years," said Edward Hasbrouk of the Aereo Travel Group in San Francisco, who estimates that most of the tickets his agency sold to Southeast Asia last year were to people planning to spend at least some time in Vietnam.
Even they have had misconceptions about the embargo, he said, often assuming that they had to arrange their flights and visas from Bangkok, not realizing that United States agents could obtain visasfrom Mexico or Canada. (Visas are not yet available in the United States.)
Inner Asia Expeditions of San Francisco, which has been sponsoring tours in Vietnam for a few years, is offering a new trip that takes voyagers down Route 9, a link on the famous Ho Chi Minh trail, across the old demilitarized zone between the north and south, and across the newly opened border into Laos. Typical tours of 8 to 12 days cost from $1,600 to $3,000, not counting air fare.
Gannon Travel of Reston, Va., is another agency developing a specialty in Vietnam, where its parent organization, the Gannon Companies, has permanent offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City staffed by Vietnamese and Americans.
Gannon, which also is involved in the construction business in Vietnam, says that a portion of its profits from Vietnam are to be donated to Operation Smile Vietnam, an enterprise that has sponsored medical assistance to Vietnamese children since 1989.
Beginning in April, Gannon will offer day and overnight tours from Hanoi, including bicycle tours, visits to villages, and festival events. The company is also planning to offer a 14-day nationwide tour priced at about $4,000, plus air fare. While travelers can go solo to Vietnam, that approach remains difficult and complicated, especially for those who want to venture far from the former Saigon, a city that still boasts plenty of Western-style hotels and where it is easy to find a car and an English-speaking driver.
There are few first-class hotels outside Saigon, but Heather Smith, who has been to Vietnam twice investigating the trade in endangered species for the Earth Island Institute, a San Francisco environmental group, said she was pleased with the inexpensive hotels she stayed in.
"You can get a great hotel for 10 bucks a night," she said. "In the north they have a hot shower, but in Saigon they don't."
Credit cards issued by American banks cannot yet be used, until the regulatory agencies work out the arrangements. And there may be a charge of up to 5 percent on traveler's checks, which will be cashed in Vietnamese currency that cannot be converted back to dollars. So travelers may want to take as much cash in dollars as possible, bearing in mind the risk of loss or theft. The dollars will be readily accepted.

HEALTH CARE
THE ROAD TO REFORM
The Future of Health Care in America.
By Eli Ginzberg with Miriam Ostow.
Free Press, $22.95. 
 Eli Ginzberg, the director of Columbia University's Eisenhower Center for the Conservation of Human Resources, has been writing about the defects and strengths of the American health care system for a long time. "The Road to Reform," written with Miriam Ostow, who is in charge of health policy studies at the Eisenhower Center, is strongest when describing how a sector that involved just 4.5 percent of the gross domestic product in 1950 could absorb more than 14 percent of national spending by 1993. The book's discussions of the Federal Government's postwar role in shaping medical training, and how the Medicare and Medicaid programs transformed hospital financing, bring useful perspective to the often ahistorical debates of the moment. Unfortunately, though, Mr. Ginzberg's insights are often buried in tedious and clumsy prose. He sees President Clinton's proposals as a reasonable starting point toward inevitable change. Closing with a general and unsurprising review of the long-term challenges that will bedevil any national plan, the book sheds little light on the specific hard choices Congress faces this year.

HEADLINE: Prices at Ebb Tide for Waterfront Property

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
BUFFETED by storms that made insurance tricky to find or difficult to afford and by reassessments that sent property taxes soaring, waterfront properties in many parts of the metropolitan New York region are now being traded at some of the lowest prices in recent history.
"This last recession is the only time I know of when blue-chip real estate did not keep its value," said lyn Hanberg, co-owner of Dunham Ltd. Realtors in Old Lyme, Conn. She said many prime waterfront properties in her part of the Connecticut shoreline had tripled in value during the boom of the mid- to late 1980's and "when they fell, they had that much farther to fall." 
 In Rye, N.Y., Richard De Mato, who has his contemporary waterfront house under contract to sell for $1.6 million, $1.9 million less than he had originally priced it in March 1989, was philosophical. "Dino Ferraris [Ferrari auto models made in the early 70's] used to cost $175,000 -- now they're under $100,000," he said. "Do I ever think waterfront properties will come back up? Sure. When? I don't have any idea."
Agents and others in the real estate industry stress that each town in each county in each state is different, and prices in some beach and waterfront areas -- notably the Hamptons on Long Island -- have been hit less, or have recovered faster, than others.
But there appears to be general agreement among real estate professionals that, in the words of Tina Fredericks, who owns a real estate agency that bears her name in East Hampton, waterfront prices "have hit bottom and are ready to go up."
"I never thought I'd see prices this low," said Charles J. Traina, a sales agent with Zachariae Realty in Manahawkin, on the Jersey Shore, pointing to a ranch house with a dock on a lagoon that once sold for close to $175,000. "When those houses went under $100,000 we couldn't believe it," he said. "And now they're listing them for $80,000, $85,000."
In the shorefront towns of Westbrook and Clinton, Conn., beach bungalows -- fairly large 1920's and 30's clapboard houses on small lots directly on Long Island Sound -- regularly sold for close to half a million dollars at the height of the market. Now many are listed between $350,000 and $399,000 and sell at somewhere between.
In the highest-end markets, waterfront mansions are also selling for substantially less than they were four years ago and even in the Hamptons there are still foreclosure sales. But agents maintain that -- at last -- these properties are now beginning to be shown actively.
"Last week I pulled into the parking lot and actually saw six cars with New York license plates," said Laura Page, of Page-Taft Real Estate in Madison, Conn. "Those people disappeared after the stock market crash and it was like seeing the swallows heading back to Capistrano. I don't know if anybody bought anything that day but it was a ray of hope."
New Jersey realtors are "starting to see a normalcy in the market," according to Robert F. Ferguson Jr., executive vice president of the New Jersey Board of Realtors. "We're not talking about the go-go days of the 80's, but waterfront prices will start to go up," he said. Environmental restrictions, he said, will make new waterfront construction more difficult and thus make existing houses more valuable.
MARIAN FRAKER-GUTIN, president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, said that "prices for waterfront properties are down, interest rates are down and sellers are ready to let them go." Ms. Fraker-Gutin, a broker with Mary Elmore Realty in Merrick, gave the example of a house on South Oyster Bay in Massapequa that was put on the market a year ago at $535,000. "We're just starting to get a little action now," she said, "but we've certainly had a bad time."
About four years ago, she said, the house would have sold quickly for close to $600,000.
Ms. Fraker-Gutin said the problem with selling waterfront homes on Long Island was no longer the recession, but in finding insurance.
"We were recovering nicely when that terrible storm hit, and the insurance problem just threw another fly in the ointment," she said, referring to the Dec. 11, 1992, nor'easter that flooded basements along the New Jersey and Connecticut shorelines, eroded beaches and even wiped out some houses.
"Then there was the threat of another big storm last September," she continued. "That storm never came -- thank God -- but that was one of the reasons why they [insurance companies] started to pull out."
Her comments were echoed by at least a dozen other agents specializing in waterfront property in the tri-state area. Doreen Niggles, of Allan M. Schneider Associates in East Hampton, L.I., said there were "major insurance problems in the Hamptons."
Eric G. Ramsay Jr., who has sold real estate in Bay Shore, L.I., for 35 years, called the insurance situation "really scary." When Bret Saberhagen, the Mets pitcher, bought his $1.275 million waterfront house, Mr. Ramsay said the baseball star tried 40 different insurance companies before one would write a policy, "so you can imagine the trouble any ordinary guy would have."
Few contracts on waterfront houses in his area are complete now without a contingency clause that lets the buyer get out of the contract if he can't find insurance. Asked if lawyers routinely add this clause, Mr. Ramsay repled: "They do if they have a brain."
MARNA VAN DER PLOEG of William Pitt Real Estate in Greenwich, Conn., said the Dec. 11 storm "had a big effect on waterfront property values" because "it made people seriously reconsider buying a waterfront home.
"The first question out of everybody's mouth is: 'Is this house insurable?' I usually answer 'Yes, up to a point -- or well, that depends . . .' Prices have fallen with waterfront properties, but the biggest thing that prevents people buying them and why they're on the market so long is perceived problems with flooding."
A contemporary house on an inlet was appraised by two independent appraisers at $795,000 and $775,000, Ms. van der Ploeg said. It just sold for $635,000. Another Greenwich waterfront house was valued at $859,000 and sold for $697,000, she added, "and this was all after the nor'easter."
Independent insurance agents confirm the problems with finding insurance for waterfront homes.
Tom Archambault, vice president of Archambault Insurance in Chester, Conn., said that after the storm companies tightened their rules on waterfronts and some stopped writing policies on certain types of waterfront properties altogether.
"The Aetna, for instance, rejects all new business for any dwelling within 1,000 feet of the seacoast, bay or sound, or located on a barrier island," he said, reading from the company's new guidelines. "Anything between 1,001 and 2,500 feet that has had catastrophic loss or windstorm damage in the last three years is not eligible."
If a person already owns waterfront property, Aetna will renew his or her policy, he said, but the deductible will be raised to 2 percent of the value if the house is within 1,000 feet of the shore. That makes the deductible on a $200,000 house $4,000, he said.
Other companies will cancel or not renew an existing policy. The policy for one house 1,300 feet from the Long island Sound in South Lyme was canceled by Metropolitan Life because of "increased exposure presented by the dwelling's proximity to tidal water," Mr. Archambault said.
F. Jeffrey Cashman, president of William Pitt Insurance Services in Stamford, said that insurance could be found for waterfront homes but that it was not easy. "Federal flood insurance is available up to $185,000, and Lloyd's of London will pick up any excess," he said, "but obviously that's expensive and is written on a case-by-case basis."
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have real estate boards and legislators who are addressing the problems and many realtors say relief is in sight.
In New York, the State Insurance Department is creating an Coastal Market Assistance Program, a pool of "10 or 12 insurance companies that will evaluate [waterfront] risks on a rotation basis, so that if there is a big storm no one company will bear the brunt," said John Calagna, an agency spokesman.
In Connecticut, the state's Independent Insurance Agents association is working with the state to establish a similar pool.
Last Dec. 29 the New Jersey Insurance Commissioner instituted a 90-day moratorium on waterfront policy cancellations -- a moratorium the state Legislature is currently considering extending until June 30.
While finding waterfront property insurance has been a problem throughout the region, property-tax reappraisals are a more significant factor in some communities.
Usually the towns that are having the problems are those where a sweeping reappraisal was completed sometime in the late 80's. By the time the property tax bills went out -- usually a year or so after the re-evaluation -- the properties were no longer worth the same.
"Waterfront properties had soared in value," said Pat Jones, who owns the real estate company bearing her name in Madison, Conn., "so they got hit the hardest; the taxes are prohibitive, they're a burden to carry."
A classic shingled beach cottage with columned porch, beaded vertical matchboard paneling and a two-car garage across the street, at 150 Middle Beach Road in Madison, was assessed at a full market value of $833,260, but Ms. Jones said the asking price was now $725,000, down from an initial price of $940,000.
NEARBY, at 16 Middle Beach Road, Sandy Busby of the Maurer Real Estate Company is marketing a 10-room year-round beach house built in 1938 that was extensively remodeled in 1986. The current owners, who paid $1 million for the house in mid-1987, rebuilt the sea wall and put in another bathroom, which they say cost $70,000. They have priced the house at $875,000, which is below the appraised fair market value of $981,000. Taxes on the house have soared, from $3,906.12 in 1986 to $14,566.94 now.
In Old Saybrook, Conn., more than 100 angry property owners who lost appeals before the Board of Tax Review have sued the town over what they claim are unfair 1989 revaluations. Almost half are from the Borough of Fenwick, a posh enclave on Long Island Sound.
Taxes on Beaumaris, an elegant, huge shingle-style Fenwick beach house that had been in the same family since the borough was established at the turn of the century, leapt with the revaluation from $5,649 to $15,543. The house, originally priced at $2.75 million, sold last summer for $1,450,000 after almost three years on the market.
"Families who were paying $4,000 suddenly were presented with a bill for $15,000," said Ward Burian, the co-owner of Dunham Realty in Old Lyme. "They decided to sell."
SIMILAR instances were reported in Essex and the riverfront part of Deep River, he said. Laura Page reported similar increases when Madison had its revaluation and Alix Sara Prince, vice president of Julia B. Fee in Rye, said that the town's waterfront had been appraised at its "overinflated" past values, creating an obstacle to selling waterfront property.
Nevertheless, Ms. Prince insisted that tax assessors, besieged by complaints, often did adjust an assessment after a property was sold if the sale was for less than the assessed fair market value.
In Huntington, L.I., Mary Rice of the Coldwell Banker Sammis brokerage, said that although there had not been a revaluation in Huntington "taxes are thought to be very high, and that creates a problem."
Ms. Rice said that despite the taxes and "some difficulties" in finding insurance, waterfront buyers -- while scarce -- were savvy, cautious customers who knew exactly what they were looking for.
"They're definitely not impulse buyers," said Ms. Rice, who is the sales manager at the Main Street branch. "These people are quite comfortable where they are, but if something comes along they'll make an offer. Every broker here has a few waterfront customers waiting for the perfect house."
She said that there was a time when such customers "would buy anything" but that "they're conservative now."
Because of the lack of pressure to buy, these potential waterfront buyers are known as tough negotiators who will walk away from a house if the price is not to their liking.
Although houses on the Sound in Huntington Bay and Lloyd Harbor almost never sell for under $1 million, Ms. Rice said houses in Asharoken and the McKinley Terrace section of Centerport sold for far less. Houses like the bayfront contemporary in McKinley Terrace now listed for $339,000 would have sold for as much as $400,000 or $425,000 at the height of the market, she said..
"One bayfront house on a narrow lot in Asharoken sold in the low threes and it took forever to go to contract," she said. "One of the issues was whether they could get insurance and they really wrangled over the price, and the seller wouldn't go any lower. It boiled down to the fact that the husband just plain loved it."
The Asharoken section, she explained, is not as accessible as other sections of Huntington. "It's kind of out of the way," she said, "but that's exactly why it appeals to some people."
On the Jersey Shore, Mr. Traina, whose company handles houses in Manahawkin and on Long Beach Island -- the 18-mile-long barrier-beach island across the intracoastal waterway from Manahawkin -- said he offered waterfront houses from $80,000 up to $3 million.
THE six-bedroom modern house at 51D Long Beach Boulevard in Loveladies on Long Beach Island -- one of the area's grandest, with sleek bleached wood, rounded corners and plain round metal railings and with 125 feet of ocean dune frontage -- just sold for $1.3 million. At the height of the market, it would have brought $2 million, the real estate agent said.
In the picturesque town of Bay Head, N.J., about 45 minutes north of Long Beach Island, where much more of the housing stock is of turn-of-the-century vintage than in the Manahawkin area, there is a grand Victorian shingled beach house with a wicker bar sitting on the curved porch.
Three corner fireplaces -- one in the entrance foyer -- sit inside the empty house with the original vertical beaded paneling. The old kitchen is rudimentary and the white trim paint is peeling. Nevertheless, the house appears in good condition and there is relatively new baseboard heat.
The house sold on March 7 for $1.075 million. "During the height of the market, it would have closed for $1.5 to $1.6 million," said Shawn C. Clayton, whose family owns a real estate company that concentrates on the Bay Head-Mantoloking waterfront. Mr. Clayton said that although properties had been hit by the recession, waterfront properties continued to sell.
"We're still getting good numbers," he said, gesturing to a wall of color photographs of properties.
Several of the houses had been substantially reduced. An eight-bedroom white Victorian farmhouse on the open bay in Mantoloking started out eight months ago at $775,000 and is now down to $595,000. A contemporary two-story, six-bedroom oceanfront house began at $1.995 million and is now listed at $1.675 million.
IN Rye, Alix Prince, who has sold four waterfront houses since Christmas, produced a handful of information sheets on houses that had been sold in the mid-1980's and had recently been resold for less.
"In 1990-1991 we had a standoff between buyers and sellers," she said. "The sellers still thought they could get top dollar and the buyers were telling them they couldn't. They're getting more realistic now. It took them a long time to believe that the market had crashed."
The market appears to be recovering more quickly in the Hamptons. According to Frank Zaperach, a real estate agent, waterfront property values that had dropped 20 or 30 percent several years ago, are almost back to the high levels of the mid-80's. His assessment is shared by other realtors there.
Mark Zimmerman, a real estate lawyer who divides his time between East Hampton and Manhattan, said that the Hamptons had recovered faster than other waterfront areas in the region because they attracted "Hollywood, Japanese and European money."
"The celebrities want to be there and the people who want to be where the celebrities are want to be there," he said.
Ms. Niggles, the East Hampton broker, offered another explanation.
"These waterfront houses rent for as much as $300,000 for the summer," she said. "Why would you want to let somebody steal your house at a bargain basement price if you could look ahead to that much income? When waterfront houses aren't selling, the owners will just take them off the market and wait."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Choosing The Best Mortgage

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH most of the first-time buyers now flooding the market are choosing fixed-rate mortgages, this may not necessarily be the wisest choice.
True, such mortgages are easier to understand and far more predictable: What you pay at the outset is what you will always pay. But they're certainly not the least exxpensive way to go. 
 Indeed, for anyone likely to move on in a handful of years -- the typical pattern for a first-time homeowner -- there could be major advantages to the vast array of adjustable mortgages now available.
Adjustables are no longer the risky product they were when introduced in the late 70's and early 80's -- a time of volatile interest rates and steep interest charges. Increases can be phased in more gradually and all mortgages have strict limits on how high payments can rise over the life of the loan.
As a result, these mortgages have a special appeal when interest rates are low. If it starts out at 3.5 percent, for example, a lifetime cap of 6 percent (the industry norm) means that the interest rate could never exceed 9.5 percent. So even if interest rates rise as predicted in the coming months they should still make financial sense.
They are particularly useful, for example, to any borrower required to carry private mortgage insurance during the first few years. This normally happens when a down payment is less than 20 percent.
In these situations an adjustable mortgage costs so much less in those early years that it should enable the borrower to pay off principal each month, thereby reaching that 20 percent threshold sooner, noted Marc Eisenson, a partner with Banker's Secret, a mortgage-information publisher in Elizaville, N.Y. As soon as that happens the mortgage insurance can be dropped.
Others who might do well with an adjustable mortgage include transferees with a limited-term assignment and an investor who's buying a "handyman special" for a quick fix-up and turnaround.
There are many different types of adjustables to choose from, each one tailored to a projected length of stay or to cover any lingering fears about the future.
There are adjustables that stay fixed for the first 3, 5 or 7 years, depending upon the borrower's choice; others that allow the borrower to convert to a fixed-rate loan at any time during the first five years with only a nominal administrative charge. Still others offer rock-bottom starting rates in exchange for a willingness to permit an adjustment once each year.
If all of this seems like hype it's worth noting that adjustables have lately become the mortgage of choice for the professionals in the business. And they should know.
Consider Neil Bader, president of Skyscraper Mortgage Corporation, one of the larger mortgage brokers in Manhattan. When he and his wife, Amy, were seeking financing for a vacation home they purchased last July in Stockbridge, Mass., they chose an adjustable for their own $200,000 loan.
The interest rate was 3.8 percent for the first year compared with 7.5 percent for a fixed-rate loan, giving them initial payments of $940 a month instead of $1,398. Even though payments will gradually rise in subsequent years the savings will amount to $8,076 over the first two years alone. "That's a lot of money," said Mr. Bader.
Moreover, the loan carried a cap limiting any increases to 6 percent over the life of the mortgage. So their interest rate could never rise higher than 9.8 percent -- the "worst case scenario," said Mr. Bader.
In other words, in a low interest rate environment, the normal 6 percent lifetime cap on an adjustable rate mortgage means that -- irrespective of what happens to the economy over the next 30 years -- the rate on that particular loan may never rise more than about two points higher than the starting rate for today's fixed-rate mortgages -- about 7.5 percent.
No wonder Marc Eisenson, the mortgage-information publisher, encouraged his brother, Alan, to make a similar move. Alan Eisenson, owner of Just Alan, an upscale gift store in Woodstock, N.Y., has been buying and selling property since the 70's, using fixed-rate mortgages each time.
But when he and his wife, Juliette, and their two children moved to a larger home in the area two years ago they were advised by his brother to instead consider a yearly adjustable, the one with the lowest starting rate. And they have not been disappointed. So far they have never seen an adjustment lift payments to the maximum permitted by their particular contract. "It was a gamble," admits Alan Eisenson. "But sometimes it's worth gambling just a little."
Or take the view of Brett and Sharon Mehlman, a couple in their 20's who have just bought their first home, a two-bedroom co-op on East 87th Street in Manhattan. They don't expect to be in the apartment more than a few years because they plan to have children and move to the suburbs.
Thus they selected a mortgage with a 6.125 percent interest rate that adjusts every three years. The $203,000 they needed in financing is costing $1,233 a month for the first three years. Although it may rise to $1,490 during the second three-year period -- assuming once again the worst case scenario -- this is still only pennies more than the cost of a fixed-rate loan that would have started out at $1,454 a month.
As they also believed that their incomes would increase as time went on, said Mr. Mehlman, it made sense to lighten the burden initially and take a chance on those later years, especially as they may not even be there by then.
Keith Gumbinger, an mortgage analyst with HSH Associates, a mortgage monitoring service in Butler, N.J, figures that it normally takes about five years before an adjustable begins to cost the borrower more than a fixed-rate loan.
Meantime, some sizable savings are being achieved. Mr. Gumbinger gives as an example a $100,000 loan. On a 30-year fixed rate schedule monthly payments would average around $686, given a 7.3 percent interest rate.
By contrast, an adjustable-rate mortgage with 6.3 percent fixed rate for the first five years would only cost $619, a monthly savings of $67. So before any adjustments even started to kick in the savings would amount to $4,020 (67 x 12 x 5).
What kind of adjustables have become the most popular? At Mr. Bader's mortgage agency it's been those that start out with an interest rate of around 5.5 percent and limit adjustments to three-year intervals.
Coupled with a 2 percent cap on each of these adjustment, he said, this means that for at least the first six years the rate will stay under 8 percent, making them highly competitive with a regular 30-year fixed rate loan.
Anyone willing to take on an adjustable with more frequent adjustment periods can probably find a loan that starts out at 3.7 percent, he said. In that case it could take as long as 10 years before you would have paid the bank as much as if you had started out with a fixed-rate loan.
Jenne K. Britell, chief lending officer at Dime Savings Bank of New York, said her first-time buyers liked adjustables that were constant for the first five years, adjusting every year afterwards.
"It gives you the security of a fixed-rate product at a lower rate with five years before you have to worry," she said.

'ORLANDO' IN RIDGEFIELD
"Orlando," based on the Virginia Wolff novel that traces the ageless, endless, gender-bending life of the title character, will be shown today at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art at 258 Main Street in Ridgefield.
It will be introduced by Quentin Crisp, the British actor who portrays Queen Elizabeth in the film. Orlando, played by Tilda Swenson, is first encountered as a young nobleman in Elizabethan England, and followed through her amorous adventures to present day London. 
 A reception at 4 P.M. will include a tour of the current art exhibition, and hors d'oeuvres prepared by Johannes Brugger, chef-owner of the historic Inn at Ridgefield. Mr. Crisp's talk and the screening will follow at 5 P.M.
American audiences may be familiar with Quentin Crisp through his autobiography, "The Naked Civil Servant," which was made into an arresting film starring John Hurt.
Tickets are $15, or $10 for students. The number for reservations is 438-4519.
 
ART OF THE ANGLER
 Fishermen impatient for the opening of the season, and art lovers whose season is never ending, will enjoy the new exhibition at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London. Curated by the director, Elizabeth P. Knowles, "The Lure of Fishing" opens today through May 1, with a selection of paintings and sculpture dedicated to anglers, angling and even some hapless anglees.
Among the historical entries are an Adirondack fishing scene by Winslow Homer, and a handsome black bass by Gurdon Trumbull, loaned by the Fine Arts and Antiques Collection of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company.
The American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vermont, has lent works by Ogden Pleissner, an early 20th century member of the Old Lyme art colony; and contemporary fly-fishermen are depicted by several Connecticut artists including Chet Renesen, Lou Bonamarte, Pam Nelson, and Luther Hall. Original prints by Robert Cale are also in the show. The Stonington artist, who died in 1991, developed a technique in which fish became a printing matrix when mixed with inks.
Gallery talks by some of the artists will be given at the opening today from 1 to 5 P.M. The museum is located at 625 Williams Street, open Tuesday through Friday and on Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.; Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $3 for adults, $2 for students and older adults, free for children through the age of 12. The number for more information is 443-2545.
 
GRAY ON ANATOMY
 Spalding Gray will present his monologue, "Gray's Anatomy," at the Norwalk Community-Technical College Theater on Saturday at 8 P.M. Tickets at $25 may be reserved by calling 857-7271.
Taking his title from the medical textbook that bore his name long before he did, he regales the audience with tales of his odyssey around the world, seeking a cure for an eye ailment that defied diagnosis and treatment. At various times he was the patient of a nutritional opthamologist in Poughkeepsie, a New Age healer in a Minnesota sweat lodge, and a psychic in the Philippines who performed strange surgery.
His style, in this and numerous other monologues that he has delivered at the Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center, relies on deadpan delivery of outrageous text. The college is located at 188 Richards Avenue.
 
LOOKING AT NATIONALISM
 The League of Women Voters of Connecticut is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Among the special events on its agenda is a Symposium on International Relations to be presented in cooperation with Yale University at the Yale Law School on Wednesday from 8:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. The emphasis will be on Russia and India and the subtitle is "Nationalism: Obstacle or Opportunity?"
Roger Hilsman, professor emeritus of international politics at Columbia University and former Assistant Secretary of State, will open the proceedings with an overview on nationalism, later fielding questions from the audience.
The afternoon session will be led by Philip Oldenburg, a Columbia University professor; and Christine Perney, a doctoral candidate in Soviet studies at Columbia.
A fee of $28 includes a box lunch, morning coffee and a program. Students will be charged $10. The number for reservations or more information is 288-7996.
 
WHEN CHROME WAS KING
 Visitors might recognize their grandmother's chrome coffeepot, platter or bain-marie among the domestic items in the exhibition of Depression Metalware at the Mattatuck Museum, 144 West Main Street in Waterbury.
The array of chrome tableware, lamps, boxes, smoking accessories and other household goods, was manufactured in the 1930's and early 40's by the Chase Brass and Copper Company, which dominated Waterbury's economy for decades.
Advertised in The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping and House and Garden, the pieces were created by the era's top industrial designers, including Russell Wright, Walter VonNessen and Rockwell Kent. They provided housewives who had to double as cooks and hostesses, with the means of producing a cheaper method of home entertaining -- the self-service buffet.
A slide-lecture on the contents of the exhibit and the social changes wrought by the Depression, will be given by the museum's director, Ann Smith, on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. Admission is free and the museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from noon to 5. The number for more information is 753-0381.
 
TALKING ABOUT WEATHER
 Appropriate to the Northeast's worst winter in memory, a four-part minicourse on the weather is being offered by the Holland-Brook Nature Center of the Connecticut Audubon Society this month.
"Forecasting Weather, From Folklore to New Technologies" is the title of the first session, to be led by Steve Newman, meteorologist and professor of physics and earth science at Central Connecticut State University, on Wednesday at 7:30.
Mr. Newman will again be in charge on Saturday, when he conducts a tour of the university's weather-tracking equipment in a program called "State of the Art Weather Forecasting." Carpools from the nature center will depart at 9 A.M., or participants may meet the group at the university in New Britain at 10 A.M.
"Weather for Fliers, Farmers and Gardeners" is scheduled on March 23 at 7:30 P.M. at the center. Charlie and Jolly Stephens, veteran seaplaners, will discuss the value of maximizing efficiency and safety through knowledge of prevailing winds, cloud formations, weather trends and seasonal variations.
On the same night Kirk Ducharme, from UConn's Department of Atmospheric Science, will talk about taking advantage of a large body of knowledge about the effects of weather on crops, relevant to preventing damage and destruction.
The final session on March 30 at 7:30 P.M. features Brad Field, meteorologist for WVIT-TV, and Sue Smith, member of the support crew for the 1991 New England Mt. Everest Expedition. The subject will be "Reporting the Weather, Forecasting and Disasters: and Weather for Trekkers." It will be held at the center, 1361 Main Street in Glastonbury. Admission to each program is $10, and the number for more information or to register for any or all sessions is 633-8402. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Hampton, a Town Where Crime Stays on Holiday

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
THE town of Hampton, tucked away in the hills of Eastern Connecticut, is one of the state's lesser-known assets. The small community -- about 25 square miles, about 1,560 people -- still lists agriculture as its principal industry. You have to work to find it on Route 97, a former Indian path known as the Nipmuck Trail that curves and dips through the area.
But Hampton's main street is a scene out of a Currier & Ives lithograph: graceful 18th- and 19th-century homes, some with big attached barns, the Grange Hall, the general store, the Congregational Church with its steeple pointing to the sky. It is a pretty place. It is also -- in an era of drive-by shootings and other random and rampant violence -- the safest town in Connecticut. 
 The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which keeps track of the state's 169 towns, discloses in a new report that Hampton has the lowest per-capita crime rate of them all. The report, "Indicators of Need in Connecticut Municipalities," is based on statistics from the calendar year 1992. Crimes included are murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.
 
Why Hampton, Indeed
 It's no surprise that the state's three biggest cities -- Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport -- ranked No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 in crime. But there at the end of the list, ranking 169, was Hampton, a place where crime seems be on holiday. Hartford's crimes -- 21,332 of them -- represented 16 percent of its population. Hampton's crimes -- a total of 9 -- represented considerably less than 1 percent.
Why Hampton?
It is not the smallest of towns; its population is about three times that of Union, Connecticut's most sparsely populated community. Nor is it the richest town, wallowing in money to spend on police and social services. Compared to the affluent enclaves of Fairfield County in Western Connecticut all the towns of Eastern Connecticut's Windham County are poor relatives. And even though Hampton is remote, a deterrent to crime in itself, so also are neighboring towns that have higher crime rates.
To get a line on how the town holds down its crime rate, the man to see is Walter A. Stone, First Selectman, Chief of Police, dairy farmer, self-acknowledged cheapskate when it comes to spending public money, and philosopher in residence.
If Hampton is a scene out of Currier & Ives, Mr. Stone is a character out of a Norman Rockwell painting, tall and spare and with wry opinions on life in the slow zone, on such subjects as getting re-elected or on keeping the town safe.
 
Now, About Spending and All
 Getting re-elected is easy. Just make sure you haven't spent too many dollars and that your town got full benefit from the ones you did spend. Hampton's town office building and its new elementary school are fine examples.
When the town built the elementary school, a brick and stucco structure of style and grace that is meant to last, the old wooden elementary school was converted into a new town office building at minimum cost. And since the basement in the office building wasn't being used, it was rented out to a small private school. That provided money to heat and clean and generally maintain the town offices. "We break even on the town office building," said Mr. Stone happily.
At 64, he is now serving his sixth consecutive two-year term running the town where he was born and where Stones have lived since the middle of the last century. His most recent election, in 1993, was a bit different than usual, however. "I had an opponent," said Mr. Stone. The local Democrats put up Robert McDermott, a retired school teacher, to run against Mr. Stone, a Republican, part of the bait being the opportunity to collect the annual First Selectman's salary of $8,750. Mr. Stone said the campaign was sort of dull: "He didn't say anything and I didn't say anything and I won." That's politicking, Hampton style.
When it comes to preventing crime, Mr. Stone and Hampton are equally low key, and seemingly effective.
While the town has no large industry, said Mr. Stone, it does have many cottage industries, such as a cooking school run out of one home, a lawyer who is also an antiques dealer, a corporate "headhunter" who has his office at home.
"These people are around all the time and they notice people who come into town," said Mr. Stone. "People really watch over each other here. If someone sees a strange car, they'll call me or one of the constables."
The constables, four of them, are elected every two years. "They don't do anything," said Mr. Stone, "but people see their names on the ballot and think they have some power." That's all right with him because it makes citizens feel more comfortable with the constables around.
 
Reining In the Overzealous
 He does not, however, want the constables to get any ideas about enforcement duties, particularly after an unfortunate incident several years ago. A young constable who was also a member of the volunteer fire department, came across a teen-ager riding a dirt bike illegally and gave chase in his fire department car, using the radio to notify anyone in range that he was in hot pursuit of the biker. Right slam on Route 97. Mr. Stone was not amused and told the constable to hand in his badge.
As the official Chief of Police of Hampton, although one without uniform or even a hat, Mr. Stone does have the power of arrest. Not that he plans to use it. On the rare occasion he really wants someone arrested, he calls the State Police barracks in the Danielson borough of Killingly. "They have one trooper who sort of looks after this town and a couple of others," he said. At the moment, though, he didn't have any idea of who the trooper might be because of personnel changes at the State Police barracks.
Mostly, fighting crime in Hampton is a psychological effort. The town has a watch committee that has posted signs all over to notify any bad guys who might decide that Hampton is easy picking that the citizens are on the alert.
When State Police do make an arrest in town, Mr. Stone admits, he tends to learn about it from reading area newspapers. "Usually, it's for fraud, or collecting unemployment compensation while working," the chief said. "I can tell you this, people don't go around beating each other up. That doesn't exist here." A murder in town? "I don't ever remember a murder."
The closest thing to a crime wave in Hampton, said its First Selectman, was last summer when some older boys used to gather at night to shoot baskets at an outdoor court at the grammar school. Somehow, the cover grate of a storm sewer drain had been dropped into the drain, presumably as a prank, and was resting several feet below. Mr. Stone dropped over one night to see the basketball players. One of the players, he said, told him that the cover was off the drain. "I said, 'It better be back on when I come back tomorrow night.' " It was.
 
If It Ain't Broke
 The one thing that mystifies the leader of the safe haven of a town is that people are always trying to change it. Not the people who have lived there all their lives. The newcomers.
"I say to these people, 'Why did you come here?' and they say 'Because we love it here.' So I say 'If you love it, why do you want to change it?' " Some things just don't make sense.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/International Design Center;
An Empty Feeling? Try Mixing Uses

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT seemed like a really great idea a decade ago: a huge, self-contained furniture mart, just across the East River from Manhattan, full of all the residential furniture anyone could ever want.
Then, when neither buyers nor sellers stormed the doors, Plan B seemed a surefire winner: Fill the showrooms with enough contract furniture -- the industry term for corporate furniture bought in bulk -- to make the place a must-visit destination for anyone outfitting an office. 
 Well, apparently "if you build it, they will come," to slightly misquote "Field of Dreams," works only in movies; they -- designers, architects, decorators, all the potential customers -- stayed away in droves.
Now the two-building, million-square-foot International Design Center in Long Island City is embarking on Plan C: It is trying to become a hybrid place, half furniture center, half business center, where administrative offices coexist with furniture showrooms.
Already it has moved all its furniture tenants into one building, enticing those who had to move with either bigger space or reduced rent. The New York City School Construction Authority has set up offices in the second building.
S.L. Green Real Estate, which was hired by the Bank of New York to manage the troubled center after the bank took control of the property last spring, plans to carve the 320,000 square feet of space left in that building into blocks of 60,000 square feet or so and market them for office use.
"We want people in midtown to view us as an alternative to leaving the city," said Arthur T. Katz, the center's senior vice president of leasing. "But we no longer expect tenants who rely on drop-in traffic. It has to be tenants whose employees come in and stay here until they go home."
Mr. Katz is acknowledging what the center's original conceptualizers did not: From the point of view of the Manhattan-based designers and executives who buy office furniture, the Design Center might as well be in Idaho. The nearest subway stop is a half mile away and the free shuttle buses the center provides to and from the subway didn't make up for the perceived inaccessibility. Nor did the free shuttle service over the traffic-snarled Queensboro Bridge to Third Avenue and 56th Street. Nor the ample on-site parking.
And, as the center's management and its hapless tenants have discovered, emptiness begets emptiness.
"Those customers who do come out here are upset because it feels so empty," said Irving M. Rosen, president of Cumberland Furniture, a Center showroom tenant. "It's like if you are the only customer in an expensive restaurant. Even if the food is good you somehow don't feel like going back."
It is an ignominious end for a project that in the boom times of the 80's held such promise. Back then, Manhattan's Architects & Designers building and its Design and Decorators Building, both on Third Avenue and 58th Street and both considered the places to go for furniture, were not only expensive, they were also full.
Meanwhile, there were these three adjacent factory buildings sitting empty in Long Island City, with big freight elevators that could accommodate furniture. So in the early 1980's New York City officials approached Harvey Schulweis, chairman of Lazard Realty and a general partner in the property, and offered him an enticing package of incentives to turn it into a furnitue center.
MR. SCHULWEIS went first class all the way. He hired the renowned architect I.M. Pei to create a master plan for the proposed design complex and the architects Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel to carry out that plan.
What they turned out was two buildings joined by covered bridges each with an enclosed courtyard, attractive and easily navigated staircases and huge corridors that make showroom-hopping easy. (The third factory was not part of the project and is now used primarily by LaGuardia Community College.)
Furniture folks quickly bought into the idea of getting tailor-made showroom space at annual rents of under $20 a square foot, half of what Manhattan space cost. Huge contract furniture companies like Steelcase and Herman Miller took long-term leases for showrooms. And smaller companies, figuring they'd benefit from the traffic that the big ones would generate, quickly followed suit.
By the mid-80's, more than 700,000 of the center's one million rentable feet of showroom space had been leased.
"Everyone expected that if you sold furniture the design center would be the only place to be," said Edward Carr, Steelcase's vice president for corporate services.
Although the leasing activity slackened off toward the decade's end, no one was worried much. Lazard figured it already had enough furniture makers to bring in customers, and it rented some 200,000 square feet of office space to the New York City School Construction Authority.
That prescient move may turn out to be the center's savior. The aftermath of the stock market crash of 1987 put the brakes on almost every corporate expansion plan, and thus on the corporate furniture business.
"Some of our tenants merged, some went bankrupt, some moved out in the middle of the night," Mr. Katz said.
The ones that stayed grew restive, as traffic to their showrooms grew negligible.
"The problem was the recession, but here, when things got slow, everyone blamed the building," said Catherine T. Giliberti, an executive vice president of the Center.
In fact, Manhattan's furniture sellers weren't having an easy time either. But their plight made things worse for the Design Center, not better. As the city went deeper into recession, affordable showroom space became available not only in Manhattan's design buildings but also in several buildings in Midtown south. And the annual rent per square foot for the space dropped to the low $20's or even the high teens, not much more than the Design Center was charging.
TO make matters worse, the city announced it was including a furniture center as part of the Times Square Redevelopment Project. Although that plan has since been tabled, the hoopla that surrounded it put the curse on the idea that, for furniture manufacturers, Long Island City was the place to be.
"Everything out here just ground to a halt," Mr. Katz said.
Today the center's white-tablecloth restaurant is closed due to lack of business, leaving a self-service cafeteria that closes at 4 P.M. as the center's only place to eat. The buildings are only half full, and not all of the current tenants are likely to stay.
Herman Miller, whose lease runs until 1997, has sued the center, saying that letting non-furniture tenants in is a breach of contract and voids their lease. A decision is expected soon.
"In some cities design centers work, in some they don't," said John R. Berry, a Herman Miller vice president. "This one was a disappointment."
Steelcase, whose lease expires in 1999, recently bought 4 Columbus Circle and may consolidate its six New York area showrooms there. Mr. Carr noted that all of Steelcase's New York leases will expire in the next few years and that it was "putting together a long-term strategy" about space; if it does not include the Design Center, many real estate experts say the center is doomed.
"Steelcase moving will probably be the center's coup de grace," warned Richard Maltz, chairman of the Queens real estate firm Greiner-Maltz.
Indeed, the smaller tenants are not certain they can survive if the industry leaders go. Yes, there are some die-hard loyalists, like John Calvano, executive vice president of Levine Calvano Associates, a furniture tenant, who calls the center "a first class facility" and "really conducive" to showrooms.
"Yes, the center has lost momentum," he said, "but if Manhattan rents go up again, it'll recover."
But not all tenants can wait that long.
"I'm between a rock and a hard place," said Mr. Rosen, who is wrestling with whether to renew the lease on Cumberland's 10,000 square feet when it expires in 1996. "I like it here, but I can't survive here alone."

HEADLINE: Why Military Contractors Covet Grumman

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

 BODY:
THE Grumman Corporation, the venerable Long Island military contractor whose future seemed dim, has suddenly emerged as a highly coveted jewel of the weapons industry. As Pentagon spending shrinks, the industry has consolidated, and there are few companies as big as Grumman left to buy -- or as willing to sell to survive.
The Northrop Corporation, a competing weapons maker based in Los Angeles, ignited a bidding war for Grumman last week, making a $2.04 billion offer, or $60 a share, that topped a $1.9 billion bid, or $55 a share, made earlier in the week by the Martin Marietta Corporation. 
 Northrop's bid, which is scheduled to commence tomorrow with a tender offer for Grumman's 33.9 million outstanding shares, raises the ante among weapons companies trying to gain the "critical mass" to survive in a fast contracting industry.
The bidding could go higher, in large part because Northrop, more than Martin Marietta, needs Grumman to keep itself from being taken over. In fact, on Friday, arbitragers were trading Northrop options as if they were in a takeover play.
"My bet is that Northrop will win Grumman in the end because they are hungrier. They need Grumman a lot more than Martin Marietta does," said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment banking firm that specializes in the aerospace and military industries.
"Northrop has to make a decision: Either to exit the business or quickly gain capacity. This is a cornerstone event for them."
Behind the battle for Grumman is a growing recognition by weapons contractors that their industry is retrenching so quickly that they will have to leave markets in which they are marginal participants and acquire businesses in areas they can dominate.
While Martin Marietta has made several acquisitions in recent years, Northrop has made no major ones. And unlike Martin Marietta's, many of Northrop's weapons contracts expire later in the decade.
Since 1985, the Defense Department's budget has declined 64 percent, leaving too many competitors in a dwindling market where, industry experts said, resources are wasted and ultimately also-rans go out of business.
Last week, industry experts and analysts initially said that Martin Marietta's offer of $55 a share was on the high end of what Grumman was worth. But Grumman's shares closed Friday at $64.75, up from around $37, where they were trading a week before Martin Marietta's offer.
That indicates that investors expect the final price for the company to be even higher than Northrop's $60-a-share offer and also raises the possibility that other bidders could join the fray.
Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst for BT Securities, said that weapons industry stocks are generally valued at slightly less than 10 times their cash flow and that he had determined several weeks ago that Grumman was worth between $50 and $60 a share using that measure.
Mr. Demisch said weapons firms are valued more cautiously than other major industrial companies because they operate in a declining industry where revenue levels are expected to drop substantially in coming years as weapons programs reach maturity.
But some industry analysts said Grumman might command a price higher than $60 a share based on the company's strong cash flow, its contracts in military electronics programs, commercial aircraft structures and computer information systems and software, and the potential economies of scale achieved through a merger. Of great appeal is Grumman's joint surveillance target attack radar system, or Jstars, which allows the Air Force and Army to broadcast radar images gathered aboard an aircraft to commanders in the field.
Martin Marietta said last week that it has arranged $2.4 billion in financing for its merger with Grumman, a cushion that will allow it to raise its bid to $70 a share. However, Martin Marietta, which had sales of $9.44 billion last year, could bid much higher, depending on how badly it wants Grumman.
Northrop could push its bid to $82 a share, based on its credit line of $2.8 billion. But Northrop's chairman, Kent Kresa, has said repeatedly that the company will not overpay.
Acquiring Grumman is far more important to Northrop than it is to Martin Marietta, which has been among the most aggressive buyers of other weapons businesses. Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., bought the aerospace electronics division of the General Electric Company in 1992, and last year acquired General Dynamics Corporation's space booster business.
But for Northrop, the acquisition could be a matter of independence. Northrop has failed to make a major acquisition in the all-important military electronics area, which analysts believe shows the most promise for growth. The company needs an acquisition to compensate for a potential drop in its revenues later in the decade. Northrop, which had sales of $5.1 billion last year, makes the B-2 bomber, missiles, military electronics and parts for the F/A-18 jet fighter and the 747 wide body.
The company has said that its annual sales could drop to between $3 billion and $4 billion when the B-2 program ends in the late 1990's.
WHILE Northrop has a significant backlog of weapons business that will keep it afloat through the decade, it has few new contracts in the pipeline. Industry analysts said that by merging with Grumman, Northrop would attain the "critical mass" that it has been seeking in military electronics, commercial aircraft structures, computer and information systems, and airborne surveillance systems.
Northrop officials said that they were under no pressure to complete a major weapons acquisition but that they are doggedly pursuing Grumman because the two companies would have an extraordinary fit.
James G. Roche, Northrop's chief advanced development planning officer, said Grumman is particularly attractive because it has assets in each of three Northrop product areas: military aircraft, airplane sub-assemblies and electronics.
"We want this company because it's a three-fer," Mr. Roche said. "Instead of going out and trying to buy smaller companies that fit into each of these areas, we can get them all in one swoop."
For example, Mr. Roche said that there are great similarities and synergies in the systems integration work that Grumman performs on the Jstars surveillance program and Northrop's B-2 bomber, which is built to avoid detection by enemy radar.
In addition, Mr. Roche said that Northrop's acquisition of Grumman would provide for an orderly transfer of Grumman's expertise in building aircraft from one contractor to another.
With the end of the Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter, Grumman has been closing down its design and manufacturing facilities for tactical aircraft. Northrop, which is a major subcontractor for McDonnell Douglas on the FA-18 and for the Boeing Company on the 747 passenger jet, says that it is better equipped than Martin Marietta to exploit Grumman's aircraft infrastructure. Martin Marietta is no longer in that business.
But Martin Marietta officials also make a good case for synergies that result from a merger with Grumman. With its acquisition of General Electric's aerospace electronics business in 1992, Martin Marietta became the nation's largest military electronics supplier. Grumman would broaden and strengthen Martin Marietta's position.
"Who has the better fit? Right now I'd say it's a tossup and the case can be made in either direction," Mr. Demisch said. "But my guess is that if the real intent here is to shrink the defense base then there would be more rationalization with Martin rather than Northrop."
That would leave Northrop to be swallowed up, which would reduce the size of the industry even more.
No matter who wins Grumman, industry analysts said that there are still plenty of weapons businesses that are ripe for the taking and that the losing bidder could still acquire critical mass through several smaller deals. Among those companies with weapons businesses that are considered likely to be sold: ITT, Raytheon, Harris, E-Systems and Westinghouse.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Argentina: A Slow, but Rocky, Recovery

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
THE second half of 1992 was a time most traders on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange thought they would never forget, when a soaring equities market, which had been fueled by foreign investor optimism over economic changes here, lost 65 percent of its value in four months.
But last month, as shares on this emerging market once again became the darlings of international mutual fund investors, up more than 20 percent in value for the year, memories appeared to be short. Argentine stocks could do no wrong -- until a series of local and international events caused a selloff. 
 In three days, the exchange's Merval Index plunged almost 20 percent, and the ghost of 1992 returned. There were rumors that Argentina's Economy Minister, Domingo F. Cavallo, the architect of its recovery and its stabilization plan, was about to resign.
Interest rates, which had been low for months, started moving up in response to increases in the United States by the Federal Reserve Board. And foreign institutional investors, who had fueled much of the run-up as Americans poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Latin American mutual funds, started liquidating some of their holdings.
Finally, local investors, who tend to buy heavily on margin and are more prone to speculate on short-term moves, rushed to get out. "Most people are of the opinion that emerging markets only go up and don't come down," said Christopher Ecclestone, a stock analyst and senior partner at Ecclestone Hickey & Company. "The last few days have been pretty traumatic for the investor here."
But stocks have been hard-hit almost throughout Latin America since mid-February, after experiencing big increases in January. The Mexican Stock Exchange, up 15.5 percent in January, has lost 16.8 percent of its value since early February. Chilean stocks, up 22 percent on the year by Feb. 4, have lost 10.5 percent. The Lima Stock Exchange, which was up almost 30 percent in mid-February, has lost 5.4 percent.
The only stock market mostly unaffected thus far is Brazil's, where prices are up 48 percent in dollar terms for the year. Brazilian stocks are less affected because local investors hold a much higher percentage of the stock than do foreigners, making the price less susceptible to outside influence.
Though in Argentina things looked bleak earlier this month, the panic of 1994 may have come to an end, and an abrupt correction may now turn into a slow, rocky recovery, analysts say. Since a 7 percent plunge in the market on March 1, the exchange's Merval index has experienced an uneasy stability. Last week, it fell 3.4 percent, to 603.22 points, down a total of 17.1 percent from its peak of 728 on Feb. 16.
Analysts say 1994 is different from 1992. Argentina is in its fourth year of stable prices; inflation was up 7 percent in 1993, and thus far this year it has been practically at zero. The economy is into its fourth year of expansion, with predicted growth of 6 percent for 1994.
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem will almost certainly succeed later this year in changing the country's Constitution in such a way as to get himself re-elected in 1995, leading analysts to predict continued stability. They say that before next year's elections, the Menem Government will seek to stimulate the economy even more.
"I have every confidence that the buying will come back in once the market stabilizes a little bit, because there is a lot of interest in Argentina's economic program," said Walter Stoeppelwerth, head of research for Smith New Court in Buenos Aires. "Fundamentally, things look very good," he added.
Economic growth is registering on the quarterly reports of many Argentine companies, with December's corporate profits among the highest on record, analysts say.
And American companies that up to now have participated in the Argentine boom by buying into privatized Government-owned concerns are beginning to look at acquisitions. Nabisco, for example, has announced intentions to buy a $250 million to $300 million stake in one of the country's largest cracker and cookie makers, Terrabusi.
For stock pickers, the emphasis may be changing on the Bolsa. Though the two telephone companies, Telefonica and Telecom, have been the focus of foreign buying for months, as have the privatized Government oil company, YPF, and the largest industrial holding group, Perez Companc, many analysts see just moderate price increases on these stocks for the rest of the year, and have recommended they be put on hold.
Instead, they are focusing on smaller companies that serve two main domestic sectors -- food, underscored by Nabisco's interest in Terrabusi, and construction.
Mr. Stoeppelwerth likes Molinos Rio, a publicly traded unit of the conglomerate Bunge & Born. Molinos has brought in aggressive new management to cut costs and promote new quality brands. He sees profits rising 70 percent this year.
He and others are also pushing the building sector, because for the first time in decades mortgage credit is becoming available to middle-income Argentines. The chief beneficiaries should be two cement companies, Corcemar and Juan Minetti, analysts say.
"Though mortgage rates are still high by international standards, and maturities are short, every day they are coming down," said Augusto Marinozzi, head of research at Mildesa Servicios Bursatiles, a brokerage here. "Argentines have the idea that possessing a home is very good, so this should touch off a major increase in construction."

As in the Old Days, Americans Take On More Debt

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
CONSUMERS are borrowing and spending again. Last week, the Government reported that the outstanding total of consumer credit rose $6 billion in February, to $796.1 billion. Over all, the amount that consumers owe is up 7.1 percent over the last year, the most rapid increase since 1989, before the most recent recession.
Auto credit is coming back even more rapidly. Americans now owe $279 billion for cars, an increase of 7.8 percent over the last year. The last time auto credit rose that rapidly, Ronald Reagan was President. 
 That is a sharp turnaround from the early 1990's, when Americans were routinely paying back more debt than they were taking out. That hesitance to borrow was one of the big reasons the initial recovery from the recession was so slow.
Still, the current gains are hardly extraordinary by historical standards. Back in the mid-1980's, when interest rates were low and the economy was growing, double-digit gains in consumer credit were standard and taken for granted.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Lending Is Easy, But Will They Pay It Back?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
"CREDIT," as Tom Paine, the American revolutionary, once wrote, "is suspicion asleep."
Nowhere is the snoring louder than in the market for foreign debt. To be sure, there is some evidence that the public is not quite as enthusiastic as the investment bankers, but a lot of it is selling quite well. 
 Last week brought two extraordinary events in the sovereign debt market. First was a $500 million bond issue from the Bank of China, a government-owned operation. Buyers seemed to want the five-year bonds but to be dubious about the 20-year variety. The People's Republic had never before sold bonds of that maturity, and it appears that the decision to sell $100 million of such bonds was based more on what the bank wanted than on what the market demanded. Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, acknowledged that not all the bonds had been sold.
The other deal was Turkey's. There, a $1 billion issue that was being marketed by Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch supposedly was pulled from them and assigned to CS First Boston, which is said to have promised a lower interest rate. So far, CS First Boston has not announced plans to sell the bonds, and it won't comment on any of this.
Both deals show how eager Wall Street is to do business with governments these days. A decade ago, the very idea of underwriting debt for a country like China would have been laughed at. Now its debt is investment grade, and its 20-year bonds were priced to yield just 1.35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds.
Whatever you might think of Washington, it does have a dollar printing press, which makes it highly likely it will be able to meet its obligations. On the other hand, if the Bank of China were to default, there is no guarantee that Chinese courts would uphold an American judgment ordering it to pay.
The billion dollars raised by the Bank of China, said Huo Tuan Jie, a deputy general manager of the bank, will be used to finance a variety of energy, communications and transportation projects in China. Not the most liquid of investments in a pinch, but these days the words "emerging markets" bring out the greed, not the fear, on Wall Street.
The Chinese deal was sold as Secretary of State Warren Christopher was on his way to China to express concern over human rights abuses and to threaten to remove China's favored treatment as a trading partner unless things improve. The buyers seem to be unconcerned, pointing instead to the bank's solid balance sheet -- audited, as it happens, not by an accounting firm but by the bank's own accounting department.
It was only a few years ago that most of America's large banks took huge losses due to defaults by foreign governments that turned out to be worse credits than expected. But there's no similar danger here. To be sure, banks bought almost half the Bank of China bonds, but not for their own accounts. Instead, they put them in the trust accounts they manage for customers.

Grumman as Cinderella: From Loser to Belle of the Ball
With arms spending way down, the folks at the Pentagon certainly don't want a lot of huge, hobbled weapons makers littering the land, like rusting hulks of old war planes. So it fit their vision nicely last week when Martin Marietta agreed to buy Grumman for $1.9 billion. As its Pentagon contracts dried up, Grumman tried to make it in the real world, but could never quite manage. It can't be that much of a loser, though, because suddenly Northrop got into the act, raising the ante by offering $2.04 billion for it. That's $60 a share, but Grumman stock leapt to $64.75 on Friday -- yes, a bidding war's brewing. What's up? Clearly, even with shrinking budgets, there's still money in high-tech weaponry, and Grumman can be a big plus. But one thing doesn't change: whoever wins, a lot more jobs will disappear at Grumman, Long Island's largest corporate employer. 

 Fleet Goes for Efficiency
Many companies face a hard choice these days: Is it worth creating a brutal efficiency if it means firing thousands of loyal workers? Last week Fleet Financial decided it was. Even though profits have surged, it will cut a surprisingly high 5,500 jobs, more than a quarter of its banking staff; that includes 3,000 layoffs. But will surviving employees put heart and soul into almighty efficiency, or will they wonder if the person who used to be at the next desk is now flipping burgers? The layoffs are "painful," said Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman, but he insisted the alternative would be to "put even more jobs at risk."
 
Thank You for Not Taxing
The thought of a 75-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes alarms the tobacco industry. So much so, in fact, that on Wednesday some big tobacco companies shut their factories and bused workers to a Washington protest rally. The industry's grim vision: the tax would put 274,000 out of work. "You kill tobacco, you kill the whole East Coast," said one worker. Then there's the Surgeon General's grim vision: 419,000 smoking-related deaths in 1990. And a third view: a study last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association minimizes the impact of a smoking decline, saying cigarette money would be spent elsewhere, creating different jobs.
 
Second Thoughts at British Air
It sounded good: British Airways would pump cash into USAir, each would feed the other's flights, and the partnership would sparkle in a global sunset. But last week British Air, which has already chipped in $400 million for 24 percent of USAir, decided to cool it. It won't invest more -- it had planned $450 million more -- until USAir gets costs down. That pushed USAir, which has lost $1.8 billion since 1988, to go to its unions for more concessions; it may even have to mimic rivals by giving workers equity. One upshot of this falling-out: the United States wants more access to London's Heathrow, but with British Air no longer clamoring for more of USAir, America's lost some bargaining power.
 
Truce for Sculley and Spectrum
John Sculley and Spectrum have made peace, of sorts -- or at least they've calmed down enough to stop throwing things at each other. Mr. Sculley had sued Peter Caserta, Spectrum's chairman, saying Mr. Caserta had lured him aboard by hiding some nasty facts. And Spectrum fired back a lawsuit accusing Mr. Sculley of breach of contract for bailing out. But last week both sides dropped their suits. They wouldn't say why they'd backed off, but one reasonable theory has it that they'll need all their energy to battle class actions from shareholders, who say management inflated the stock price by painting a too-rosy picture of the promise of Spectrum's cellular technology. So, chapter closed, but not this bizarre book.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Satellite Pictures for All
America's got some pretty fancy technology for taking satellite pictures -- it can spot things as small as a few feet wide. The question is, should it be sold abroad? No, say some, giving the old national-security cry -- we can't let the likes of North Korea and Iraq get their hands on it. Nonsense, say others: the stuff's out there, so if we don't sell it, someone else will. Last week, the Administration came down on the side of commerce -- as it often does these days -- and said companies like Lockheed could sell spy satellite technology worldwide. The cold war recedes even further into memory's distant corners.
 
Media Mergers: Canada's Turn
Americans are not the only ones dreaming of multibillion-dollar media mergers, of dominating hot markets like cable television. In Canada last week, there was a media deal worth serious money: $2.5 billion. After five weeks of haggling, Rogers Communications agreed to merge with Maclean Hunter, creating Canada's biggest communications company. Rogers, Canada's largest cable operator, also runs various radio stations and a Toronto television station, while Maclean Hunter, No. 4 in cable, also has broadcasting and publishing interests.
 
Easing Tensions With Japan
The trade tension between the United States and Japan eased a notch last week. Even as Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on a visit to Tokyo, accused Japan of reneging on a broad promise to open its markets, one small but symbolic sticking point may have been worked out. Motorola and a Japanese company, I.D.O., reportedly made a deal that lets Motorola get a piece of Japan's cellular telephone business. Under the agreement, I.D.O. will build base stations that will work with Motorola technology, making Motorola a viable competitor. It could just be enough to head off trade sanctions threatened by the United States -- and who knows what other unpleasantness.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Inflation? Here! There! Gone.
Bond traders these days must have powerful telescopic sights. They're jumping at imagined inflation so far in the distance that mere mortals couldn't possibly see it. Ever since the Federal Reserve nudged interest rates higher a month ago, rates have soared, with 30-year Treasury bonds yielding a full point more than they did in October. The market had a bad case of the jitters on Thursday, when rates roared to 6.95 percent, sending stock prices down in lockstep. But when the rate brushed up against 7 percent early Friday, traders said, Enough! Rates skidded back down to 6.90 percent, and the Dow charged ahead by 32 points. And inflation? Still not much in sight.
 
Municipal Bonds: The Facts
In recent years, a lot of people have discovered the joys of municipal bonds -- mainly, not paying tax on the interest. Individual investors, directly or through mutual funds, now account for 75 percent of this $1.2 trillion market, up from less than 45 percent a decade ago. But in many cases they've also discovered the horrors: a bond plummets in value when, out of the blue, bad news hits. Too often, in this lightly regulated market, investors don't know what they're buying -- and aren't told of events that affect their investment. The S.E.C. moved to fix this last week, proposing rules to keep investors better informed, like making issuers put out financial reports and disclose troubles. "This vital constituency," said Arthur Levitt Jr., S.E.C. chairman, must "understand what they are buying."
 
Nice 'Tips' for Co-op Managers
Tenants in Manhattan co-ops and condominiums often wonder where their maintenance checks go, and last week they got an unpleasant clue: they discovered that about 10 percent of their money could be vanishing in thin air. After a three-year inquiry, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said managers have regularly taken payoffs from contractors for work in the buildings. It's become routine, investigators said, like tipping the doorman. But these were substantial tips, with some managers said to have gotten as much as $250,000 over five years. As if living in New York weren't expensive enough.
 
Get Your 3-Cent Stamps Ready
Yes, yes, you'd gotten used to 29-cent stamps and all the multiples -- 20 for $5.80, and so on. But look at it this way: the Postal Service let us have an extra year before making us reprogram our postal thinking. By early next year, when the 32-cent rate it proposed last week takes effect, it will have been four years, not the usual three, since the price last rose (from 25 to 29). And that's just a 10 percent rise, not 16. But brace yourself for weeks of fiddling with 3-cent "make-up" stamps to add to those 29's you keep finding, then having a bunch of 3's left over, useless clutter. Why can't they just take the 29's as trade-ins? Car dealers do it. No, too simple. They've got two billion make-up stamps waiting to torment us.

HEADLINE: The Games, Practice; the Money, Real

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Fla.

 BODY:
THE crack of the bat, the chatter of players lazily chasing fly balls in pregame practice, the clamor of fans straining for a glimpse of their favorite slugger -- all that remains the same. But in many other ways, Space Coast Stadium, the 7,500-seat preseason home of the Florida Marlins that opened here last weekend, deliberately breaks with the tradition of spring training as an idyllic anachronism in the big business of professional sports.
An outer-space motif, in keeping with the nearby Kennedy Space Center, includes an 80-foot rocket outside the stadium, twin gantries that bracket the main entrance and a scoreboard that launches a giant baseball after a Marlin home run -- all monuments to the marketing savvy of H. Wayne Huizenga, the entertainment magnate who owns Blockbuster Entertainment as well as the Marlins. The prices are also out of this world for a spring-training stadium: box seats go for $12, compared with $8 charged by the World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays for their best spring-training seats, and there are even luxury suites, for $25,000 apiece a year. 
 Add a generous 20-year lease from Brevard County and land donated for the stadium by a local developer. All this gives the Marlins, an expansion franchise entering its second season, a spring-training arrangement that is regarded with envy by many established clubs.
With envy, and with a desire to do likewise. The other 27 Major League teams, facing player salaries now averaging more than $1 million a year and broadcast revenues that are about to plummet under new cable and television contracts, are themselves moving to milk the 30-odd preseason games for every dollar they can.
Increasingly, for example, they are playing hardball with the towns in Florida and Arizona that covet the wintering tourists that baseball attracts. Playing one town against another, they are winning favorable deals for new stadiums where the amenities approach those of their regular-season parks.
Take the New York Yankees. Eager to get out of Fort Lauderdale Stadium, which the team considers too small and too far from the other teams, the Yankees have spent the last five years looking for a deal, leaving a trail of ill will in their wake. Tampa now appears to be the closest to winning the team, with a deal to build a $17.5 million, 10,000-seat stadium.
The teams are also raising ticket prices to levels double those of just six years ago. They are cutting deals that give their spring-training hosts no share of the money from concessions, parking and advertising in billboards and game programs -- an amount that typically exceeds revenue from ticket sales -- while saddling the towns with debt. They are planning to raise their broadcasting revenue by televising more preseason games. They are scheduling more preseason games in cities outside Florida and Arizona. And they are forming partnerships in real-estate and other business ventures unrelated to baseball.
"Spring training used to be something casual that teams did for six weeks at a fairly low cost, fun but no big deal," said Charles C. Euchner, author of "Playing the Field: Why Sports Teams Move and Cities Fight to Keep Them" and a professor of political science at Holy Cross. "But the astute, aggressive business people who now run the game realize that spring training is one of those things that, if treated like a real business, can be a nice side venture for you."
Not everyone is happy about the new approach. Lower-income fans like local retirees, low-paid workers and children -- the economic backbone of spring training for years -- are being priced out of the market. Their place is being taken by companies that buy seats for their employees and clients and by more affluent out-of-state visitors who regard a $12 box seat for a spring-training game as a bargain compared with regular-season prices. The Marlins have only raised the ante with the introduction of the luxury suites.
"The old-timey spring-training feeling is already gone from a lot of places," Mr. Euchner said. "Most people think of sports as a proletarian activity, but clearly in recent years it's been very consciously directed at an upscale, suburban audience. Joe Lunchbucket can't afford a suite, but a law firm can, so they become the market."
True, revenues from spring training would not even cover the salary of a Barry Bonds or a Bobby Bonilla. Spring training generates only about 2 percent of a team's total revenues, according to Roger Noll, a professor of economics at Stanford University who wrote the book "Government and the Sports Business."
But increasingly the team owners recognize that they can do a lot better in the preseason and are shopping themselves around to Sun Belt communities until they find an attractive bidder.
Executives at many clubs think the Florida Marlins negotiated an ideal deal here in Melbourne, a city of 65,000 halfway up Florida's east coast. The Marlins' 20-year lease gives the team all the revenues generated by ticket sales, concessions, parking and paid advertising at Space Coast Stadium as well as the money from the 11 luxury suites. Brevard County owns the stadium, freeing the Marlins from possible tax obligations.
What is more, the team got the land on which the ballpark is built for nothing. Space Coast Stadium is part of a 65-acre parcel, valued at more than $1 million on the open market, that was donated by the Viera Company, a Central Florida land development company that also installed the necessary roads and utilities. Viera saw the team as an attraction for a planned community that is eventually expected to have 100,000 residents. Similarly, the New York Mets moved from St. Petersburg to Port St. Lucie in 1988 at the behest of the Thomas J. White Development Corporation, which saw the team as an attraction for its planned community.
"We hope that when people are looking at a game, they are also looking at us as a place to buy a second house, retire, or relocate their businesses," said Perry J. Reader, chief operating officer of Viera. "In economic development, things are so competitive that you need every edge you can get."
The Marlins also have an option to be a joint-venture partner with Viera in the development of a shopping center, golf courses or housing on the land around the stadium.
Similarly, an owner of the Boston Red Sox, Haywood Sullivan, became a partner in a $20 million condominium complex going up near the team's new stadium in Fort Myers. (He has since sold his interest in the team). And the Atlanta Braves, which are owned by Ted Turner, are negotiating with Palm Beach County for a new stadium in Jupiter that would be part of a planned community in which the team might also get a stake.
Built for $6.2 million, Space Coast Stadium will be used during the regular season by a minor league team owned by the Marlins. The Marlins also have the right to use the stadium for concerts and other events. The stadium is but a small part of Mr. Huizenga's entertainment empire, which also comprises Blockbuster Video, the Sound Warehouse and Music Plus record-store chains, film and television production companies, the Miami Dolphins football team, the Florida Panthers hockey team and Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami.
BREVARD COUNTY wanted the Marlins for the tourist dollars the team would attract, and county officials like the deal they got. The Marlins agreed to pick up the cost of operating and maintaining the ballpark, and to build their permanent minor league complex next door.
To be sure, "we don't get a cent" of the money the Marlins generate at the stadium, Tom Jenkins, the county administrator, acknowledged. "But we don't have to operate the stadium or subsidize it either." Total debt service on the park amounts to about $650,000 a year, but Mr. Jenkins said the costs of building Space Coast Stadium have "no direct fiscal impact on local residents" because construction was financed by adding a penny to the tax on hotel rooms.
 
The Yankees' Search
 The Yankees, despite their status as the most valuable franchise in baseball, have found the search for a new home difficult. An early candidate was Pasco County, just north of Tampa. After offering the team 100 acres of free land at either of two sites adjacent to Interstate 75, plus a generous financial incentives package and a pledge to build a $15 million stadium, county officials extracted what they describe as an oral commitment from the team to relocate there. But then, for reasons the county administrator, John J. Gallagher, says he still doesn't understand, Yankee management had a change of heart late in 1992 and backed out.
"It left a bitter taste in everybody's mouth when they broke their word," he said. "I learned that with these people, a deal is not done until it's done, and even then it's not done."
But Joseph Molloy, the Yankees' general partner, said there was no deal. "We had a conceptual idea that we needed to finalize," one that the Yankees' lawyers deemed unsatisfactory because of doubts about the county's ability to meet its financial commitments, he said.
THE Yankees soon made it clear that they were seeking a grander and more elaborate deal in Kissimmee, just south of Orlando. The team approached the Osceola County board with a proposal to build both a 12,000-seat stadium and a 30,000-seat concert amphitheater that would be run by the Nederlander Organization, a minority partner in the team. The project would have cost about $50 million, with the bulk of the cost to be borne by local government.
Osceola County passed on the idea. "The economics simply weren't there," said Bill Goaziou, the county manager. "In 30 days you don't get enough out of spring training to pay the interest on a $50 million project."
Of course, it didn't hurt that Drayton McLane, owner of both the Houston Astros, a team that already trains in Kissimmee, and a food-service company that does a lot of business locally, was irritated by the Yankees' gambit. "We weren't pleased with the idea of another team moving into our market," said Tim Bawmann, the Astros' director of Florida operations. "We have invested millions of dollars in Osceola County, and for them to bring the Yankees in would have done nothing but hurt our ability to survive in this market."
Mr. Molloy, the son-in-law of the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, said that the "backroom politics" of "a good-old-boy network" contributed to the failure of the proposal. Asked whether he included Mr. McLane in that group, he replied: "No comment."
Rebuffed, the Yankees then looked north across the county line, to Orlando. But to officials there, the Nederlander amphitheater proposal was a deal breaker. "They said, 'Give us the land, we'll put up the facility and keep all the revenues, and you can build the road,' " said Bob Haven, the Orlando city administrator. "It would have walked events straight out of our arena, and besides, we just weren't interested in subsidizing their operation."
Tampa, where Mr. Steinbrenner has long lived and operated his shipbuilding company, had always been in the running. But when Mr. Steinbrenner returned to baseball last spring after a three-year suspension, the city quickly moved to the top of the team's list. Tampa, which has had no spring-training team since the Cincinnati Reds left in 1988, has offered not only to build a 10,000-seat stadium but also to relinquish all revenues from concessions and parking at the Yankees' games.
But the Tampa deal hinges on the city's ability to put together a complicated real estate swap that, because it involves state land, must be approved by the governor and his cabinet. If the issue is not resolved by April 15, either side can walk away from the deal.
 
Others on the Move
 The Yankees are only one of many teams to want more than they have. Over the last decade, half of the 20 teams that play in Florida's Grapefruit League have moved to new towns. The Boston Red Sox, for instance, jumped last year from Winter Haven and its old 4,500-seat park to a vastly more profitable deal at a new 6,800-seat stadium, expandable to 10,000 seats, in downtown Fort Myers. Several teams, including the Baltimore Orioles and Atlanta Braves, are searching for new homes.
In Arizona, where the eight-team Cactus League plays, the situation is similar. The departure of the Cleveland Indians to Florida after the 1992 season and lucrative offers made to the Chicago Cubs, historically the biggest draw in Arizona, came as a wake-up call, said Joe Garagiola Jr., a Phoenix lawyer who is chairman of the Arizona Baseball Commission. The state has responded by imposing a $2.50 surcharge on car rentals in counties where Major League teams train and using that money to improve existing ballparks or build new ones, like the $30 million complex in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria that opened this month and is shared by the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners.
"As teams here have seen the new facilities in Florida and what the teams there have, they have told us they need something similar," Mr. Garagiola, son of the well-known sports announcer, said. While no team has threatened to move, he added, "they don't need to say that" to make the message clear.
TEAMS are also generating more revenue by taking their spring-training show to cities outside the traditional circuit, where they can charge prices close to those of the regular season and fill big stadiums. This weekend, for instance, the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves, rivals in the 1992 World Series, flew to Toronto for a two-game set at the Skydome, the Blue Jays' regular season home, that is expected to draw 80,000 fans. The Braves, Orioles, Indians, Marlins, Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers are also scheduled to play exhibition games at their regular-season parks, and other teams will play in Vancouver, New Orleans and Washington.
Because cities in Florida and Arizona are eager to reap the prestige and the perceived economic benefits that come from having a Major League team as a tenant, most stadium rents are quite low: the 30-year deal that the Yankees have tentatively negotiated with Tampa calls for them to pay only $75,000 a year for the first five years, for instance.
Smaller towns in particular seem willing to make concessions. Studies prepared for the Florida Commerce Department and the Arizona Baseball Commission estimated that the six-week season triggers more than $600 million in spending in the two states, most of it in small Florida towns looking to baseball to attract visitors who would normally go only to Orlando or Miami.
"If you look at the trend of spring training over the last 10 years, the teams have gone out of big cities to smaller towns where they function like an anchor in a shopping mall," said Rick Nafe, executive director of the Tampa Sports Authority. "Miami, Orlando and Tampa all let teams go, because they couldn't match the offers of smaller communities for whom spring training is their only tie to professional sports."
 
 
 
IS SPRING TRAINING PROFITABLE?
 DO Major League teams make or lose money on spring training? That's a matter of debate.
The teams themselves say they make no money from the preseason games. "There are no profits in spring training," said John Schuerholz, general manager of the Atlanta Braves. Referring to the new kinds of deals being struck by teams, he added: "You have to have these new deals just to minimize your losses. The function of spring training is to try to bring in as much money as you can so that you limit what you lose."
That claim cannot be verified because the 28 Major League teams historically do not make their income statements public and each uses slightly different accounting methods. But many independent analysts disagree with Mr. Schuerholz. "I think the teams are probably making a lot of money because there is quite a bit of money to be made," said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College and the author of "Baseball and Billions: A Probing Look Inside the Big Business of Our National Pastime." "You are selling out most games at ever higher ticket prices, you're getting a healthy chunk of concessions, advertising and parking, and your player salary expenses are virtually nonexistent" because players generally do not receive extra pay for preseason games.
Indeed, a team's revenues during spring training can exceed $2.5 million, depending on the size of the park and the contract each team has with its host city. By contrast, the average operating cost of spring training per team in 1991 was a mere $750,000, according to a study commissioned by the Florida Commerce Department.
 
 
 
YOU'LL NEED A SCORECARD AND A MAP
 Many baseball teams are on the move in Florida, seeking better deals for spring-training stadiums.
 
BALTIMORE ORIOLES: Left Miami in 1990; still searching for greener pastures. Perched first in Sarasota and Bradenton, now in St. Petersburg, sharing quarters with the St. Louis Cardinals.
 
 BOSTON RED SOX: Felt Chain O'Lakes Park in Winter Haven was too small and too old and moved last year to a new stadium in Fort Myers, built at a cost of $22 million to the team's specification.
 
 CINCINNATI REDS: Wanted a better park and a more secure lease than in Tampa, which might have evicted the team for a Major League franchise. But did not want to lose convenience of being part of an eight-team cluster in the Tampa Bay area. Solution: a 1988 move to Plant City, 25 miles to the east.
 
 CLEVELAND INDIANS: Leaving Arizona, planned to move last year to a bigger, newer park in Homestead, Fla., to be closer to the Midwest fan base. But Hurricane Andrew forced the team to Central Florida for a stay that turned out to be permanent when Winter Haven trumped Homestead's offer, and the Indians invoked an "act of God" clause.
 
 FLORIDA MARLINS: Expansion team moved this month to a new stadium in Melbourne.
 
 HOUSTON ASTROS: Left old park in the Cape Canaveral area in 1985 for a new stadium in Kissimmee, near Disney World. Staved off an attempt by the Yankees to invade their turf.
 
 KANSAS CITY ROYALS: Left Fort Myers for Haines City, south of Orlando, in 1988, after Fort Myers officials refused to spend $2 million to upgrade the stadium. Hoped to benefit in the new location from an association with the adjacent Boardwalk and Baseball theme park, but the project fizzled, and the team is said to be looking for a new home.
 
 MINNESOTA TWINS: Left Orlando in 1990 when the city felt their demands had become exorbitant. Found a home in Fort Myers, which was smarting from the departure of the Royals and was willing to spend $18 million to build a stadium.
 
 NEW YORK METS: Tired of playing second fiddle to the Cardinals in St. Petersburg, jumped in 1988 to a new park and a sweetheart of a deal on Florida's Atlantic Coast, setting up shop near the winter home of the owner, Nelson Doubleday, and reinvigorating a rivalry with the Dodgers. In the process, pioneered the now-popular idea of using a baseball team as an anchor of a real estate development and persuaded many New Yorkers to buy retirement or second homes in the area.
 
 NEW YORK YANKEES: Eager to leave Fort Lauderdale, complaining stadium complex is too small. Team has a tentative agreement to move to Tampa, which happens to be where the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, lives and works.
 
 TEXAS RANGERS: Triggered the recent exodus of teams from South Florida by leaving Pompano Beach for Port Charlotte on the Gulf Coast in 1987. Move to fastest-growing county in Florida allowed team to move from under the shadow of the more popular Yankees and Orioles, which themselves later abandoned the Miami area themselves.

HEADLINE: On Reducing Employees' Trips

 BODY:
This is in response to a letter to the New Jersey editor on Feb. 20, regarding the article "New Rules Nudging Companies to Reduce Employee Commuting."
The letter states that drivers who "putt along in line" (drive at 55 m.p.h.) will cause accidents by crossing from the High Occupancy Vehicle (H.O.V.) lane through lanes of speeders to an exit lane, and, further, that increasing the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. would improve traffic flow, fuel economy and safety. 
 Traffic flow is improved if all vehicles travel at the speed limit, but if you are a good driver and allow a safe stopping distance between vehicles, there will be fewer cars on any given part of the highway as the speed limit is increased. Air resistance reduces fuel economy drastically at high speeds, which is why the 55 m.p.h speed limit was introduced in the first place.
Safety is of primary concern, since accidents not only destroy lives and cost billions of dollars, but also are a major cause of fuel waste and pollution when miles of traffic sit and wait to get by the scene.
Don't get rid of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit; enforce it! While patrolling the H.O.V. lane, the police could issue summonses (with serious point value) to anyone observed passing a vehicle traveling at the speed limit.
If you eliminate this passing, you eliminate the excuse everyone uses for speeding. Under these conditions, changing lanes from left to right will still be difficult, but could be done safely using care and courtesy.

HEADLINE: A Little Postal Perspective, Please

BYLINE: By BARTH HEALEY 

 BODY:
When the cost of mailing a letter rises next spring to 32 cents, as it almost certainly will, postal rates will finally get back to where they were in 1799. That's right, 195 years ago. The increase was proposed on Tuesday by the governors of the United States Postal Service, and was welcomed by all the important lobbying groups that influence rate changes.
 In 1799, when rates varied according to distance, it cost 31 cents to send a letter from Boston to Savannah, for example. And that was real money -- the same price as a pitchfork, a bundle of quill pens or three or four shots of rum in a tavern, according to historians at Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Mass. 
 The rates had been much higher before establishment of a common currency in the United States. And they rose later, in 1815, when a Boston-to-Savannah letter cost 43 1/2 cents. But as delivery became more efficient, prices tumbled.
 In 1847, when the United States first issued stamps, there were two rates: 5 cents for delivery within 300 miles and 10 cents beyond. (Before stamps, and for many years thereafter, postmasters just wrote the amount paid on the envelope.)
 Then, in 1863, a uniform nationwide delivery charge was set at 3 cents, not to rise again for 95 years, surely a record for holding the line on costs. Indeed, the rate fell further, to 2 cents in 1883. Ther was a 1-cent "war tax" on letters in 1917-19 to help support American troops in World War I, but the basic rate stayed at 2 cents until 1932. BARTH HEALEY

GRAPHIC: Photos: 1756 -- First handstamp in the United States, used between New York and Falmouth, England; 1815 -- Example of postal charge written on envelope by a postmaster (25 1/2 cents for 150 to 300 miles); 1847 -- First U.S. paper stamp; 1919 -- Allied victory stamp; 1973 -- First "Love" stamp.
 
Graph tracks the cost to mail a basic letter since 1799. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
 A letter used to be a large financial commitment: 31 cents in 1799 was about half a day's wage; 5 cents in 1847 represented 20 minutes' work. Prices became more reasonable in this century: 1919's 3 cent stamp was worth about 3 minutes' work for the average American; 8 cents in 1973 was less than 2 minutes' worth of work. If a first-class stamp goes to 32 cents next year, it will still be the equivalent of less than two minutes' worth of work.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Decade of Disillusionment in Grenada

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada

 BODY:
NEARLY a decade before the United States began grappling indecisively with what peacekeeping or peacemaking roles it might undertake in the post-cold war world, there was Grenada.
Small and close to home, Grenada was not Somalia or Bosnia. People were not starving or being shelled. But there was political turmoil. An authoritarian and unelected leftist government under Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who was respected by Grenadans but demonized by the Reagan Administration, was under attack from more radical hard-liners within its own camp backed by the Cubans and Russians. 
 The hard-liners were responsible for the massacre of Mr. Bishop and scores of his supporters on Oct. 19, 1983. Less than a week later, American troops came ashore. Grenadans, shocked by the carnage that consumed what they call The Revolution, welcomed the Americans. Order was restored at little cost to the United States. Mr. Bishop's killers, led by his deputy, Bernard Coard, were imprisoned. The Yankees went home.
What followed illustrates the limits of a peacemaker's role in rebuilding a nation, even a relatively advanced one, where there is a history of parliamentary democracy, an atmosphere of old-fashioned civility, fertile soil, clean drinking water and no slums.
Grenada and its 95,000 people are in political and economic stagnation, by most accounts. Distrust persists between the majority of African descent and the mixed-race or lighter-skinned intellectual and business elite. Aid from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Taiwan and Japan has not appreciably altered living standards. In short, democratic Grenada has not taken off, except for growth in tourism. Young people are resentful and restless.
"I think that about 40 percent of the people in this country have lost all confidence in politics and politicians," said Randolph Mark, a retired civil servant and amateur historian who a decade ago was part of an interim government responsible for putting Grenada back together again.
 
Wanting to Look Back
 Partly in despair, partly from a need for reconciliation and healing after the disruption of the revolutionary years, Grenadans often seem to look backward for solutions.
All around Grenada there are signs that a virtual cult has grown up around the Bishop legend, though this has not translated into political power. The Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement has been unable to get more than about 4 percent of votes in national elections. Nevertheless, the new road to the largely Cuban-built airport that so mesmerized the Reagan Administration, which saw it as a potential Soviet-bloc base, is about to be named the Maurice Bishop Highway. (All former prime ministers qualify to have a road named after them.) At the National Museum, young men stand before and sometimes salute Mr. Bishop's photograph in a small corner display devoted to his era.
Alban Daniel, a freelance tour leader, was a teen-ager in the revolution. He remembers how the Cuban-trained militia came for him because he refused to join the army after finishing high school. "They put a gun at each ear, and one pointed up my nose, and I enlisted," he said. "But I got to see the good things in the army. The Cubans taught us a lot. They gave us training and jobs. And in the revolution if you took cocaine you were shot, no trial, no nothing. Drug-taking stopped. Now it's back all over."
Alister Hughes, a writer and publisher of an independent newsletter who was perennially harassed and finally jailed by the left-wing government, says that many young people live on the Bishop legend "because they were somebody in that period." In the swagger that came with a new uniform and a gun or the pride taken in a Cuban higher education, self-esteem rose in a generation with few other outlets. For their parents, a national insurance plan and make-work programs helped cushion a hard life.
Mr. Hughes remembers the shouts of the young people, many no more than schoolchildren, who helped rescue Mr. Bishop from house arrest. As the youths marched through the town, they chanted proudly that they had saved their leader. But hours later, he was recaptured and put to death.
That generation, now disillusioned and leaderless, faces an unemployment rate over 30 percent and as high as 50 percent for the better-educated.
More astonishing to a visitor returning after 10 years is the resurgent political strength of Sir Eric Gairy, who dominated public life from independence in 1974 to the 1979 Bishop-led coup that overthrew his government. As Prime Minister, Sir Eric communed with extraterrestrials and enforced his earthly will through a villainous armed squad known as the Mongoose Gang. His record won converts to Mr. Bishop's radicalizing vision. Now nearly blind and in his 70's, Sir Eric is expected to be a force in the election that the present Prime Minister, Nicholas Braithwaite, must call in the next 12 months. It will be the third democratic election since 1984.
Both Mr. Mark, now a farmer near Grenville, on Grenada'a Atlantic coast, and Mr. Hughes, in his study overflowing with books and papers on a hillside above St. George's' sheltered Caribbean lagoons, suggest that the fascination with the recent past reflects a still unfulfilled Grenadan yearning for identity and purpose. Mr. Hughes has long argued that islands like this, with African, European, Asian and Arawak or Carib Indian influences, should consciously strive to create a distinctive regional culture he calls "Westindian," spelled as one word.
Mr. Mark says that Grenadans need to get to know themselves better first. He pleads for more attention to the collective histories of a people who passed from slavery to plantation drudgery to independence with scant sense of their own worth or ability to set their own priorities. In that atmosphere, a kind of national attitude of dependency, ideological or economic, can persist.
"Generations have come, and generations have gone, and there's no single record of a life story," he said as he brought out a typescript of an unpublished autobiography, "Sixty Years of Struggle to Survive." The story of Mr. Mark's life, begun as a child laborer in the plantations, would resonate widely in the West Indies. "My mother bought our first house for $6," he said. "It was made of swordfish boxes and galvanized metal. It was so small we six couldn't all be in it at the same time."
Mr. Mark, who became an M.B.E. (Member of the British Empire)in 1985, sees a fundamental need for a closer relationship between islanders and the fertile land that could support them, even when export crops like nutmegs and bananas have taken a price battering. But to return to the land means confronting an older, more painful legacy. "The stigma of our past history of slavery is still with us," he said. "Work in agricultural labor is linked to that."
Meanwhile, in the streets where jobless young men hang out, a common reply to the greeting, "How goes it?" is, "Day pon try," which in the local patois means roughly, "I'm still trying." Ten years after the Americans left, the phrase has special meaning.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
West's Fears In Bosnia: 1) Chaos 2) Islam

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

 BODY:
LATE last year, the peace negotiator Lord Owen addressed an issue that has seldom been openly discussed but has rarely been far from European politicians' minds during the Bosnian war. "The European Union," he said, "has no reason to be suspicious or to fear a new Muslim state emerging within Europe. For Europe over the centuries has been enriched by Islam."
The sense of that enrichment, evident from Cordoba in Spain to Sarajevo, has, however, been dimmed by more pressing concerns. Rising Islamic militancy in neighboring Algeria, a steady flow of Muslim immigrants across the Mediterranean from North Africa and explosive racial tensions in cities short of jobs have produced a thinly veiled anxiety in Western Europe over the potential radicalization of a Muslim-led Bosnia. 
 This anxiety, like some ghost of ancient fears of the Terrible Turk against whom Europeans fought for centuries, has been an unspoken subtext throughout the talks on how to end the Bosnian war. For all the horror over the "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims from land that Serbs covet, Europeans have never been ready to fight to preserve a Bosnian state led by Muslims.
"What many in my party fear is the emergence of a kind of Gaza strip in the midst of the Balkans," said Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist member of the French Parliament. "There's a widespread view that an isolated Muslim entity would not be viable, and that a drift to radical Islamic politics would follow."
Mr. Lellouche spoke after returning from a hectic overnight stay in his constituency in the Paris area, Garges-les-Gonesse, which he described as "Beirut." A night-long riot, involving the burning of more than 20 cars and the destruction of several buildings including a synagogue, shook the area last week following the murder of a 16-year-old Vietnamese boy. When a police sweep followed, hundreds of youths took to the streets in what Mr. Lellouche called "a kind of Parisian intifada."
"Any pretext is good for a riot," the deputy added. "Thirty-eight percent of the people in Garges are either unemployed or on minimum welfare. In this context, what panics us in France is the vision of hundreds of thousands of Algerians fleeing a fundamentalist regime. We wouldn't know where to put them and we wouldn't know how to employ them."
Viewed from the United States, rioting in Paris suburbs and the savage Algerian war between Muslim fundamentalists and the military-backed Government may appear to have little or nothing to do with the plight of the generally secular Slavic Muslims of Bosnia.
But in an anxious, recession-hit continent just across the Mediterranean from an Algerian conflict that has claimed 2,000 lives in two years, the issues have tended to coalesce. Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, has even referred to "les odeurs d'Islam" -- "the whiff of Islam" -- permeating the French urban landscape.
"The Germans, British and French have consistently shared some concern about a Muslim state in Europe," said a State Department official. "I think they feel somewhat reassured by recent developments."
The official is referring to the United States-brokered agreement between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats to set up a federation of semi-autonomous cantons and eventually join this to Croatia in a loose confederation. Because this arrangement is bi-national, "it finesses some of the European concerns," said Marty Sletzinger, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee staff.
Important questions remain, however. To what extent have the Serbian and then Croatian campaigns of "ethnic cleansing" against the Muslims during almost two years of war radicalized a population that initially identified only slightly, if at all, with Islam? Has the West, by its passivity during the conflict, encouraged precisely the move toward Muslim militancy that it proclaimed to fear? And to what extent has President Alija Izetbegovic's Muslim-based Party of Democratic Action became divided between hard-liners now favoring something close to an Islamic state and others still committed to a secular, multi-ethnic society in Bosnia?
The fact that some drift toward Islamic militancy has occurred in Bosnia, particularly outside Sarajevo, seems clear. After all, whatever arms and money have reached the Muslim-led government forces have tended to come from Muslim countries.
In the area around Travnik in central Bosnia, the scene of bitter fighting last year and the base for many of the Muslim dispossessed driven out of northern and eastern Bosnia by the Serbs, there have been persistent reports of new regulations imposing the use of the veil on women, and resort to Islamic indoctrination in some schools and army brigades. This is also the area where the United Nations has identified several hundred soldiers believed to be from Iran and Afghanistan, who have often shown a particular brutality, as in the recent killing near Vitez of a British aid worker.
 
A Trend Without Depth
 However, the trend appears to be superficial. "These people are Bosnians and Europeans, but the more the fighting goes on, the more the roots of fundamentalism will dig in with a Farrakhan-like indoctrination imported from the outside," said John R. Lampe, director of East European studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center. "My view is that the fundamentalism in Bosnia remains thin and if there's a settlement, it would fade."
Dominique Moisi, the deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations, was less optimistic. "By doing nothing, we have created a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said. "In desperation, the Bosnians have been pushed toward a more radical Islam. The trend is strong and all hope of a multiethnic Bosnian society has been smashed."
The Clinton Administration now hopes to revive the multi-ethnic dream by extending the Muslim-Croat federation to embrace the Serbs. But the Serbs, who control 70 percent of the territory, have fought to be separate and are unlikely to be drawn in. This impasse in turn appears likely to test the divisions within Mr. Izetbegovic's government and army.
Hard-liners, like Vice President Erup Ganic and some of the army commanders in central Bosnia, would certainly oppose letting the Serbs secede, even if they first gave back wide tracts of land. They argue that Muslims have been fighting, above all, for the right to return to all towns seized by the Serbs. But Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic would probably be more ready to compromise in the interest of peace.
Such divisions mirror emergent splits in Bosnian society between secular Europeans and others whom persecution has now driven toward a vision of Islamic society. The faster the war ends, the less likely these splits are to go wider, both within Bosnia and in Europe as a whole. "There is a European interest in having a state in the heart of the continent where Muslims and non-Muslims live together," said a senior White House official. "For concerned Arab countries elsewhere in the world, that would be a powerful symbol."

HEADLINE: A Winter of Disaster Leaves the Bills to Prove It

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
It wasn't a hurricane or an earthquake, but the winter of 1993-94, which is now entering its final full calendar week, has become a disaster of its own sort, leaving a trail of damage, hardship and bitter memories whose effects will be felt for years in the eastern half of the United States.
Spread over three months, the winter has ebbed and flowed, striking with fury one day, only to give way to days of sunshine. Seemingly relentless, the series of 16 snow and ice storms that have battered the East and Southeast are an unconventional disaster, but one that nonetheless ranks among the worst to have hit the country in recent years. 
 Insurers estimate that they will eventually pay over $1 billion for damage caused by the storms, ranking it above the $900 million for the fires in California last October and the $775 million for the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
 
Benefits for Some
 Yet some businesses, whose products and services thrive in harsh weather, have experienced a boom, while still others, which suffered short-term losses from the frigid weather, expect that demand will prove elastic over time, snapping back as the weather becomes more moderate.
John Skorberg, an economist for the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the cold spell had actually turned out to be positive for some parts of the local economy. "The retailers who sell clothing, batteries and utilities did better than anticipated," he said. "But malls and small retailers who had to rely on foot traffic were hurt."
The meteorological pattern of this winter's storms has been unconventional, experts say.
While the National Weather Service has recorded at least 18 all-time low temperatures, including 21 degrees below zero in Detroit on Jan. 19 and a minus 50 in Amasa, Mich., on Jan. 18, this winter, over all, will not make the record books when it officially ends at 3:28 P.M. on March 20.
"Astronomically, it's the end of winter, but meteorologically, not really," said Joe Venuti, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. "It's not safe to say we've seen the end of snow."
Indeed, a storm blew east across northern New Mexico yesterday, dropping eight inches of snow on the mountains, Mr. Venuti said; it could reach the southeastern states later this week.
Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center in Washington, said: "We've seen some of the coldest air that has ever invaded this part of the world. But then you go and look at the averages, and it's cold but nothing unbelievable."
Much the same applies to moisture. Snowfall records were set in several places around the country, like Boston, which recorded a season total of 89.5 inches. While New York City has so far had a season total of 50.3 inches -- the most in 16 years -- that is still far below the record 63.2 inches that fell in the winter of 1947-48. In many other areas, like the Great Lakes region, which has so far had its 25th driest winter in a century, combined rainfall and snowfall is actually below normal.
Taken in total, the storms have gradually exacted an enormous toll that mounted in small and large ways, from the addition of 14 minutes a day for Philadelphia high school students because of snow closures to the temporary loss of power to 1.5 million Pennsylvanians after a January ice storm.
Philadelphia spent $1 million to demolish 209 buildings, most of them unoccupied, that had become safety hazards as a result of storm damage. In New York, the city lost about $6.5 million in parking fines because of the snow. In Mississippi, pecan orchards throughout much of the Delta were devastated by an ice storm. Crop losses there could be as much as $7 million a year for the next five years, said Freddie Rasberry, a horticulturist at Mississippi State University.
 
Sizable Loss
 For many business owners, the days of lost work and dampened sales have built into a sizable loss that some may never recover. "It's been a nightmare," said Gregory M. LoVece, a 40-year-old clam harvester from Blue Point, L.I., who was only able to gather a quarter of his usual harvest. "Our men are running to Florida, the Carolinas, anywhere there is money to be made. You can't work here because the weather conditions are too adverse."
Municipal governments have scrambled to deal with budgets drained by snow-removal costs, and throughout the freeze zone an oppressive sense of desperation has mounted throughout the winter's prolonged assault.
Unlike disasters whose damage is measured in buildings and homes destroyed, most of this winter's damage is in the form of small claims -- broken pipes, damaged roofs and fender benders. "A lot of homes have sustained a little bit of damage, but the cumulative effect is huge," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the New York-based Insurance Information Institute.
 
113 Deaths
 The economic loss from days of canceled work and diminished sales has accumulated over the past three months, and some economists believe it may ultimately exceed the $12 billion to $30 billion wrought by the Los Angeles earthquake two months ago.
At least 113 deaths were linked to the winter weather -- mostly car accidents and heart attacks from shoveling -- surpassing the combined total of last year's Midwestern floods, in which 48 people died, and Hurricane Andrew, in which 56 died two years ago.
Even for regions accustomed to ice and cold, this winter's freezing temperatures were stunning.
In the tiny New Hampshire town of Stewartstown, just a few miles south of the Canadian border, the temperature dropped so low late last month that sections of the town's water pipes froze, effectively cutting the supply to many homes, businesses and municipal buildings, like the grammar school.
 
Spring Around the Corner
 "They say spring is just around the corner, although no one is saying just how long that corner is," said the town's Water Commissioner, Robert Burns, who figured that much of the underground piping could remain frozen solid until late spring.
In Pennsylvania, state officials had to borrow four ice breakers from the Coast Guard to get fuel oil to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after the Delaware River froze.
One of the hardest-hit areas was a swathe of southern states struck by a two-day ice storm that began on Feb. 9 and destroyed crops, snapped power lines and left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity.
In Mississippi, total damage to public facilities exceeded $1.3 billion, and 26 counties were declared Federal disaster areas. Ed Jussely, a spokesman for the Mississippi Power and Light Company, said 4,111 miles of power lines had been knocked down by the weight of ice. The cost of repairs could be as high as $100 million, which the company will try to recoup by asking the state to approve a rate increase. "The damage was the same as if it were a hurricane," Mr. Jussely said.
Economic losses throughout the freeze zone were replayed in widely varying ways, from what the Long Island clammers' called a "total washout" to Weight Watchers International Inc. of Jericho, N.Y., which lost 10 percent to 20 percent of its usual customers this winter because they could not reach the company's offices. "A third of our volume is done in the winter season -- it's New Year's resolution time," said a company spokeswoman, Linda Webb Carilli. "We're hoping for a blockbuster spring."
 
Some Manufacturers Humbled
 Some of the biggest manufacturing plants in the country were humbled by the ferocity of the storms, though shutdowns were mostly short.
Roger Lambert, manager of corporate communications for Honda of America's plant in Marysville, Ohio, said production was slowed when workers were unable to reach the plant and the temperature became too low to paint cars in January. The plant, which employs 10,000 workers, lost four work shifts, but eventually made most of that up by adding Saturday shifts.
Many businesses, particularly those associated with snow removal, reaped a windfall from the weather.
John Kiley, owner of Atlantic Atlantic Plow Blade of Hyde Park, Mass., which makes the cutting edges of snow plows, said: "This is our best year ever. I have three salesmen who do a snow dance every morning and pray for snow every night."
At the Chicago-based Cotter and Company, the distribution arm of the nation's 6,500 True Value hardware stores, sales of windshield-washer fluid increased ninefold over last winter, to 450,000 from 50,000, and sales of ice-melting chemicals and rock salt soared, as well. "Sales of birdseed were up 70 percent, too," said a company spokesman, Alex Goff.
Gary Rejebian, speaking for the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, which has 23,000 store members, said: "For the week that the snow hit, sales were down. But over all, retailers have been doing fairly well. Hardware, home-building and lumber were up in February between 5 and 10 percent; shoe sales were up 5 percent."
Communities like Trenton received an unusual bonus when the freezing temperatures were too low for many criminals. Lieut. Joseph Dolina of the Trenton Police said assaults dropped to 204 last month from 239 in February 1993, complaints of drug deals on the street and other drug violations plunged to 206 from 459, and there were no murders, as compared to 2 in February 1993. "Our crime stats did go down due to the cold weather," he said. "People weren't out on the streets."
But the news in most cities was more about busted budgets than busting criminals. The biggest costs fell on communities and government agencies that had to clear roads, repair utilities and fill millions of potholes.
As budgets drained, resources had to be shifted, setting off a fiscal domino effect in many communities that will continue for months and even years.
The city of Manchester, N.H., spent double what it had budgeted for snow removal, getting the money from a citywide recycling project. Now the roads are riddled with potholes, putting off other, scheduled road repairs. "We're going to be paying for all this way past winter," said Tamara Carson, the administrative assistant to the mayor of Manchester.
 
Frigid Pennsylvania
 In central Pennsylvania, State College has had a record 101.7 inches of snow, breaking the record of 98.2 inches. Harrisburg, the state capital, has had 69.7 inches, breaking the record of 60.6 inches set in winter of 1969-70. The city also recorded its lowest temperature in January -- 22 degrees below zero. John Comey of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency said the state has exceeded its entire winter budget for snow removal by $30 million to $40 million.
Jim Eberwine, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Philadelphia, said: "In other years, we would often get a big snowstorm, but after 12 hours or so we'd dig ourselves out." Gov. Robert P. Casey asked the Federal Government to declare the state's 67 counties disaster areas.
But spring and warmer weather may not end the trauma. Some Midwestern cities and communities face the possibility of renewed flooding from the spring thaw and rains.

HEADLINE: CHINA REJECTS CALL FROM CHRISTOPHER FOR RIGHTS GAINS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Mar. 12

 BODY:
Chinese officials today flatly rejected Secretary of State Warren Christopher's demand that Beijing improve its human rights performance and warned that stripping China of its trade privileges would backfire.
In a day punctuated by harsh and often acrimonious exchanges, the Chinese also accused the United States of breaking Chinese law by meeting secretly with a leading dissident last month. 
 Mr. Christopher's first visit to China as Secretary of State, initially planned as the culmination of the Administration's six-month-long strategy of intensive high-level engagement with the Chinese, has instead reduced China's chances of winning renewal of trade privileges that expire in June.
 
Internal Affairs Cited
 This took place against a backdrop of heightened American demands for steady and substantive progress on human rights, and in large part they clashed with China's traditional resistance against being told what to do about its internal affairs and with the authorities' desire to maintain strict control as democracy advocates begin to become more assertive.
Mr. Christopher told Foreign Minister Qian Qichen this morning that China's actions toward its citizens, including the recent detention of a number of prominent dissidents, "suggest that China attaches relatively little weight to core human rights issues," the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, told reporters.
If that is so, the Secretary added, it "certainly bodes ill" for the chances of renewing the most-favored-nation trade status that gives China lower tariffs than those accorded to most American trading partners.
 
A Rancorous Exchange
 The exchange was so rancorous that as he said goodbye to Mr. Qian after four hours of meetings that extended through lunch, Mr. Christopher made no effort to hide his frustration, saying, "I wish the meeting had been as good as the lunch," Mr. McCurry reported.
In an afternoon meeting, Prime Minister Li Peng seemed to reverse China's earlier pledges this year to try to make progress on human rights.
"China will never accept the U.S. human rights concept," Mr. Li told Mr. Christopher, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin. "History has already proven that it is futile to apply pressure on China."
Mr. Christopher's aides have acknowledged that they are both shocked and bewildered by the Chinese decision to greet Mr. Christopher's arrival with a sweeping crackdown on dissidents instead of conciliatory gestures on human rights.
But at the same time, it was impossible to judge whether the sudden Chinese belligerency was a tactical rebuff to Mr. Christopher, who has been publicly scolding the Chinese for not making enough progress, or a tough, new overall attitude on human rights. Only a month ago, President Jiang Zemin told American Congressional leaders in very conciliatory tones that China would make an effort to respond to Mr. Clinton's demands.
In taking a tougher line than at any time since the Clinton Administration took office, the Chinese appear willing to gamble that Washington has too much to lose by revoking the trade privileges, a policy they see as driven by anti-China lawmakers in Congress. Both Mr. Qian and Mr. Li warned Mr. Christopher today that the United States would suffer more than China if its trade privileges were revoked.
 
Boast of Self-Sufficiency
 China is nearly self-sufficient economically, Mr. Li boasted, adding that if the United States were to revoke its trade status, "it means the United States would lose its share of the big Chinese market." He said Chinese imports were growing at a rate of 9 percent a year and would reach a trillion dollars by the turn of the century.
But Mr. Christopher, the highest Clinton Administration representative to visit China, told his hosts that reports in China that the United States had already decided to extend preferential trade privileges or would accept only modest improvements in human rights to extend them were "unambiguously wrong," Mr. McCurry quoted Mr. Christopher as saying.
In an extraordinary allegation that prompted a strong response from Mr. Christopher and his aides, the Chinese accused John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, of breaking Chinese law by meeting late last month with Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, whom Mr. Wu described to reporters as "a criminal on parole."
The official New China News Agency quoted Mr. Qian as telling Mr. Christopher, "A top U.S. Government official came to prepare for Christopher's visit, and in disregard of Chinese laws, the official took actions interfering in China's internal affairs."
 
U.S. Refuses Diplomatic Limits
 In reply, Mr. Christopher was quoted as saying the United States "cannot accept any limits on the ability of its diplomats to meet with foreign citizens."
Although Mr. Christopher chose not to speak publicly today about his first day of meetings, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, chastised his hosts. He told reporters that the Chinese assertion that the United States was poisoning the well in advance of Mr. Christopher's visit because of human rights was "really Alice in Wonderland," and "an extraordinary leap of chutzpah."
Mr. Lord, a former Ambassador to China, tried to put the best face on the trip, saying, "Let's hope the next couple of days are better."
But Mr. Christopher's aides conceded in private that any real progress would have to come after the meeting is over.
 
Two and a Half Months Left
 The Chinese still have two and a half months before the Administration must decide whether they have made enough progress in improving their human rights record to warrant annual renewal of their preferential trade privileges. And despite Mr. Christopher's threats to revoke China's trade privileges, the United States has no intention of abandoning its strategy of high-level diplomatic engagement, Mr. Lord told reporters.
Still, there is deep concern on the American side that China may do too little too late in meeting the requirements of a 1993 executive order linking extension of the trade benefits to China's progress on releasing political prisoners, ceasing the jamming of international broadcasts, carrying out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, protecting Tibet's cultural and religious heritage, permitting the right of emigration and opening Chinese prisons to international relief groups.
The executive order was the result of intensive consultations with Congress, which has pressed for deeper concessions from China on human rights.
In an unusual departure from Chinese hospitality and courtesy, Mr. Wu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged to reporters that the Chinese had suggested that Mr. Christopher postpone his trip because it coincided with the opening of the National People's Congress, but that when the Americans said they could not change their arrangements, "in the end we have accommodated the Secretary."

HEADLINE: Hope Starts to Bloom in the Motor City That No Longer Builds Many Cars

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 12

 BODY:
The economic ministers of seven nations convening here on Monday at the invitation of President Clinton will have a chance to see what Detroit residents have known for years: a strong recovery by the automotive industry no longer guarantees boom times for the Motor City.
In fact, only three automobile assembly plants are left in Detroit, where the public sector is the top employer. Second is the health care industry and the auto industry ranks third. 
 For 50 years, the auto makers have been moving plants into the suburbs, then across the nation and around the world. In the area within 40 miles of the city, factory jobs have steadily dropped in relation to total employment since 1952, to 22 percent in 1993 from 51 percent. But while the suburbs continue to boom with new service industry jobs, Detroit never found industries to compensate.
Now, under an energetic new Mayor, Detroit may be poised for a comeback that many local business leaders believe is possible. Their optimism is pervasive although specific solutions are in short supply.
 
Enthusiasm Returns
 "I'm not suggesting I know what the right answer is on how at this point you revitalize the city," said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation. Citing the willingness of the new Mayor to work with business, he said, "I'm more enthusiastic about the city of Detroit than I have been in the past 20 years."
To be sure, the auto makers are still a major economic force in Detroit, and their upturn this year probably accounts for a recent rise in city tax revenues, said David L. Littmann, senior economist for Comerica Bank. But their economic influence is much diminished from the past.
For instance, while the General Motors Corporation employed 26,000 workers in the city in 1984, Mr. Littmann said, it employed only 9,257 by 1990, the last year for which numbers were available. During the same period, jobs at Chrysler dropped from 13,242 to 8,636.
 
Sentimental Reasons
 Still, a strong sentimental tie connects the auto makers to the city they made famous, and they have donated millions to help build parks and maintain museums. Last month, in fact, the General Motors Corporation promised the city two new Cadillacs, one a limousine, principally for Mayor Dennis Archer.
But in that gift there was also a symbolic reminder of the auto companies' shrinking economic presence: The cars are being assembled in Arlington, Tex.
Mr. Archer insists that the city's economy has already diversified beyond the auto industry, and he is seeking out other businesses like the health care industry to continue the process.
But much remains to be done. "The city of Detroit is in need of a direct infusion of help," Mayor Archer said. He often cites a grim list of statistics, including the fact that almost one in every three residents lives below the poverty line, and among children, 46 percent live in poverty.
Nevertheless there are some bright spots for the auto industry, and consequently for the city.
 
Hiring at Chrysler
 The Chrysler Corporation recently announced that it was hiring a third shift for its assembly plant on the East Side, where the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles are produced. That decision could result in about 800 new jobs.
But Chrysler also announced in September that it would move its corporate headquarters and 4,500 jobs out of Highland Park, a city of 20,000 almost surrounded by Detroit. The company had previously said it would not leave.
G.M. is now the only auto maker with its headquarters in the city, employing 5,000 people. Ford's headquarters has been in Dearborn, about 15 miles west of the city, since the 1920's.
Despite the surge in car buying, the auto makers have been cautious about hiring. Douglas A. Fraser, a former president of the United Automobile Workers union who is a labor professor at Wayne State University, scoffed at the recent news that the Ford Motor Company planned to hire several hundred new workers at plants outside Detroit.
 
Jobs for Everyone
 "They used to hire that in a day," said Mr. Fraser, a Scottish immigrant who got his first auto job in a DeSoto plant on Detroit's West Side in 1936. "You went up to the employment office, and they felt you, and if you were warm, they hired you." Mr. Fraser has now put his renowned negotiating skills at the service of Mr. Archer, bargaining for wage concessions from the city's police and fire unions.
Detroit's population has paralleled the course of the industry. Between 1910 and 1930, as the automobile roared into the nation's culture, Detroit's population more than tripled, to 1.56 million. But by the early 1950's, the rapid growth of auto jobs peaked and so did the city's population, which had reached almost two million and has since fallen to about half that.
Even while auto making was still booming in Detroit, the very highway system that was part of the industry's success made it possible for workers to migrate away from the city and into the growing suburbs.
"We didn't realize it at the time, but when they built Hudson's Northland that was the death knell," said Norman McRae, a local historian, referring to a shopping mall that opened in the mid-50's a few miles north of the city.
Like many older Detroit residents, Mr. McRae, who is 68, worked in the auto plants in 1950, when they offered regular work at good pay for virtually anyone. He said that as late as the early 1950's, "a black guy or a poor white guy from Tennessee or an immigrant from Poland could come here, and he could get a job."
 
City Courts Business
 Now, Mr. Archer, in hopes of making the city more livable, is working to improve city services like garbage removal. The first new Mayor in 20 years, Mr. Archer is hoping to reduce the municipal budget deficit by cutting waste in purchasing and contracting.
And he is aggressively courting businesses, pointing out that Detroit residents, lacking stores in the city, spend more of their dollars in the suburbs. "This is a retailer's dream," he said.
Mr. Archer's efforts have caused some business leaders to predict a renaissance. "Whoever it is you talk to, bankers or businessmen or whoever, they see this city as turning around," said Art VanElslander, chairman and chief executive of a chain of Michigan furniture stores, Art Van Furniture.
Mr. VanElslander recently bought a hotel in downtown Detroit that has been run by a Federal agency since the savings and loan that owned it failed. Explaining his acquisition, he said, "I see the economy as very upbeat in Detroit, particularly with the new administration."
Some bankers are not so sanguine. "Nothing fundamental has changed, and people have to understand that," said Mr. Littmann of Comerica Bank, who is also president of the Heartland Institute of Michigan, a public policy group. Mr. Littmann said a principal problem was that Detroit's total tax burden is seven to eight times above average for a Michigan municipality. "That would be all right, if the services were commensurate in value with that, but they're not," he said.

HEADLINE: Accord Will Allow U.S. Cellular Phones in Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Clearing away one of several trade disputes that have roiled relations between the United States and Japan in the last month, President Clinton today announced a detailed agreement to expand American access to the Japanese cellular telephone market.
The agreement calls for one of Japan's main providers of cellular telephone service to invest in additional equipment that would make it easier for people there to use cellular telephones manufactured by Motorola Inc. 
 But the pact does not address the issues that provoked the failure of the trade talks a month ago between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan and continue to produce recriminations.
 
Gain for Both, Clinton Says
 In his weekly national radio address, President Clinton presented today's deal as helping both countries.
"This is a big win for everyone," Mr. Clinton said. "Workers in the United States will gain because the agreement means more demand for cellular telephones and related equipment made in America. Japanese consumers win because they'll have access to better service and better technology at better prices. Even Japanese manufacturers may win because of the increased demand for cellular telephones."
The Administration's tactics -- threatening trade sanctions if the Japanese Government did not force a private company there to change its investment plans to suit an American manufacturer -- had drawn a mixed reaction from economists.
Some economists, and many Japanese officials, contended that the Administration was improperly encouraging the Japanese Government to return to its practice of dictating many companies' financial decisions. Other economists, and American officials, said the Japanese Government had allocated cellular telephone frequencies to insure that American-made cellular telephones would not be competitive in the Japanese market.
The President took pains today to emphasize that the cellular telephone deal included specific measures of compliance by the Japanese provider of cellular telephone service, the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, better known as I.D.O.
In broader talks that began last summer at the Tokyo summit meeting and failed at last month's meeting here between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa, the United States had tried unsuccessfully to get Japan to agree to numerical targets by which to gauge the progress in opening its markets.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said at a news conference here today, "This agreement validates our results-oriented approach."
But Takenori Kanzaki, the Japanese Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, said in Tokyo that the pact was consistent with Japan's opposition to numerical targets. The pact calls for I.D.O. to accelerate its schedule for deploying cellular telephone relay stations for phones made by Motorola, not to make additional purchases, he said.
Under today's agreement, I.D.O. must expand its network of cellular telephone relay stations to cover more than 95 percent of the heavily populated corridor between Tokyo and Nagoya by the end of 1995, compared with 56 percent coverage now.
As part of its expansion, I.D.O. agreed today to buy 159 extra phone relay stations from Motorola for an undisclosed price, bringing its total to 348. The Japanese company has already built a cellular phone system using phones made in Japan.
Christopher B. Galvin, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said the agreement would increase Motorola's annual sales in Japan by $300 million a year and provide "hundreds of jobs" for American workers.
The Japanese Government also agreed today to take away a few of the radio frequencies used for phones made in Japan and reallocate them for use with phones made in the United States. The two phone systems are technologically incompatible.
Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said at a press conference there that because a few details of the pact remained to be worked out, the American threat of sanctions would technically be postponed for 30 days rather than lifted entirely. But he predicted that the final details, notably concerning the precise location of the new relay stations, would be settled soon.
Today's pact was technically two agreements, one between I.D.O. and Motorola and the other between Mr. Kantor and Takakaza Kuriyama, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States.
The broader talks are aimed at reducing Japan's overall trade surplus with the rest of the world, which reached $131 billion last year. These talks have initially focused on industries like cars, car parts and insurance.

HEADLINE: More Women Take Low-Wage Jobs Just So Their Families Can Get By

SERIES: Staying Afloat: Work in the 90's - Last of four articles

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
Women who once went to work to buy the extras for their families are paying for more and more of the basics, piling job upon job as their husbands' earnings fall.
About 15 million working wives hold well-paid executive or professional jobs, anchoring their families to the middle or upper classes. But far more -- 37 million -- are working for lower wages as clerks and cashiers, nurses' aides and bank tellers, secretaries and maids. Their wages serve as a cushion between welfare and getting by. 
 For the most part, it is the wives and mothers among this huge population of lower-paid women whose husbands' wages have fallen the most and who are becoming the new bulwarks of the family economy. These women take full-time jobs and then go to school to qualify for better ones. Others combine two or more jobs.
Two decades ago, six men for every one woman held more than one job. As of the end of February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, almost 47 percent of the nation's seven million multiple-job holderswere women. Just over half of these women stack a part-time job on top of a full-time one or hold two or more full-time jobs.
 
'Barely Hanging On'
 "The men are feeling desperate and barely hanging on," said Karen Nussbaum, director of the Women's Bureau at the Labor Department. "Women are more likely to have a practical response: 'How do I just get through this?' They go from a secretarial job to a night job at K mart."
Christine Gibbs is typical. Twenty-nine years old and the mother of a 3-year-old girl, she works 19 hours a week at the drive-up window of a shopping center bank during "peak time" afternoon hours.
Peak-time workers make $8.50 to $12 an hour, but the bank does not provide health benefits or pay wages for an eight-hour day. Then on Saturdays, for $200 a month, she cleans the restrooms and offices of another bank.
 
From Promise to Gloom
 When Mrs. Gibbs began working three years ago, her husband, David, now 30, seemed to have a promising future as an auditor of passenger tickets at Trans World Airlines. So the couple built a three-bedroom house for $80,000 in a subdivision about 25 miles north of downtown and bought a second car.
Since then, Mr. Gibbs has survived round upon round of dismissals at T.W.A. He took a 10 percent pay cut last year, and rumors fly daily of yet more dismissals and another pay cut.
While the Gibbses' annual income, slightly less than $40,000, is still above average for the region, the couple are in debt and know their situation is precarious.
"I expected to gain," Mrs. Gibbs said of her decision to go to work. "But it seems we keep going backward."
For decades, workers like Mrs. Gibbs raised the family income. But in inflation-adjusted dollars, the rise in the median family income peaked in 1989 at $38,710. By the end of 1992, the latest year for which the Government has figures, it had slipped to $36,812.
"An important legacy of the last 12 years is even if you know something is wrong, you're helpless to do anything about it," said Ms. Nussbaum of the Labor Department, reflecting on diminishing incomes and disappearing jobs.
 
Marking Time at Best
 Women, who earn 77 percent of what men do, saw their wages rise by 1.4 percent in real dollars from 1987 to 1993, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-supported research organization. But in the same period, the average male worker's pay fell 10 percent.
Three years ago, the parade of women into the workplace seemed to stall, with 53.5 million employed along with 65 million men. But it was only a pause. Since 1990, nearly three million more women have taken jobs, almost twice the number of men.
Two thirds of all part-timers and nearly 60 percent of all temporary workers are women, according to the Labor Department. Lately, many of these jobs have become entrenched. Banks and supermarkets, for example, now hire some workers, mainly women, for part-time shifts.
The average annual pay in the Kansas City area was $25,345 in 1992, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, close to the national average of $25,903. Typically, the wife's wages lift the family's income to about $35,000. Economists say that amount here allows a modest, middle-class standard of living, covering the cost of a mortgage on a three-bedroom house, two cars, including one with a loan on it, some health insurance and an annual vacation.
 
A State of Mind
 Middle class is partly a state of mind, but in economic terms it is best defined as the mix of income and cost of living that permits families to live independently and have some options.
Eva Pina, a 32-year-old Mexican-born mother of five children, is just barely there. She earns $16,000 a year as a full-time job counselor at a private, nonprofit center for refugees and an additional $5,000 a year working two nights a week and 12 hours on weekends in a supermarket bakery in a tough part of town.
The family of seven needs the money: Ms. Pina's husband, Emeterio Orozco, who speaks no English, earns $6 an hour making commercial dishwashers.
They worry about the monthly $387 mortgage on their sparsely furnished house. "I don't think we can make it on my husband's salary," Ms. Pina said. "I don't want to be on welfare. I know I would get lazy and not improve myself."
 
Trying to Get Ahead
 It was not hard for Ms. Pina to find work. Subsistence jobs, barren of benefits and paying $5 and $6 an hour, go begging because welfare with Medicaid benefits is often a better bet.
To get ahead, women often go to school later than men. Slightly more men than women go to college between the ages of 20 and 24. But among students aged 25 to 54, about 61 percent are women. And once in school, slightly more women than men also hold jobs.
Thelma West, 25, who has four children, juggles a full-time job as a data-entry clerk at an insurance company with psychology courses at a junior college.
Her husband, Tommy, 32, a public works department truck and tractor driver for five years, quit school in the 10th grade. He is reluctant to discuss his pay, but city workers at his level earn about $15,000 a year. To get a better job, he enrolled in a business school to study electronics. But the school folded, and he was left owing $3,500 on his student loan.
 
'That's the Reason'
 After dinner one night at their rented brick rowhouse, Mrs. West dropped on the couch while her 2-year-old, Frances, played nearby. Nodding toward his wife, Mr. West said, "That's the reason we're making it."
One night a week, Mrs. West takes advantage of her college's concession to working students and watches a three-hour class on videotape at home.
Her wages bring the family's income to around $40,000 a year. But after Mr. West's experience with the business school, the family is afraid of debt. They replace their worn furniture piece by piece when they have the cash, and buy food in bulk.
"I doubt that there're many people saying, 'I'm living as I always wanted to live,' " Mrs. West said.
But she does not complain. "Sure, I would like to buy a house in the suburbs," she said. "And right now I'm making preparations for that day. But I don't see us as a certain status. If I was to put us in a category, I would put us as being blessed."
 
Moved From California
 Eva Virji, 54, is looking for a job similar to Mrs. West's. A former loan processor for the Bank of America in Los Angeles, Mrs. Virji practices data processing seven days a week at Johnson County Community College, in suburban Overland Park, Kan.
She left California a year ago to join her husband, Adi, now 52, a chemist and pharmacologist with a doctorate from London University. He had come to Kansas City two years earlier to take a one-year job at a small pharmaceutical company, and his contract was not renewed. Mrs. Virji scoured the region for a job like her previous one, which paid $26,000 a year. But without data-processing skills, she said, the best she could find paid only about $12,500 a year, or $6 an hour.
This month, her $1,400 monthly severance benefit from the Bank of America ran out, and the Virjis are reduced to living on the $800 a month Mrs. Virji collects in workers' compensation for a knee injury.
With her training almost complete, she said she would start looking for work again. She hopes to find a job like Mrs. West's, paying $9 or $10 an hour. But, she said, "If I have to take two jobs, I will."
 
From Raise to Exit
 Like many other men in their 50's who have lost their jobs, Dr. Virji, who was born in India, has found the job market almost impossible to crack. He was laid off from two jobs in Los Angeles before moving to Kansas City; one company eliminated his job two days after giving him a 25 percent raise.
He was let go at the end of his contract in Kansas City, he said, because the drug company was tightening its belt to prepare for the overhaul of the health system.
In Kansas City, he said, "I thought I'd be a big potato in a small field." Instead, employers say he is overqualified for a lower-level position in a laboratory or in a pharmacy, filling prescriptions. "No one will give you a chance to do a lower job," he said. "They say I wouldn't be happy." Taking such comments to heart, Dr. Virji dropped the "Ph.D." from his resume.
Dr. Virji said he would flip hamburgers, but his wife, protective of his self-esteem, won't allow it. "I don't want him to go to McDonald's," she said. "All work has dignity, but I want him to apply for something in his field."

HEADLINE: Temporary Jobs Now Seem Anything But

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
During recessions, employers put off the cost of new hiring by paying people extra to work overtime. They also turn to part-time and temporary workers who are rarely paid benefits.
But it has been three years since the economy began rebounding from the last recession, and these arrangements seem to have taken root. Factories nationwide are relying on record levels of overtime, typically four and five hours a week. Ford's 4,350 workers in Kansas City, for example, have been putting in 50-hour weeks for a year and a half. 
 Automobile industry jobs here, most of them at a Ford plant and a General Motors plant, have climbed to 9,100 from 8,200 four years ago, but they are still far below the 15,200 of 1985.
Some economists say that business's reliance on overtime and on "contingent" -- temporary and part-time -- workers should fade as business picks up.
"We're using more of this contingent work force than we ever have before," said Lowell Mayonne, vice president for human resources at Hallmark, which has its headquarters in Kansas City. "We're like all the other lemmings in American industry. When a gimmick comes along, we tend to fall for it. But I suspect American industry will find that there's a certain loss in productivity."
Other executives suspect that the pressure to operate close to the bone will persist because of a more competitive domestic and global economy and because part-time and temporary workers can provide a more efficient way to serve customers when business is brisk.
Richard E. Beyer, head of human resources at Boatmen's First National Bank, Kansas City's biggest bank, said tellers used to have little to do in the mornings when business was light, then worked hard in the afternoons. Enter a new job category: peak-time workers who are hired only for the busiest hours. The trend toward contingent workers has been a boon to temporary agencies that hire job-seekers and send them out on assignments that can last days or months.
Now, however, even the growth in those kinds of last-resort, low-wage jobs may be abating. David Stanley, chairman of Payless Cashways, a 400-store do-it-yourself chain with headquarters here, said that with ever more sophisticated computers, the company needed fewer and fewer workers.
Bill Yarberry, the head of Manpower Inc.'s office in suburban Overland Park, Kan., makes no apologies for flooding the city with short-timers. He says a temporary job is a springboard to a full-time job for 35 percent of his clients, especially the young workers.
In the minds of many people, "flipping hamburgers at McDonald's," has come to symbolize a culture of low wages and lost hope. But there is another side to the stereotype.
"For young people, the jobs teach teamwork, discipline, communications skills -- a lot of things that build a foundation for later in life," said Rebecca Caruso, a spokeswoman for McDonald's. "More than half our senior and middle managers started out working behind the counter, including our president, Ed Rensi." PETER T. KILBORN

HEADLINE: Washington Might Recognize a Bosnian Serb State

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
The United States may be prepared to recognize a state for Bosnian Serbs on part of the territory they now hold in Bosnia and Herzegovina if such recognition would help foster an overall settlement of the war acceptable to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, Administration officials said this week.
A senior official said that while the Clinton Administration strongly favors preserving Bosnia and Herzegovina intact by persuading the Serbs to join a proposed federation of Muslims and Croats being negotiated by the United States, the eventual acceptance of a Bosnian Serb state could not be ruled out. 
 "We're not excluding recognizing a Bosnian Serb state," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If, at some point, the Bosnian Government tells us, 'Look, this is the best chance for our entity,' we'd have to take that into consideration. It could well be that a Bosnian Serb state will emerge and have some relation to Serbia on the other side."
The Serbs, who made up close to one-third of Bosnia's population before the war began nearly two years ago, now hold about 70 percent of the territory of the former Yugoslav republic. In exchange for any eventual recognition, they would clearly have to give up a considerable part of this land to the federation of Croats and Muslims now taking shape.
 
'Very Loose Structure' Seen
 "We've told the Serbs the door is open for them to join the federation, but we assume they do not want to come in," the official said. "So what you could eventually have after hard bargaining on territory is a Bosnian Serb state recognized by the United Nations with confederal ties to Serbia, and a Muslim-Croatian state with confederal ties to Croatia, and then perhaps some very loose overarching structure for the original land mass of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Asked what structure could link two separate sovereign states in Bosnia, the official suggested a free economic zone and periodic meetings of the presidents and prime ministers.
After several months of diplomatic inertia, the United States has now taken the lead in seeking a settlement for the Balkan war.
In so doing, officials recognize that it has been obliged to abandon the moral high ground for what they consider a level of pragmatism. Still, recognition of a Bosnian Serb state would be vigorously debated because it might appear to reward the aggressor, flout international law and lend permanence to the forced eviction of Muslims from certain towns by Serbs, known as "ethnic cleansing."
 
Readiness Varies
 Several conversations with senior officials of the State Department and the White House suggested differing degrees of readiness to recognize the Bosnian Serbs. None, however, rejected the possibility.
A second official said: "It will be very difficult if the Serbs want to secede. They would have to give more territory than if they remain within a loose union in Bosnia. But our bottom line is that if eventual secession is acceptable to the Bosnian Muslims, then we will support it and commit U.S. troops to the implementation of the agreement."
Asked about recognition of a Bosnian Serb state, a third highly placed official said, "Let's first nail down the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and then approach the Serbs and see." He said it was "unlikely but not impossible" that the Serbs would join the federation, "and we must explore this possibility."
In the conversations with the officials, the planned course of American diplomatic efforts over the next few weeks emerges clearly.
 
Muslims and Croats Talk
 First, every effort will be made to conclude negotiations in Vienna between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats on the establishment of a binational federation of semiautonomous cantons that would then be joined to Croatia in a loose confederation. Officials believe that a signing ceremony in Washington between President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia is likely to take place within the next two weeks.
By the time of this signing, the Muslims and Croats will be ready to put their territorial demands jointly to the Serbs.
This "bottom line" on territory would be coordinated with the United States and is certain to involve a demand that the Serbs give up at least 20 percent of the land they now hold. Indeed, in a statement this week, Mr. Izetbegovic said the Muslim-Croat entity would cover 60 percent of Bosnia -- implying that the Serbs would be asked to give up 30 percent.
Negotiations would then begin with the Serbs, the officials said, and would be certain to involve hard bargaining on a number of issues. Still, an official said, "the Muslim-Croat federation will create a better balance of forces in Bosnia, and we believe this is something the Serbs understand."
 
Muslims Oppose Partition
 After several changes of policy over the last year, it seems clear that Mr. Izetbegovic and his Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, now favor maintaining the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina intact rather than allowing partition. Their initial position in discussions with the Serbs would therefore be that the Serbs should give up territory while remaining within some loose union in Bosnia.
"What we have in mind," a United States official said, "is that the central government of the whole would be weak, but the Muslim-Croat part would be stronger. The links to Croatia on the outside could be stronger than those to the Serbs within the country of Bosnia. You'd end up with an asymmetrical federation in Bosnia."
On the specific question of territory, two possibilities are being examined. The Muslim-Croat federation might give up some of the isolated Government-held eastern enclaves, like Zepa and Srebrenica, but in return gain a far greater share of a province around Sarajevo, the capital, and complete control of the city itself, which would not be divided.
Alternatively, blurred land corridors might be secured linking all the isolated eastern Muslim enclaves, with acceptance by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats of a lesser share of Sarajevo and its province.
 
No Telegraphing in Advance
 "I don't deny that some people might be thinking about the necessity of giving up the eastern enclaves," an American official said. "If you look at the maps, some more coherent and contiguous state is easier to defend. But we have tried not to telegraph in advance what we would like the Muslim-Croat part to look like."
But all the ideas appear to present enormous, perhaps insurmountable, problems.
The Bosnian Serbs have never said they would give up more than 20 percent of what they hold, and recently their leader, Radovan Karadzic, has retreated from that position, suggesting that the concession may be no larger than 10 percent. The Serbs are committed to holding part of the city of Sarajevo. And having already declared their self-styled independent state on the land they hold, the Serbs have certainly not forsaken their two-year-old fight for independence or the desire to join with Serbia.
"If the Serbs want out, they will have to give more territory, that is clear," a United States official said. "But even then, for Izetbegovic, it may be tough to sell Serb secession to his various constituents, particularly the army, many of whose soldiers have been fighting for the right to go back to their homes."
 
Two Firm Positions
 Two positions do appear firm amid the difficulties. The first is that while a Bosnian Serb state might be acceptable to the United States if the Muslim-led Bosnian Government agreed to it and secured large territorial concessions, Serbia's annexation of Serb-held parts of Bosnia is not.
"We do not want Serbia expanding into 50 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina," an official said. "There would be real penalties for any Serbian 'anschluss' of the Bosnian Serbs."
The second is that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government would sign an overall agreement only if it is accompanied by a firm commitment from the United States to send troops to enforce the accord.
"For the Bosnians, our presence is crucial," an official said, adding that he thought President Clinton could secure Congressional approval for sending troops even though it would be a hard-fought battle for the President.
Asked if a necessarily imperfect agreement, involving continuing Serbian dominance on land seized by force, could really be policed by the Americans, the official said, "Look, we are working toward what the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, has himself called the least unjust of solutions."

HEADLINE: POLAND SEEKS TIES TO EUROPEAN UNION

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 12

 BODY:
Concerned about resurgent Russian nationalism, Poland has stepped up its efforts to join the European Union with the idea that even partial membership would push it further into the orbit of the West.
The Polish Foreign Minister, Andrzej Olechowski, said at meeting of the union in Brussels this week that Poland would make its application for what he called partial membership next month. If the union agreed, such an arrangement would allow Poland full participation in the union's foreign and security activities, he said. 
 Poland's economic conditions did not yet allow it to work toward economic integration with the union, Mr. Olechowski said. "I'd like to see this happen as soon as possible," he said of the partial membership plan. "Poland would then be preparing for full membership."
Hungary's Minister for International Economic Relations, Endre Juhasz, said at the Brussels meetings that his Government would apply for full membership in the union next month. Poland and Hungary already have association agreements with the European Union, which provide for limited trade and aid.
 
Unease About Moscow
 The surprise moves for closer ties to the European Union by the two formerly Communist bloc countries reflect a continuing unease about Russia, a disquiet that was heightened by the recent Russian involvement in the efforts to end fighting in the former Yugoslavia.
Poland and Hungary are among the countries that have signed up for partial membership in NATO under the "Partnership for Peace" plan, but so has Russia. Some of the former satellite countries of the old Soviet Union fear that Russia is determined to prevent the partnership plan from growing into an alliance with security guarantees. Polish officials, for example, say that by inviting Russia into the partnership Washington insured that the plan would fail to grow into a meaningful grouping.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, appeared to encourage this fear with remarks before the Russian Parliament's foreign policy committee Thursday. He was quoted in the Polish press as saying: "The NATO-mania of the impatient candidates for members of the alliance, similarly as the conception of 'Partnership for Peace,' may only lead to the strengthening of Zhirinovsky's camp, especially if it's accompanied by anti-Russian hysteria." He was referring to Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the leader of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party, which made a strong showing in Russia's parliamentary elections.
Mr. Kozyrev's comments followed a swing through Eastern Europe earlier this month, which went smoothly in Hungary and the Czech Republic, but was reported in Poland as a cool and truncated visit. Mr. Kozyrev did not meet with President Lech Walesa, for example, or even visit Warsaw.
 
Jaruzelski Interviewed
 In a rare interview published Friday in the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, the last Communist leader of Poland, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, underlined the Polish drive for security guarantees from the West and the nature of its difficulties with Russia.
"Almost all political parties in Poland, whether on the right or left, think that the guarantees of our security lie in our close contacts with the West," he said, adding there should also be "co-operation with our eastern neighbors."
Mr. Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law on Poland in 1981, said that some Russian foreign policy makers wanted to keep Eastern Europe away from the West and leave it as a neutral zone, a prospect that many Poles particularly fear.
The former Polish leader said he liked and respected Russia but predicted Russia would remain a "very unstable country" until at least the year 2000.
As well as pushing at the doors of the European Union, Poland and several of the other former Warsaw Pact countries, plan to seek membership in the Western European Union -- a defense alliance of union members that are also part of NATO -- at a meeting of that organization in May.
The May meeting of the Western European Union is scheduled to consider opening the organization to new associate members. Some officials in Brussels, worried about the direction of Russia, have said in the last few weeks that the Eastern Europeans should be offered stronger security assurances than they are likely to get through the "Partnership for Peace" of NATO.

HEADLINE: State Employees Brace for the Budget

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 12

 BODY:
When Gov. Christine Todd Whitman releases her 1995 budget on Tuesday, no group will pore over its numbers more anxiously than New Jersey's state employees.
With a $2.2 billion projected budget gap to close, Whitman administration officials have been hinting that state workers' wages and fringe benefits, accounting for 20 percent of state spending, will be high on the list for budget savings. 
 Possible changes include placing new limits on the state's generous sick-leave rules, curtailing health insurance contributions and delaying contributions to pension programs. In addition, the state may consider forcing local school districts to assume responsibility for their teachers' pensions, which the state now pays, and weakening the current system of compulsory wage arbitration for police and firefighters, which has been blamed for wage increases that run twice the rate of inflation.
If the fears of New Jersey's 61,000 state workers are realized on Tuesday, they will not be alone in their dismay; state employees in New York and Connecticut also face the prospect of being asked to sacrifice during coming labor negotiations.
 
Economy Up, Not Benefits
 In all three states, public workers had hoped that an improving economy might let them make up for the wage freezes and benefits reductions forced on them during hard times. They are finding, however, that tax cuts, not wage increases, are the order of the day.
A few years ago, administrations pointed to falling tax revenues as the reason for holding wages down, trimming benefits and forcing layoffs. Now they argue that taxes must be cut for the states to remain competitive with lower-taxing states in the South and West. And they show every sign of expecting state workers to help pay the price.
Union leaders acknowledge that the wage-squeezing sits well with recession-weary taxpayers.
"The recession has made it politically acceptable to go after public employees," complained Robert Yackel, head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s state and local workers' federation in New Jersey. "You still have high unemployment out there, people are having to take second jobs to make ends meet, and they see public employees with steady jobs and steady incomes and they get resentful."
Some experts on state fiscal issues say that state payrolls, particularly fringe benefits, deserve to be re-examined in light of new fiscal realities.
 
Sharp Contrast With 1980's
 "I think everything ought to be on the table in states that are in serious fiscal situations, particularly in a state like New Jersey, that does have high personnel spending," said Steven D. Gold, head of the Center for Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany.
The change is in sharp contrast to the relative security that public workers enjoyed as a group during the 1980's, when government employee wages at the state and local levels, while still lower than for corresponding jobs in private industry, were increasing at twice the private rate, and when a state job was considered an ironclad guarantee of lifetime job security.
Over the last three years, however, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut each laid off thousands of state employees, and public workers' pay is now rising nationally at a third the rate of private employees.
Most New York and New Jersey state employees have a year to go on their contracts, but labor contracts did not stop either state from saving millions of dollars since 1991 by delaying scheduled pay increases or reducing pension plan contributions.
 
Weicker Wants Wage Freeze
 In Connecticut most labor contracts expire in June, and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has already signaled that he wants a wage freeze to help the state compensate local governments for eliminating personal property taxes. On Wednesday, he advised the legislature to reject an arbitrator's award of wage increases to state university employees.
"There is no money in the current budget or in the upcoming fiscal year for general wage increases," said Avice A. Meehan, Governor Weicker's spokeswoman.
In New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed layoffs and tax cuts, city workers face much the same situation.
To make good on her campaign promise to cut income taxes by 30 percent over three years, Governor Whitman must cut an additional $1.1 billion in state spending, and there are few places other than the state's work force where she can save.
At its current spending level of $15.6 billion, New Jersey's budget also lists about $2.2 billion more in spending than there is money, a gap that has traditionally been closed by fiscal gimmicks and one-time revenues. Mrs. Whitman, who criticized "one shots" during the campaign, has said that she will have to resort to some in her first budget.
 
Local Cuts a Last Resort
 About two-thirds of the state's budget, or $10 billion, goes for public health and welfare costs or is returned to municipalities and school districts. Mrs. Whitman has assured the mayors and school boards that she will cut state aid to schools and localities only as a last resort.
That leaves the $4.6 billion spent annually for state operations, of which about $2 billion pays salaries and $1.1 billion goes for fringe benefits, including $675 million annually for pensions alone.
Over the years, one of the harshest critics of state spending on personnel has been the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, a private fiscal monitoring organization, whose former head was David Kehler until he became Governor Whitman's deputy associate treasurer. It is taken in Trenton as an article of faith that Mr. Kehler's critiques of state personnel spending policies are now working their way into the new budget.
In the past, the institute's researchers have criticized the fact that New Jersey employees, unlike nearly all other public workers, need not contribute to their health coverage, although they must pay into their pension plans. Many fiscal analysts have also suggested increasing the co-payment that workers make for doctor's visits and for prescription drugs. Each $1 increase in co-payment for drugs would produce $4 million in savings, for example.
 
Criticizing Sick-Leave Cash
 Mr. Kehler has, in the past, also criticized the state's practice of allowing retiring state workers to cash in their unused sick leave for up to $15,000, a policy that costs the state $16 million annually.
The state could also save close to $400 million in pension costs, over the short term, at least, by delaying contributions to pension plans, and leaving it to future governors to make up the financing as needed for retiring workers. New York State tried this approach in 1991, saving about $3 billion since then, but the courts have since struck down the practice.
Public employee wages and benefits are not the only place Governor Whitman may look for savings. She is known to admire fellow Republican governors in Michigan and Massachussetts who have cut or eliminated welfare payments to able-bodied, childless adults, a program that now costs New Jersey $166 million a year.
In addition, the nearly $3 billion in annual Medicaid payments include expenses for services not required by the Federal matching grant program, like eye care, podiatry and chiropractic. State officials have also suggested requiring Medicaid patients to enroll in managed-care programs.

HEADLINE: Businesses Press Lawmakers on Overhaul of Education

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 11

 BODY:
The delicate consensus that supports public education is being tested in the Legislative Office Building's hearing rooms as advocates of an ambitious plan to overhaul the schools try to push it to the top of the General Assembly's agenda.
Strongly endorsed by Connecticut's business leaders, the plan takes its lead from President Bush's America 2000 initiative, which called on states to set "world class" standards for their schools to prepare students to compete in a global economy. 
 The plan focuses on educational outcomes rather than on money spent per student or time students spend in class. It would establish strict goals for knowledge and skills deemed necessary for students to learn, then redesign curriculums to help nearly all students reach them.
But business is only one of many groups concerned with education plans that focus on outcomes, , and it has become a target for others with different interests.
Parents who oppose the plan call it a deception, part of a nationwide conspiracy to "dumb down" schools so they produce docile workers molded to meet industry's needs.
 
Teachers Join Attack
 Teachers unions, fearing that business people with little sense of the classroom are unfairly blaming teachers for the shortcomings of schools, have joined the attack. In a newspaper ad this week, the 30,000-member Connecticut Education Association accused business leaders of misleading the public about the plan's goals.
"Business leaders should say what they are really aiming for: schools that will turn out workers who fit their specific needs," the ad stated. "But teachers know there is more to education than preparing for a job."
Standing among the opposition, meanwhile, are supporters of school-choice plans that would give parents money to send their children to private schools, ready to step forward with their proposals if the plan for outcome-based education falters.
At a hearing before the Legislature's Education Committee today, the clash of perspectives was so jarring that members of the Commission on Educational Excellence for Connecticut, which issued a report on which the bill for outcome-based education is based, were shaking their heads at some criticism.
After one mother described the reform package as "radical educational experimentation" aimed at shaping children's "attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviors," Senator Robert L. Genuario, an Education Committee member who also sat on the commission, asked if she could point to any language in the bill that supported her comments.
"I can't imagine myself voting for legislation that would bring about the results that you suggest," he said.
 
'The Mind-Control Aspect'
 Little that the commission members told the Education Committee about the plan mattered, in an atmosphere in which one opponent, coordinating his testimony with another, said matter-of-factly, "I'll address the mind-control aspect."
The commission had been instructed by the Legislature to draft an outcome-based system, opponents say, and so whatever commission members said, they were really talking about outcome-based education. Outcome-based education, as the opponents understand it, is a system meant to teach all children the same things, to foster conformity and to discourage competition.
Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a committee co-chairman, tried to spike that line of reasoning. He asked Robert D. Kennedy, the chief executive of the Union Carbide Corporation, "How would you respond to the observation that commission members are either liars who don't mean what they say, or fools who don't understand what they mean?"
Mr. Kennedy replied: "Change is threatening to people. Those who oppose education reform -- and you'll hear from them today, and you should listen to them closely -- it's clear what they oppose. It's not clear what they favor."
Still, when the State Commissioner of Education, Vincent Ferrandino, assured the committee, "It's strange to me that a group of businessmen who are concerned about being competitive would even consider the idea of dumbing down standards," someone in the audience hissed a possible motive: "Robots!"
 
Complicating Factors
 Complicating the plan's prospects is the language of professional educators and reformers, which mixes jargon with sweeping generalizations. After more than 18 months of study and discussion by the commission, for example, the plan's bywords -- "All children can learn at high levels" -- are still misunderstood by many people.
To the commission, the phrase means that all children are capable of learning more than public schools now expect of those who are not college-bound. If schools specified what children should know -- the desired outcomes -- they would then be able to figure out how to teach those things to every child.
But to a public well aware that children come in all varieties of intelligence and aptitude, commission members have been slow to explain how such a concept would be carried out in classrooms so that slow children would have as much time as they need, and smarter ones would not be held back.
As a result, critics have been able to mock the idea as unrealistic, or to supply horror stories from elsewhere in the country where the concept was carried out poorly and all children were held to the pace of the slowest.
Lost in the debate is the plan's intention that most children would meet the requirements not at graduation, but by the end of the 10th grade, leaving at least two years -- more for talented students who met the goals sooner -- to pursue their academic interests.
"We don't expect that all students will reach the same level," Mr. Ferrandino said. "Obviously, some will go well beyond the standards."

HEADLINE: Raze the Roof, Fix a Pothole

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KEARNY, N.J., March 9

 BODY:
At 15 snowstorms and counting, this has been Brian H. Howland's best winter ever.
His company, Reclaim Inc., makes a material to fill potholes, so every time the streets thaw and then freeze, there is more demand for his product. But there is more reason to like the bad weather: it generates more supplies of Reclaim's unusual raw material. While other paving supply companies use asphalt, his uses old roofs. 
 "This weather is great, incoming and outgoing," he said. "It's going to develop both markets."
Reclaim, which says it is the only company in its business, uses the old asphalt shingles that roofers remove from houses and commercial buildings. The company, which has one plant here and another in Camden, shreds the shingles, grinds them, mixes them with gravel, throws in a dollop of a secret blend of solvents that helps it all stick together, and cooks it all up into a patching material.
 
All This and Recycling Too
 With a 20-foot tower of roofing debris rising from the mud beneath the Pulaski Skyway, and a clanking steel-clawed auger in the little factory, Reclaim does not look like most people's notion of a "green industry." But it has kept more than a quarter-million tons of discarded roofing material out of New Jersey landfills, cut the demand for oil used to make asphalt, and provided, according to the company and some of its customers, a superior pothole patch, though it is more expensive than the usual mix.
"It works fantastic," said Henry A. Monker, who fills potholes for the Union City Department of Public Works. "It's good stuff," said William F. Bull, the recycling coordinator in the City of Bayonne. "I really believe in the material," said John J. Tarditi Jr., the Mayor of Haddonfield. All three said Reclaim's main product, called Repave, is superior to the current standard material, called cold patch, a tarry gravel that workers shovel into holes and hope stays there.
New York City officials are evaluating Repave, but have not decided to buy. There are test patches at 11th Street and Seventh Avenue in Greenwich Village and on Smith Street near the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn.
 
Scraping the Barrel
 Asphalt roofing tile and asphalt paving material come from the same place: the bottom of the oil barrel. If oil were peaches, asphalt would be the pits. Asphalt is made from the big hydrocarbon molecules that oil refineries can't use in gasoline, heating oil or anything else.
People have thought for a long time about recycling the tile into paving material, but Reclaim, which is based in Tampa, Fla., is the first to make it work. It works in New Jersey because landfill prices are high, so Reclaim does not have to buy its raw material; in fact, it makes truck drivers pay to dump, although less than they would at a landfill.
Along with the economic incentive, Reclaim has benefited from New Jersey's decision to make recycling mandatory for materials in the waste stream for which a recycling system exists. Roofing tile represents about 3 percent of what goes into landfills.
 
Slow to Catch On
 Reclaim is not trying to maximize the amount recycled. If the pile gets too large, it will raise its fee for accepting the material. The constraining factor is the demand for its product, which company officials say is catching on slowly. Mr. Howland said that city purchasing authorities are slow to try new methods of filling potholes.
So production remains low. Most of it is mechanized, but workers still load five-gallon pails and 60-pound plastic bags with a shovel. The product is not yet available in bulk, which is how highway departments usually buy.
The company went public a year ago and trades under the ticker symbol Roof, but has not yet turned a profit.
At Reclaim these days, there is only a dribble of trucks, because few roofers work in the snow. But it will swell to a steady stream come spring.
 
The Remains of a Roof
 This afternoon Cheryl Halper, the owner of Cornell Disposal of Piscataway, pulled up with a 15-cubic-yard dumpster that held the remains of a roof from a house in Hillsboro. She signed a form saying where the material came from, information that will eventually go to Trenton and help determine the size of a bounty that the New Jersey state government pays each town. The form also included a promise by Ms. Halper that there was no asbestos in the load.
She paid $375 to dump the load. Without Reclaim it would have gone to the Somerset County landfill, she said, at a charge of $1,500. She keeps part of the difference, but most is passed along to the roofer, who presumably passes some of the saving to the homeowner.
"Hey, recycling pays," she said.
From the heap near the entrance to Reclaim's 2.5-acre plot here, a payloader carries the tile to "the muncher," a steel box containing an auger, a corkscrew-shaped piece of metal that breaks up the tile and carries it to a conveyor belt. The tile then goes to a "mini muncher," which breaks the material up finer, until it is shredded. A magnet removes roofing nails.
 
No Goo, Please
 According to Mr. Howland, one of Reclaim's special skills is breaking up the tile without heating it through friction. Too much heat turns the asphalt to a useless goo.
Along with asphalt, the muncher also breaks up the backing of the shingles, which is cellulose or fiberglass. Those materials provide fibers that make the patch stronger, he said. That idea is not new; concrete manufacturers have begun adding fibers to strengthen their mix.
Repave is 20 to 30 percent recycled material. The rest is aggregate, the technical name for the fine gravel used in asphalt, and the solvent.
Pound for pound, Repave costs about six times as much as cold patch, mainly because it requires more labor to make. But road departments say the patches last years. Cold patch sometimes lasts but often comes back out of the hole in weeks.
With cold patch, said Mr. Bull of Bayonne, "you wind up in the course of a winter going back three or four, maybe five times, because the stuff doesn't hold." With Repave, he said, "You just go once and you're finished. So the crew gets a chance to do more holes, and catch up with them."

HEADLINE: Productivity Booms at Workers' Expense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Sylvia Nasar's article "The American Economy, Back on Top" (Feb. 27) celebrates the current boom but gives short shrift to the disastrous effects on workers and families. Recent gains in productivity were obtained mainly by raising factory output while reducing factory jobs and middle-management jobs. But the painful downsizing has been masked by a vast rise of mostly low-level and low-paid service jobs -- often temporary or part-time work.
Among most groups there are stagnant wage rates, reduced real family incomes, swollen numbers of discouraged workers and limited purchasing power. At the least, we should be expanding our care for the victims of this kind of boom.

HEADLINE: Winners, Losers and Bankruptcy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Beware Management Talking Poor" (Wall Street, Feb. 13), Alison Leigh Cowan exposed a slick method to pay certain creditors far more than 100 cents on the dollar in today's large Chapter 11 cases, while sticking other creditors with larger losses.
Peter C. Browning, National Gypsum's former chief executive, and John H. Laeri Jr., the financial adviser to National Gypsum's asbestos committee, contend the column was wrong (Letters, March 6). I represented a committee of bond and trade creditors in the National Gypsum bankruptcy, and I found the column was on target. 
 Initially, National Gypsum proposed a plan requiring new contracts for the top five executives. We believed the plan was based on pushed-down business projections. Mr. Browning did not receive more than his old salary as part of the plan because the court ruled it would not approve his linkage of the new contracts to the plan.
That five of six classes of creditors accepted the plan only shows that creditors don't mind being paid more than in full.
National Gypsum's directors supported the plan that extinguished their stock. That was not surprising given the admission of National Gypsum's financial adviser that he discussed with a director that the least expensive way to reacquire the company could be to buy the reorganized company's stock on a when-issued basis. To claim that the stock initially traded on a when-issued basis at the low level predicted by National Gypsum only shows that the plan worked. Only after that did the company disclose it could increase cash flow $30 million a year by laying off 12 percent of its work force.
National Gypsum's share prices rose from its projection of $12.50 a share, to $45, in less than eight months, and most of the increase occurred after the company disclosed how it was increasing income and while interest rates were rising.

Some Rooms With Vrooms On Crowded Nascar Circuit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
If you plan to attend a Winston Cup stock car race and haven't made hotel reservations, you may not want to bother. Simply show up after the final qualifying session of race weekend; several rooms should be available.
More and more teams are going home early from Winston Cup races this season, as the burgeoning success of Nascar's top series has drawn more teams, more sponsors and more promising young drivers. The only problem is, the number of starting positions has stayed the same. 
 That has made it tougher than ever simply to make the starting lineup, which can vary from 37 to 43 cars depending on track length. In years past, a half-dozen or so semi-regulars would fill the few spots at the tail end of a race lineup that the big-time teams left open. As recently as last season, in fact, some races on the tour started fewer than the maximum number of cars allowed.
 
Big Names Missing
 But in qualifying for the four races this year, including the Purolator 500 today in Hampton, Ga., a number of big-name teams and drivers have missed at least one race -- including, last weekend in Richmond, the new team run by Travis Carter, with Hut Stricklin as its driver. And for the last two weekends, Wally Dallenbach, Richard Petty's driver, has gone home early.
The teams that have suffered the most, however, have been the ones whose drivers are rookies on the Winston Cup tour. Of the eight drivers considered contenders for the 1994 rookie of the year, only two -- John Andretti and Jeff Burton -- have qualified for all four races so far. And two others, Rick Carelli and T. W. Taylor, have not made any starting lineup.
"You can't make any mistakes," said Joe Nemechek, another rookie. "When you go out to qualify, you need to have the best tires you can have and the best setup, and the driver cannot make a mistake."
 
Sponsor Not Happy
 Nemechek went home before the Daytona 500, the series' biggest race. That could not have pleased his sponsor. "Well, there definitely was some pressure there," he said. "They're paying money to be on a race car and to get television time."
One driver who looked particularly relieved last weekend in Richmond was Ward Burton, Jeff Burton's brother and fellow Winston Cup rookie. Ward Burton had failed to qualify for the season's first two races, but squeezed into a tight 37-car field at Richmond and made today's lineup.
"Just making this race was almost as emotionally satisfying as winning my last Busch race at Atlanta," Burton said at Richmond, referring to his sendoff last fall from the Busch Grand National series, Nascar's triple-A league.
Because Richmond is a three-quarter-mile oval, the spread between the fastest and slowest qualifying times -- and thus the driver's margin for error -- is much smaller than at longer tracks such as Daytona. The difference between Ted Musgrave's pole-winning lap time at Richmond and that of the slowest qualifier, Bobby Hamilton, was 0.522 seconds.
 
'A Lot of Really Good Cars'
 "It's nothing new to have a lot of cars," said Jeff Burton, recalling how he and his brother arrived at some Busch series races with 40 cars vying for 28 starting spots. "What's new is there's a lot of really good cars. When you send a driver the caliber of Hut Stricklin home, that doesn't speak negatively about the team, it speaks positively about the sport."
Try telling that to your sponsor. Was Ward Burton feeling pressure as he went out to qualify at Richmond? He laughed and said, "Man, I tell you, it's a ton of pressure."
But, he said, even if his sponsor had been sitting in his garage breathing down his neck, he couldn't have driven the car or himself any harder. "I got a clear conscience with that," said Burton. "The only problem is, sometimes that's not good enough."
Richard Childress, team owner for the defending Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt knows how damaging it can be if a team with a major sponsor fails to get into a race.
"What happens is, the sponsors bring in a lot of their sales and marketing people, customers or whatever," Childress said. "And they do a big promotion around it. And so if your car's not in the race, it's not a good situation."
You can always make the best of it, though. Danny Sullivan, the unemployed Indy-car champion who is trying to run a handful of Winston Cup races this year, failed to qualify at Rockingham, N.C., and this weekend, and pulled out of Richmond. But the fact that he has not run a Winston Cup race this year did not stop him from having a trailer full of his souvenir merchandise parked outside the Richmond oval, alongside the trailers selling Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott souvenirs.

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Deal for North Korea

 BODY:
International inspectors are now scouring North Korea's nuclear sites for signs of any recent diversion of nuclear material to the making of nuclear arms. If they find none, Washington will soon resume talks with Pyongyang on gaining even greater access to determine how much material, if any, it may have diverted before inspections began and whether that was enough to make a bomb.
To win such inspections, President Clinton needs to put together a package of inducements that addresses North Korea's diplomatic, security and economic concerns. He also needs to quiet the loose talk of war in Washington. 
 To that end, he might read a report by the U.S. Institute of Peace, drafted by former officials, some of whom shaped U.S. policy toward Korea in the past. It challenges the view that North Korea's nuclear program has created a military crisis that requires a flexing of American muscle. Such posturing, the report suggests, adds nothing to U.S. negotiating leverage but instead raises doubts in Pyongyang about whether Washington is serious about a deal.
The report's assessment of the military balance indicates that the threat from the North is not growing. Pyongyang's missiles, artillery and rockets have long been able to reach Seoul. But the South is spending twice as much as the North does on defense, while the North's reduced access to oil has degraded its military effectiveness. Further, North Korea's economic setbacks are so serious that Kim Il Sung's dream of reunifying the peninsula has "given way to concern for survival."
The report also raises questions about the North's bomb-making activity. The C.I.A.'s estimate that the North has accumulated enough plutonium for one or two bombs is a "worst-case extrapolation." Moreover, there is "no hard evidence -- only the presumption" that the North has turned whatever plutonium it has into a bomb.
Rigorous inspections of North Korea's nuclear sites could clear up these uncertainties. The North also needs to carry out its 1991 pledge to dismantle its reprocessing plant, and account for any plutonium it may have produced. To coax Pyongyang into these steps, the U.S. should offer incentives to be delivered once the North takes specific actions.
It is essential, for example, that Pyongyang continue its talks with Seoul. The U.S. can then hold out step-by-step diplomatic ties and U.S. backing for aid, investment and trade as inducements for regular inspections. The package would also include a joint U.S.-South Korean offer to reduce forces in the demilitarized zone and take other steps to build mutual confidence if the North reciprocates.
Pyongyang's economy is in disarray. A firm commitment from Mr. Clinton could produce a broad diplomatic bargain that just might work, allowing Pyongyang to extract itself from a nuclear dead end of its own making.

What Recovery?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Joan Rivers lives in Sandy, Ore., a small town in the foothills of Mount Hood, not far from Portland. She's not the comedian, although she's blessed with an abiding and often therapeutic sense of humor. She's a divorced mother of six who is trying to make her way in the treacherous new world of work in the United States.
Ms. Rivers is not impressed with the current economic recovery. The wonders of the resurgent economy are proclaimed most loudly by those with good jobs and no fear of unemployment. Ms. Rivers is a college English instructor who has been unable to find work in her field. She makes ends meet (barely) by selling ice cream and espresso from a converted vacation trailer. 
 In the hierarchy of tough jobs, selling ice cream in Oregon in the winter ranks near the top.
Ms. Rivers tried to get back into teaching full time a few years ago, but couldn't. "At first," she said, "it was a shock to me that I couldn't find work that I was qualified to do. I have my degree and my teaching certificate. I'm a capable person. I have great references from my professors and everything."
Undaunted, she lowered her standards a bit. She was willing to teach high school English.
"Couldn't even get called in for interviews," she said.
She sought work as a teacher's aide. Nothing.
In desperation, Ms. Rivers even tried to go to Guam, "where I had once taught years ago. They were willing to hire me but there were no living accommodations for my kids."
She improvised. "I did some substituting, made beds at a school for the blind, made and sold wreaths at Christmas."
She had a humorous piece published in The Oregonian, and a short story in Mountain Writer's Quarterly.
"I tried to set up my home for elderly care, but that required fire escapes, decking, etc., which I couldn't afford. I started working nights at the dog racing track, selling hot dogs and beer."
One day she looked out the window at her 1972 trailer in the backyard. She saw possibilities. With her brother's help she refurbished the trailer and turned it into a concession stand. She got permission to sell ice cream at a local tourist stop. Business was O.K. during the summer but it virtually collapsed at the end of September, so she invested $2,500 in an espresso machine in the hopes that it would carry her through the winter.
"Well," she asks rhetorically, "am I unemployed? Discouraged? Self-employed? Underemployed? Or off the charts?"
Given her personal experience with the realities of work in the 90's, Ms. Rivers has little patience with official unemployment statistics and rosy economic assessments. "When I read the business page and see all these figures saying the economy is going up and there are more and more jobs available, I'm saying this isn't accurate."
She spoke of several friends who are also having a difficult time with work: "A former building contractor who builds furniture at home. A divorced woman with three kids who picks mushrooms to supplement her waitress income because she can't find a dental hygienist job. A woman working on her doctoral thesis in labor-management relations who works at a 7-Eleven.
"I used to think people who couldn't get jobs were misfits in some way. Maybe that used to be the case. But I see now a lot of vastly underutilized citizenry."
Ms. Rivers is not bitter, does not feel betrayed and, in fact, remains optimistic. But she thinks it's time for a general acknowledgement of the tough state of the economy and a more honest view of the problems of joblessness and underemployment.
She is far from alone. The New York Times profiled a family last week in which the husband and wife are working four jobs that will pay them a total of $18,000 this year. When it was noted that two million new jobs were created last year, the husband quickly put that statistic in perspective. "Sure, we've got four of them," he said. "So what?"
The economy may be improving, which essentially means businesses are doing well. But in the real world of ordinary working Americans, where the unrelenting struggle is to stop the erosion in the standard of living, things are still not looking up.

Caught Between 3 Community Boards

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Boundaries of the city's community boards, set up in the late 70's, are due for reconsideration under the terms of the City Charter. And in the first wave of what could become a flood of border wars, Westchester Square is trying to redefine itself.
The area -- with a residential section characterized by single-family homes peppered with high-rise buildings and a flourishing commercial section that is also a transportation hub -- is split between Community Boards 9, 10 and 11. Some merchants and other residents there are urging that it be included entirely in either Board 10 or 11 so it would benefit from the unified lobbying of one community board. 
 "As it is now, it's like a patchwork quilt," said Sandi Lusk, president of Westchester Square and Zerega Improvement Inc., one of the groups behind the campaign. "Residents are totally confused."
Alison Gran, president of the Association of Merchants and Business Professionals of Westchester Square Inc., complained that a simple event like a street fair requires the approval of three community boards, two sanitation districts and three police precincts. "This is ridiculous," she said.
Community Board 9 opposes the move; the other two boards simply say they are satisfied with their boundaries.
Under the City Charter, the Mayor must submit a report to the City Council outlining proposed changes in the city's district maps every 10 years. The review was due after the 1990 census but was delayed when the city challenged the results.
Around 1980, when the first review took place, Bronx residents fought off the city's recommendations to change some boundaries, said Veralyne Hamilton, the director of community boards for the Bronx Borough President. The community board functions largely as an advocate for a particular district, but it wields no legal authority.
As residents of Central Park North, Clinton (formerly Hell's Kitchen) and York Avenue (formerly Avenue A) can testify, New York is a city where shifting neighborhood designations often represent social and economic aspirations and differentiations.
But while there are racial and economic differences among the three community boards -- 9 is densely populated and predominantly Hispanic working class; 10 and 11 are largely middle-class Italian, Irish and Jewish -- the leaders of the campaign in Westchester Square insist their motivation is merely practical.
"I'm not changing my address," Ms. Lusk said. "This is not about Community Board 9. It's a matter of geography."
Those geographical divisions were quite clear after a recent snowstorm, when one side of Tremont Avenue, a main thoroughfare, was cleaned immediately, while it took sanitation workers two more days to plow the other side.
But the proposed plan faces an uncertain future. Councilwoman Lucy Cruz, whose district encompasses Westchester Square, said she opposes redrawing the boundaries and that few residents have complained about lack of service.
"They probably get more service because of the interlapping," Ms. Cruz said. GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

A New Crane to Help Lift Up a Sagging Port

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
One of the last of New York City's bustling ports, the Red Hook Marine Terminal, will gain a refurbished, high-tech crane next week.
In a major feat of marine engineering, the 70-ton, 120-foot-tall crane will be placed on a special rail-track barge and floated about two miles north along Upper New York Bay from the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park, where it has been perched idly for years. 
 It is the latest in a series of moves to revitalize the faded waterfront terminal, which has suffered through decades of neglect as the shipping industry has shifted from New York to New Jersey, said Chris Ward, senior vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. The crane transfer will cost about $500,000.
The city bought the $7 million crane more than eight years ago to shuttle containers, the metal boxes about the size of a rail car in which most cargo is now shipped, at the 39th Street Pier at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But as the huge container ships shifted to high-capacity ports in New Jersey, the terminal focused on bulk freight, primarily cocoa, and the crane was idled.
Councilwoman Joan Griffin McCabe, who represents Sunset Park and Red Hook, said: "Nothing's happening at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal that would require the use of the crane. It's not as if we're taking anything away from Sunset Park."
The Red Hook terminal generally serves smaller steamship lines that carry containers of lumber and plywood, salt, clothing, radios, television and bulk steel.
In 1992, the terminal's seven berths handled 53,000 containers. But last year the level fell to about 25,000 containers -- an average of four ships a week -- as most of the terminal's clients opted for New Jersey, said Sal F. Catucci, chief executive of American Stevedoring of Elizabeth, N.J. In January, Mr. Catucci's company signed a seven-year lease for the Red Hook terminal with the Port Authority.
"Given the proper equipment, we can get business back to New York Harbor and make Red Hook more attractive," said Mr. Catucci, who has nicknamed the crane Alexander, after his first grandchild.
Mr. Ward said the capacity added by the new crane was expected to attract more ships and provide hundreds of jobs.
In other moves to help the terminal, the city, state and Port Authority spent $3.2 million last year to finance a barge service from New Jersey to Red Hook. The barge, which began running about a year ago, allows customers to receive and deliver on both sides of the Hudson, said Roy Jaeger, assistant director of the port department of the Port Authority. And the authority has dedicated $9 million to revitalize the terminal, including rehabilitating storage sheds, over the next year.
Lou Pernice, secretary-treasurer of the International Longshoremen's Association, said he was not impressed with the first step of the revitalization. He said the crane could bring in a relatively insignificant number of jobs.
"This crane is going to replace something that should have been done some time ago," Mr. Pernice said. "This move will simply help the port become more efficient. I don't think it's going to add anything." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LONG ISLAND CITY;
For the Giants of Retail, the Rules of the Game

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
New York is one of the last frontiers for modern megastores, partly because of zoning restrictions dating back 20 years. Now the Giuliani administration is wrestling with whether to lower those barriers to draw more of the giant stores to the city.
The barriers originated in a 1974 zoning law intended to curb the loss of hundreds of thousands of factory jobs. That law bars stores larger than 10,000 square feet in manufacturing zones, to keep retail development from driving up real estate prices and factory overhead. 
 Inconsistent provisions placed no size limit on hardware, office supply and toy stores -- a loophole that years later gave Home Depot, Staples and Toys 'R' Us entry to the city while other megastores, like Kmart and Loehmann's, were prohibited and had to go through an long appeals process for the chance of a variance.
Despite the law, factory payrolls continued to plunge -- and because of the law, retail commerce also suffered. Store sales in the boroughs outside Manhattan lagged far behind their suburban rivals.
If the city had its fair share of retail, studies indicate, it could gain 50,000 jobs, billions of dollars in sales and hundreds of millions in taxes.
The Dinkins administration last year proposed opening most manufacturing zones to stores of up to 100,000 square feet.
Now Mayor Giuliani faces the issue, with its prickly political, economic and neighborhood implications. Although his administration is viewed as pro-business and free market, Mr. Giuliani as a candidate was cautious on megastores, urging a case-by-case review. That reflected the concerns of small merchants, many of them his supporters, who fear big-store competitors.
Indeed, Queens is now home to several megastore disputes. Home Depot recently opened in South Ozone Park over neighborhood opposition and a fight on its zoning. Now a battle is shaping up over a proposed Pathmark in Astoria.
Some studies suggest that these fears are unfounded, and John S. Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for economic development, agrees. And would more stores would drive out manufacturing jobs? Planners say the demand for retail space would leave ample room for factories.
Mr. Dyson said that he and the city's Planning Director, Joseph B. Rose, hope to complete a proposal for the Mayor soon. The process, including review by the planners, community boards and borough presidents and adoption by the City Council -- could take more than a year.
Mr. Dyson said the change would be well worth it to the city. "It's plain to me that if the big stores don't get built within the city limits," he said, "they will be built outside the city." B.L.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LONG ISLAND CITY;
Northern Boulevard, Megastore Central?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Legend has it that Northern Boulevard follows the route of ancient Indian paths. In more recent decades, the thoroughfare has led a more prosaic existence, lined with aging warehouses and factories and a string of automobile dealers. Suddenly in the 1990's, however, it is becoming a major urban retail center.
"It certainly is a hot megastore retail strip, a natural land-use change that the market is dictating," said Jack Rainey, executive director of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation. 
 The latest merchandiser to join the cluster of large stores in the area is Tops, the expanding suburban discount appliance chain. In its first venture into New York City, Tops plans to open a 75,000-square-foot store this fall at 50-01 Northern Boulevard. Its showroom space will match the chain's largest, at its Secaucus branch. The new site is in Long Island City near Woodside, Sunnyside and Astoria.
Kmart could well be the next addition: It is considering moving into the old Ronzoni pasta factory site opposite Tops, a decision that would symbolize the sweeping reversals in the New York economy. After 43 years, Ronzoni shut down the plant last summer and moved to Virginia, a course similar to that followed by many city manufacturers in search of cheaper overhead.
Several major retailers, including Price Club, are said to be considering the site. Kmart appears to be the most serious, although it has not announced its intentions. "A Kmart would do good there," Mr. Delis said, "and it would be an asset to the area."
Pathmark was the area's first major retail pioneer when it built a superstore on the boulevard in 1977. That remained the lone outpost until 1990, when Pergament and Toys 'R' Us opened adjacent stores on nearby 48th Street. Last year the Staples chain opened a branch on Broadway.
Not everyone welcomes the trend. Nearly 20 years ago Julian Wager was arrested in a street blockade against the Pathmark project. Today, as president of the Steinway Merchants Association and chairman of the Commercial Committee of Community Board 1, he is still opposed.
"I am not thrilled by the prospect of these stores going in there," Mr. Wager said. "They don't belong there. The roads and traffic can't deal with it. They cause bottlenecks the likes of which you've never seen."
But Mr. Rainey said, "When Pergament came in, the Sunnyside community's worst fears about traffic were not realized."
Another objection comes from small neighborhood merchants, who say they suffer from the big competitors.
Replied Mr. Rainey, "I don't know if that's the case, but we're bound to find out." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Where Cocoa Is King

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
ON the Sunset Park waterfront, alongside the 110 acres that make up the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, waters are still and twisted steel piers are burned out and littered with garbage. The streets nearby are deserted, except for the occasional patron sliding into the local topless bar. Empty warehouses stand as ghostly relics of an age when New York boasted one of the busiest ports in the world.
But behind the high wire fences on 39th Street the other day, 100 longshoremen were unloading almost 8,000 tons of Nigerian cocoa from a freighter. As the sun beat on the wharf, 140-pound bags were piling up quickly, 15 feet high, in the half-mile-long warehouse. Soon trains would rumble on the tracks that curve around the warehouse and transport cocoa beans to the factories of Nestle, Hershey and other chocolate makers. 
That so many tons of cocoa beans are stacked up on a Brooklyn dock is a result of a decision the city made to cash in on the growing demand for chocolate. In 1989, New York set up a cocoa port on the 39th Street wharf, which since then has become the nation's third largest port of entry for cocoa -- still far behind Norfolk, Va., but catching up with Philadelphia.
Importers now complain that sometimes there is not enough space to store all the cocoa beans passing through New York. So they are pleased by the city's plans to expand the cocoa port -- either by adding an $11 million warehouse nearby, a proposal by former Mayor David N. Dinkins, or, more modestly, by converting a coffee bean warehouse on 23d Street.
The Giuliani administration will choose one plan in a few weeks, said Chris Ward, senior vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "The city is committed to expanding the cocoa operations," he said. "Cocoa is clearly the growth commodity. It's the underpinning of the rejuvenation of the South Brooklyn Terminal."
Until the early 1960's, when New York City began rolling down its sleeves and buttoning down its collar, it had the world's greatest concentration of cargo piers. Then the city lost most of its shipping to ports in Newark and Elizabeth, which had modern container ship terminals.
A generation ago, New York was actually the leading port of entry for cocoa beans, but high costs and the lack of a warehouse devoted exclusively to cocoa sent beans south. In 1988, before the cocoa port opened, New York City and Albany accounted for 29,613 tons of cocoa, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. By last year, the figure had climbed to 83,346 tons, with New York City taking more than two-thirds of it.
The rise in New York's cocoa imports has been accompanied by a decline in incoming coffee beans. Cocoa imports last year, mostly from West African nations, were nearly 40 percent above the figure for 1989; coffee fell by more than 50 percent. "We see more of an influx of cocoa and a continuing decline in coffee," said Douglas Martocci, president of Continental Terminals, the city's largest warehouse for both commodities.
In part, coffee has slid because Americans drink about 25 percent less than they did three decades ago. But the immediate cause in New York is that coffee brewers, like auto makers and other manufacturers in search of lower costs and low-paid workers, have taken their factories from the East Coast to Southern states. Most notably, in 1992, Maxwell House padlocked its sprawling plant in Hoboken, once the largest coffee producer in the world, and consolidated its East Coast operations in Jacksonville, Fla. Just a year before, Hills Brothers abandoned its plant in Edgewater, N.J., for a plant in Virginia.
With the area's two biggest roasters gone, New York, which ranked second to New Orleans as the nation's top coffee port in 1989, slipped to fourth place last year.
Thus, one of the city's proposals is to transform a coffee storehouse into a cocoa warehouse, adding 300,000 square feet of cocoa storage space. One drawback, city officials say, is that the use of an existing building would do nothing to rejuvenate the waterfront. It would also steal space from coffee, which, though slipping, still accounted for 143,033 tons of imports last year.
Why can't cocoa and coffee co-exist under one roof? The smell of cocoa beans would spoil the coffee, said Gerald Ponsiglione, vice president of Continental Terminals, which leases the cocoa and coffee ports from the city. And cocoa beans are delicate.
Checking a pile of the cocoa bags from Nigeria, Mr. Ponsiglione scooped up a handful of beans, pointing out the spoiled ones with black shells and hardened insides. He said the bag had probably leaned against metal in the vessel, preventing the beans from breathing. "It's especially risky at this time of the year," Mr. Ponsiglione added, "with the beans going suddenly from a warm to a very cold climate."
The city's other plan calls for the construction of the $11 million warehouse next to the cocoa operation on 39th Street. The cost of simply renovating the coffee port would be substantially less, though the city has provided no figures. For the new 250,000-square-foot building, $6 million would come from the state and the rest from the city's capital budget. Among the potential economic spin-offs are 100 jobs to build the warehouse and 80 jobs to operate it, as well as $10 million in tax revenues over 25 years.
"The downside," Mr. Ward said, "is spending $11 million, which might be better allocated on other waterfront projects."
Johann J. Scheu, president of the Cocoa Merchants' Association of America, said that for cocoa importers, a port's efficiency and low rates are more important than its proximity to manufacturers. Referring to Norfolk, he added: "The industry has been somewhat concerned that it was concentrating in only one location." Cocoa importers have urged Philadelphia and New York to modernize their equipment, to compete better with Norfolk. Mr. Scheu pointed to changes between 1992 and 1993: Norfolk lost about 74,000 tons, while New York and Philadelphia gained a combined 89,000 tons.
City officials are hoping for even greater gains. In their dreams, New York will be known as much for cocoa beans as Coco Chanels. "We are committed to capturing the cocoa," Mr. Ward said.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Firemen in Waiting

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
FIREFIGHTERS spend most of their time waiting, fidgeting benchwarmers at a game they can only anticipate. While they wait, they make their own beds, scrub their own toilets, polish their truck (they call it an apparatus). In full fire regalia, they take their shiny red truck to the supermarket, then cook feasts together. They drill on techniques, lift weights, watch television and read mountains of Playboys dating back more than a decade.
At Ladder Company 176, in a tattered corner of Brooklyn, firefighters go about their tasks with a camaraderie found in few groups outside the Boy Scouts. (Women are still a rarity, accounting for just 35 of the city's 11,800 firefighters.) In fact, the men like their jobs so much they routinely arrive an hour or so early. 
 Despite the probability that most will be injured at least twice during their careers, the undisputed high point of their day is a fire; Ladder Company 176 puts out some 40 a month (more than most units but less than one just a few miles away, in Crown Heights), and responds to about 30 false alarms as well as sundry emergencies, from a cat up a tree to a domestic dispute to a woman giving birth.
But to firefighters, anything less than a glorious conflagration -- especially an "occupied structural work," a burning building in which people are trapped -- ranks only slightly higher than snarling guard dogs.
"Anything else is like kissing your sister," allowed John T. Vigiano, the company commander, who won a bout with smoke-induced throat cancer a decade ago. "Everything seems to come up two or three notches when there's a good fire. It's like a game."
Despite the heroics, the Fire Department has its critics. One of the most vocal is Raymond D. Horton, president of the watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission, who contends that firefighters misuse their time. He argues that since urban fires are started by people, people can prevent them. And firefighters, whose duties are defined in union contracts, should be busier conducting inspections, enforcing regulation and educating people. "A perfectly functioning Fire Department would go out of business," he says.
Such revolutionary thinking goes against the machismo grain, though Ladder Company 176 now does inspections two half-days a week. "Firefighters don't want to do building inspections; they don't want to do housework," says Captain Vigiano, a 32-year veteran. "They want to go to fires."
A ladder company's function is to find the fire, ventilate the rooms and rescue people trapped inside, while the engine company's job is to actually put out the fire. Ladder Company 176 and Engine Company 233 share a modern firehouse, situated where the neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Brownsville converge, an economically bedraggled area of vacant lots, storefront churches and Chinese takeout places with bulletproof glass.
 9 A.M. A typical day at Ladder Company 176 begins with roll call. Firefighters work a seemingly haphazard pattern of shifts, a schedule adopted after World War II that has never been changed. They do nine-hour tours on two succeeding days, take 48 hours off, work two 15-hour shifts, then take 72 hours off. Each month, they get an additional day off to keep the workweek to 40 hours.
At roll call the ladder company's five firefighters and one officer are assigned duties. One man, the driver, is also expected to coordinate things outside a burning building. Today he is Cornell Horne, an affable Vietnam veteran who is quick to send flowers to a sick colleague. Mike Pagano, a second-generation firefighter known for his physical and emotional strength, is designated the forcible-entry, or irons, man. He uses an ax and other tools to fight his way to a fire while a colleague carries an extingusher. The extinguisher bearer, or can man, will be Jim Mills, a new fireman who radiates enthusiasm. Jack Sweeney, whose father served for more than 35 years, will be in charge of "lateral ventilation," through windows and walls. The roof man, Thomas Farragher, a 12-year veteran, is responsible for "vertical ventilation."
"Very few jobs have as much instant gratification," says Mr. Farragher. "You're there, and you don't leave until it's out."
9:23 A.M. The alarm sounds -- a smooth series of beeps. Then bells ring -- two summon the engine company, three the ladder company and four both. Most often, both go.
A few men slide down two gleaming brass poles from the living quarters, where there is a study, lounge and dormitory for snatching naps in work clothes. The men move briskly, putting on their leather helmets, coats and boots with practiced motions. They don't run, to avoid bumping into one another. The idea is to quicken response time rather than speeding in traffic. Talk is crisp and factual as the men pile into the cab and race toward an apartment building in East New York.
Some motorists pull to the side, but others seem oblivious even to the deafening horn (the department has shifted to European-style electronic sirens, less damaging to hearing than the old-fashioned whine).
At the apartment building, which houses the mentally ill, it turns out a resident threatened to set fire to his neighbor's apartment. The police, who automatically answer fire alarms, take over.
Minutes later, as the truck wends its way back to the firehouse, a beeping is heard. Another alarm, this one in Brownsville. "I can see smoke," says Mr. Horne. The atmosphere is tense, and they strain to see smoke as they approach. A burning mattress has been thrown in an air shaft. The firefighters drag it outside and extinguish it. A skylight is opened to ventilate the shaft. End of job.
10:35 A.M. Next stop is Met Foods. Mr. Horne stays in the truck to monitor the computer, which sounds alarms and provides addresses and any known details (a central computer processes all fire calls in the borough and automatically assigns companies).
The other firefighters, led by Mr. Pagano, today's designated chef, keep in contact with Mr. Horne via radio. At Met Foods they buy five loaves of Italian bread, Goya red kidney beans and other fixings for chili, a Pagano specialty. He attributes his culinary expertise to TV cooking shows and tricks picked up from firefighters.
The men tip their helmets, a department tradition, to female customers as they pass in the aisles. Each man's share for food will be $5.
11:05 A.M. A call comes from a woman who thinks she is breathing toxic fumes. The firefighters and their officer, Lieut. Philip McDonnell, nicknamed the Sheriff, agree the oil burner and chimney in her tenement need to be fixed. They shut off the furnace and begin the paperwork to force the owner to make repairs. He has up to 16 days, which could mean the building will be cold until then.
"The woman probably thought we could just come over and fix it," says Lieutenant McDonnell. "We can't."
12:53 P.M. Mr. Mills, a firefighter for only nine months, pulls the ladders out of the truck and begins washing them. He is quickly joined by the others, who have finished helping Mr. Pagano chop vegetables for chili.
Firefighters must have a high school education and complete an eight-week course. Before joining the department, Mr. Mills was a police officer for eight years, rising to detective in a Brooklyn anti-crime unit. He is critical of police life. "The managers here go into the fires with you," he says. "Police captains sit in their offices. Then they second-guess what you do four days later." A son and nephew of firefighters, he says it is the bonds between comrades he most values. Referring to Mr. Pagano, he says, "When I come to work and he's working, my confidence goes up."
1:30 P.M. Motivated by thoughts of an alarm, the men gobble down huge platters of rice and chili. "It's not good for your stomach, but you get used to it," Mr. Horne says.
The scene -- firefighters gathered at the table, boots and rubber slickers arrayed in neat rows -- fits the children's book stereotype. Except that this company has never favored high-strung Dalmatians, a traditional horse-stable dog that became a firehouse regular when apparatuses were truly horse-powered. The firehouse has been dogless since the even-tempered Snotsy, a former stray, was run over by a car. But there is no shortage of nonhuman companions. There are two boa constrictors, a python, a baby alligator, four chinchillas and a half-dozen tanks of large tropical fish.
2:10 P.M. The company is on its way to shovel snow from around hydrants and inspect them for storm damage. Mr. Horne, puffing a postprandial cigar, flips on the siren. "I want everybody to know I'm coming," he says.
As the engine cruises, the firefighters see sites they have fought big fires. They point to buildings, quizzing one another on how to approach a fire. After 3 P.M., with students dismissed from school, radio activity picks up as children pull alarm boxes: more false alarms to go out on.
4:03 P.M. Captain Vigiano, who is working the night shift, arrives early. Between battles with a stack of paperwork, he recalls growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and how nice it was to walk with his grandmother to a little bakery on Sundays. He learned his trade as the area burned in the late 60's, when arson was common and there were as many as 38 calls a night for Ladder Company 176.
The result, he says, was that firefighters quickly got on-the-job experience. But he doesn't think the job has become easier. Today's double-paned windows delay discovery of fires and make temperatures higher. There are toxic fumes from plastics. Anti-burglary devices complicate firefighting. "We had more work, so we got better," he says. "They don't have the work and face more obstacles."
5 P.M. The first shift ends, but many hang around. Dinner, arroz con pollo, will be served at 7:30 around the handsome wood table the men built themselves.
"If you had a son and you wanted him to be a firefighter," Captain Vigiano says, "this is where you'd want him to learn his trade."

The I.B.M. Circle: Still Unbroken

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
IN the years of its dominance, the International Business Machines Corporation was a one-of-a-kind behemoth employer, an elite, life-long womb to which only the best and brightest aspired and were granted entry. So it's not surprising that the 150,000-plus employees who did not survive into the company's post-dominance era would be inclined to stay in touch with each other.
That at least is what Alexander Auerbach, a public relations executive who once covered I.B.M. as a financial journalist, figured as he was driving down the Ventura Freeway in Los Angeles one day last year listening to a National Public Radio story on downsizing at the Armonk, N.Y.-based company. As the story came over the air, he hatched the idea of a publication that would provide news, advice and contacts for the thousands of employees who had been and would be nudged and pushed off the I.B.M. plank. "Two exits later, I had a business plan," Mr. Auerbach joked. 
 This month he published the first issue of Out of the Blue, eight pages of items and tidbits designed to keep the company's alumni around the country at one with their cultural roots, and to help them cope with the shock of separation.
Changes in the work force, especially downsizing, have inspired other startup publications. Hunt-Scanlon, the Greenwich, Conn., publisher of an executive search newsletter, has just mailed out the first issue of Workplace America, which tracks numbers on layoffs as well as career and work trends. And other companies have in-house newsletters and magazines that are sometimes sent to former employees.
But I.B.M. is one of the few companies whose former employees could or would support an independent publication.
"I.B.M. had a unique culture. When people worked there, they bought in," said Rick Weiner, Out of the Blue's editor and a 26-year I.B.M. veteran who took early retirement last year when his job in corporate communications was eliminated. "It was a wonderful corporation. It demanded a lot, but it gave a lot. People who were there so long considered themselves as part of an extended family."
The deep, family-like attachments explain some of the difficulties I.B.M. employees have shifting to the outside world. Not only are many of the downsizees past the point in their careers when shifting gears is uncomplicated, but also, as the lead article, on life after I.B.M., notes, in I.B.M. parlance an employee who leaves the company is said to have "left the business."
"The expression implies that there is nothing else in the computer industry, and maybe not much else of real interest in the business world," writes Emily Andren, who left the company in 1992 and is now a freelance writer. The toll that attitude takes on the identities of workers cut loose is evident in the anger, sadness and confusion of some of the former employees whose stories Ms. Andren tells.
The overall tone of the newsletter, on the other hand, is optimistic. The words "Big Blue Meanie" never appear. The approach was chosen deliberately, Mr. Auerbach said, in part because he is not eager to mix it up with the still-wealthy and powerful organization, but also because he has a message to deliver. "People need to focus on tomorrow, not yesterday," he said. "Investing a lot of emotion in what I.B.M. 'coulda-shoulda' done is pretty pointless."
MOREOVER, Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Weiner agree that however painful the layoffs and changes have been for particular individuals, it was necessary to save the company and the 200,000 jobs it will eventually represent. "The company is facing economic reality," Mr. Weiner said. "It's treating people as well as it can."
The newsletter would not hesitate to publish a critical article, he said, but it is not out to throw darts. Indeed, Paul Carroll's gleeful 1993 evisceration of the company, "Big Blues: The Unmaking of I.B.M.," is favorably reviewed, but without dwelling on what looks to many outsiders like ineptitude on a huge scale. Like the newsletter's other writers, the reviewer worked at I.B.M. The first issue also contains an assessment of I.B.M.'s stock prospects; a first-person account of the perils of moving from a New York City suburb to a small island off the North Carolina coast, and a jobs bulletin board.
What happens to the newsletter once I.B.M. has finished its convulsions and has settled into whatever fate its current employees and executives fashion for it? Can it survive the recovery from mourning of former employees who move on emotionally and materially? The I.B.M. alums, many of whom are in their 40's and 50's, are in the prime advice-receiving years. They are thinking, Mr. Auerbach said, about "everything from being in the sandwich generation to preparing for retirement." Because of their backgrounds, brains and general lack of interest in going to seed, they are also a group employers and investors -- more potential subscribers -- are likely to be interested in. So his publication may not last forever, but then, Mr. Auerbach points out, neither did Look or The Saturday Evening Post.
Information on Out of the Blue, which costs $39.95 a year, is available at 800-871-2583 or P.O. Box 56044, Sherman Oaks, Calif. 91413.
 
 
 
THE LAY OF THE LAND FOR LAYOFFS
IT is quite possible that no newsletter will ever fill the gap left by the demise of Workplace Trends, a feisty, fervently pro-employee bimonthly that disappeared when its editor, Dan Lacey, died early last year. Workplace America, the new newsletter from the Hunt-Scanlon Publishing Company in Greenwich, Conn., is considerably more buttoned-down than Workplace Trends, but to some degree it picks up where Mr. Lacey left off. It provides, for example, a tabulation of fourth-quarter layoff announcements, a vivid reminder that the current recovery is a macroeconomic event not of immediate relevance to many workers.
Workplace America's impetus was simple enough: "Because the workplace is changing so much," said Christopher W. Hunt, the newsletter's editor. "Some of the stories we covered aretestimony to that: flextime, harassment and job layoffs." Mr. Hunt plans to publish the newsletter five or six times a year for Hunt-Scanlon's audience of human resources and executive search specialists and job-seekers. For the latter, the daunting list of layoffs may be counter-balanced by another item, entitled "An 'Out of Work' Executive Could Be Your Best Candidate."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 1994, Sunday; March 27, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The At Work column last Sunday about a newsletter for former I.B.M. employees referred incorectly to The Saturday Evening Post. The magazine is published six times each year; it has not ceased publication.
A brief report on March 13 with the At Work column, about employment newsletters, misstated the date of the death of Dan Lacey, the editor of Workplace Trends. It was Sept. 21, 1992, not early last year.

HEADLINE: Highlighting Hair, Women's Ultimate Crowning Achievement

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
RAPUNZEL let hers down. Delilah had Samson's cut off. Medusa's was turned to serpents.
"A woman's hair, which completely replenishes itself, is a powerful symbol defined by myth, traditions, modern concepts and media hype, which influences colors, style and care," Dr. Connie Koppelman of Setauket said. "It can signify age, conformity, mourning, rebellion, punishment, servitude and sex appeal. How can the acceptance of a variety of hair styles move society toward the acceptance of a diversity of life styles?" 
 In June, Dr. Koppelman presented a paper to the National Women's Studies Association in Washington on "The Politics of Hair." Her research took a multicultural approach toward hair as a symbol of power and powerlessness. She discussed how, throughout history and cultures, women's hair, especially, had been styled to show beauty, removed to cause humiliation and interpreted as a sign of strength or weakness.
Hair can determine social, economic, intellectual and marital status or religious affiliation.
Dr. Koppelman has degrees in art history, library science and in American history. She became active in the women's movement in 1972 as an intern at the Whitney Museum of American Art, when a critic, Lucy Lippard, became her mentor.
"That was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life," Dr. Koppelman said. "It was during the Conceptual Art movement. I was present at the first all-women's art exhibition in January 1973 in New York City held at the Huntington Hartford Museum near Columbus Circle."
For five years Dr. Koppelman has been an adjunct lecturer in the women's studies program at the State University at Stony Brook, where she directs the programming in March for women's history month.
"I had always been interested in how women were treated in advertising and the emphasis on beauty rather than brains," she said.
She started her research on hair after a presentation by the African studies department on how advertising affects women's hair. "During my research," Dr. Koppelman said, "I began to have some doubts about my own hair. I stopped coloring it and I cut the front shorter, left the back longer, showing my own ambivalence."
When planning the program for this year she teamed with Norma Cohen, executive director of the Smithtown Township Arts Council. The exhibition is an outgrowth of Dr. Koppelman's paper and Ms. Cohen's resources of hundreds of artists and a national advertisement for related art work.
The show, "Hair: The Long and Short of It," includes 89 artists and begins today at the Mills Pond House in St. James with a presentation by Dr. Koppelman.
Michele Brangwen of Bellerose, who performs with the City Ballet of Houston, will discuss hair and its relation to dance. A video that she choreographed and performed, "The Lone Star Dances," will be shown.
A workshop for children is scheduled for March 19.
The exhibition, which runs until April 17, is financed by the State Council on the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well money from L'Oreal.
"We had no idea what kind of response we would get, but we were flooded with enthusiastic artists," Dr. Koppelman said. "We saw the potential that a head of hair has to communicate public messages."
The cultures reflected are as diverse in shape, form, color and texture as hair itself. All the artists were invited to submit statements about their work.
The spiritual power imputed to hair can traced back from the sun. The early settlers of India referred to their solar god as having "the flaming hair," and the Aztecs' God of Declining Day had "abundant hair."
Rhoda Sherbell of Westbury, whose polychromed bronze of Casey Stengel was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in 1981, and whose bronze of Aaron Copland has been approved for acquisition, is exhibiting a bonded bronze called "Out of Africa, the Legacy."
After extensive travel through Africa "from the Horn to the Cape," Ms. Sherbell said, she found beauty as well as horror in some of the cultural practices. Her sculpture in St. James was created after a visit to east Africa.
"Hair has always reflected the society that it belongs to, and especially in Africa it has different styles and meanings," Ms. Sherbell wrote in her statement. "Heads are covered, veiled, shaved, braided, adorned with medals, painted with animal fat or covered with cowry shells, as in my sculpture, to signify female sexuality and currency. All the designing has to do with the inextricable practice of ancestral and spirit worship from religious rites to the rite of passage."
Because the African cowry shells cannot be taken out of Africa she used shells from the Philippines. The elaborate sculpture makes a statement about how a woman presents herself. "With a head of shells she is an important person in her group," Ms. Sherbell said.
Alex Gardega of Huntington, who attended the School of Visual Arts and the Fashion Institute of Technology, has been etching glass for six years, much of it relating to mythology. Drawn to the subject of Medusa he began experimenting with oil paint and etching on glass to create between the hair and the face "just enough tension between the two."
Mr. Gardega's Medusa poses the question: "What if a woman with a normal face had such awful hair? What if she had classical beauty, how would she be looked at? How much are women today judged by something they have limited control over?"
He chose to paint a peaceful Madonna-like face contrasted by serpent hair, placing her as a victim of the snakes. Perhaps, he said, that would make people look for a deeper meaning.
A monotype print of a kabuki actor and onnagata, Tamasaburo Bando, is a subject for Susan Carter Carter of Port Jefferson, a printmaker who is also an adjunct professor of art at Suffolk Community College. "In kabuki just a few strands of hair out of place can convey distraught emotions," Ms. Carter Carter said. "I elaborate on that and use the hair as a compositional device."
Since a college summer program took her to Tokyo in 1969, Ms. Carter Carter has used Oriental imagery. In 1974, after much debate, Ms. Carter Carter braided for the final time her own 10 years' worth of hair, reaching midthigh. She said her hair had been a source for endless comments, conversations, jokes and wonder, which evoked offers to touch, brush, cut and even purchase it.
After the cutting, she said, "I remember it so warm, like an animal sitting in my lap." Her hair had come to symbolize the embodiment of a whole period in her life, she said.
Twenty years later and inspired by the theme of the exhibition, Ms. Carter Carter has created a reliquary for her braid, "a more noble resting place." It is three feet long.
When Miriam Cassell of Sea Cliff saw the call for slides in the Smithtown Township Arts Council newsletter, she said, "I had been working on an installation piece in celebration of having green hair for 10 years."
The hues in her hair, to match her eyes, added to her natural red hair. "I've been called a piece of walking art," Ms. Cassell said.
Much of her art work is serious and emotional, and her looks provide a balance, a sense of comic relief, she realized. "When you add color to a canvas or to yourself, you really bring joy to other people," she said. The 10 X 7-foot hanging consists of 47 pieces showing different ways of hair coloring, with a screaming green-haired Ms. Cassell in the center.
Ms. Cassell said she always used her body to create art forms. Accompanying "Performance Art" is a book construction. The mannequin with an elaborate headdress holds her artist's statement.
"My hair is my crowning artistic effect," Ms. Cassell said. "People react to my hair as a mirror reflection of who they are. It creates humor, tension, envy, intimidation, shock, anger, curiosity, but never neutrality. People either compliment or criticize, but I take their reactions in stride. My art evolves and envelops me because I know hair today, gone tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Fishermen and Other Residents Rally To Fight Ferryboats as Threat to Way of Life

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN 

DATELINE: BELFORD

 BODY:
FOR more than 200 years, the resilient fishermen from this tiny Raritan Bay village have battled severe storms at sea and heavy flooding in port. In recent years, they have voiced concerns about overregulation from what they say are too many overlapping state and Federal agencies, as well as water pollution, declining fish stocks and a growing public awareness of the need for safety in eating seafood.
They know they are in a fragile industry. But now the fishermen from the port of Belford, the last major commercial fishing enclave in New Jersey's Bayshore area and a strong economic force in the region, are facing what they call their biggest survival challenge ever: ferryboats and commuters. 
 They have vowed to save the Belford Seafood Cooperative Association's historic fishing sanctuary in Compton's Creek from a $16 million Monmouth County government plan to build a neighboring ferry terminal, a 1,200-car parking lot and other buildings on 40 acres. The co-op says the project "will squeeze us out and destroy us."
The co-op generates about $4 million in sales yearly, including revenue from a retail store here. It provides about 300 jobs and brings about $10 million into the local economy, fishermen say. The Belford-based fleet consists of about 70 vessels.
But Middletown Township's recently elected Mayor, Joseph W. Oxley, who lives in Belford, sees the ferry project and other Bayshore plans as a "major plus for the area" -- one that will, he said, increase property values.
The ferries would make the 18-to-20-nautical-mile trip to Manhattan in 45 minutes. The county says they could complement or perhaps replace ferry service now operating out of Highlands and Atlantic Highlands. About 450 commuters make the trip now each weekday, and a study projects that the number could grow to 1,200 to 1,400 riders by the year 2,000.
The ferry project is one component of a plan to revitalize the Bayshore region, which encompasses nine municipalities in Monmouth County and four in Middlesex County along Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays. It involves a county park, a hiking and biking trail and possibly some private commercial development in the Port Monmouth area. It is unclear whether that project will become a reality.
 
'A Question of Navigation'
 "Fishing boats and ferryboats just don't mix in a narrow channel," contends Richard T. Isaksen, a third-generation fisherman who lives here and owns a 65-foot trawler, the Iasetta, named after the first working boat his father ever had. Mr. Isaken's 17-year-old son, the next generation, is one of his crew on the 100-mile, three-day trips out into the Atlantic Ocean.
"This is a question of navigation, a question of safety." Mr. Isaksen said. "The time has come for us to draw the line. We are going to fight this to the end."
The fishermen say they are alarmed that plans are to bring in three ferryboats into the creek. They say the ingress and the egress at the mouth of the creek are too narrow to allow the safe passage of a 40-foot-wide ferry and a 25-foot-wide fishing boat in the 75-foot-wide channel.
"Just another negotiating tactic on the fishermen," said Henry R. Nicholson, the director of the Monmouth County division of transportation and one of the small army of county employees and hired consultants involved with this and other proposed Bayshore area development projects. "We've been through this before with them." Mr. Nicholson said. "What we are planning will help preserve the fishing industry in Belford, not eliminate it. The fishermen will have to learn to share. Our consultants tell us there is no safety problem."
 
Impact of Traffic Feared
 The fishermen do not agree with that, nor do a group of 135 Belford residents who have formed the rapidly expanding Belford Citizens Association, which fears the impact of the heavy commuter traffic on their narrow streets.
They say their quality of life is at risk and so is the very character of Belford, a section of modest homes on small lots along the north and south sides of Route 36 in Middletown Township, which is Monmouth County's largest municipality with about 68,000 residents. Belford has about 4,500 residents.
"That's typical of the arrogance and the lack of concern we are getting from the county," said Patricia Cusick, who lives with her husband, Thomas, on Main Street, the main pathway for the automobile traffic. The commuters are expected to come from nearby wealthy areas, a source of irritation to the Belford people.
Plans for an access road from Route 36 to the proposed ferry terminal were eliminated after wetlands problems developed. Mrs. Cusick said residents were not informed of the change.
The Cusicks were among the chief organizers of the citizens' group last July, when, they said, hundreds of large dump trucks suddenly started rumbling into Belford, filled to the brim with dirt, to be used to cap an old landfill near the proposed ferry terminal site.
"No one told us a thing," Mrs. Cusick said. "We could not get any answers from the county. Township officials and the police said they knew nothing about it. One day, 240 trucks came in and then left our town. Children were not allowed out. You can see why we seriously question the county's credibility."
Strong political pressures eventually brought the trucking to a halt. The county has now authorized a $55,000 study by its engineer to investigate the possibility of excavating soil from the area surrounding the landfill to be used to cover the landfill. County Administrator Robert J. Collins took the blame for authorizing the trucks' dirt deliveries and apologized to the Belford residents.
"The only bright side to that whole terrible and outrageous episode was that we realized what we were up against and had galvanized the fishermen and the people of Belford into action," said Paul V. Chaballa Jr., a Belford resident who is active in the association. "We don't have all the attorneys and the consultants that they have. But we do have people who are willing to work for what is right."
 
Finding a New Ally
 And now the fishermen and the residents have a new ally in Andrew J. Willner, who keeps an eye on Raritan Bay as the baykeeper for the American Littoral Society's New York-New Jersey harbor program. The society is a national conservation organization based on nearby Sandy Hook.
"The Belford ferry project should be scrapped as rapidly as possible," said Mr. Willner, an environmental advocate. "It doesn't belong there. There are alternative sites for it in the Bayshore if, indeed, another ferry site is needed."
Mr. Willner said the county and its ferry consultants, TAMS, an engineering, architectural and planning firm from Boston, and its New York affiliate, Howard/Stein-Hudson Associates Inc., never contacted him.
"This is a classic example of how people in a traditional community are being impacted by forces from outside the community who know nothing about the community," Mr. Willner said.
 
Planning Board Review
 Another potential supporter of the fishermen's position is Judith H. Stanley, chairwoman of the Middletown Planning Board and also the president of the Monmouth County Conservation Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving open spaces.
Though the ferry project does not need Planning Board approval, it must go before that body for review. Mrs. Stanley said she would study "very, very carefully" its total impact on Belford, which, she added, "has a great deal of history, beauty and charm."
Clyde L. MacKenzie Jr., a fisheries biologist at the James J. Howard Marine Laboratory at Sandy Hook, said, "I hope the fishermen win this one." Mr. MacKenzie, who is the author of a book, "The Fisheries of Raritan Bay," published recently by the Rutgers University Press, added: "It's obvious the people who are proposing this do not know what they are talking about. Ferries and condominiums don't belong in Belford."
 
An Official Willing to Listen
 Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat from the Sixth Congressional District, of which the Bayshore area is a part, has become what Thomas Schnoor, a fourth-generation fisherman, calls a "savior" for the fishing industry. Mr. Schnoor is the president of the Belford Co-Op, the umbrella organization for its 38 members and 31 independent fishermen.
Mrs. Cusick said Mr. Pallone was the only major elected official willing to listen with a promise to take action to benefit the fishermen and Belford residents.
Ronald Schnoor of Belford, a third-generation fisherman, treasurer of the co-op board and Thomas Schnoor's uncle, said the next step would be to take the ferry issue directly to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. "It's time someone from Trenton looked at this matter objectively," he said. "We think she will."
Mr. Pallone held a public meeting at a Belford firehouse in February that was attended by more than 200 residents of the area. No one spoke in favor of the ferry project. Mr. Pallone said he would gather further information from the Army Corps of Engineers, which must give or deny approval for the proposed widening and dredging of Compton's Creek.
He also said he would investigate, with the Coast Guard, possible safety hazards in the narrow channel if ferryboats entered those waters in competition with the fishing boats. "I think everything you are saying about safety is absolutely correct," he told the applauding fishermen.
Mrs. Cusick said she was disappointed that County Freeholder Theodore J. Narozanick, who has been in charge of the Bayshore revitalization projects, did not attend.
Later, Mr. Narozanick, for the first time, broke ranks on the county position on the ferry project. "I would not be averse to another engineering study," he said. "Nothing is written in stone. I am a great believer in compromise."
He is expected to be a candidate for re-election in November, as is Mr. Pallone.
 
'They Handled This Badly'
 Patrick W. Parkinson, a former Mayor who is serving his seventh year on the Middletown Township Committee, said it was time for the Belford project to be brought to a halt and for the county to take another approach.
"They handled this badly," he said. "First of all, they never told anybody what was going on. No wonder people are confused."
In addition, Mr. Parkinson said he did not think the ferry ridership projections were accurate. He said businesses were leaving New York, which would mean fewer commuters taking the ferry to work there.
The township's Deputy Mayor, Joan Smith, also a Belford resident, said she stood somewhere between Mayor Oxley and Mr. Parkinson.
"I think the county is taking too strong a position," she said. "This is our township, not theirs. It's time they started to massage this ferry plan to make the fishermen and the Belford people happy."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Dr. Henry A. Coleman;
Helping Government Run Efficiently

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
IN one way or another, all of New Jersey's 567 municipalities, 21 counties and the state government itself have been touched -- probably for the better -- by the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University.
It is one of the few departments at the state university that combine teaching, research, continuing education, technical assistance and public service -- all aimed at making local government units operate more professionally and more efficiently. 
 "No question -- we are in the trenches every day with our strong commitment to public service," said Dr. Henry A. Coleman, who took over in September of 1992 as director of the center, which was established in 1950 as the Bureau of Government Research.
Right now, Dr. Coleman is trying to make sure that the center continues to be regarded as a nonpartisan agency, ready to serve municipal governments run by either political party. He was a top policy aide to Gov. Jim Florio on fiscal, budget and housing issues.
"I served as a bureaucrat detailed to Governor Florio's policy office," he said. "I was never asked to do purely political activities during my tenure."
 
Stress on Ethics Courses
 Concerned that several recent corruption and misconduct episodes at the local level in New Jersey "lower the public credibility of all municipal officials," he wants to place even greater stress on center courses that deal with ethics and integrity in government.
Interestingly, his old boss, Mr. Florio, is now at Rutgers as a visiting professor of public policy and administration and will be lecturing at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, of which the center is a component.
Dr. Coleman, whose Ph.D. is in economics, lives in Newark. He is known as one of the country's foremost experts in the area of government finance.
With a new Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, in place and her warnings that this is a time for frugality and cost cutting at all levels of government, and with many questions about whether current levels of municipal and school aid will be maintained, the role of the Center for Government Services has taken on an even greater importance, Dr. Coleman said.
 
Concern on Rising Taxes
 "There is a new concern that property taxes will be going up," he said. "Everyone now is looking not only for ways to be leaner but also for ways to be smarter in the delivery of government services. There are some real opportunities ahead for us."
Many mayors, Dr. Coleman said, are coming to realize that state aid is going to be reduced, and they would be happy just to have current municipal aid programs preserved. He agreed with Governor Whitman that there might be areas in municipal and county spending that could be cut, but questioned whether that would be enough to halt tax increases.
"Remember," he said, "when the income tax was enacted in 1976, it was a property tax relief fund. Take away some of that relief, and it can only mean one thing."
The center, at the university's Livingston College campus here, offers 600 courses in 18 areas of local government and has a full-time staff of 30 people and several hundred adjunct faculty members, all experts in their fields. The courses vary from 9 hours to 13 weeks and cost about $35 to $45 an hour.
The students include municipal financial officers, administrators, lawyers, tax assessors and collectors, planning and zoning board members, firefighters, elected officials, purchasing officials and public works personnel.
The center, which Dr. Coleman says is self-supporting, has also provided research and staff assistance to various state government commissions. It also publishes the annual New Jersey Legislative District Data Book, which is loaded with demographic and tax statistics on legislative and Congressional districts and on municipalities.
Q. What is the center's most important function?
A. All of our activities are important, in my view. However, if significant is measured by scale and/or scope of activities, our 600-plus continuing education programs serving more than 20,000 students annually would be seen as most important.
Q. Where does the center get its funds?
A. Center funding derives from several sources. First, we impose fees and charges, akin to tuition, for many of our continuing professional education courses. Next, we have a few ongoing contracts with the state and the Federal Government to provide training for building code and fire-related personnel, respectively.
We do some research and technical assistance under contract, primarily with state agencies and municipal governments. We generate some revenues through the sale of publications, especially the annual Legislative District Data Book. Finally, just less than 15 percent of our operating revenues is provided by Rutgers University.
Q. The center is now a component of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. What are the benefits that go along with that move?
A. The principal benefit is that we are now part of a larger organization that shares a common mission -- public service. A state university like Rutgers has a threefold mission: to generate knowledge (research); to impart knowledge (teaching), and to use knowledge to improve the quality of life for its citizens (public service).
This last component is often overlooked. The center, along with our sister organizations in the Bloustein School, helps to provide a critical core set of activities in furtherance of the public service mission.
Q. Does New Jersey really need 567 municipalities?
A. I do not know if 567 are needed, but at least at some point in the state's history, that number was preferred. There is no formula that will take in all of the state's characteristics and churn out a "right" number of municipalities. Moreover, increasing or decreasing the number of municipalities will not be a guarantee of greater efficiency or equity in service delivery or financing.
All that we can say is relative to other states of similar population or geographic size, New Jersey has a lot of local governments, and evidence from research and analysis would suggest that some improvements in efficiency and economy would potentially result from regionalization or consolidation.
Q. In that connection, the Florio administration seemed to talk a good game about the consolidation and regionalization of municipal governments and school districts. But the perception is that little happened. What went wrong?
A. Since I do not know very much about what was attempted by Governor Florio, I cannot really say what, if anything, went wrong. Consolidation and regionalization offer the potential for improved service delivery, as well as cost savings.
I think the state should provide, one, more information so that localities know the potential benefits and problems associated with regionalization. Two, technical assistance so that amenable localities have the required "know how" for implementing regionalization, and three, incentives so that municipalities and school districts are induced and not pushed into greater regionalization-consolidation.
Q. How do you view Mrs. Whitman's action to cut income taxes by 5 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, a measure she signed last week?
A. I have somewhat mixed reactions. The tax cuts may help improve the business climate and provide a modest economic stimulus.
On the other hand, part of the benefits to New Jerseyans will be offset through higher Federal taxes -- both because of Federal tax increases and because residence will have fewer state income taxes to deduct against their Federal tax liability. In addition, the loss of state income tax revenues may exasperate existing revenue shortfalls in the state budget.
Q. Mrs. Whitman is also setting up a 12-member economic master plan commission aimed at coming up with a blueprint for the state's economic future. Your reaction?
A. New Jersey is home base for some of the country's best economic analysts. I think it is commendable that the Governor would seek to tap this resource on an ongoing basis. I see no downside to the establishment of such a commission as a source of advice and counsel to the Governor as she grapples with some very difficult issues.

HEADLINE: Elevating Sales to a Degree Program

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHERE do the heads of American corporations come from? Some reach the top position through a company's legal department, others from accounting, but the majority of chief executive officers are former sales executives.
"Sales are the engines that drive companies," said Edward Flanagan, president of the International Association of Sales Professionals, a trade group with a chapter in Westchester. "You only have to examine any corporate financial statement. Up in the left-hand corner are the company's sales figures, listed prominently. 
 "Businesses depend on a productive sales force for their ultimate success. Yet, people in sales suffer from a negative-image problem, even though, according to the Census Bureau, the number of people who make their living in sales has increased 40 percent since 1980, to 14.5 million today. But the general public still believes that sales is not really a profession."
Other than the individual company training that is given to a sales staff, selling has largely been ignored as a profession by the academic community, Mr. Flanagan added.
 
An Aid to Recruiting
 In order to change these perceptions and improve the image of selling, Mr. Flanagan said that 90 members of his group, from such companies as Avon, Nynex and Sony, met last June to develop a national standard of training and certification.
James Carter, chairman of the trade group and vice president of sales at Domino Sugar, put it this way: "We decided that formal academic training, similar to that which exists for accountants, financial planners and social workers, would help the image of our profession and help recruiting and decrease turnover.
"Sales executives are tired of accepting the traditional poor image of our profession. We're tired of not seeing enough good people making sales a career. We are frustrated that our academic institutions don't offer enough sales courses or a certificate or a degree program leading to the bachelor of science and sales."
Now Berkeley College, a two-year college of business with five campuses in the New York City area, is collaborating with the members of the trade group and has developed a professional-sales-degree program, the first of its kind by any college in the nation. The course will be offered to students at Berkeley's Manhattan and White Plains campuses this fall.
Dr. Rose Mary Healy, president of Berkeley College in White Plains, said: "The professional-sales-degree program is a result of an interesting partnership between education and corporate America. It has already been approved by the New York State Board of Regents, and students are now being recruited for the first class in September."
The year-and-a-half program, which will combine formal academic training with practical work experience, "integrates the classroom with the workplace," Dr. Healy said. "The curriculum includes a core of general business education as well as seven required sales courses, and three paid internships will give a student the opportunity to get some practical hands-on skills. Students will graduate with an associate degree in professional sales and will leave with a thorough understanding of business practices and sales strategies."
What is also interesting, Dr. Healy said, is that in conjunction with an advisory board of members of the International Association of Sales Professionals, "students in the program will get a terrific opportunity to form a network of contacts with prospective employers, as the advisory board has pledged to support the internships and also to work with us to provide permanent positions for the graduates. We are in such a good location here: right in the middle of the largest concentration of corporations in the country, many of them involved with the sales-degree program."
Enrollment at Berkeley's Westchester campus, situated on a wooded 10-acre site on West Red Oak Lane just off the Platinum Mile in White Plains, is about 500, of which 140 are housed in Berkeley dormitories and apartments.
"We recruit students from far and wide," Dr. Healy said. "Several come from abroad. These international students are here to learn American business methods." The school, she added, has an interesting history and has changed with the times. "Berkeley was founded in Manhattan in 1931 in the depth of the Depression," she said. "The first class had an enrollment of 12 students, all women."
 
Accredited as a College in 1987
 When the Berkeley School, as it was known for 59 years, opened its first branch in White Plains in 1945, it was still a traditional secretarial training school for women, teaching typing, shorthand and office skills. It was accredited as a college in 1987.
"The enrollment was all female until 1980," Dr. Healy said. "Men now make up about 25 percent of the student body, and we also have many more male faculty members. We have also added courses that attract men specifically, in restaurant and hotel administration, and despite the recession our enrollments have been holding steady. In fact, we are finding enrollments up among older adults who are either upgrading their skills or preparing themselves for entirely new careers."
Dr. Healy said that courses focus on business and added that 92 percent of the graduates find jobs immediately after graduation. "Our graduates are career oriented and in demand," she said. "It's the mid-size companies where most of the jobs are today. We are perhaps best known for teaching support staff. Shorthand has been replaced by training in computers. Administrative assistants, customer-service account reps are the types of jobs graduates start. Many go on up the ladder to successful careers."
 
A Pragmatic Program
 Now that selling is to be taught in an educational atmosphere, Mr. Flanagan said, there will be a better understanding and appreciation of the role of more than 10 million Americans who earn their living in sales.
"Instead of the adversarial relationship that has long existed between academia and the world of work, here is a pragmatic program developed by leading sales professional educators in tandem," he said. "We are very excited about it. It makes good sense. Students will be taught by a team consisting of one member from the Berkeley faculty and the other from our group of professional trainers who make their living training the sales forces of different corporations.
"For students, it means that they can begin their careers in sales as professionals. For companies, it means they have gained a more effective sales work force with less turnover. It's our hope that other colleges throughout the country will adopt the professional sales curriculum."

HEADLINE: Above the Battle at West Point

BYLINE: By LAURA CUNNINGHAM; LAURA CUNNINGHAM is the author of the memoir "Sleeping Arrangements" (NAL/Plume).

 BODY:
MY uncle Len has always marched to the beat of a different drummer, and that beat led him, on a recent weekend, to check in at the Hotel Thayer at West Point for "undisclosed reasons." As a traveler, Len has always cloaked his movements in a fog of mystery to match his actual cloaklike trenchcoat. Len raised me from age 8 and, during my childhood, he would periodically vanish on what he called "secret missions." At 6 feet 6 inches, tiptoeing on his size 13 shoes, Len's personal aura seemed to combine Sam Spade with Len's own lifelong hero, Abraham Lincoln.
"There's a matter of national importance that must command my attention," Len would say as he departed. He was famous, in our family, for his secrecy and style of traveling light. He carried only a manila envelope. Everything else, including his shoes, would be mailed ahead to the "undisclosed location," and then returned in a sturdy metal mailing box that looked as if it might really contain what Len implied were classified materials. When I was 10, I was sure Len was a world-class spy, or some sort of government agent. At some point in my teens, I peeked into the "classified" file and found only a clean change of underwear and rolled socks. I began to suspect he hadn't truly traveled abroad on a matter of international diplomacy but had taken a weekend flyer with his girlfriend. 
 Not all his trips were fictional: When I was 11, Len whisked me off to Castro's Cuba while the walls ran red with blood oaths to Batista. Len hinted he was there to talk to Fidel, but ultimately he admitted, as we stood on a shrapnel-pocked street, that he had transported me to Cuba to give me some perspective on a problem I was having with a fifth grade teacher. His method worked: I forgot all about the fifth grade.
In the decades that followed, I came to realize that most of Len's trips were in his mind. He made Walter Mitty look like a pragmatist. He exaggerated the distances and the significance of his outings: A trip to the Borscht Belt became obliquely referred to as "official business with the Russians." I learned that he was not, after all, a spy, but a senior economist with the state of New York. After his retirement, it appeared that Len had hung up his trenchcoat and manila envelope for good.
Then, suddenly, at 78, shrunken down to 6 foot 4 but still imposing, with a full head of silver hair, Len was on the move again. But why West Point? Why now? Uncle Len was characteristically noncommittal: "It never hurts to be near ramparts." He murmured a few asides regarding global unrest, and packed a manila envelope, mailed his shoes to West Point, and booked himself a room, river-side, with a view of stout castles and the Hudson. He wore an admiralty cap.
Even before he arrived at the Hotel Thayer -- I escorted him up and back -- Len was thrilled with "the protocol." On the phone, the reservations clerk asked: "Is this a military assignment? A P.C.S.?" referring to a Permanent Change of Station.
"That remains to be seen," said Len, taking the American Association of Retired Persons discount rate.
The Hotel Thayer is government-owned and operated, a fortress built of local granite, that has stood stony guard over the United States Military Academy grounds since 1926. Flags and insignia flying in the crisp river breeze, the hotel itself seems to stand at attention for the 440 cadets who march past.
But the Thayer seemed a real departure from Len's usual style: the nap is worn from the elevator rug and any hedonists would flee before reveille. No one will tuck a bedtime chocolate on one's pillow here for a nice nighty-night. In fact, government-employed chambermaids sprint in to snap off the air-conditioning if any guest should depart his room for even a few minutes. On the other hand, there is no room or food tax.
Len implied, as he checked in to his somewhat fortlike room, that his mission was "government-related," but he refused to elaborate. We had lunch in the feudal-style dining room, a lunch that was surprisingly tasty. The chef turned out to be trained at the C.I.A. (Culinary Institute of America)), and the price (about $10 a person) was as fetching as the presentation (fruit salad served in a carved pineapple). The lettuce was buttercrunch, not the dreaded iceberg, but still I wondered: Why West Point? Why the Thayer? Why was Len tipping his admiralty cap to the desk clerks?
As Len recounted the hotel's history, I began to get a glimmer: "George Washington himself chose the location for West Point. He called it 'the key to America.' " Then Len told me of the giant chain Washington had thrown across the river to block a British invasion. Washington himself surely slept on the site, in a tent, to oversee the design of the series of forts and redoubts that became West Point. Three hotels preceded the Thayer, and housed many notables. "General MacArthur's mother stayed here, to be near her son when he was a cadet," said Len.
A more recent roster of the current hotel turned up an intriguing mix: former Presidents (Ike was the first to sleep here, Mamie moved in for the war years), entertainers (Dinah Shore), fighters (Sugar Ray Leonard) and, as they are always referred to at the hotel, "the American Hostages." The hostages checked in for three days in 1981, to recover from their captivity in Iran. All other guests were asked to leave, and the staff was locked in with the hostages, for security reasons. The hostage stay is still vivid to those clerks who remained with them ("We gave them slippers," recalls one hotel employee, "but they were unaccustomed to wearing shoes, and they walked the halls barefoot all night.")
Len loved the story, and he loved the lobby and the halls, too. The desk clerks were more than friendly. When I'd phone, they'd say, "I just saw him wandering through the lobby," and comment on what a nice man and what a knowledgeable history buff.
When I picked up Len at the end of his stay, he told me the highlight of his trip was a privately arranged visit to "The Fortifications Collection" at the West Point Library. I stopped to chat with the chairman of the collection, Col. Roger Ney, retired. Fortification, the art of building and maintaining forts against the threat of siege warfare, was a period with a distinct beginning, middle and end. The end, it turned out, came suddenly, as soon as the enemy could be airborne. Colonel Ney, the author of "The Patton Mind," as well as a resident historian on West Point and the history of fortification, outlined the elaborate system and design that made West Point so impenetrable.
Len loved the fortification collection: "It makes me feel so safe, in retrospect." But he saved the best for last: a visit to the hotel's Presidential Suite. While it is not possible to reserve the Presidential Suite (unless you happen to be the President), it is quite possible to stay in it -- if you check with the desk after 6 P.M. If no Presidents or other notables have checked in, you may indeed, as Len and I did, hotfoot it up to the third floor and the semi-secret suite, just to look around; it
costs $175 a night for non-Presidents.
Len and I entered the four silent rooms. In the living room, there is a black marble fireplace for Presidential chatting. The bedroom features two double beds, and two toilets (one for the President and one for the First Lady), and there is a kitchenette, where a President could have what Len calls "a snackaroo." In the living room, there is a gleaming raft of a desk, rumored to have belonged to F.D.R. I watched Len assume his seat, and dash off a memo, where perhaps F.D.R. once took a note or two.
We concluded what Len called his "fortification vacation" with a hike to Fort Putnam. Len breathed hard on the climb, but he pressed on, and when we reached the summit, we were the only visitors to this restored Revolutionary War ruin. The day was clear. We could see miles along the blue ribboning Hudson. From down below, at the West Point cemetery, came the sad, but oddly soothing sound of taps. The mighty cannon aimed below. It was not just easy, but inevitable to feel transported back in time. And to think of that distant troubled past was somehow to arrive at this afternoon's sense of peace -- certainly the secret of Len's secret missions. On this afternoon, at West Point, we both stood above the battle.

HEADLINE: State Is Rolling Out the Red Carpet for World Cup Soccer

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES 

 BODY:
GEORGE R. ZOFFINGER recalled sitting in a Portuguese restaurant in Newark in 1990, about to eat a forkful of paella, when Gov. Jim Florio endorsed his idea: bring the World Cup to New Jersey. Mr. Zoffinger, then the State Commerce Commissioner, was given the go-ahead to offer Giants Stadium as a site for World Cup games in 1994, the year the United States would be the host nation.
In 1992, soccer's governing body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, announced nine American sites for World Cup play, including Giants Stadium. Seven games will be played there, and the organizers say the matches will add up to the largest sporting event ever held in the New York metropolitan area. Over a five-week period beginning on June 18, half a million people are expected to see the games. The finals will be held in Los Angeles. 
 Other numbers indicate the magnitude of the event. It is projected that two billion people will watch the finals via satellite, up from 1.5 billion for the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Such a forecast proved a viable reason for companies to pay $30 million each to be official World Cup sponsors.
Some $800 million in revenue is expected to pour into the New York-New Jersey region, up from the original projection of $400 million. Even the World Cup draw held in December was a boon to the metropolitan area.
The opening game at Giants Stadium pits Ireland against Italy, an event that Mr. Zoffinger, now a co-chairman of the New Jersey World Cup Host Committee, calls "a match made in heaven."
Filling New Jersey's coffers will be an estimated $13 million in sales tax alone. The economic impact on the state has so much riding on it that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman saw an occasion to give her husband, John, a financier, his first official appointment: co-chairman of the New Jersey World Cup Host Committee, along with Mr. Zoffinger. The co-chairmen's posts are unpaid.
Hotels are already booked; restaurants are conjuring up menus to satisfy the taste of those who will cheer on Saudi Arabia and Morocco, two of the teams scheduled to play at the stadium. Car rental companies are swamped with orders, and shopping malls are ready to promote their wares to occupy visitors without soccer tickets who are traveling with ticketholders.
"The World Cup is a showcase for New Jersey, and we are working hard to take advantage of it," said Gerry Kauper, the acting director of the New Jersey division of travel and tourism. "Hotels at resort sites are offering tour packages; those who stay in the hotels will fill area restaurants."
It was at a restaurant frequented by Portuguese soccer fans -- Seabra's Marisqueira, in the Ironbound section of Newark -- that Mr. Zoffinger played out his idea.
The Essex County Sheriff, Armando Fontoura, a founder of the Portuguese-American Congress of New Jersey, recalled the occasion. "We had finished marching in the Portuguese Day parade and were about to eat when loud yelling continually erupted from a crowd gathered around a television," he said. "Governor Florio asked what was all the commotion about, and George explained they were soccer fans watching the World Cup."
Mr. Zoffinger, who is the now the president and chief executive officer of Constellation Bancorp in New Brunswick, reasoned that if Giants Stadium could be a site for the 1994 World Cup, New Jersey with its deep ethnic ties to the sport would enthusiastically support the games, and the state's economy would benefit.
Soccer's proponents backed his prediction. On a Sunday morning last June, an allotment of tickets for the first five games at Giants Stadium went on sale by telephone at 9 A.M. By 11 A.M., the stadium was sold out. Later, the remaining two games also sold out.
From the start of site selection, soccer federation officials never lost sight of the fact that Giants Stadium was the only arena in this country to have been host to more than six million soccer fans as the home of the Cosmos and the scene of the farewell game of the Brazilian soccer star Pele.
Guido Tognoni, a spokesman for the federation at its offices in Switzerland, said that despite the fact that the field at Giants Stadium by soccer standards is short one meter on each side, measuring 66 by 103 meters instead of 68 by 105 meters, "It would have been stupid not play there," he said.
Having toured Giants Stadium, Mr. Tognoni said: "The stadium has several hundred professional people in place; they even have their own security system. Frankly, we never considered not playing at Giants Stadium, if it were offered as a venue site."
The stadium's 76,000-seat capacity may be reduced somewhat for such factors as field requirements and additional space necessary for television coverage.
After the selection, Doug Arnot, executive vice president of World Cup U.S.A. '94, the United States organizing committee, named Charles Stillitano of Westfield, a lawyer with the American Telephone and Telegraph Conmpany, to head the New York-New Jersey preparations for the games.
"I selected Charlie because he is indicative of why the World Cup is in New Jersey," Mr. Arnot said. "He's steeped in soccer history there, understands the ethnic diversity of its fans and has worked for New Jersey youth soccer leagues that have over 120,000 members. Charlie was all-American soccer at Princeton University, and he understands both sides of the game."
Mr. Stillitano, looking for some benchmarks on numbers and dollars, began his assignment by asking Dr. James Litvack, an economics professor at Princeton University, to put together an analysis of the economic impact the seven games would have on the region.
Speaking about his report, Dr. Litvack said: "What was hard to analyze was, What is the spending going to be like of the ticketholders? An 8-year-old and his mother who travels from Princeton to the Meadowlands may buy a soda, a hot dog and pay for parking. But a group of Italians who come here and stay for a month, needing meals and hotels -- that data changes the numbers."
For Rich Fritsky, the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce president, it is not just about spending money but increasing trade with foreign visitors and their companies. The chamber includes companies like Goya Foods, the Matsushito Electric Corporation and Hartz Mountain Industries.
"It's an unprecedented opportunity for this region to market itself to the world," Mr. Fritsky said. "Unlike other sporting events, people will come and stay for a month. It gives them time to see what makes this area tick from an economic viewpoint."
Smaller companies also see the opportunity to increase their clients. Glasgow and Sons, manufacturers of children's clothing in Perth Amboy, received approval from Time Warner, which licenses products bearing the World Cup insignia, to design a line of children's clothing with the insignia. The outfits, in red, white and blue, are for newborn to age 13 and include sports clothing, jackets, shorts and sweat suits. They are sold in such stores as Kmart, Caldor and Wal-Mart.
When the games begin in June, Assemblyman John A. Rocco of Cherry Hill envisions play on a board game he created, called World Cup Soccer. Reviewed and approved by Time Warner, the game carries the World Cup insignia and will be sold at nine places throughout the country.
A teacher at Rowan College who has used simulation in the classroom, Dr. Rocco has deployed the same technique with the board game. He said it was geared for beginners along with soccer coaches who can use the board to explain strategy.
George Blasko, who has a U-Save Auto Rental franchise in Clifton, even opened another location on Route 17 to be closer to the Meadowlands and has added foreign cars to his inventory.
In addition, he raised his stock of 15 passenger vans to 100. "People will be traveling in groups," he said, adding that it is "better to have 15 people who don't speak English in one vehicle than have groups of five people in three cars getting lost."
Hotels near the Meadowlands have been booked to accommodate groups like journalists and television crews; some 3,000 media people are expected to be accredited for each game. Away from the site, hotels near training camps throughout the state will house teams and their entourages.
The Italian team will work out at the Pingry School in Martinsville and has reserved the entire Somerset Hills Hotel in nearby Warren Township.
Restaurants and pubs are gearing up. Early in the year, Alan Meinster, a co-owner of Marsilio's in the Chambersburg section of Trenton, dubbed New Jersey's Little Italy, offered cooking classes featuring dishes that would appeal to World Cup teams. But his effort is to get the Italian team to visit the area, where, he said, "the food will make them think they are back in Italy."
At Club Cocomo in Lyndhurst, Mario de Paola, a co-owner, who is also the United States Soccer Federation Region 1 director, has booked groups like 500 Canadian tourists for dinner, shuttling them to the stadium and back for cocktails.
Last October, Cryan's Beef and Ale House in South Orange installed a satellite dish so that fans could watch Ireland qualify for the World Cup. Large, signed photographs of the Irish team decorate the walls, and John Cryan, the restaurant's owner, says he has a commitment from the Irish team to dine there.
Even what had been considered a drawback for Giants Stadium, its artificial turf, has turned into a windfall for New Jersey businesses. Under federation rules, soccer may be played only on natural turf.
To meet the requirement, a field of Bermuda grass, currently growing in Virginia, will be installed. Before it is put down, local companies will construct a platform and truck in tons of soil. The loam will make the turf grass at Giants Stadium a rich shade of green, something akin to the color of the money that will flow into the region.

HEADLINE: For Governor's Husband, A World Cup Role

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES 

 BODY:
WHEN Gov. Christine Todd Whitman named her husband, John, co-chairman of the New Jersey World Cup Host Committee, it was his first official appointment in her administration. Taking the unpaid post was a departure from Mr. Whitman's usual posture of a mate who is highly supportive, but avoids any official roles.
His appointment, he said, "demonstrates to everyone how important the Governor feels the World Cup is to New Jersey and how she wants to know intimately what is going on every step of the way." 
 With Giants Stadium the site for seven World Cup games, including a semifinal, Mr. Whitman said, "billions of people worldwide will see these games played in New Jersey." He added, "As the most direct spokesperson for the state with the foreign dignitaries who will come here, it's Christie's light to shine on everything she possibly can to showcase the great things we have."
 
Sharing a Post
 Mr. Whitman shares the host committee post with George R. Zoffinger, who was appointed to it in 1992 by Jim Florio, then the Governor. Mr. Florio continues as honorary chairman of the committee, which has among its goals "to sell New Jersey to the world."
As for any political ramifications, Mr. Whitman said, "At the end of the day no matter what your political party or what you are trying to accomplish, basically, if the state does not prosper, you are not going to either."
The timing of the World Cup, Mr. Whitman said, ties in with the new administration's long-range planning. Recalling his wife's statement in her inaugural address, "We are open for business," Mr. Whitman said: "Central to the plan for economic recovery is to attract new business to New Jersey. This is a way to get around the economic problems the state has been suffering. Enjoy the World Cup; come away with a new vision of New Jersey as a place to live and work."
Mr. Whitman, 49, who has been a Wall Street financier, started his own consulting concern, Broken Bridge Inc., which in 1992 earned fees of $1.5 million. He said his work on the host committee would not be confined to finances, but was geared to coordination of the activities of the host committee with the Meadowlands operation and the World Cup U.S.A. '94 organizing committee.
 
'Reaching the End'
 "All of the work of these groups has been going along, and now we're reaching the end of the planning process," he said. "What follows is to make sure that everyone knows what everyone else is doing."
While the host committee will be involved in some fund-raising events, Mr. Whitman said, "I will do whatever they ask, but I am not the banker."
During his new assignment, he will remain engaged in running his own company. "Don't regard this appointment as one of a long line of such positions," he said. "This is short term. But if another situation like the World Cup arises and the Governor feels it is important to make her personal interest in it known, she may call upon me again."

HEADLINE: Chinese Puzzle;
After Months of Dialogue on Human Rights, Beijing Takes Harder Line Toward the U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 13

 BODY:
From the outset, Warren Christopher's first visit here as Secretary of State has been a diplomatic mugging. Today he and his aides were trying to understand why.
But instead of answers, what Mr. Christopher got was a philosphical discussion punctuated by aphorisms in a meeting with President Jiang Zemin: 
 President Jiang: "You can't become a fat man with one big meal."
Rough translation: The Chinese must proceed step by step toward human rights reform, and no amount of force-feeding will speed up the process.
President Jiang: "You have to clash before you become friends."
Rough translation: We bashed you intentionally to put you on the defensive, and now that we have the advantage, we would like to resume our talks.
After six months of broad and deepening dialogue with the Chinese on human rights, one of the most sensitive issues in this society, Mr. Christopher has been treated to a Chinese attitude that an American official described as "in your face."
The Chinese reaction was not altogether surprising, because Beijing had asked Mr. Christopher to delay his visit, hinting that the timing was not good. But his aides said that this trip best accommodated the Secretary's calendar, and that he was insistent on delivering President Clinton's message on human rights. So Beijing relented.
With less than three months to go before Mr. Christopher recommends to President Clinton whether to renew or revoke China's favorable trade status with the United States, the Communist leadership refuses to articulate, by word or deed, how it intends to respond to Mr. Clinton's challenge to make "overall significant progress" on human rights.
What seems certain is that the struggle within the Chinese leadership over how to define human rights for the country's 1.2 billion citizens is very much unresolved. And therefore Mr. Christopher's mission to admonish, scold and cajole Chinese officials seems destined to be resisted.
The state security authorities who rounded up the usual suspects of dissent last week so Mr. Christopher and his aides would not be able to hear their voices have only reinforced China's image of being in a defensive crouch.
Some American officials have said Mr. Christopher's trip was ill timed, because the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's ceremonial Parliament, opened on Thursday, one day before Mr. Christopher arrived. The Secretary's message may have sounded too much like a rebuke to Chinese leaders concerned about losing face before the assembled cadres.
Other officials wondered whether a new hard-line current was in ascendance in the Chinese leadership. With Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, appearing to be in frailer health, China's anti-reform octogenarians whom Mr. Deng forced into retirement may be pondering a comeback.
If that is so, President Jiang may be losing some of his political maneuvering room for tough decisions regarding human rights, like accounting for and releasing political prisoners and opening Chinese jails, detention centers and labor reform camps to international inspection.
No Chinese leader can contemplate concessions on that scale without considering whether the hard-liners will regard them as a sign of weakness.
Since January, when President Jiang told a delegation from the United States Congress that China was going to make an effort to improve human rights, his pronouncement has been followed by inaction.
Some American officials are worried that it could be paralysis.
Not since President Richard M. Nixon came to China in 1972 to begin to reopen relations after more than two decades of hostility has there been such a sense that China and the United States are on the cusp. But of what?
The stakes are enormous for both sides. No one in the Clinton Administration, and virtually no one in Congress or in the human rights organizations, actually wants China to lose its status as a favored trading partner.
Such a move would hurt American consumers, whose purchases of a wide range of Chinese products, including inexpensive textiles and toys, have given China a $20 billion trade surplus with the United States.
At the same time, the Chinese have enjoyed the phenomenal economic growth that comes from access to the United States market. Any slowdown risks social unrest.
American corporations, whose regional chiefs today also chided Mr. Christopher over the Administration's human-rights policy, depend on the low cost of Chinese labor. As their investments grow, what they want is stability in American-Chinese relations.
The simplest explanation for this month's clampdown on dissidents, and the hostile reception for Mr. Christopher, may be the most compelling. Many China analysts point out that the fear of chaos is deep within the Chinese leadership. "Stability" has become a code word not only for political repression but also for a "never again" attitude toward the remnants of China's democracy movement.
This winter's human rights dialogue with Washington and the June deadline for Mr. Clinton's trade decision have empowered and emboldened China's dissidents for the first time since the violent crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989. So it is not surprising that with the Communists' urgency for control and order, the authorities swiftly detained and intimidated members of the democracy movement and effectively muted them.
 
A Display of Muscle
 The prospect of Mr. Christopher's arrival seemed only to encourage the dissidents further. What better opportunity, one Chinese analyst said, for President Jiang to establish his credentials as a leader tough enough to crack down on dissent, strong enough to lead the country after Mr. Deng is gone?
"The leadership needs to demonstrate that it can run China," the Chinese analyst said. "It needs to demonstrate to itself and to the country that it is strong."
These currents may have converged as Mr. Christopher and his entourage made their way across the Pacific.

HEADLINE: Rebound in Interest Rates May Hinder the Recovery

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Interest rates have climbed by more than a percentage point in five months, and the American economy is beginning to feel the pinch.
The great rush to refinance mortgages at lower rates and lower monthly payments -- a big source of extra cash for consumer spending -- has slowed sharply, the Mortgage Bankers Association reports. Bank loans to individuals and companies are no longer rising. And many families are rushing to buy houses before mortgage rates go any higher, a flurry of activity that probably will not last, some economists say. 
 "All the data about mortgages and lending suggest that the rise in interest rates is beginning to produce the first stages of an economic slowdown -- a mild one, but clearly slower growth," said Nancy R. Lazar, a senior economist at ISI Group, a Wall Street investment house.
Low interest rates had been the cornerstone of the Clinton Administration's strategy to strengthen the economy and drive up employment. And while no one had expected rates to remain as low as they had been last October -- when the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a barometer for many important lending rates, fell below 6 percent for the first time in 25 years -- neither had most people expected the rise to be so quick and so strong. On Friday, the yield on the 30-year bond neared 7 percent, and the rates for other loans lasting two years or more have risen in tandem.
 
Surprisingly Quick Rise
 Most of this rise has occurred since early February, when the Federal Reserve, concerned that the robust economy might be inflationary, decided to push up interest rates slightly to inhibit borrowing and spending. Wall Street traders, who have the power through their buying and selling of bonds to make interest rates fluctuate, then pushed up rates more. They responded not so much to expectations of inflation, but to such unsettling issues as the Whitewater investigation involving President Clinton and the Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan.
"This extreme nervousness on Wall Street is relatively temporary," said David M. Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond trading firm.
The sudden jump in interest rates bothers Administration officials, though it has not shaken them from their forecast that the national economy will grow 3 percent this year, even if interest rates do not subside. The economy had been growing at twice that rate from July through December, but 3 percent growth will be enough, the officials say, to create jobs at a healthy pace and reduce unemployment.
"Obviously, we would prefer a lower 30-year Treasury bond rate than we are seeing now," said Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy. "But even if interest rates stayed where they are now, it is still a far more stable and favorable economic environment than we inherited over a year ago."
 
Still Comparatively Low
 On the day of President Clinton's inauguration, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was 7.4 percent, Mr. Sperling noted. Even after the recent surge, rates remain quite low compared with their levels during the last 15 years. What is more, many economists argue, the strong economic activity late last year produced a momentum that has offset the rise in interest rates.
"The rising interest rates will dampen the demand for loans and soften the economy in the process, but this is offset by the fact that the economy has been more robust and the recovery more solid than we expected," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
That view seems to have been confirmed in the weekly surveys of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center. "There was a time that people were very apprehensive that the country could quickly slip back into recession, and that apprehension is gone now," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys. "People certainly don't have a blind eye to the problems of the economy, or their own job problems, but they tend to diminish the negative news out there."
That might explain why car and truck sales have not been affected. They continue to boom, although auto loan rates are up half a percentage point, to more than 9 percent on average for a four-year loan. "But if rates stay up, I would expect to see some slowing in sales later this year," said Wynn Van Bussman, an economist for the Chrysler Corporation.
 
Spurred Auto and Housing Sectors
 More than anything else, the Clinton Administration had counted on low interest rates to make the auto industry and home construction boom. These are huge areas of activity, and the expectation was that prosperity in these industries would spread to the rest of the economy, an expectation that seemed to be materializing in the very strong fourth quarter of last year.
Now, the greatest uncertainty is home construction, given that the average rate for a 30-year mortgage has risen by a full percentage point since October, to 7.6 percent. While home sales are strong, home construction has fallen this year, either because of the bad weather or the rising interest rates or both.
"It is going to be awfully difficult to interpret what is happening in housing until the spring," said Lyle Gramley, the chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who said he believed that construction would remain strong because mortgage rates, even at 7.6 percent, were still relatively low.
The rising interest rates have not touched some areas of the economy. Retail sales were brisk in February, despite the bad weather, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. "For the most part, people are paying the same rates on their charge cards that they always paid," said Joseph Siegel, a vice president of the National Retail Federation. If anything, some credit card rates have fallen as card companies compete for customers.
Home equity loans, a big source of family credit, are also largely untouched, as are the loans that banks make to small companies. Both are tied, in most cases, to the banking industry's prime interest rate. They rise or fall in lock-step with the prime, and it has remained unchanged at 6 percent for more than a year.
 
Corporate Debt Unaffeected
 Similarly, big companies that borrow millions of dollars by issuing long-term bonds or short-term commercial paper, which are i.o.u.'s, report that the rise in interest rates has not affected their borrowing plans. The Colgate-Palmolive Company, for example, is issuing commercial paper at a 3.5 percent rate, compared with 3.25 percent last year. "That is not enough change to make a difference for us," Brian Heidtke, the treasurer of the company, said.
And Colgate-Palmolive has not canceled its plans to sell $250 million of new bonds by the end of April, although the rise in the 30-year barometer Treasury bond rate means the company will have to pay an extra percentage point or so above what the cost would have been last fall.
"In a longer historical context," Mr. Heidtke said, "the present Treasury bond rate of nearly 7 percent is still very reasonable."
Still, many economists predict that the higher rates, if they endure, will eventually pinch the economy, mostly because of their potential impact on vehicle sales and, in particular, home construction.
"Eventually, higher rates mean higher mortgage payments," said David Wyss, research director for DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting firm. "And that means fewer people buying homes and less home construction."

HEADLINE: Christopher Ends Beijing Talks Citing Modest Gains

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, March 14

 BODY:
Three days of talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and China's leaders ended today with Beijing making modest gestures on human rights that had been sought by Washington.
Mr. Christopher's talks, which both sides said were quite blunt, marked the highest-level visit to Beijing since the Clinton Administration took office and had been planned as the high point of the Administration's six-month-long strategy of intensive engagement with the Chinese. 
 By sending home Mr. Christopher with little to show for his first trip to Beijing as Secretary of State, the Chinese instead have complicated their chances of retaining a relatively favorable trade status that expires in June. Under an executive order issued last year, China must make "substantial, overall progress" in human rights to win extension of the trade benefits, which allow Chinese goods to enter the United States with virtually no tariffs.
 
'Clarity' Is Achieved
 "I came to China to try to insure that the Chinese side understands the importance of human rights in the context" of extending trade privileges, Mr. Christopher said at a news conference after a meeting this morning with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. "I doubt we would have achieved such clarity at least the highest levels without the advantage of this visit."
Mr. Christopher sought to portray his three days of talks in a positive light and his presentation today lacked the rancor and critical tone of remarks made during his first two days here. He said the two nations have begun "to narrow the differences" between them.
Specifically, the Chinese took some modest steps on a number of fronts, Mr. Christopher said.
On the most sensitive issue -- accounting for and releasing political prisoners -- Mr. Christopher said that his team had received "a great deal of information" on 235 specific cases first presented to the Chinese last fall.
John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said afterwards that American officials were still evaluating the information, but that it appeared to be "definitely more than we had before."
And for the first time, the Chinese have pledged to provide detailed information about Tibetan political prisoners, Mr. Christopher said.
The two sides codified, as expected, an agreement reached in principle with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in Beijing in January to reopen Chinese prisons to American inspectors to insure that they are not making products for export to the United States.
Throughout their three days of talks, Chinese officials flatly rejected Mr. Christopher's demand that Beijing improve its human rights performance, saying this was interference in their internal affairs.
On Sunday, representatives of some of America's largest corporations told Mr. Christopher that the Administration's policy was undermining American companies trying to take advantage of China's economic expansion.
The frank comments by indignant executives from business giants including A.T.& T., General Electric and Dow Jones preceded Mr. Christopher's 75-minute meeting with President Jiang Zemin, who dismissed the Secretary's demands on human rights as meddling in China's internal affairs.
 
Less Bitter Atmosphere
 Although Sunday's meeting was described by both sides as less rancorous than Saturday's sessions, the two sides continued to talk past each other.
The Chinese are gambling that Washington will suffer too much it if revokes the trade privileges under a policy they see as driven by anti-China lawmakers in Congress.
At a breakfast meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, members said it was misguided to use trade privileges to force changes in human rights policies, telling Mr. Christopher that the best way to improve human rights in China was to open the country to new markets.
But Mr. Christopher rejected this view, urging the organization of some 300 American businesses "to use your influence to convince the Chinese it is in their interest to make at least the limited progress on human rights that we seek."
Mr. Christopher is to head today to Vladivostok to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Middle East with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia.
Mr. Christopher declined to tell reporters whether the Administration would renew China's trade privileges if it had to do so now. When asked in the past, he has routinely replied that China still had not made enough progress to warrant renewal of the trade benefits. But some of his senior aides have suggested that the daily diplomatic temperature-taking was counterproductive, and when asked the question today, Mr. Christopher replied, "I'm really out of that business."

NEW YORK CITY
 
CUNY'S CRITICS URGE A MORE ACTIVE BOARD
A majority of the members of the City University of New York Board of Trustees are holdovers whose terms of office expired as long ago as 1988. Educators and local officials say this has weakened the leadership of the nation's largest urban university. Herman Badillo, a governor's appointee whose term expired last June, said this was a critical time for the university, which is undergoing sweeping academic consolidation, budget cuts and a changing student population. A vigorous board is needed, he said. B3. 

INSURANCE-FRAUD INVESTIGATION
An investigation into systematic payoffs to apartment-house managers by contractors has been broadened to include fraudulent insurance claims, investigators in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. Just as work contracts were inflated to pay for kickbacks from contractors to the managers of hundreds of condominium and cooperative apartment buildings, so were some insurance claims, the investigators said. B3.
 
UNION VICTORY IN CHINATOWN
A seven-month lockout in Chinatown's only unionized restaurant ended in victory for the workers, in what union supporters hope will be a historic day for long-suffering and often powerless Asian immigrant employees. But others pointed out that the Silver Palace, where workers joined the Restaurant Workers Union in 1981, remains Chinatown's first and only union restaurant, and that other workers have little power to fight back.

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LEAR'S
Lear's magazine died as it had lived. It was created by Frances Lear, who, after a bitter divorce from the television producer Norman Lear, was at a crossroads. She invented the magazine for a particular reader: herself. She gave the magazine her vision, her energy, her money and her name. She sustained it with her enthusiasm and, when she lost interest, she pulled the plug. D1.

REPUBLICANS IN HARMONY
They squabble like a dysfunctional family, accusing one another of dark intrigues and impure motives. But when the Republicans seeking to run for governor talk about how to defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, they harmonize like the Vienna Boys Choir. In a year when party leaders are unable to unite behind a standard bearer and plotting primary challenges, at least the would-be candidates, liberal and conservative, seem sweetly attuned to what they think is the winning formula.

FIGHT LOOMS ON LAWSUITS
A fight over placing restrictions on the right to sue -- with supporters saying that would reduce frivolous lawsuits, and opponents contending it would shield businesses from paying for legitimate damages -- is shaping up in the New Jersey State Legislature. The drive for making the first changes in seven years in laws regulating civil torts, cases in which an individual sues because of alleged harm received, is part of a national debate that has surfaced across the country.

TAKING OVER NEWARK SCHOOLS
Donna Jackson, an unemployed mother of three, has been battling the Newark school system since her daughter Ericka, now 11, was 3 years old. She considers the district corrupt, anti-parent, and largely unconcerned about its students. Yet she passionately opposes the State Department of Education's proposed takeover of the 50,000-student school district, the state's largest. As the department moves closer to the proposed takeover, emotions in Newark are running high. B5.
 
TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS CANCELED
The temporary closing of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports in London after a mortar attack on Heathrow led to the cancellation of some flights from London to New York and left hundreds of passengers stranded for hours on both sides of the Atlantic. But airline officials said they did not expect any interruptions in flight service today. Several British Airways planes flying into Heathrow were diverted to other British airports after the attack, disrupting schedules and forcing the cancellation of four flights headed to Kennedy and Newark International airports from London.

HEADLINE: Conservationists Divided Over How to Protect Sea Mammals

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
As Congress revises a law that controls the killing of whales, porpoises and other marine mammals by the fishing industry, the debate among conservationists seems at times more intense than the one among lawmakers.
Groups that together made "save the whales" one of environmentalism's best-known slogans are now divided over how far to accommodate the needs of the fishing industry in a new version of the law, the Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
 The law, enacted in 1972, was meant to prevent the deaths of mammals in fishing nets. In 1988, its central provisions were suspended for five years to allow biologists to study the status of various protected species. But the moratorium will expire on April 1, putting pressure on Congress to revise the law quickly so fishing will not have to be halted in important areas.
 
Dissent Among Advocates
 Some groups, like the Center for Marine Conservation, have endorsed a draft of legislation that is expected to be debated soon by the Senate, while others, like the Defenders of Wildlife, say the proposed measure is unacceptable.
The question, said Nina Young, a spokeswoman for the Center for Marine Conservation, is, "Do you let the fishermen fish for some amount of time under a set of regulations to reduce mammal mortality, or do you not let them fish -- do you close the fishery down?"
"We support what is coming out in the Senate," Ms. Young said. "It does have a very conservative approach for reducing the mortality. It allows them to fish, and to change their behavior over time."
But Christopher Croft, a marine wildlife specialist with Defenders of Wildlife, said that while his organization and dozens of others did not want to halt fishing they considered the latest legislative proposals to be seriously flawed.
"All we are asking is that there be some protection left in the Marine Mammal Protection Act," Mr. Croft said. "We are not asking too much."
 
Tens of Thousands of Deaths
 In the five years that the act has been curtailed, tens of thousands of mammals have died each year in fishing nets. Some species, like the harbor porpoise, have been depleted to a point where their replenishment is in doubt. (In the late 1980's a consumer boycott of canned tuna led the Government to protect dolphins specifically during the marine mammal law's five-year moratorium.)
Now, as Congressional committees dominated by lawmakers from fishing states rush to draft highly technical bills for consideration by the House and Senate, conservation groups are at odds over the proposals.
Last year, some conservation groups negotiated a proposal with the fishing industry that has been incorporated into the legislative draft. The compromise was intended to reduce the killing of mammals, but not necessarily to end it altogether.
It was that proposal that sparked the dispute among conservation groups. And even though they have won important concessions in negotiations that continue, some groups are withholding support from the full legislation.
 
Acceptable Formula
 Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is managing the Senate bill, met on Friday with environmental groups to discuss a fresh draft. In an interview, he said he had urged them to help him reach a formula acceptable to all sides.
"I told them, 'You have a choice here between trying to constructively come together and reach an agreement on what we can all make work, or you are going to have to ask for the current regime to be prolonged, which gives you no prohibitions and no guarantees,' " Mr. Kerry said. " 'You really have to get into a reality mode.' "
Although the Senator has been working closely with the conservation groups, his state is also the base of much of the New England fishing industry, which is already suffering because of depleted fish stocks and has much at stake in what the marine mammal law will allow.
For example, the types of nets used for catching flounder and cod in the region take a heavy toll on harbor porpoises, a species that is proposed for listing as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act.
 
Changing Some Practices
 The draft bill that Mr. Kerry is pushing would set a formula for Federal fishing regulators to use when determining the acceptable level for the killing of harbor porpoises, and for how fishing practices would have to change to protect the mammals. It would also change the treatment of species listed under the Endangered Species Act, making it possible in some circumstances to kill them.
A provision of Mr. Kerry's bill and a companion measure being drafted in the House is of particular concern to some conservationists because it will shift the burden of proof from the fishing industry to the Government when deciding whether to allow protected mammals to be killed. The proposal before Congress would give fishermen permits to kill protected mammals unless the Government showed the mammal species would be threatened. Under the old law, the fishing industry had to prove that the species would not be threatened.
The proposals would require changes in fishing practices, like avoiding certain mammals' known migration routes each year. Some conservation groups are even less pleased with the version of the bill being drawn up in the House by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, which is headed by another Massachusetts Democrat, Representative Gerry E. Studds. A subcommittee approved a draft of that legislation on Wednesday.
In a move that did not affect fishing but that infuriated animal-protection advocates, the House subcommittee agreed to allow Americans to import polar bear trophies, a step that would encourage American hunters to shoot the bears in Canada or Russia.
Although animal-protection groups like the Fund for Animals criticized that provision, which was promoted by sport-hunting businesses, some conservationists defended it, saying it would raise the value of a thriving bear population to Canada's Inuit inhabitants, who could sell their bear-hunting licenses to American trophy hunters.
"Providing ongoing economic value to an animal species is the surest way to guarantee its health and perpetuation," said Joseph P. Kalt, a natural resource economist who is faculty chairman of the environment program at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

HEADLINE: U.S. Gains On Japan In Patents

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
For the first time in almost a decade, an American corporation has dislodged a Japanese company from first place in the top-10 list of companies receiving patents in the United States.
While the Japanese still held 6 of the top 10 positions on the list announced last week by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I.B.M. jumped into first place with 1,085 patents in 1993, up from sixth place in 1992. 
 The annual list from the patent office, which is an agency of the Commerce Department, is closely watched as a barometer of the research, development and innovation undertaken by the creators and manufacturers of technology around the world.
Throughout the 1980's, the list stood as a sharp illustration of how the United States lagged behind Japan in the race for discoveries that lead to new products and services. In fact, Japanese companies have led the list and dominated the top 10 since 1985.
 
Japanese Companies Edged Out
 On the 1993 list, the International Business Machines Corporation was followed by two Japanese companies, the Toshiba Corporation and Canon Inc. But in another shift, the Eastman Kodak Company and the General Electric Company moved into fourth and fifth places, edging out Japanese companies and giving Americans three of the top five spots.
In 1992, four of the top five spots went to Japanese companies, with Canon leading the list. General Electric ranked fourth, and I.B.M. was sixth.
Intellectual-property analysts, patent attorneys and corporate officials believe American companies are rising on the list because they are investing more vigorously in developing competitive high-technology products. And while Americans are seeking greater patent protection for their inventions, a weak economy is leading Japanese inventors to cut back on patenting costs.
 
A Shift in American Economy
 At the same time, the rankings illustrate how the American economy is shifting from a traditional manufacturing base toward technology-based industries like computers and telecommunications.
"One factor is simply the greater value of technology relevant to traditional wealth in the economy," said Herbert C. Wamsley, executive director of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, a trade group representing patent, copyright and trademark holders.
"What we're seeing now is recognition of the value of technology and knowledge-based industries," he continued. "Because of that, businesses have been willing to invest in research and development and to put greater importance on securing the best possible intellectual property rights as a way of protecting knowledge."
Patents provide exclusive ownership for 14 years to inventors of new mechanical, chemical and electrical products or processes. For many industries, a single patent can be more valuable than the deed to a large factory. In 1991, for example, the Polaroid Corporation received $925 million from Eastman Kodak to settle a lengthy patent dispute over Polaroid's instant photography technology.
The United States Government was the overall leader in patents received last year, with 1,165 inventions belonging to various agencies, principal among them the Defense Department.
 
Rethinking Research at I.B.M.
 I.B.M. officials say the sharp downturn in their company's fortunes in recent years forced them to re-evaluate their research priorities as well as their patenting policies.
"This is a shift in the company waking up to the fact that good things don't just naturally happen to I.B.M., and we have to scrap and scrape to succeed," said Marshall Phelps, vice president of intellectual property and licensing for I.B.M.
"There was a time when I.B.M. could afford to do a lot of research for academic interests," he added. But that was before last year, when I.B.M. slashed $1 billion from its research and development budget.
"Those days are over," Mr. Phelps said. "This stuff is practical. It's about where we think the industry will be, what the technology requires, where the products are going."
But Dan Mandresh, an I.B.M. analyst with Merrill Lynch, questioned whether the company can "bring this technology to the bottom line."
"Here they win this patent citation for developmental efforts embarked on several years ago under a management team that is no longer there because it didn't bring results to the bottom line," he said. "Now they're in the first full year of a new management team whose entire focus is cutting expenses. The question is: Where will I.B.M. be on this list three years from now?"
 
A Tool for High Technology
 Mr. Phelps said most of I.B.M.'s patents were for inventions in the areas of multimedia, software, computer networking, microprocessors and information storage devices. "There is no question that an awful lot of these patents reflect a shift in emphasis into technology," he said.
That should please the Clinton Administration, which views the patent system as an important tool for insuring the development and competitiveness of American high-technology industries. Bruce A. Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, has said that the Administration sees those emerging industries as the source of future high-wage jobs, and that intellectual-property rights are one way for companies to maintain a competitive edge and seek advantage in export markets.
Mr. Lehman has held public hearings on patent harmonization -- efforts to bring Federal patent law into harmony with rules in Canada, Europe and Japan -- and, more important, on the issue of patents for inventions related to computer software.
 
A Crucial Government Effort
 The patents counted in last year's list are for inventions completed two to three years ago, because that is about how long it takes the Government to process the applications. So the Clinton Administration's efforts would have had no effect on these latest rankings.
But a previous Government initiative, during the Reagan Administration, was crucial to American corporate attitudes toward patents. In 1982, Congress established a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to hear patent infringement suits. Before that, nonspecialist judges in regional courts were often skeptical of the breadth of many patent claims.
"The Federal Circuit brought more unification and certainty to patent law," Mr. Wamsley said, giving companies more confidence in the long-term investment value of patents.
Thomas L. Giannetti, a partner with Fish & Neave, a law firm that specializes in intellectual property, said, "There's a perception that patents are more valuable than they used to be because they get upheld by the courts with greater frequency, and the damages are higher."
"Patents represent investment," he added. "I can't speak to I.B.M., but it all fits together. If patents have greater value, then research has greater value. It becomes a better investment because companies can protect it."

HEADLINE: Michigan Debates Best Tax to Finance Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KALKASKA, Mich., March 12

 BODY:
For weeks, the talk in this rural town surrounded by poplars and pines has centered not on the snow or the spring fishing but on schools and taxes.
This is the town that drew nationwide attention last March by closing its schools three months early when it ran out of money after voters refused to raise taxes. Its decision led to one of the nation's most sweeping proposals to change the way schools are financed. 
 On Tuesday, Michigan residents will vote on a proposal to pay for their schools by increasing the sales tax to 6 percent, from 4 percent, and tripling the state cigarette tax.
In return, they would get sharp reductions in their local property taxes, which now provide most of the support for schools.
But even if the measure is defeated, paying for schools will never be the same. The Michigan Legislature has approved a backup plan to pay for schools by raising the state income tax and trimming property taxes.
Statewide polling shows the sales tax plan has the edge over the income tax plan, and Kalkaska residents say they simply want their schools to stay open.
"Over all, I think the proposal is a more equitable way to finance schools," said Randy Nygren, the owner of a downtown restaurant and the father of two children in schools here. "I'll probably vote for it. It's the least of two evils."
The plan has drawn considerable interest from other states caught in the same mire of school finance -- with debates about the inequities between rich and poor districts, and with property owners facing tax increases each year for what they perceive as declining schools.
 
Support for Sales Tax
 Supporters, including Gov. John M. Engler, said the ballot measure would relieve pressure on taxpayers as well as schools, which are now forced to go to voters every two to three years for a tax increase.
"There is nothing more stable than the property tax," said John Truscott, a spokesman for Governor Engler, a Republican who is running for re-election in November. "But it is unfair to property owners. The sales tax spreads the cost to everyone."
But will sales taxes generate adequate money or schools?
Critics think not. They said the tax was too vulnerable to the ebb and flow of the economy. In recessions, consumers delay buying cars and other big-ticket items that increase revenue from the sales tax, which covers all purchases except food, prescription drugs and heating fuels.
"The proposal is shaky," said Beverly Wilcow, executive director of the Michigan Education Association, which represents 127,000 school employees statewide. "It is not a good plan."
Nonetheless, figures from the Michigan Treasury Department show that since 1985, the sales tax revenue has grown each year, to $3.7 billion in 1993. Property taxes generate significantly more money -- $6.8 billion last year, of which about 70 percent went to education. Income tax revenue was about the same -- $6.9 billion.
Under the ballot measure, the sales tax would increase to 6 cents from 4 cents, generating nearly $1.8 billion next year. The cigarette tax would rise to 75 cents a pack from 25 cents, raising an estimated $350 million a year.
The incentive for voters is a drastic cut in local property taxes, down to $6 on $1,000 of assessed value. In Kalkaska, where the average home is assessed at $44,000 and property owners pay $24 per $1,000 of assessed value, the typical homeowner would pay $264 a year, down from $1,056.
If voters reject the proposal, the Legislature would raise the state income tax rate to 6 percent from 4.6 percent, which would generate $1.8 billion to $2 billion in revenue. Property taxes would also be trimmed under the backup plan, but not nearly as much. Whichever plan is enacted will take effect on May 1.
In either case, statewide money for education would be increased to $10.2 billion, up 5 percent from the current budget.
While statewide polls show the sales tax plan has the edge, the fight has been cantankerous. Michigan Citizens for Fair Taxes, representing the teachers union and the tobacco industry, is spending $3.8 million to fight it.
But in Kalkaska, a town of about 4,300 people in northwestern central Michigan, some residents say the differences between the two plans amounts to very little.
"Either way, we pay," said Rene Niece, a waitress at Judy's Lagoon Saloon who has two children in school.
At Kalkaska High School, where 590 students are enrolled, teachers said they hoped the measure would eliminate the prospect of closing early, which they said has hurt the students. Sam Luedtke, a 17-year-old senior, said that in his math class this year, for instance, the teacher had to start with the concepts that were not covered because of last year's truncated school year.
Another student, Travis Hansen, an 18-year-old senior who now has to pay a $50 fee to play on the basketball team, said, "The proposal would help our schools, but it won't solve all our problems."
Even though Kalkaska's public schools will see per pupil spending increase to $4,200 a year in the next school year from the current $3,800 if the ballot measure is approved, school officials say the district will still be under financial pressure.
"What happens if the sales tax declines one year and there isn't enough money?" asked Doyle Disbrow, the Superintendent of Schools. "What happens then? As a superintendent, I'd like to know where revenue is coming from in the next five years for planning purposes."
It is not an unreasonable request, Mr. Disbrow said. Already, some state officials acknowledge that the state sales tax measure, if approved, might well require supplemental income from other state sources that have yet to be identified.
That is not a prospect that makes Mr. Disbrow feel comfortable about the ballot proposal. "It has all the markings of destruction down the road," he said.

HEADLINE: Newark vs. Trenton: Fight for a City's Schools

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 9

 BODY:
Having grown up in this city, Donna Jackson knows that Newark can be angry. She says a little constructive anger might be good right now.
Ms. Jackson, an unemployed mother of three, has been battling the Newark school system since her daughter Ericka, now 11, was three years old. She considers the district corrupt, anti-parent, and largely unconcerned about its students. Yet she passionately opposes the State Department of Education's proposed takeover of the schools. 
 "I still believe, firmly believe, that they have no business coming in here," she said. "The bottom line is, state takeover -- and I'll say this forever and a day -- has nothing to do with our children and nothing to do with education."
 
Newark Under Review
 Emotions are running high in this city as the State Department of Education moves closer to a proposed takeover of the 50,000-student school district, the state's largest. A stinging report delivered to the State Education Commissioner last April portrayed Newark as a chronically failing district, damaged by mismanagement and paralyzed by cronyism and political interference. The report led to a final education department review of the district, now under way.
The State's Education Commissioner, Leo Klagholtz, has said he hopes to review the results of the investigation and make a recommendation on the takeover by June. If, after that, the State Board of Education decides to take over the district, it will replace the school board and top administrators.
Meanwhile, people like Ms. Jackson impatiently work the community groups and parent associations of Newark, warning about the dangers of a takeover.
Ms. Jackson, 29, considers herself a community parent, responsible not only for her own three children, but for every Newark schoolchild "and those on the street, too." She is blunt, insistent, often pushy, a squeaky-wheel woman who serves on several parent-teacher associations and volunteers as a go-between for parents embroiled in school battles large and small.
 
'It's Personal to Me'
 Ms. Jackson became involved in the district to assure that her daughter Ericka, who became physically disabled after a playground accident at the age of 3, received special education. Ericka now receives occupational therapy through the schools. Ms. Jackson also has two other children in the district: Matthew, 7 and Rashaun, 12.
"They say it ain't personal, but damn, it's personal to me," Ms. Jackson said. "Because I know that, directly, they have killed our children for over 10 years."
Ms. Jackson's latest support base is the Newark Parental Commission, a group of about two dozen community advocates and parents who came together from other fledgling groups to create what they hope will be a significant voice for the community during the takeover negotiations. The members of the group are sometimes divided over whether a state takeover will make things better or worse, but united by their frustration at the district's failings.
Asking these parents what they think of their schools is asking to hear a torrent of complaints.
Maryam Bey, who is running for the Newark school board, is angry that the district has not met state education standards for more than a decade; that 86 percent of 11th-grade students at Central High failed the math portion of a recent state proficiency test; that Newark officials are, she says, unable or unwilling to halt the deterioration of the schools.
"Those who are not working have to go," she said. "They are destroying children. That's the bottom line."
Jerry Jacobs, a parent with two daughters in the system, said the only improvements made in his daughters' schools have come since the state began the takeover process. He said district officials have proved that they cannot or will not improve the schools.
"This thing is like a cancer," he said. "It's embedded. You have to clean house."
His fifth-grade daughter is a straight-A student, but only because she has been tutored at home, Mr. Jacobs said. He hopes she will land a scholarship at a local private school for next year and be able to leave the Newark schools forever.
But Mr. Jacobs's 14-year-old daughter is struggling at the High School of the Arts, and he bitterly attributes her trouble to the education she received in middle school. His daughter often did not have English textbooks or math workbooks, he said.
"I am sure the state can't do any worse," he said.
During a meeting of the Newark Parental Commission, on a cold night in late February, fewer than 40 people shared the room. But there was anguish for a thousand.
Gordon Mays, an elementary school principal, pleaded with the group to work with a state takeover, instead of against it. He said the group's impassioned demands to control their own schools with minimal interference from either the state or the Newark school board were unrealistic, and he urged the parents to negotiate with state officials for a part in choosing people to run the district during a takeover.
"There is nothing that prevents you from becoming involved now, as opposed to playing the same old game we have for years -- standing outside, objecting to everything, and when the deal goes down we're still on the outside looking in, folks," he said. "Ever since I been in this district the community has never won."
"Please," he said, "for God's sake, become winners this time."
But Rebecca Doggett, the state-appointed auditor general of the Newark school district, who has attended dozens of meetings to explain the proposed takeover and encourage community involvement, said that although some parents agree with Mr. Mays, most do not.
"Very few parents have said, 'Yeah, let the state come in.' They're as afraid of the state as they are of 2 Cedar Street," she said, referring to the address of the Newark school administrative offices.
No amount of reassurance is enough for Ms. Jackson, who believes passionately that state education officials are more interested in jobs and power than in educating Newark children. Widely shared is the suspicion that during a takeover the state would contract with outside vendors for cafeteria and janitorial services and clerical help -- a move that some fear would especially hurt black and Hispanic workers.
"Newark is being turned into a big employment factory where more of us, and by us I mean African-Americans, will just be pushed out of the way," Ms. Jackson said.
Such tensions lie like a veil over the face of the school district. Newark is a predominantly black city, with a small but significant white population, a large Portuguese community and a growing Hispanic presence. In the past, school board members have suggested that the proposed takeover by mostly white state leaders was, in part, racially motivated.
Several Hispanic groups have complained of Hispanic underrepresentation among teachers and administrators. Hispanic students, mostly Puerto Rican, make up 26 percent of the Newark student body. Fourteen percent of district principals and vice principals are Hispanic, according to district figures. Thirty-five percent are white and 52 percent are black.
Roberto Del Rios, acting executive director of Aspira of New Jersey, a Hispanic educational and advocacy group, said one of the district's two Hispanic guidance counselors died last year. The other retired.
Mr. Del Rios said his group's board of directors has not taken a position on a takeover partly because the group receives money from the district, but also because many members are deeply ambivalent. No one is impressed by the state's results in Jersey City and Paterson, the other two districts that have been taken over, he said.
Different people gave different answers to the big question of why more parents are not involved with the school district. Ms. Jackson said many parents are so confused and discouraged, they have given up. Other parents complained that policies like the required five-day advance notice to speak at board meetings discourage involvement.
Ms. Bey said that although some Newark parents have abdicated their responsibility to help educate their children, that fact does not absolve the district of its failures.
"Eventually those parents will come around," she said. "but it's never the majority that makes a change. It's a small minority." So the Newark Parental Commission goes on, handing out fliers, meeting every other Monday night, preaching fiery warnings and hoping, next time, to draw a crowd.
"With all of that money and all of that failure, it's time to kick butt and stop being quiet, and get emotional," Ms. Jackson told the nodding audience at the group's last meeting. "Y'all too quiet for me."

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s Cuomo Rivals: Shared Views Amid Squabbling

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 13

 BODY:
They squabble like a dysfunctional family, accusing one another of dark intrigues and impure motives. But when the Republicans seeking to run for governor talk about how to defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, they harmonize like the Vienna Boys Choir.
Crime? The six most active candidates advocate the death penalty, which Mr. Cuomo has blocked for 11 years. Taxes? All support deep cuts in the personal income tax and many business taxes. Welfare reform? All would fingerprint welfare recipients and require able-bodied ones to work. Big government? All talk about slashing the state work force, privatizing services and instituting some form of school voucher program. 
 In a year when party leaders are unable to unite behind a standard bearer and plotting primary challenges, at least the would-be candidates, liberal and conservative, seem sweetly attuned to what they think is the winning formula.
"You've got a basic Republican philosophy and they're all running on it," said William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman. "Someone tough on crime, who understands the problems of the economy, who is for less government, not more, who feels that cutting taxes sends a signal to business that New York State is a user-friendly state."
 
Scent of Blood
 But the Republicans' conformity on issues may have less to do with philosophy than the scent of Mr. Cuomo's blood. A recent poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie found that voters were most concerned about crime, the economy and taxes. That same poll showed Mr. Cuomo's approval rating at 36 percent, near an all-time low.
And the successes of tax-cutting and tough-on-crime Republicans in last year's New Jersey gubernatorial race and the New York City mayoral race have given those traditional Republican concerns new prominence in the state's political firmament.
"Nothing quite brings unity like the statewide prospect of victory, and that's what we've got this year," said Jay Severin, a Republican political consultant. "The Governor is in trouble on issues that make virtually any Republican candidate a viable candidate."
The six most active Republicans seeking the nomination are J. Patrick Barrett, a former state Republican chairman; Evan G. Galbraith, a former Ambassador to France; Bill Green, a former United States Representative from Manhattan; Herbert London, a college professor; George E. Pataki, a State Senator from Peekskill, and Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman.
Mr. Pataki and Mr. London are at the heart of a rift within the party. Mr. Pataki is supported by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato while Mr. London is supported by some Republicans close to Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate majority leader.
Several other men have said they might run but have not campaigned for support. They include Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of Glens Falls and Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive.
 
Ideological Contrasts
 The candidates by no means share similar ideological roots. Mr. Barrett, Mr. Galbraith, Mr. Pataki and Mr. London hail from the party's conservative wing, and all have ties to the anti-tax group, Change-New York. Mr. Green and Mr. Rosenbaum come from the party's liberal wing, once dominated by Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Those differences are clearest on abortion, the one issue that threatens to inject a sour note into the Republican melody. Mr. Barrett and Mr. London hold strongly anti-abortion views, while Mr. Green and Mr. Rosenbaum oppose any restrictions on abortion. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Galbraith say they support abortion rights, but both could support some abortion restrictions.
But on closer examination, several candidates seem to be inching toward a middle ground.
Mr. London argues that while he opposes abortion, United States Supreme Court rulings have made it a protected right that he, as governor, would be required to uphold. But he would support ending Medicaid funds for abortions, requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions and imposing a 24-hour waiting period.
Mr. Galbraith says that while he is in favor of abortion rights, he would support ending Medicaid funds for abortions. And Mr. Pataki has voted in the Senate against Medicaid-financed abortions and says he would do so again unless women are required to undergo family-planning counseling before receiving abortions.
Republican and Conservative Party leaders also seem determined to accommodate each other to avoid the friction of 1990, when the Conservative Party endorsed Mr. London instead of the Republican candidate, Pierre Rinfret, an abortion-rights supporter. Mr. Rinfret barely finished ahead of Mr. London as Mr. Cuomo easily won a third term.
Both Michael R. Long, the state Conservative Party chairman, and William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, say abortion will not be a "litmus test" for candidates. "I'm not going to allow a single issue to take over our convention," Mr. Powers said.
On a host of other issues, the Republicans are in sync. Though some articulate only the gauzy outlines of programs, they have not hesitated to attack Mr. Cuomo's tax-cutting, welfare and criminal-justice proposals as anemic.
"What Cuomo calls for is boutique tax-cutting," said Mr. Rosenbaum, probably the most cautious of the Republicans on tax cuts.
All six say they would reduce the state's personal income tax, a position Mr. Cuomo opposes. Mr. Galbraith would go the furthest in cutting the top rate almost in half, to 4 from 7.88 percent. All would reduce the state's corporate surcharge more than Mr. Cuomo has proposed, and three -- Mr. Pataki, Mr. London and Mr. Galbraith -- would eliminate it.
 
'Family Concept'
 Mr. Galbraith proposes the most radical overhaul of welfare, saying he would eliminate most payments within two years. "This system has clearly destroyed the family concept in the inner city," he said.
The other candidates propose a range of programs that require welfare recipients to work or set time limits on payments. Mr. London would also reduce payments to unwed mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
As in the past, the Republicans view Mr. Cuomo's adamant opposition to the death penalty as an Achilles' heel, and all hammer at him for having a death-row prisoner in Oklahoma brought to New York to serve a life sentence for another murder. "This is a governor who has been exporting jobs all over the country but importing convicted killers," Mr. Pataki said.
But for the liberal Republicans, supporting capital punishment also seems a way to win conservative cachet. "The Conservatives ought to consider someone like myself who is a conservative on fiscal issues and supports the death penalty," Mr. Green said.
The Republicans contend that Mr. Cuomo's budget and State of the State speech this year indicate how vulnerable he feels on taxes and crime. Mr. Cuomo has called for reducing the state corporate surcharge, phasing out the state hotel tax and reducing or eliminating a number of lesser taxes and fees.
 
Prison Without Parole
 On crime, the Governor has proposed life imprisonment without parole for people convicted of a third felony, a position long favored by the Republicans who control the State Senate but opposed in the Democratic-led Assembly.
Mr. Cuomo has also sounded several other traditionally Republican themes. He wants to encourage more welfare recipients to work and has endorsed, in theory, fingerprinting some recipients to prevent fraud. He has supported giving parents greater choice over which schools they send their children to, though he has stopped short of endorsing a voucher program. And he has endorsed restrictions on product liability suits and a type of shareholder litigation against corporations.
But Mr. Cuomo's aides object to his being portrayed as a recent convert to those positions, particularly tax-cutting. "The real issue is that the Democrats have controlled and cut taxes to their lowest level in 30 years," said Al Gordon, the state Democratic chairman. "And who did they cut it from? The Republicans."

HEADLINE: World's Big Economies Turn to the Jobs Issue

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
When recession pushed up unemployment in all the major industrial democracies a few years ago, the conventional wisdom was that the upturn in the business cycle would solve most of the problem. But now that the upturn has arrived in the United States, and the worst of the recession is over in Europe, new high-wage jobs remain scarce in both places, and many governments are beginning to fear that the shortage may be permanent.
"We used to think that jobs and the economy were the same thing," the United States Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, said. "But we have learned in recent years that the paper economy and the people's economy are not always the same thing." 
 In today's highly integrated global marketplace, he said, economies can grow in size, company profits can soar, a stock market can rise, and yet many people can be unemployed or underemployed -- because capital and technology are now so mobile that they do not always create good jobs in their own backyard. Add to that the emphasis on corporate cutbacks and a lot of people have been left stranded.
"There is now a much greater sensitivity," Mr. Reich said, "that the challenge of creating good jobs must be dealt with on its own terms" and not by relying on economic growth alone.
That sensitivity is the driving force behind the jobs conference being convened by the Clinton Administration in Detroit on Monday, bringing together finance and labor ministers from the Group of Seven industrial democracies.
This will be the first Group of Seven conference ever to include labor ministers. In the past, only finance ministers and heads of state got together, to discuss high diplomacy and the high finance of exchange rates and interest rate management.
But that lofty approach is insufficient to get at the jobs issue now ailing all these nations. In some ways, just as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is groping to redefine itself and its priorities to stay relevant, so, too, is the Group of Seven.
"Seen from Europe, unemployment is the biggest security problem facing the Western world today, and the G-7 is simply acknowledging that," Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations, said. "Because if we don't find answers to that problem, our entire system will collapse on itself."
Like many such international gatherings, the Detroit meeting will probably do more to highlight the problems than to solve them. American officials say they are not planning any final communique.
But the ministers do hope that the discussions can teach them something about what each of them has done right, and wrong, in confronting the jobs question. To some extent, they may each use the conference to build political cover at home to confront some of the hardest issues -- such as getting workers in Europe to accept fewer benefits so more people will be hired, or persuading Congress to invest more in job training so more teen-agers who are not going to college will have marketable skills.
Many European leaders initially played down the idea of the conference when President Clinton proposed it last summer in Tokyo. But their interest has grown in recent months as continuing unemployment has become the hottest political issue in elections throughout Western Europe, where roughly 19 million people are out of work.
After all, as Mr. Moisi put it, unemployment "is the proof that governments are not effective because they are not finding solutions to the most urgent problems of the day."
"It delegitimizes governments and is a time bomb," he added. "In France there are people already saying we are preparing ourselves for a nice little replay of the revolutionary events of May '68 -- only this time around it won't be young people bored with growth and the affluent society who take to the barricades, but young people desperate to find a place in a system that rejects them."
Among the Group of Seven -- Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada, Italy and the United States -- the jobs problem manifests itself differently. Broadly speaking, Europe and Canada have managed to keep wages and benefits rising for their workers, but at the price of relatively high unemployment for many others, who are sustained with generous unemployment insurance.
The United States, which has been out of recession the longest, has managed to create many more jobs than Europe, but only by getting workers to take more low-paying jobs, thereby widening the gap between the highest-paid and lowest-paid workers.
"At heart," Mr. Reich said, "the question before this summit will be: Are we condemned to choose between more jobs but greater inequality and insecurity, as we have in this country, or better jobs, but higher unemployment and a thicker social safety net, as in Europe?"
 
The Gap in Rates
 The numbers tell the story. In the United States the unemployment rate is holding at about 6.5 percent, despite a booming economic recovery, while in Canada and Western Europe, it averages around 11 percent, with Spain topping the list at 23 percent.
These figures do not take into account the large numbers of workers who are soon to be laid off, as the European Union begins to go through some of the cost-cutting that American industries have already endured.
Japan is at a comfortable unemployment level of 2.9 percent. But that does not include many workers who are kept in make-work jobs as part of Japan's lifetime employment policies.
The problem looks somewhat different from a wage perspective. According to the Labor Department, total compensation -- wages, health benefits, vacations -- for the typical American manufacturing worker has declined slightly or remained flat since the mid-1970's, while in Europe and Japan it has increased by 40 percent. Minimum wage levels tend to be higher in Europe, with cost-of-living increases and four-week annual vacations virtually guaranteed. Average manufacturing compensation in Germany is $26 an hour. In America, it is $16.
What the Labor Department calls low-wage noncollege-educated workers and workers from disadvantaged backgrounds have suffered even more in the United States. In the 1980's, their wages fell 15 to 20 percent when adjusted for inflation, while in Europe and Japan these wages rose about 15 to 20 percent.
But on the flip side, between 1973 and 1991, the United States economy created more than 35 million jobs. In the same period, the European Community generated only eight million new jobs, even though it has about one-third more people.
In large part, this is because of Europe's relatively comfortable social safety nets, which have left many workers preferring to stay on welfare rather than take the sort of low-paying jobs accepted by many workers in the United States. In most of the European Union, an unemployed worker can receive close to $1,000 a month indefinitely. In addition, Europe's highly regulated job markets, where it is very difficult to dismiss workers, have left employers wary of creating jobs.
 
The Potential Lessons
 What might the Americans learn from the Europeans and the Japanese at the conference? They both have done a much better job of developing apprenticeship and training programs for those between the ages of 13 to 17 who are not going to college, American officials say. Getting these young people into more skilled jobs is one reason Europe and Japan do not have as wide a wage gap as the United States between skilled an unskilled workers.
From the Americans, the Europeans and Japanese could learn how to make their work forces more flexible by eliminating some job security, encouraging people to relocate and moving toward a social safety net that is more focused on retraining people for new jobs than paying them to stay indefinitely unemployed.
If there is a synthesis that might emerge from Detroit, Mr. Reich said, it is: "We can learn from their educational system; they can learn from our mobility."
But what is not clear, he added, is this: "Can you combine the degree and quality of human capital investment and educational training and apprenticeship programs that we see in Europe and Japan, with the sort of flexible, mobile labor market that we have in this country?"

Graphs: "Job Woes inthe Group of Seven: An Overview"
 As their leaders gather to discuss the economics and politics of employment, the sevenlargest industrial democracies have little in common beyond concern over slow job growth. Here is where each nation stanes.
 
United States
 Plenty of bad jobs. Over the last two decades, the United States has created many more jobs than Western Europe - 35 million - but the bulk of new jobs are low paying, widening the gap between the lowest- and highest-paid workers.
 Failing pay. Of the major economies, only the United States has seenr eal wages fail over the last decade. Total compensation for the average American worker in manufacturing is $16 an hour, less than two-thirds of the $26 an hour a typical German worker gets.
 First to streamline. American industry has been cutting payrolls and closing inefficient operations on a large scale for more than a year, a process European countries have just begun. America's lower unemployment rate makes short-term dislocation easier to tolerate.
 
Canada
 Commodity slump. Canada's resource-based economy was so clobbered by the latest recession that it has yet to replace jobs lost over the past five years. World demand for Canadian exports like lead, zinc, timber and newsprint has not rebounded strongly.
 Reluctance to hire. "Employers are trying to enhance productivity, not create jobs," said Edward Harvey, professor of industrial relations at the University of Toronto. "They're extracating additional productivity from existing workers."
 Public pump priming. The Government's strategy is to jump-start job growth with large spending on public works programs by all levels of government; aid for small business, the principal generator of jobs, and apprenticeship programs for youth. Officials estimate that 300,000 jobs remain unfilled because young people with relevant skills cannot be found for them.
 
Britain
 Credibility. Britain will be the only European nation at the summit enjoying falling unemployment and solid growth, and its free-market approach, often given the cold shoulder in the past, will command an unusual level of respect. But critics say the country has too many part-time or low-paying new jobs.
 Pressure on unions. The goal of London's approach to job creation is "flexible" labor markets, in which employers can hire and fire workers relatively easily and inexpensively. Policies to that end include limits on the strength of unions, deregulation of industry and low interest rates and inflation.
 Against make-work. Prime Minister John Major has argued strongly -- and so far successfully -- against Europe-wide public spending projects to create jobs, which he said would be inflationary and do little to address long-term structural unemployment.
 
FRANCE
 Irreparable harm. The French government would be less alarmed about rising unemployment if it was simply a product of the current recession. But officials worry that one million jobs lost since 1991 may be gone forever. France's economy creates few jobs even when growing, and except for a brief respite in the late 1980's, the number of jobless has been climbing for 25 years.
 Working less for less. The government has proposed cutting minimum wages for young trainees by 20 to 70 percent, but students and labor unions are stiffly opposed. A plan backed by the opposition Socialists to cut the work week from 39 hours to 32, theoretically spreading the same work and pay among more people, is hotly debated.
 Welfare at risk. The heart of France's problem is whether it must reduce the social costs paid by employers -- and shrink the country's generous system of welfare benefits -- in order to stimulate job creation and make its economy more competitive. But it knows that this is politically explosive.
 
ITALY
 Hard to slim down. Half of the economy is in the public sector; politics makes it hard to prune jobs from the vast array of state-run businesses ranging from supermarkets to the national airline. Worker-friendly laws make private-sector layoffs very expensive for employers, requiring a month's severance pay for every year of service. Ravages of recession. Such protections have not kept unemployment from rising sharply since 1992. And official statistics exclude the 500,000 workers temporarily laid off, who receive 80 per cent of their salaries under a long-standing arrangement between employers and the Government.
 Decoupling wages. Unions agreed last year to suspend the "scala mobile", a national tradition insuring that annual salary hikes automatically matched inflation. Wage rises have slowed substantially.
 
GERMANY
 Structural crisis. In Germany and much of western Europe, "the assumption that renewed economic growth will automatically create jobs is no longer valid," says Kurt Biedenkopf, premier of Germany's Saxony state." The German economy is in a structural crisis, shifting away from labor-intensive smokestack industries toward service, software and high-technology. Even strong growth, which is not to be expected, will not create enough new jobs to replace those lost."
 Market rigidity. Germany's labor market is among the most expensive and tightly regulated in the world. The government has made mild moves to loosen it, moving to encourage part-time employment and allowing creation of private employment agencies. The economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, wants a new category of low-wage jobs for workers with few skills and lower entry-level wages for some jobs.
 
JAPAN
 Feeling vulnerable. With low unemployment and a huge trade surplus, Japan is approaching the jobs conference with some dread. It is sure to be criticized for exporting unemployment, and pressed to expand its economy and open its markets. But Japan shows only the feeblest signs of recovering from a three-year slump.
 Lifetime jobs. Japan chalks up its low unemployment to the tradition of companies retaining employees in bad times. Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, said the jobless rate would be 5 to 6 percent if Japanese employers eliminated unneeded jobs the way Westerners do.
 Other ways to trim. Lifetime employment will not be abandoned outright. But companies are cutting staff by attrition, curtailing hiring and "asking" middle managers to retire. Wage growth, already low, is heading lower.

An untraditional retailer in Japan is on a roll and gains influence.

BYLINE: By James Sterngold 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
ISAO NAKAUCHI is by Japanese standards a frightening revolutionary he wants retailers to be retailers.
Those are fighting words in a country where, in stark contrast to the situation in most industrial countries, manufacturers and not retailers have controlled which products make it to market, how they are sold and how they are priced. Retailers have generally done as they are told. 
 Mr. Nakauchi has been on a decades-long mission to change that, and there are signs that his long struggle may be coming to fruition. He is the chairman and controlling shareholder of Daiei Inc., Japan's largest supermarket chain and retailer, and after a series of mergers the company has developed far more influence over its suppliers.
Helped by the removal of some regulations at the urging of the United States, Daiei has become a big catalyst of change in Japanese retailing.
"They are absolutely right on target in what they are doing," said Mike Allen, the retailing analyst here with Barclays de Zoette Wedd Securities. "Everything they've done for the past year is just what they need to do to bring pricing control into the hands of the retailer. Daiei is out in front."
Daiei (pronounced die-ay) is a big discounter aiming at the lower end of the market, where volumes are huge and margins are thin. Its products range from food to clothing. It even owns a professional baseball team. More recently it has added real estate to its stable of interests.
One problem, if it can be called that, is that Daiei's stock price has been on a tear. It has more than doubled in the last year, to 1,920 yen a share, or about $18.275, at the close on Friday, from 790 yen, or about $7.52, last March. Given the volatile swings of the market, that has been a remarkably robust performance.
But there is concern that the rise may have run its course. Mr. Allen, for instance, said he rated Daiei a "hold." He added that traditionally it had been one of the least efficient retailers, in spite of its aspirations.
He was quick to add: "We still think that in the long term it has the highest potential for appreciation in the retail sector. It is the only retailer that has consistently improved gross margins throughout the recession."
Kaori Hasegawa, the retailing analyst with Salomon Brothers Asia, also has some hesitations. She said almost a quarter of Daiei's assets were devoted to nonretailing businesses like real estate and condominium sales. These companies, she said, had not meshed well with the retailing businesses and had not produced impressive returns.
"I've been wrong on this stock before," she said. "But the rise has been so sharp it concerns me a lot. If their earnings don't meet expectations, there's a real risk of a big drop."
But she said Daiei had made great headway in taking control of its pricing. A good example is its three-decade feud with the country's largest consumer electronics company, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company.
Mr. Nakauchi battled Matsushita in the early 1960's, when he defied the manufacturer's orders and sought to sell its refrigerators, rice cookers, televisions and other products at discounts. Matsushita, which sells its products here under labels like National and Panasonic, simply cut off Daiei.
But recently Daiei took control of a smaller retail chain, the Chujitsuya Company, which carries Matsushita products. A decade ago, when Daiei made a similar acquisition, Matsushita stopped selling products to the retailer. This time it was big news when Matsushita agreed to keep selling its products to Chujitsuya. Daiei had gained the upper hand.
Daiei was a pioneer in selling products under a private label at cut-rate prices. It has recently forged close relationships with a number of manufacturers and big trading houses as it seeks to circumvent Japan's famously inefficient wholesaling system.
"Once they consolidate all these mergers, they will have even more purchasing power, and that's what they need to keep reducing their costs," Mr. Allen said. "When Daiei talks, the manufacturers finally listen."

In 'Marathon Dancing,' Only Anger Is the Victor

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
As the film "They Shoot Horses, Don't They" made thunderingly clear 25 years ago, it isn't too hard to find metaphors for the sickness of the American soul in the dance marathons of the Great Depression. A disparate group of desperate, impoverished losers dancing themselves into exhaustion for a monetary prize, a cynical master of ceremonies manipulating them into increasingly humiliating exhibitions and his repeated glib assurances that these plucky demonstrations of perseverance are what the country is all about: the elements seem made for bald American fables of illusion and exploitation.
Audiences who remember the 1969 Sydney Pollack movie may experience an acute sense of deja vu watching "Marathon Dancing," the director Anne Bogart's fiercely cynical, one-note treatment of the same subject. But though the essential themes of the works are similar, Ms. Bogart takes a far more detached, typically Brechtian view of the phenomenon. And while "Marathon Dancing" offers a host of elaborate visual and musical flourishes, it all seems designed to ballast, quite numbingly, a premise that is established very early on. 
 Whereas the movie was essentially character-driven, Ms. Bogart presents her cast as a marionettelike cavalcade of social archetypes, from an embittered chanteuse to an unemployed World War I veteran, who represent a weary spectrum of a society gone sour, resonant with suggestive parallels to America today. And, in keeping with the director's fascination with indigenous American music, the show is built around more than a dozen songs of the time that, in this particular context, take on sinister significance, emphasizing hopelessness and anomie, even when the lyrics percolate with optimism.
Produced by En Garde Arts, a company famous for its site-specific performances, "Marathon Dancing" has been appropriately staged amid the oppressive institutional opulence of the cavernous Masonic Ballroom on West 23d Street. In the course of its roughly 110 minutes, the work follows some 600 hours of the marathon. We are 721 hours into it when the show begins, and the dancers are already showing signs of fatigue, hostility and disenchantment.
Frankie Aragon, the unctuous M.C. (P. J. Benjamin), a satanic variation on Gig Young's character in "They Shoot Horses," struggles to keep audience interest up with hucksterish patter about the contest, "where dreams are made and broken." Worried about dwindling attendance, he strong-arms the contestants into degrading novelty stunts, including a forced wedding.
His roller-skating floor judge, Gus (Steven Goldstein) roves among the dancers, sadistically anticipating their collapses and pointing out to the audience that the marathon's real catharses are provided not by the final victory but by the failures along the way. "Who's gonna die on the floor?" he asks us. "That's what I'm here for. That's what you're here for."
Most of the characters, including a mute female clown who can only howl in grief, are provided with stale monologues that reveal the bleakness of the lives behind them. As written by Laura Harrington, they are familiar tales of the sorts that abounded in the literature of the period: the boxer who delivered a fatal punch to a friend in an exhibition match; the emaciated farmer whose family is starving in a shack; the aging vaudevillian who feels he has no future on the stage. "I used to have a place," he says. "I can't find it. I can't find anything anymore."
Because the speeches are so standard issue, and delivered with such conscious artificiality, we are seldom directly engaged by these characters, which deprives the work of any real emotional momentum. And the organizers' corrupt nature and the concomitant frustration and weariness of the contestants are made so apparent from the earliest scenes that "Marathon Dancing" fails to develop in any substantially surprising ways.
What we are left with, essentially, is a dark cabaret of songs and dances, some of which, though repetitive in their thematic nature, are indeed very effective. The choreography, by Alison Shafer, blends deliberately clumsy conventional ballroom steps with an imploding sense of anger. Ms. Bogart's robotic staging of the mock marathon wedding, with the reluctant bride swathed in cellophane, is a satirical high point. And Christopher Drobny's adaptations for the three-member band are seductively smooth.
In their singing, the largely talented cast covers a variety of period pastiches, from Kristen Flanders's harsh, Kurt Weillian interpretation of "The Boulevard of Broken Dreams" to Matthew Bennett's subversively manic version of "Never Swat a Fly," a whimsical song about not dividing lovers.
The acting, in a confounding diversity of styles, is less successful. But Ms. Flanders, as a Danish idealist, and Jennifer Wiltsie, as a naive newlywed, find a plaintiveness that transcends the dogmatic material. And Frank Raiter, as the old vaudevillian, has a heartbreaking mechanical smile that punctuates even his most fatalistic declarations and says everything about the show-biz tradition he's descended from.
These individual glimmers of warmth are incongruities in an evening that is clearly intended to keep us at a chilly, contemplative distance. Unfortunately, "Marathon Dancing" doesn't give us much that's new to contemplate.

HEADLINE: Fewer Are Late On Mortgages

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Americans had an easier time paying their mortgages in late 1993 than at any time in the last 20 years, a banking group says, as homeowners benefited from lower interest rates and the improving economy.
Mortgage delinquencies, or the failure to meet mortgage payments, fell in the last three months of 1993 to the lowest levels since the first quarter of 1973, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Friday. 
 It said the percentage of homeowners who were late in their payments fell 18 basis points, to 4.03 percent, from 4.21 percent in the third quarter. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The bankers group said the survey, which covers about a third of all mortgages on one-to-four-unit residential properties, showed the delinquency rate was down 21 basis points from late 1992.
The Northeast showed the biggest drop in the rate of troubled mortgages, down 35 points, to 4.02 percent.

HEADLINE: The Plot to Recapture Ukraine

 BODY:
Ukraine is an independent country, though many Russians are reluctant to recognize that fact. Hard-line remnants of Russia's military and K.G.B. are eager to recapture it. Their strategy is to stir up civil unrest, beginning in Crimea, which is part of Ukraine. By undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity, hard-liners hope to destroy the republic's independence.
That strategy could lead to civil war and could erode the power of Boris Yeltsin and his fellow reformers in Russia. Obviously, they cannot afford to play along. Obviously, too, Washington needs to help them. 
 Ukraine has a tenuous hold on Crimea. The Soviet Union ceded it from Russia in 1954. But a majority of its population is Russian; many residents are retirees from the Black Sea navy.
Events in Crimea look ominously like the divide-and-conquer strategy Russia's hard-liners followed in Moldova and Georgia, where Russian secessionists, with the complicity of renegades in the military and K.G.B., declared independence and called on Russia to protect them.
Last month, Crimea elected Yuri Meshkov President. Mr. Meshkov, an ethnic Russian and former K.G.B. border guard, won overwhelming support from fellow ethnic Russians in a campaign managed by a reputed covert operative from Moscow, after which he appointed a citizen of Russia Prime Minister. He will soon call for a referendum on Crimean independence and could then call on Russia's army to protect Crimea.
Meanwhile, the breakaway threat in Crimea has energized rabid Ukrainian nationalists, who fear a broader plot to split off eastern Ukraine, with its large Russian population. Most Russians in Ukraine voted for its independence in 1991 -- many in the belief that it would be more prosperous than Russia. Kiev's economic mismanagement is giving them second thoughts.
Some still think of themselves as Soviet citizens; others share regional rather than ethnic identities. But about a quarter have married ethnic Ukrainians and speak Ukrainian. And many Russians in Ukraine do think it a separate country.
That is not true in Russia, where few Russians, even reformers, have reconciled themselves to Ukrainian independence. That strengthens ultranationalists who desire to regain Ukraine, or at least the part where Russians predominate. But controlling Ukraine would require an army of occupation far larger than the one driven out of Afghanistan. Raising such an army would sap Russia's resources, and a functioning draft could not be restored without force.
This step could not be taken without wrecking reform and restoring the old order in Russia. That is exactly what the empire rebuilders want to do, and why Mr. Yeltsin and his reformers would be wrong to cooperate with them on Ukraine.
Washington may be able to help. It can try to mediate disputes. It can encourage the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to assure minority rights on both sides of the border. It can encourage Ukraine and Russia to undertake joint economic development in heavily Russified eastern Ukraine and nearby Russia. And it can channel U.S. aid for that purpose.
In short, the U.S. can try to get Ukrainians and Russians to concentrate on economic improvement, not ethnic identity, and give them every opportunity to better their common lot in life.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up the Trash Racket

 BODY:
Trash hauling is a big, competitive business almost everywhere. But in and around New York City, the trash business is just big. Racketeers and ancient family enterprises dominate the trade; consumers and commercial enterprises suffer. Instead of competing, haulers operate in market-allocating cartels while mob enforcers help keep the competition out, robbing the public of efficient, economical service.
This is a well-documented disgrace that deserves far more official attention that it has received. Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, now advocates changes aimed at introducing price competition into a strangled market. His suggestions deserve the careful attention of Mayor Giuliani, who is a fan of competitive enterprise and built his career fighting racketeers. 
 A recent Justice Department settlement in a Long Island racketeering suit offers a rare glimmer of hope and suggests a useful strategy against mob control of trash-hauling monopolies. It requires eight of the region's largest carters to start competing against one another and to hire auditors to police them from within and report their findings to the courts.
The settlement, to be supervised by a Federal court, is an interim product of five years of Justice Department litigation. The Government has sued more than 140 companies and people, moving against a half-century's accretion of inertia, graft and the occasional violence that inhibits customers from changing haulers.
The settlement mainly affects the interests of Salvatore Avellino Jr., a captain in the Lucchese crime family and the largest residential hauler in Suffolk County. He has pleaded guilty to ordering the murders of two haulers who bucked organized crime and were preparing to testify against gangster companies.
A similar mix of fresh competition, internal policing and outside supervision could help free the city's commercial enterprises -- restaurants, hospitals and thousands of businesses -- from costly bondage to the cartel. One healthy sign is the recent arrival of Browning-Ferris Industries, the nation's second-largest hauler of solid waste, to bid on commercial waste contracts. The company, which says that it is here to stay, has won some business and claims that its bids have dramatically lowered the costs of contracts it did not win.
Mr. Green has introduced legislation in the City Council calling for experimental collection districts where a single low bidder would replace dozens of small haulers who now decline to compete within their protected fiefs.
Mr. Giuliani needs to come up with his own proposals to make trash hauling more honest, perhaps through auditing procedures, and more competitive. He might consider a program to encourage reputable firms to bid or the redrawing of collection areas, as Mr. Green suggests. Without proposals from the Mayor, City Council leaders should move ahead with hearings on the best way to free trash collection from gougers and racketeers.

'More Of Itself'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
When Lyndon Johnson was struggling in the quagmire of Vietnam, he took comfort from his favorite ally in the war: Australia. Australian troops were there from 1966 to 1972, almost to the final American withdrawal.
Next month the Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating, will fly to Hanoi. His visit is a symbol of the most important trend in this country. Australia is intent on finding a place for itself in Asia. And part of that is a greater willingness to differ with the United States. 
 American Secretaries of State used to visit Canberra and bask in the warmth of agreement and respect. But that was not what Warren Christopher encountered when he was there the other day, on his way to China.
The Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, told him bluntly that Australia disagreed with President Clinton's invocation of the threat of trade sanctions against Japan. That was managed trade, he said, not multilateral free trade. If it had any effect, it would simply lead to a preference for American goods in Japan -- and hurt Australia and others.
The Government and Australian commentators were equally critical of the Clinton Administration's pressure on China to improve its human rights record by June or lose its most-favored-nation trade status.
Senator Evans told the press after two days of meetings with Secretary Christopher that a U.S. withdrawal of China's M.F.N. status would have "a very adverse impact" on the economy of all Asia. He said it would be especially devastating for Hong Kong but would also hurt Australia.
The sharp disagreement on trade policy -- and on what Australia sees as rough American tactics -- illustrates the change in relationship with the United States. It is a change both political and psychological.
When the British colonies on this island continent came together as Australia in 1901, the new country remained resolutely British -- with a colonial inferiority complex. The Australian writer Thomas Keneally (author of among other books "Schindler's Ark," on which the movie "Schindler's List" is based) remarked recently that Australian culture and society had to recover "from a sense of exile."
After World War II the ties with Britain frayed, no doubt inevitably because of distance and the end of empire. America replaced Britain as the powerful friend, a relationship formalized in the Anzus Treaty.
Australia's eager support of American policy in Vietnam showed the closeness of the relationship -- and probably marked its high point. For Australia like most developed countries has come to see the great issues and potential conflicts in the world as economic rather than military. And Australia's neighbors in Asia are the fastest growing in the world economy.
Until as recently as 25 years ago Australia was formally committed to not being Asian. That was the import of its White Australia policy, barring Asian immigrants. Since the repeal of that law, a flow of Asians has gradually developed. They now make up 4 percent of the population. A Sydney taxi driver said he came here from Canton seven years ago "to do better."
Echoes of America remain. A visiting American has a certain feeling of deja vu: of familiar issues and trends.
Australia's old reputation was as one of the most macho cultures on earth. But the country has a strong women's movement now, and two women are even moving toward the top in politics. There is a sensitivity about gender in language, sometimes to the same absurd degree as in American political correctness. A woman applicant for a university position was criticized recently for referring to someone's "mastery" of a subject.
Sydney has had a gay and lesbian mardi gras for years. Last week's attracted 500,000 onlookers, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation did an hour's program on the parade. A few politicians complained about the broadcast but most people seemed happy about the event.
Maybe in that respect Australia is more comfortable with diversity than an angry American society is today. In any case there is a distinctiveness about this country now. It is not really a copy of anything. "Australia," Thomas Keneally said, "has become more of itself."

HEADLINE: Why Do We Still Play This Dirty Spy Game?;
Terrorism Studies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Terrorism studies, a think-tank mainstay of the 1970's and 80's, are among the industries that have declined with the end of the cold war. For more than two decades, this was an academic growth industry, sucking huge sums from Federal agencies into such enterprises as the Rand Corporation, George Washington University and the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis -- represented by Mark D. W. Edington in "Terror Made Easy" (Op-Ed, March 3). 
 Unfortunately, these studies taught us very little, or we were allowed to learn very little from them. The money filtered into them was from agencies whose own operations were usually sub rosa, so the resulting work was usually not publicly available. Such arrangements seriously compromise academic standards, like the free exchange of ideas and open access to data generated by public funds. Now the students of terrorism are suffering from cutbacks.
One thing we did learn during the period of terrorism studies was that these benefactors, the intelligence agencies, were unreliable in their main business: knowing what was going to happen, or probably going to happen, in key places. The collective wisdom of more than $1 trillion spent on intelligence gathering and analysis did not foresee or properly analyze the consequences of any significant event from the Tet offensive to the collapse of the Soviet Union -- let alone the hijacking of an airplane or the taking of hostages here and there.
Now the declining terrorism-studies industry warns us we face new dangers and must beef up our vigilance (and, by implication, our terrorism research budgets). They play off the domestic headlines and call for beefing up what we are just debeefing, and stricter controls on immigration and personal rights.
The facts do get in the way. The incidents Mr. Edington mentions (the World Trade Center bombing, the arrest of suspected Hamas supporters and the Brooklyn Bridge shooting) were solved with conventional policing powers and are being adjudicated through normal legal processes. We have enough knowledge and legal power to handle these things, and we should not be frightened or seduced into going back down the path of expensive and fruitless studies into what cannot be foreseen.
And we should be especially wary of anyone who wants more domestic controls over our movements and rights.

HEADLINE: Clinton Partner Denies One Allegation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
As Democrats and Republicans continued bickering on television this morning over whether Congressional hearings should be held on the Whitewater case, Bill and Hillary Clinton's business partner in the Arkansas land venture that gave the case its name said that one main instance of supposed wrongdoing never occurred.
The former partner, James B. McDougal said on the ABC News program "This Week" that "in no way, shape, form or fashion" did any money from a savings and loan he headed go "into a Clinton campaign." 
 Mr. McDougal held a fund-raising event in 1985 to help Mr. Clinton pay off a $50,000 loan that had helped finance his 1984 campaign for re-election as Governor of Arkansas. One matter under investigation by the independent counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., is whether any money raised by Mr. McDougal came from the savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. The savings association ultimately collapsed at a cost to the Federal Government of more than $60 million.
 
Mistake by Aides
 Mr. McDougal, his head shaven, sat stiffly before the camera in a high-backed leather chair in his office in Arkansas and complained that the Clintons were refusing to give him corporate records of the Whitewater Development Company that he needed to complete his income taxes.
A White House spokeswoman responded this afternoon that all the records had been turned over to the independent counsel. She said she did not know if the Clintons had kept copies.
Mr. McDougal said he did not believe that the Clintons had committed any crime, but he suggested that material in the records might somehow embarrass them.
The new White House counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, appeared on all three network interview programs this morning and said that White House aides had made a mistake by discussing the Madison investigation in meetings with officials from the Treasury Department and the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency managing the savings and loan bailout.
But on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Cutler said the mistake was "more the appearance of those meetings than anything else."
Between the lines of Mr. Cutler's remarks, one aspect of the White House strategy began to take shape. The White House seems to hope that Mr. Fiske will deal first with the meetings between Treasury Department and White House staff members on Madison Guaranty, as he has said he might, and publish an interim report exonerating Administration officials of wrongdoing on that angle of the case.
Then, they may hope to argue that since nothing wrong has been done since Mr. Clinton became President, Congressional hearings are unnecessary.
Having been named to his position only on Monday, Mr. Cutler said he had not had time to review many relevant documents.
But, he declared: "From everything I have heard, it seems to be clear that no effort was made by any White House people to indicate to the Treasury people what they ought to do, and, indeed, the Treasury and the R.T.C. did not change their position."
Mr. Cutler and the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, argued that Congressional hearings should not take place until Mr. Fiske had completed his inquiry.
But Senators Bob Dole of Kansas, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and William S. Cohen of Maine and Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, all Republicans, maintained that public hearings were necessary to clear the air.
Mr. Cutler insisted that his job was to advise the President in his public duties and that Whitewater matters would be handled by the Clintons' personal lawyer, David Kendall.
 
Possibility of Back Taxes
 Mr. Kendall said in an interview published this week in U.S. News & World Report that the Whitewater investigation might end up showing that the Clintons would have to pay some back taxes.
Mrs. Clinton, in interviews with Time and Newsweek to be published on Monday, said she and the President would pay whatever additional taxes they owed.
In the interviews Mrs. Clinton took an approach often favored by politicians, admitting that mistakes had been made but rarely saying precisely what they were. For example, in the Newsweek interview, she said: "Clearly there were lots of missteps along the way. I'd be the first to say that, and obviously I wish there weren't because this thing has gotten blown so out of proportion.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 15, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Whitewater case misstated the source of a report that David Kendall, Bill and Hillary Clinton's lawyer, believed the Clintons might owe some back taxes on their real estate investment in the Ozarks of Arkansas. The report, published this week in U.S. News & World Report, was attributed by the magazine to unidentified "insiders," not to Mr. Kendall.

HEADLINE: Failure to Replace Trustees Weakens CUNY, Critics Say

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The mayor and the governor have not appointed any new trustees of City University for years. The board held only eight regular meetings last year, and just one of the five borough hearings it is supposed to hold every year. And at committee meetings, where most of the work is conducted, there are often only two trustees at the big table.
A majority of members of the City University Board of Trustees are holdovers whose terms of office expired as long ago as 1988, an unprecedented situation that educators and local officials say has weakened the leadership of the nation's largest urban university. 
 Herman Badillo, a governor's appointee whose term expired last June, said the university is at a critical time, undergoing sweeping academic consolidation, budget cuts and a changing student population. A vigorous board, he said, is needed: "The problem now is there is less regard for the City University. The loss of support from the public and from the politicians for CUNY requires a board that is much more active."
Today, according to State Senator Guy J. Velella, Republican of the Bronx, who is a critic of Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, "Nobody on the board seems to be paying attention."
 
Highly Unusual
 Many state-appointed boards have some holdovers, but it is highly unusual for a majority of members to be serving expired terms, educators and local officials said. "A few expired terms is fairly common," said Tom Ingram, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, a nonprofit service organization. "In this case, it sounds like the City University has an unfortunately and inordinately large number of expired terms."
Nonetheless, the State Attorney General's office said, these trustees have full voting powers.
Of the 15 members, 8 are serving expired terms and 2 vacancies have not been filled, leaving only 5 serving out their seven-year terms. The board also includes a faculty representative, who has no voting rights, and a student representative. The mayor has five appointees, with four now serving expired terms, and the governor 10, including the chairman and the vice chairman. Six gubernatorial appointees, including the chairman, are holdovers. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said he plans to fill all four vacancies in the next few weeks.
 
Setting the Academic Tone
 The trustees, who serve without pay, set policy for the 200,0000-student system. By hiring the chancellor, who runs the university on a day-to-day basis, and overseeing appointment of the system's 18 presidents and three deans, they also set the academic tone for the institution.
The board's current state stands in sharp contrast to its early years as a high-profile and aggressive body. For instance, in 1976, when the state imposed tuition during the city's fiscal crisis, most of the board quit in protest. In 1979 the board split over the selection of the Hunter College president. One faction wanted Donna E. Shalala, now Secretary of Health and Human Services, but the board chairman, Harold Jacobs, wanted another candidate. So the Shalala faction waited until Mr. Jacobs was out of town and approved Dr. Shalala.
But last year attendance at meetings ranged from as few as 7 trustees to as many as 12 -- not counting the student and the faculty representative -- and the board met eight times, one less than the year before.
The chairman of the board, James P. Murphy, said he disagreed that this board was passive compared with past boards. Mr. Murphy served on the board from 1974 to 1976. He was reappointed in 1986, and his term expired in 1992."There's not a shy one in the bunch," he said.
 
No Appointments by Dinkins
 During his term Mayor David N. Dinkins made no appointments, even though four of his five spots opened. Of the governor's 10 appointees, 5 are serving expired terms, including Sylvia Bloom, whose term officially ended in 1988. In addition there is one vacancy, and trustee Stanley Fink will complete his term in June.
Legislators and other critics blame Mr. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for the inattention to the board. "It is my opinion that the people responsible for appointments should make them in a timely manner," said Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, chairman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee.
But spokesmen for Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo, both Democrats, blame the majority Republicans in the State Senate for playing politics with the nominations they forward to them.
"It wasn't lack of care," said Lee Blake, who was executive director of the Office of Education Services under Mr. Dinkins. "The appointment process is so complicated. Fighting battles in Albany just took up so much energy."
Senator Velella conceded that the Senate held up two nominations -- one by the Governor, one by Mayor Dinkins -- over dissatisfaction with Dr. Reynolds's direction on two lawsuits against CUNY. The first, by an Italian-American coalition, successfully sought hiring and educational remedies; the other, by Prof. Leonard Jeffries, successfully sought his reinstatement as chairman of the black studies department at City College. The university is appealing both cases.
"I worry that politics have reared their ugly head in the case of CUNY," said Mr. Ingram, of the national association of governing boards. "It suggests the possibility that political leaders may not understand the function of the board of trustees and the world of universities as distinct to the world of politics."
Mayor Giuliani has announced that he is nominating Jerome Berg, a partner in a consulting and developing firm who is involved in community activities on Staten Island, to replace Louis Cenci, whose term expired in 1989. Mr. Giuliani is also said to be considering Ron Jones of Brooklyn, a vice president of the United Federation of Teachers; Lorraine R. Colville of Manhattan, a former faculty member at John Jay College who during the Reagan Administration was the New York regional representative of the United States Education Department, and John W. Peterkin of Queens, a former police officer and security director of New York City Technical College.
 
'As Quickly as We Can'
 The Governor's education assistant, Neil J. Foley, said the Governor was working on his nominees but he could not say when they would be announced.
"The issue with respect to naming people and resubmitting people's names is one of the many, many items that we deal with here and we will deal with it as quickly as we can," Mr. Foley said.
But the sentiment persists among many educators, at CUNY and at other colleges in the state, that Governor Cuomo is less interested in public education than his predecessors beginning with Nelson A. Rockefeller, who created both the State University and City University system.
"Half of the members have terms that have expired," said Kenneth P. Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College. "While some of that reflects the Republicans and the Senate holding things up, it also reflects the low priority they, the governor and the mayor, have given to CUNY, and it reflects the low caliber of the appointments."
 
A Prestigious Assignment
 Before the late 1970's, the board -- then called the Board of Higher Education -- was made up of 21 mayoral appointees, and because it was considered a prestigious assignment it attracted pre-eminent figures in the city's civic, academic and diplomatic circles. Previous boards included such people as Harry Carman, a senior dean of engineering at Columbia University, Ordway Tead, a publisher, Federal Judge Simon Rifkin and Emanuel Peori, the head of scientific research for I.B.M.
In 1976, the city's fiscal crisis caused CUNY to run out of money and close its doors for two weeks. The state rescued it, but CUNY was forced to impose tuition for the first time in its 129-year history. Fiscal control was transferred largely to the state, and by 1979 the governor had 10 of the 15 appointments. The Legislature required that each borough be represented on the board.
Since then, many of the appointees have had political ties to the mayor or governor, or to borough presidents, but there are almost no educators.
"The big problem is that there is no one on the board who is competent to judge some academic issues, who is an academic, who is by profession in the university world," Professor Sherrill said. "What this means is that not only does the central administration have an absolute monopoly over the flow of information, but also a monopoly on the interpretation of the information."
But Mr. Murphy, the chairman of the board, said that while today's trustees have different credentials, they are just as capable of making decisions on the academic direction of the university.
"They represent all social and economic needs of the city," he said. "They are not specialists, and we are not meant to be specialists in academic matters."

HEADLINE: Kohl, Battered in Opinion Polls, Remains Buoyant

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, March 14

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has stood astride Europe for more than 11 years, but if current public opinion polls are accurate forecasts of the Oct. 16 national elections, his domination might be at an end.
If he should topple, it would send shock waves around the Continent and across the Atlantic, since for many of his fellow leaders he has become the very symbol of Germany, and all of his potential successors are little-known abroad. 
 But at 63, Mr. Kohl looks and sounds supremely self-confident. Looking out at the pink cherry blossoms and the daffodils on the Rhine outside his modern third-floor office here on a sparkling spring afternoon, he just smiled and said: "Ever since I can remember, people have been predicting my imminent political demise. Once it made me angry; later it amused me; now I simply ignore it.
"I know just as sure as I look out the window and see spring that the mood has changed. I'm going to win."
Mr. Kohl has had the last laugh on his opponents often enough to indulge in such idiosyncrasies as not giving interviews to newspapers and magazines he does not like, which means a good many of them. He does not even read Der Spiegel, the country's leading news magazine, which proclaimed "The End of the Kohl Era" on its cover in December.
Mr. Kohl has been there before. He seemed headed for electoral defeat in the last national elections in 1990, but was saved by the sudden collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the unexpected opportunity it offered for German unification. He seized the opportunity with consummate determination and diplomatic skill, and with firm backing from the Bush Administration.
 
Stressing Close Ties With United States
 Today he has the best personal relationship of any European leader with the Clinton Administration. "I am a proven friend of the United States," he said. "My relationship with America is emotional and deep-seated. And I have had extraordinary luck with all recent U.S. Presidents, including a great relationship now with Bill Clinton."
He visited the President in Washington briefly early this year, strengthening his own image in German voters' eyes as America's most trusted ally. He playfully endured Mr. Clinton's ribbing about his size. At one point during the NATO summit in January, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Kohl that he had dreamed that the German leader was a sumo wrestler, a bit of an exaggeration for the Chancellor, Kohl, who may be big, at six feet four and 300 pounds, but not that big.
But with Germany's unemployment rate over 10 percent, with more than four million jobless -- the highest level since the start of the post-World War II economic recovery -- and with Government finances in such a bad state that his opponents have been drawing comparisons to the Weimar Republic, the domestic economy will probably determine his fate.
Here, too, he is all optimism. "The deep recession that we're just coming out of has laid bare economic problems that have been with us for 30 years, so I'm in the unusual position of telling people at campaign rallies that we have to change our ways of doing things," he said.
His opponents do not underrate him. "He is an unbelievably good political fighter -- the best there is when the chips are down," said Dr. Friedbert Pfluger, a member of Parliament and one of his most outspoken critics within his own Christian Democratic ranks.
Nevertheless, a string of 18 state and local elections began with a defeat for Mr. Kohl's party on Sunday in Lower Saxony, despite his own heavy campaign schedule there. "A bitter loss," he conceded today.
 
Mix of Domesticity And United Europe
 Since he first appeared on the national scene in the mid-1970's as premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, his political genius has always been a shrewd mixture of provincial domesticity that puts his countrymen at ease and a deeply felt dedication to European unity that has often reassured Germany's neighbors.
Even his opponents do not question his commitment to Europe, but when domestic and foreign interests clash, Mr. Kohl goes for the votes at home every time.
In 1985, for example, he insisted that President Ronald Reagan visit a German military cemetery in Bitburg, despite a controversy that raged after it turned out that some members of the Nazi Waffen SS military units had been buried there.
Mr. Kohl prevailed on Mr. Reagan to come anyway as a gesture of postwar reconciliation. Some intellectuals and commentators called him ignorant or worse for forcing the issue, but many ordinary Germans thought him patriotic and courageous.
"In Germany, two-thirds of the population was born after Hitler," he said in his office recently. "I see the role of my generation, which is old enough to understand what happened under National Socialism but too young to be blamed for it, as explaining to the younger ones how it was, bearing witness to the good things their parents' generation did as well as the bad -- not denying the past at all."
 
Stand on Borders Worried Neighbors
 At times his strategy has been difficult for foreigners to fathom. While he pressed for German unification, Mr. Kohl resisted several months of international pressure to reassure Poland that a reunified Germany would make no claims on the territory beyond its eastern border that had belonged to it before the war.
He finally did so in March of 1990, after bringing around supporters who had been expelled from those territories to the view that kissing the lost lands goodbye was the price of unity.
He wanted their votes in the national election, and nine months later his party won.
Mr. Kohl has also shaped his foreign policy around German public opinion. It was reticent in the war in the Persian Gulf, where Germany stayed out of the fighting on the grounds that the 1949 constitution allowed only defense of German territory.
But his policy became more assertive as Yugoslavia began to break up. The German Foreign Minister at the time, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, insisted on recognizing Croatia and Slovenia even though some of his European Community partners feared that recognition could set off fierce fighting in neighboring Bosnia. Mr. Kohl, mindful of strong German support for Croatia, went along with Mr. Genscher.
But with the public horrified by two years of bloody fighting in Bosnia and with Germany overwhelmed by refugees, Mr. Kohl has backed peace efforts by his allies.
 
Playing the Card Of World Expertise
 A grave international crisis before next October would probably help Mr. Kohl to use his international experience against his Social Democratic challenger, Rudolf Scharping, one of his successors as Premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Mr. Scharping, anxious to bolster his own standing abroad, will travel to the United States next month and will be received by President Clinton on April 12, American diplomats said.
But domestic economic problems have cost the Chancellor the considerable support he had in the eastern part of Germany in the last election. And in the west, people like former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt have asked why Mr. Kohl did not make a "blood, sweat and tears" speech in 1990 to warn them that unification would take sacrifice and time.
"I've been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn't been?" he answered. "I didn't know in the spring of 1991 that the Soviet Union was about to collapse, but no one else did either."
If the next election were held now, all the recent public opinion polls indicate, the Christian Democrats would win only 32 to 35 percent of the vote, compared with 37 to 41 percent for the Social Democrats.
 
High Wages Blamed For Recession
 With little prospect of economic recovery in sight, Mr. Kohl began telling voters last fall that the problem was not the $100-billion-a-year cost of unifying the country, but wage and welfare benefits that had swollen to such generous levels that German products were unable to compete on world markets.
"Helmut Schmidt had a lot to do with the fact that wages rose throughout the 1970's without much relation to costs," Mr. Kohl said.
But Mr. Kohl did not ask for sacrifice four years ago because people were not ready then, one of his advisers said. "They are ready now," the adviser added.
Mr. Kohl says that the severe recession scared his compatriots out of complacency. "When I talk to them at rallies, they don't drown me out with jeers, they listen to me and applaud afterward," he said. "The Germans will make an economic comeback -- don't you worry about that."
In fact, Mr. Kohl has seldom led public opinion, and instead tends to follow its dictates. When neo-Nazi groups began attacking the foreign asylum-seekers who were pouring into the country in 1992, for instance, the Chancellor resisted invitations to visit Rostock, the site of one of the worst attacks.
"Political tourism," his spokesman, Dieter Vogel, called such demonstrations of sympathy.
"I am a firm opponent of all radicals, left or right -- they are a shame on our country," Mr. Kohl said.
But he did not believe in the power of words to stop the attacks when the Constitution seemed to lay the country open to an unlimited influx of people in search of a better life.
Germans were "overwhelmed," he said. Last summer, the Government and the opposition agreed to change the Constitution to make it more difficult to obtain asylum, and the number of attacks has diminished.
"He underestimated the effect the right-wing attacks had on public opinion abroad," one of his closest aides said. "But he thought that if he joined the public protests it would only make neo-Nazism seem more serious than it really was and strengthen the right-wing splinter parties."
 
Stress on Austerity To Revive Economy
 Both candidates agree that German industry needs to become more competitive, but Mr. Kohl puts more emphasis on belt-tightening. "We cannot secure our country's future by running it like a collective leisure park," he told Parliament last fall. "We must create the necessary conditions for a fundamental turnaround in all branches of our economy."
Under prodding from the central bank and international organizations, he is also trying to turn around government finances, which relied heavily on deficit spending even before the burden of unification.
According to the central bank, total federal Government debt rose from 232.3 billion marks ($134.3 billion) in 1980 to 678.3 billion marks ($392.1 billion) by last November. To slow down the rate of increase, the government cut $12.4 billion from the federal budget last year, but the federal budget deficit was still $17.3 billion greater in 1993 than the year before.
Mr. Kohl has his eye on grander visions, though. "When I go home I visit Mainz, Worms, Speyer -- all cities that have been repeatedly fought over and destroyed in wars," he said. "We're not going to build Europe in a day, but at the end of this century, I expect to live to see the realization of Adenauer's vision of German unification and European unity as two sides of the same coin."

HEADLINE: Europeans Chase the Sun to Brazil's Northeast

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RECIFE, Brazil

 BODY:
Fleeing cold weather and seeking sunshine, Europeans are flocking to the white crystal beaches of Brazil's Northeast, making the region the fastest-growing center for international tourism in South America.
More and more Italians, French, Germans and Spaniards have begun to vacation along the 2,000-mile coast of Brazil's northeastern shoulder, where this continent reaches out toward Europe. 
 International tourist arrivals are expected to reach one million this year, a tenfold increase in just four years. There are weekly flights from most European capitals to Recife and Salvador, the largest cities in this region, yet cities that are essentially unknown to most in the United States.
 
Cheap, Yet Relatively Unknown
 Although a vacation in the Northeast can cost half as much as a holiday in the Caribbean, travelers from the United States are watching the boom from the sidelines. Americans may offer the largest natural market, but no United States airline flies to the Brazilian Northeast. New United States investment is limited so far to half a dozen McDonald's restaurants and two hotels here, a Sheraton and a Best Western. Yet Recife is as close to Miami as to Lisbon.
By contrast, Spanish and Italian investors are contributing heavily to $1 billion of hotel and resort construction under way on the coast. A further $1.3 billion is being invested by the states of the region, with backing from the Inter-American Development Bank, to upgrade roads and sewers to international tourism standards.
"The Caribbean is saturated," said Celso Sterenberg, tourism secretary for Pernambuco state. "The next big tourist development is going to be Brazil's Northeast."
By the end of the decade, Brazilian economists forecast, tourism will be the largest industry in the Northeast, long Brazil's poorest region. The World Travel and Tourism Council, an industry association, predicted in a study last year that "Brazil's tourism industry would grow 2.8 times as fast as Latin American travel and tourism, and more than 160 percent faster than the world average."
But Varig operates only one flight a week from Miami to Fortaleza and Recife. Next month, another big Brazilian carrier, VASP, will inaugurate direct service between Recife and Miami. To win more United States passengers, Varig recently signed a ticketing, baggage and mileage-program partnership with Delta Air Lines.
Isn't there room for more? Only with great care, says Adam G. Carter, director of Brazil Nuts Tours of Fairfield, Conn. An airline route from Miami to Recife "is not going to make it," Mr. Carter said.
"For the mass American market, it has to be New York-Recife, Chicago-Recife."
American tourism to Brazil dropped sharply in the late 1980's after the authorities failed to check street crime against tourists in Rio de Janeiro, the nation's largest port of entry. "The importance of what is happening now in the Northeast is that it will eventually fuel the return of American tourists to Brazil," Mr. Carter said in a telephone interview from the state of Rio do Norte.
A major appeal is Brazil's cost of living, which is inexpensive compared with that in the United States and most of Europe.
"Here you can have a rum drink for 50 cents and a plate of shrimp for $8," said Carlos A. Sodre, executive director of the Northeast Integrated Tourism Commission. "The average foreigner spends $71 a day in Brazil's Northeast. In the Caribbean, he spends $120 to 150 a day."
On Saturday, 53 American tour operators are to come to Recife as part of a group of 500 attending the Brazil National Tourist Mart, a four-day event that has become the largest such trade fair in South America.
"Once we get more American travel agents down here, we will start getting more American tourists," said Mark Birchall, sales director of the Sheraton Petribu Hotel. He estimated that fewer than 2 percent of his guests are now Americans.
The 16-floor Sheraton opened two years ago on a quiet beach here, part of a cautious entry of American hotel chains into the region.
In the last year, Best Western opened a hotel in Recife, and Ramada signed a contract to administer a hotel in the city of Natal. Hyatt is studying a site in Salvador, where the state government has invested $15 million in renovating the colonial urban core.
 
Hotel Space Is Precious
 As the region comes to the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer, hotel managers report that hotel occupancies for January and February reached as high as 90 percent. These occupancy rates are spurring hotel construction up and down the coast.
"In two to three years, Recife will have nine five-star hotels, the same number as Sao Paulo," Mr. Sterenberg predicted, referring to the nation's biggest city. At Recife airport, the Brazilian Government has authorized the region's first duty-free shop.
Americans working here say they see a new, pro-business attitude in northeastern Brazil, a region traditionally dominated by narrow-minded ruling families.
"To get our supply networks going, the state governors flew us around in their helicopters," said Peter Rodenbeck, who manages half the 124 McDonald's restaurants in Brazil. He has opened six McDonald's in northeastern cities over the last 18 months. "Our sales growth in the Northeast was spectacular last year," said Mr. Rodenbeck, who wants to open restaurants in five more regional cities.
 
Too Big for Single Campaign
 With the nine states of the Northeast vying to become a South American Costa Brava, untouched stretches of beach are being promoted with appealing labels: Bahia's "Green Line," Pernambuco's "Golden Coast" and Rio Grande do Norte's "Route of the Sun."
Northeastern states plan to spend $16 million on promotion this year -- five times what the national agency, Embratur, spends to promote the entire country.
"We are a continent-sized country," remarked Mr. Sodre, the Northeast Tourism Commission director. "There is no return in selling Brazil; you have to sell it by region."
Believing that employment from tourism can help lift the region out of poverty, the Inter-American Development Bank is lending $200 million in the start of a decade-long program to finance tourism development in the Northeast.
"If you don't have good sanitation and roads, you might lose the nascent tourism you already have," said David B. Atkinson, the bank's representative for Brazil. "Our objective is to develop infrastructure in tourist areas near population areas. We are not looking at creating enclaves like Cancun."
The bank is lending $750 million to improve roads and sewage around the three largest tourism destinations -- Fortaleza, Recife and Salvador. Fortaleza has a cholera problem, and the bank's loans will help expand sewerage to 80 percent of the city, from 15 percent. And the northeastern states are investing to promote other projects.
State tourism authorities have set a goal of tripling tourist spending in Bahia, to $1.4 billion, by the end of the decade. Links are being added almost monthly: Salvador's international flights have increased to 43 a day, from six a week in 1991.
Forty miles south of Recife airport, Pernambuco state is promoting an ambitious, Cancun-style development called the Costa Dourada, or Golden Coast.

HEADLINE: Saving Lawmaker on Labor Hit List

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, March 14

 BODY:
It was surprising enough for Vice President Al Gore to break an unspoken White House tradition by taking sides in a bitter primary fight between two party members. But even more surprising was his decision to do so on behalf of a lawmaker who often behaves more like a Republican than a Democrat.
The candidate, Representative David Mann, voted against President Clinton's stimulus package and his budget proposal. He does not much care for the President's remedy for health care. And he thinks Congress should step in and get to the bottom of the Whitewater matter. 
 But Mr. Clinton had promised to help Mr. Mann in exchange for a single vote: the freshman Congressman's decision to support the North American Free Trade Agreement. That vote infuriated Mr. Mann's longtime friends in labor here and in Washington, who helped elect him in 1992.
This year he is their biggest, and so far most vulnerable, target.
 
Alone With Opposition
 "There's a sense of betrayal here," said Richard Walsh, the national political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We're not afraid to punish our enemies."
For all the bullying from labor organizations last year about knocking off the 102 House Democrats who voted for the trade accord, Mr. Mann is the only lawmaker at this point with serious primary opposition.
And even here the opponent was not recruited by labor, but was a popular candidate who had been waiting on the sidelines: State Senator William F. Bowen, who lost to Mr. Mann by only 416 votes in an eight-candidate primary two years ago. Mr. Bowen is a liberal who is counting on all-out support from labor and from black ministers who are influential here to give him an edge this time.
The May 3 primary in Ohio's First Congressional District, which includes most of Cincinnati as well as suburbs on the Indiana border, is shaping up as a case study of what might have been had the threats from labor materialized elsewhere around the country.
 
Party Is Troubled
 Mr. Clinton, who last year commended Mr. Mann for "a very courageous vote," has put the prestige of the White House on the line to defend him. Labor groups, meanwhile, are out to prove that they have not lost all their influence by making an example of Mr. Mann for daring to defy them. As union memberships dwindle, that may be difficult, especially because this district has never had the big industrial union presence of cities like Cleveland and Akron.
The race has troubled Democratic Party officials, who do not like to see two prominent local Democrats attacking each other and leaving an opening for a Republican to win in November. After all, this is far from a liberal district; Mr. Clinton and George Bush each won 43 percent of the vote in 1992. Usually, national political officials steer clear of local primary fights to avoid ending up with a Republican or an embittered Democrat in office.
"Family squabbles are always difficult," said Donald R. Sweitzer, the political director of the Democratic National Committee who has close ties to labor in this state.
Mr. Walsh of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said Mr. Mann's trade vote was "the last nail in the coffin" because unions were also distressed by his other positions, like his opposition to the Clinton budget and to extending unemployment benefits.
 
'Public and Private Pledges'
 Clarence Frost, the regional director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said his group would mobilize its 27,000 members in the district and bring in help from around the country to run telephone banks, send out mailings and aid in other efforts. "We're going to do everything we can, that's legal, for Senator Bowen," he said.
Vice President Gore insisted that he had no qualms about being the headliner for two fund-raising receptions here on Sunday, which the Mann campaign said raised more than $100,000. "It's not touchy for me at all," he said in an interview. "Both the President and I made public and private pledges to defend those who cast a vote of conscience and were attacked for it. I'm going to honor the pledge."
But in his introduction of the Vice President, Mr. Mann was still keeping his distance. "My vote is not owned by the President," he declared. "My vote is not owned by the Vice President. My vote is not owned by any member of the labor community or any member of the business community. My vote is owned by myself."
When it was his turn at the microphone, Mr. Gore stopped short of endorsing Mr. Mann, or even putting his arm around his shoulder. He was as effusive as he could be in speaking about someone who often bucks the White House. "I can tell you from personal experience and with some regret that David does not vote the way we want him to every time a vote comes up," Mr. Gore said as the crowd burst into applause. "But the American people want a member of Congress to exercise independent judgment."
The Vice President seemed stumped, however, as he searched for common ground on issues other than the trade accord. He ended up devoting several minutes to thanking Mr. Mann for supporting the Brady bill, which imposes a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. But with the overwhelming backing of House Democrats, that vote was hardly a close call.
Besides Mr. Gore's rescue attempt, Mr. Mann is reaping other rewards for voting for the trade agreement. Before the $125-a-person public event, four local business leaders held a smaller $1,000-a-person reception with the Vice President. In an invitation, the organizers -- the heads of Procter & Gamble, PNC Bank Ohio, the Kroger Company, and Federated Department Stores -- noted that Mr. Mann "stood with us" in voting for the accord. Mr. Mann said that would help offset the $150,000 in labor contributions he expected to lose to Mr. Bowen, a state senator for more than two decades.
Mr. Bowen contends that the corporate support for Mr. Mann demonstrates that the incumbent, a former Mayor of Cincinnati, has turned on working Democrats. :
"I've known David a long time," said Mr. Bowen, 65, explaining why he decided to run. "I supported him. But people who have supported him are shocked and appalled. It's despicable what he has done." The trade vote was but one of his concerns, said Mr. Bowen. sporting a button on his lapel that said, "I'm proud to be union." He added: "The economic stimulus would have meant substantial money for the city of Cincinnati. Then there was his vote against the extension of unemployment compensation. The budget reconciliation bill. His voting record is not representing the district."
Mr. Mann, who is 54, said he had no apologies for favoring the trade accord or any of his stands. He responds to the attacks by declaring himself to be independent-minded. Five times in his announcement speech, Mr. Mann noted that he had acted under "the instructions" of his constituents and no one else.
"All I had to do was vote 'no' on Nafta and none of this would have happened to me," he said in an interview. "My pollster, my consultant, my wife -- every political consultant I have -- told me to vote 'no.' But I'm very proud of my Nafta vote, and I haven't lost a minute's sleep on it. If there's a district in the country that could benefit from Nafta, it's the First District of Ohio."

HEADLINE: SMALL LATIN LANDS FEELING SLIGHTED

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Several Central American and Caribbean countries are angrily accusing the Clinton Administration of favoring the big over the small because it is backing the Colombian candidate, rather than his Costa Rican rival, as the next Secretary General of the Organization of American States.
Officials from Costa Rica, whose Foreign Minister, Bernd Niehaus, is running for the post, complain that the United States is being insensitive in favoring the candidate from a large country -- President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia -- when no one from Central America or the Caribbean has headed the O.A.S. since it was founded in 1948. 
 "The O.A.S. shouldn't be in the hands of just the big countries," said Luis Guardia, the Costa Rican representative to the O.A.S., who complained that "when the United States throws its weight behind a candidate that makes a big difference."
 
Defending an Endorsement
 Some Costa Rican officials feel double-crossed, saying that Washington had originally signaled it would back the candidate endorsed by Central America and the Caribbean: Mr. Niehaus.
Harriet C. Babbitt, the United States representative to the O.A.S., vigorously denied the accusations, insisting that in backing President Gaviria for a five-year term, it is merely supporting the candidate it thinks is best.
"We responded to Gaviria because we think he is a very strong candidate," Ms. Babbitt said. "He has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so. He's been very forward-looking on economic reform in Colombia and on economic integration in the hemisphere."
It looked as if Mr. Niehaus would win easily until Mr. Gaviria entered the race last month, evidently looking for a job when he steps down as President in August.
Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington research group, said Washington's embrace of Mr. Gaviria has unnecessarily created bad blood with other countries. "The U.S. has created few friends but an enormous number of enemies in how it has handled this," Mr. Birns said. "If anything, Costa Rica is in better shape than Colombia in terms of economic reform and human rights."
Costa Rican officials say that Mr. Niehaus has the votes to win the election, which will take place on March 27 in Washington.

Amarillo Promises a Profit For American Air's Service

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
After Amarillo, Tex., learned last month that it would be losing jet service from a major airline, it decided to fight the same fate that had befallen dozens of other small cities. So late last week, city officials put up $1 million to guarantee American Airlines a profit on flights between Amarillo and Dallas.
The arrangement is not unique, but is part of an emerging trend among cities to go on the offensive to retain or expand jet service, which can be crucial in attracting new business and maintaining a strong local economy. With several of the largest carriers shrinking capacity and shedding unprofitable routes, many airlines have told city officials in places like like Sioux City, Iowa, and Bismarck, N.D., that they would replace jets with smaller, propeller planes. 
 "The competition among communities to attract new air services is intense and at levels never seen before," said Morris R. Garfinkle, an aviation lawyer in Washington who represented Nashville last year in its unsuccessful bid to establish an air route between Nashville and London.
Other cities that subsidize service from major airlines include Allentown, Pa., and Traverse City, Mich., as well as some ski resorts like Vail, Colo. In all of these cases, the cities worked out their own, often creative terms to convince major airlines not to replace jets with smaller, propeller-driven aircraft.
In Amarillo, city officials said they would give American Airlines up to $1 million during the first six months of service to cover any losses it incurs from serving the market.
American has been using Fokker 100 jets with 96 seats to fly three flights a day to Dallas, and it planned to replace them entirely with turboprop planes from its American Eagle commuter division.
But with the pledge from Amarillo, it will replace the jets with slightly larger planes this summer and drop a few trips on the turboprops to increase ridership on the jet flights.
Southwest Airlines also provides service to Dallas, but Amarillo officials said that service from a carrier like American with a hub airport was a crucial asset in attracting new business to the city. Amarillo also lost last year the only two daily jet flights offered by Delta Air Lines.
The money that would be paid to American by Amarillo would be drawn from funds collected from a city sales tax for economic development programs.
"We see this as an important promotional element to our economic development program," said Michael Bourn, executive director of the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation.
Trans World Airlines and the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority in Allentown, Pa. struck a similar agreement last year. To fight the loss of passengers to airports in Newark and Philadelphia, the airport had been searching for ways to add to the roughly 30 daily jet flights it offered last year. So it promised T.W.A. minimum revenues on one-stop flights to St. Louis and Orlando, Fla.
The city terminated the agreement to subsidize trips to Orlando on March 1, but the service to St. Louis continues. Because the city is guaranteeing revenue, it also sets the ticket prices on the two daily flights to St. Louis through Baltimore.
George F. Doughty, executive director of the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority, said the city had cut prices drastically on the route.

HEADLINE: House Panel to Vote on a Health Plan Alternative That Doesn't Raise Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
A Congressional subcommittee plans to begin voting on Tuesday on an alternative to President Clinton's health care plan that seeks to guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans without increasing the Federal budget deficit.
The bill, sponsored by Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of the insurance premiums for their workers. It would, in addition, impose a new payroll tax on all employers. 
 The votes in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, headed by Mr. Stark, would be the first test of comprehensive health care legislation in the 103d Congress.
Mr. Stark's bill would require employers to pay a premium of 96 cents an hour for each adult worker. This is a substantial amount when compared with the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour. But Mr. Stark said he was confident that his bill would not hurt any businesses, just as he said there was no harm from recent increases in the minimum wage.
 
$2,500-a-Year Premium
 Mr. Stark's bill envisions a premium of $2,500 a year for each adult. The employer would pay $2,000, and the worker $500. These premiums included the cost of insurance for children, if any. Low-income and unemployed people could enroll in a new program, known as Part C of Medicare.
New budget estimates, prepared by the subcommittee staff with the Congressional Budget Office, show that Mr. Stark's bill would spend $35 billion a year on new Medicare benefits, including coverage of prescription drugs. These costs would be offset in part by $23 billion a year of Medicare savings, achieved mainly through stringent new cost controls.
Mr. Stark's bill also calls for $151 billion a year in subsidies and other assistance to low-income people, to help them pay private health insurance premiums. These costs would be partly offset by $139 billion in savings under Medicaid, the existing program for low-income people.
To make up the difference between the new benefits and savings, Mr. Stark proposes $24 billion a year in new revenues, including a payroll tax of 0.8 percent.
These proposals, taken together, would neither increase nor decrease the deficit, Mr. Stark said. The payroll tax was set at the level needed to make sure there would be no net effect on the deficit.
Mr. Stark developed his proposal to avoid several sections of Mr. Clinton's plan that he said lacked support, most notably its requirement that most Americans enroll in regional insurance purchasing cooperatives, or alliances.
The White House has not offered a detailed critique of Mr. Stark's bill, but Administration officials say they are pleased to see Congress take up such legislation after months of hearings and delays. Mr. Stark's bill incorporates many features of the Clinton bill, but to date no committee has taken action on the President's original proposal.
Mr. Stark said he hoped his subcommittee would finish work on the bill by early next week, clearing the way for action by the full Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Stark's panel will consider many amendments, but Mr. Stark said he would insist that every proposed amendment pay for itself, so the deficit would not increase.
Representative Stark's bill would also gradually reduce the growth of Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled, so it increases no more than the gross domestic product in the year 2000.
Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office says, the Government will spend $290 billion on Medicare in that year. While Mr. Stark's bill would reduce this sum by $23 billion, Mr. Clinton's bill would cut the growth of Medicare more sharply, reducing outlays by a total of $37 billion in 2000.
Mr. Clinton's bill would provide subsidies to employers -- $58 billion in the year 2000 -- to help them buy insurance for workers. Mr. Stark's bill provides no such subsidies.
But he said today that he would be willing to subsidize "incipient and small businesses with low-wage employees and low profits," provided there was a way to pay for the subsidies. One way, he said, might be to collect additional money from "profitable businesses and rich people."
Republicans are expected to propose eliminating much of the Government regulation, some of the cost controls and the employer mandate in Mr. Stark's bill. In an interview, Representative Bill Thomas of California, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said: "I don't expect to win. But if we can defeat some things in a bipartisan way, that's progress. In the process of voting on specific amendments, we can create a universe of bipartisan options."
Representative Sam Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, predicted that the subcommittee would approve a version of Mr. Stark's bill. He said the bill was a practical way to achieve universal health insurance coverage.
Mr. Gibbons said that Mr. Stark's bill was better than Mr. Clinton's proposal because it would allow people to buy insurance through regional purchasing cooperatives, but did not require the use of such alliances. "That's a good move," Mr. Gibbons said, referring to the proposal for voluntary alliances.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Job Prescriptions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
President Clinton called on Japan to stimulate its economy more and on Europe to lower its interest rates, as he opened the jobs conference of the world's leading industrial nations today. But he also used the occasion to call for putting a lid on American interest rates.
"I think that since there's no inflation in the economy, interest rates should not continue to go up," he said. 
 Mr. Clinton's remarks were part of an address to the finance, labor and economic ministers from the Group of Seven major industrial democracies about how they must now cooperate in facing their common problem -- unemployment -- in much the way they have cooperated for the last 50 years to defeat Communism, to stand up against Iraqi aggression and to expand the global trading system.
 
Call for a New Outlook
 In effect, Mr. Clinton called on the group to transform itself from an exclusive club of statesmen who gather annually to talk about issues of high finance and high diplomacy into a global employment agency focused on "the challenge of creating a high-wage, high-growth society in mature industrial countries."
The President said that to produce jobs, each of the Group of Seven nations -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the United States -- must do more to retrain workers, improve productivity and promote a more flexible job market.
Unless the Governments do more to stimulate their economies, he said, there will not be enough jobs, and workers will not be willing to accept the costs they are being asked to bear, whether fewer benefits, relocation or retraining.
"The United States should continue to bring its deficit down," the President said. "Japan should increase domestic demand through more government spending and tax cuts so that its consumers will import more from the rest of the world. And Europe should continue to work for lower interest rates, so that these three things together can spark a new round of worldwide growth, which will create more economic activity and more jobs in European countries, in the United States and Canada and in Japan."
Just in case Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not get the subtle hint, Mr. Clinton told reporters when asked if rising interest rates in the United States were choking the recovery: "I don't think we can say that for sure yet. They were bound to go up some after the fourth-quarter growth figure came in. We had the highest growth rate in a decade. But I think that since there's no inflation in the economy, interest rates should not continue to go up. If they moderate and tail off, then we'll be all right."
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, which was below 6 percent in October, has hit almost 7 percent recently, following the Federal Reserve's move to raise short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point last month. The Bundesbank of Germany, which sets the rate trends in Europe, has been lowering its rates but at a pace that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen says is far too slow to lift Europe out of recession.
American officials have been equally unimpressed with the one-year, $140 billion tax cut introduced in Japan last month, an action Washington believes is too small and too short in duration to produce much of a jump in spending by Japan's consumers. Still, Japanese officials here signaled no willingness to expand their stimulus program.
The German officials at the conference also steadfastly refrained from giving any sign that their nation would follow Mr. Clinton's advice.
The Administration clearly wants to use this job conference to step up the pressure on its partners to stimulate their economies more, and Mr. Clinton more or less told the delegates that the United States had done its part in getting its deficit down and it was now time for them to do more.
The President did get some backing. Italy's Treasury Minister, Piero Barucci, for one, echoed Mr. Clinton's view. He said the Europeans could afford to bring down interest rates even more "without worrying too much about its effects on inflation, which seems anyway under control."
Pascal Lamy, an official representing the European Union, said: "We have no problem with what the President assigned as the main tasks for Japan and Europe. The problem is meeting the conditions for that. We cannot go faster. That is the debate among ourselves. We've been creating the conditions little by little for interest rates to go down."
 
Past 'Embarrassments' Recalled
 Pointing to the foreign officials gathered at the Fox Theater here, Mr. Clinton said: "My fellow Americans, you need to know that they used to meet once a year, and every time they met, for 10 years, the G-7 nations passed a resolution that was, frankly, embarrassing to the United States.
"They did it in very polite language, but they essentially said the global economy cannot grow if America continues to expand its budget deficit. By cutting the deficit by $500 billion, we now have a deficit that is a smaller percentage of our annual income than all but one of our other G-7 nations represented here today. So we are moving in the right direction."
The clear impression Mr. Clinton left was that Germany and Japan still were not in step, or as the President sought to remind them: "One lesson is clear: there is no rich country on earth that can expand its own job base and its incomes unless there is global economic growth."
It may not have been an accident that the Detroit Symphony Orchestra introduced Mr. Clinton by playing not only "Hail to the Chief," but also the "William Tell" Overture -- more widely known as the theme music to "The Lone Ranger."
Besides the President's speech, seminars on unemployment policy were conducted by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers; Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Mr. Bentsen. One theme for all of them was that the industrial nations must oppose a growing school of thought that views improvements in productivity and technology as dangerous for countries seeking to create and maintain jobs.
The Americans say that while technology may be "job displacing" and force people to learn new skills, it ultimately is not "job replacing," in the sense of shrinking the overall job market.
"We have to restore confidence in people that if they do acquire the skills they need and help their countries move forward, they'll be rewarded not punished," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Never Tiring of Talking About Work

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich stepped into an elevator with half a dozen fidgety aides and fiddled with the pin on his lapel.
'Hideous!" he concluded as a thousand unseen gears whisked him to the top of the city's towering Renaissance Center. "Lavender and yellow? It must be the flag of some obscure Slavic country." 
 He spun the lavender side to the top. "Last night at dinner some of the ministers had the yellow side up. Some had it down. We couldn't decide what it meant."
 
Enthusiasm for Problems
 So it goes. Talking, not deciding, is the theme of the two-day Group of Seven jobs conference. And Mr. Reich, who is still very much an unreconstituted academic who seems to revel in problems as much as in the policies that grow from them, stepped off the elevator and into a new round of problems, one of which was that he got so distracted talking that he was late for his own staff meeting.
Though his aides have been quick to deny that the jobs conference is Robert Reich's turn in the spotlight, it is a hard notion to ignore. Assigned to a post that has been routinely undervalued by Republican administrations, Mr. Reich is at the center of the Clinton Administration's effort to rethink some basics of social policy, from unemployment benefits to worker retraining to the linkages between welfare and health care.
Now, with unemployment and other jobs issues topping the agendas of many advanced nations, he finds himself center stage in a play he might as well have written. He hardly troubles to conceal the thrill.
"One of the subtexts of this meeting is that for years and years the G-7 has been primarily about finance, about macroeconomics," he said. "It has been financial ministers and central bankers and of course heads of state talking about policy. But issues of jobs, their quantity and quality have become so much at the center of politics in every nation that the labor ministers and others are now playing a larger role."
 
A Focus on Jobs Training
 The first sessions of the conference only underscored that point. "We spent a lot of time talking about training," he said. "And there was a unanimity that we all have got to do a better job in lifelong learning."
Here, in this city of declining hope and gritty determination, the Labor Secretary is in his metier. Sounding the alarm on stagnant social programs and calling for "a whole new way" to approach everything from high school studies to transitions from one job to another, he has rushed from meeting to meeting, squeezing time when he can to take his message to the news media and then pounding at it again and again in private sessions with his peers.
His hand, or at least his advice, seems everywhere behind this conference. He flew to Detroit on Air Force One on Sunday and then went with President Clinton to Focus Hope, a jobs retraining program that he has been showering with praise for months. His distinctive bearded face and quick grin have been on every network news report for days. And his message, if not his distinct style of delivery, was at the core of the President's statements at his formal opening address today.
Having hammered at these themes month by month since his move from Cambridge, Mass., where he taught at Harvard University, to Washington, the Labor Secretary now has more than a score of foreign ministers and about 1,000 reporters in his line of sight. And he is not missing a chance to chant his chant about retraining, retooling American industry and reorienting the approach to joblessness so that workers will not languish on unemployment insurance for months before anyone realizes that their old jobs will not reappear.
 
Plenty in Common
 And here, he is hearing that chant from France to Japan. "The whole point is to share ideas, to share problems," he said. "We need to realize that we really have a lot in common."
Running late this morning for a breakfast with President Clinton and the foreign officials, Mr. Reich paused with one foot aimed toward the coffee urns and the other toward a tape recorder. As aides nudged and quietly cajoled, he spoke at length about a conversation he had with a British official about the long-term unemployed.
Explaining that a British program corroborated his own theories about quickly identifying workers unlikely to return to their old jobs, Mr. Reich leaned forward with enthusiasm. "That's what we've been saying," he said. "But here's the empirical evidence. That's what this meeting is all about."
The issues have driven him since childhood. His family moved from one economically hard-hit city to another as factories closed and businesses contracted, and he lived through the economic convulsions that he would later analyze. That experience, he said over breakfast last month, shaped his notions of economics and of job security. It also shaped his politics.
Now, it may be shaping his social standing, too. When someone pointed out how rarely American financial and labor secretaries have met and worked together, President Clinton's economics adviser, Robert E. Rubin, suggested that the Detroit meeting could be "a socially uplifting thing."
Robert Reich laughed with everyone else. But then asked -- twice -- "For whom?"

HEADLINE: Giuliani Wants Welfare Recipients to Work

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his administration is considering requiring at least 10,000 people receiving welfare payments to perform jobs like cleaning streets, filling potholes or scrubbing graffiti in exchange for their payments.
Speaking at a news conference in City Hall, the Mayor said the plan is "in the idea stage," adding that it is one of a number of methods being considered to compel able-bodied welfare recipients to go to work. 
 Under the proposal being considered, some people receiving Home Relief Welfare grants would be required to work in jobs in the sanitation, parks or transportation departments. The idea was discussed earlier in the day at a City Council hearing in which John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, testified that Mr. Giuliani had directed him to come up with such an initiative.
Mr. Dyson said the target of 10,000 recipients "seemed to be a realistic estimate of what the various departments could absorb." He also said that the figure was based on studies indicating that 30 percent of the people on home relief were classified as able-bodied.
He added that the Giuliani administration planned to have the program in place by the summer and that Mr. Giuliani was eager to expand the number of workers over time.
About 221,000 people in New York City receive Home Relief Welfare grants, which are given to poor people who are single or married or to couples with children. Half of the cost of administering the program -- about $700 million -- comes from the state, with the balance provided by the city. Typically, a single home-welfare relief recipient would receive $400 a month while an average couple with one child would receive $700 a month.
As a condition of accepting the payments, recipients are required to do one of several assignments, ranging from searching for a job to being assigned to work for a nonprofit agency. Some counties in the state require recipients to perform street-cleaning jobs, state officials said. In New York City, the Parks Department employs about 900 home-relief recipients, who perform a number of maintenance and clerical tasks.
 
Aiming for 10%

Over all, about 14,000 Home Relief recipients in the city already work for their benefits. In addition, a small proportion of mothers with school-age children who receive Federal welfare benefits are required to enroll in training courses.
Mr. Dyson said that it remained unclear how many hours a week the welfare recipients would be required to work, saying that many details had not yet been decided. But he said that the Giuliani administration was considering requiring recipients to work the number of hours that would cover the amount of their welfare payments, calculated on a basis of what they would receive if they were earning the minimum wage. He said that, when Medicaid and food stamp allocations were included, welfare recipients would most likely work a 40-hour week.
"If we get just 10 percent of these people to work, that would be 20,000 people," Mr. Dyson said, standing next to the Mayor at the news conference. "It would double the number of people doing this work and the city would really begin to look like somebody took care of it."
Putting welfare recipients to work was a major theme of Mr. Giuliani's campaign for mayor last year. But since his inauguration, he has been vague about how and under what conditions he would require some of the city's 1.1 million welfare recipients to work.
Last month, in fact, Mr. Giuliani sought to distance himself from a memorandum written by Mr. Dyson, suggesting that the city's welfare recipients be required to put on green uniforms and clean up highways and parks as a condition of receiving benefits. The Mayor said at the time that the memo -- which was written in mid-December and addressed to Peter J. Powers, Deputy Mayor for Operations -- did not reflect a clearly formed policy of the administration.
While Mr. Giuliani made clear yesterday that Mr. Dyson's proposal was one of several being discussed, he embraced the idea, saying "it would seem to me that is exactly the area where reform should start."
Mr. Dyson, too, made it clear that he had received the go-ahead from Mr. Giuliani to begin crafting a program to get welfare recipients to clean streets, parks and fill the city's estimated 275,000 potholes. "This would give them the experience, the satisfaction of contributing something back to society and make an overall contribution to the way the city looks," Mr. Dyson said.
But the proposal drew criticism from some experts, who complained that the such a program would not prepare people for long-term, full-time employment. Marion Nichols, a researcher for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based group that studies welfare issues, said: "The problem is people do not necessarily get jobs after these programs are completed. It can lead to a job, but it usually doesn't."
Some union officials, on the other hand, charged that the proposal would replace skilled, unionized workers with people compelled to work for low wages.
"It's a crazy idea," said Peter Scarlotos, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. Mr. Scarlotos complained that the idea comes at a time when the Giuliani administration has proposed cutting about 1,500 jobs from the city's sanitation workforce of 9,500 people.
"Mr. Dyson wants to put people who are currently employed out of work, so that unemployed persons can take their jobs," Mr. Scarlotos said. "This is just another attack on organized labor and we will not permit our contractual rights to be trampled on."
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said his organization opposed the idea because "we believe that individuals should not be coerced into employment and this is a form of government coercion." He said that "if the city wants to induce people to work, the city should make work sufficiently attractive."
"We favor the carrot, not the stick," he added.

HEADLINE: Budget Seen Cutting Services Or Increasing Property Taxes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 14

 BODY:
The levels of state aid in Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's budget brought expressions of disappointment and dismay today from representatives of school boards and municipalities, who predicted that Mrs. Whitman's failure to increase aid will lead to higher property taxes or sharp service cuts.
At the same time, the union that represents 50,000 state and local workers said that Mrs. Whitman has unilaterally reneged on a deal to prefinance pension and cost-of-living increases that was worked out two years ago with the current Republican leaders of the Legislature, former Gov. Jim Florio and state and union actuaries. 
 Frank Belluscio, the spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said that maintaining current financing levels is a prescription for higher property taxes or program cuts because school districts face annual increases in teachers' salaries and transportation costs, inflation, new debt service and, often, enrollment increases in regular and special education.
 
Possibility of Larger Classes
 "A lot will depend on where the spending cap is for the coming year," he said. If the amount school budgets can increase is set between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent, then spending will increase to those levels and require increased property taxes, he said. A lower cap could make it necessary to have larger classes and fewer teachers and programs.
"Some people may think you can cut back on the income tax and keep aid levels the same and not see an impact," he said. "Unfortunately, that's not the case."
Donald Testa, president of the New Jersey Education Association, said the Governor's budget proposals would hurt the quality of education and threaten school employees' pensions and retirees' health benefits.
"This budget signals distress for public school students across the state," Mr. Testa said. "It means we may be cheating our students out of the opportunity to compete in the global marketplace." The cuts, he said, could prevent poor urban districts from reaching financing equal to that in affluent suburban districts, as mandated by the New Jersey Supreme Court.
In addition, state employees and teachers will have to pay a 2 percent Social Security tax that had been paid by the state since 1959. The shift will save the state $98 million but "will amount to a pay cut of $400 to $1,000," said Alan Kaufman, the legislative and political coordinator for the Communications Workers of America, which represents state and local government workers.
Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, said that the losses in state aid will be made up in large part by reducing pension costs paid by schools and towns and by passing along planned savings in state health care costs.
State resources being made available to municipalities and schools are virtually the same as last year, he said, with the exception of "a little haircut" of $14 million in desegregation aid -- which he said did not get used for that purpose -- that would no longer go to 26 school districts. Also, 24 large suburban towns will lose $8 million in density aid, which is used to help pay for municipal services.
The combination of reducing pension costs and returning some benefits from health care changes will mean that school districts will receive $4.02 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1, compared with $4.04 billion in the current year, Mr. Clymer said. Municipalities will receive $1.54 billion, compared with $1.55 billion this year, he said.
Yet William G. Dressel Jr., assistant executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities said there will have to be property tax increases, or cutbacks in municipal services -- or both.
"We haven't received an increase in four years, and we're already operating in a hole," he said.
 
A Certain Degree of Relief
 Mr. Dressel said, however, that he was relieved that there wasn't a larger cutback in state aid, given the size of the budget deficit Mrs. Whitman had to offset.
The final impact on local governments of the changes in aid and in pension and health benefit systems will have to await town-by-town reviews, Mr. Dressel said. "The devil is in the details," he said.
The decision to finance pension obligations on an annual basis instead of prefinancing their costs, said Mr. Kaufman of the Communications Workers of America, calls into question whether promised pension benefits will be available for future retirees.
Slowing cost-of-living payments and reducing the level of financing for employees' pensions until their salaries increase, he said, will result in "astronomical" pension costs in the future that the state may not be able to finance.
"If the Governor is changing the prefunding agreement without having talked to us, then that's not acceptable," Mr. Kaufman said.
The union will appeal to the legislative leaders to stand by their agreement with the union as they review Mrs. Whitman's budget, he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble In Mexico

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 14

 BODY:
Mexican stocks ended sharply weaker today, hit by uncertainty about the country's political future and heavy selling of Telefonos de Mexico.
The key IPC index of 36 leading shares ended at 2,429.88 after dropping 81.05 points, or 3.23 percent, the third-biggest fall this year. 
 "It was a massacre," said Alvaro de la Macorra, director of capital markets at the brokerage firm Probursa. "There was nothing to push the market higher. The fall went in line with the drop in Telmex in New York." The American depositary receipts, or A.D.R.'s, of Telmex in New York were down 3 1/4, to 62 1/4, in late trading.
Analysts said the market reacted negatively to the announcement of the Chiapas peace envoy, Manuel Camacho, Friday that he was leaving open the possibility that he would run for president in August.
The prospect of a Camacho presidency worries investors who wonder about his commitment to President Salinas's economic changes and how it would affect the 65-year reign of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
In the broad market, 98 issues traded, with declines topping advances, 62 to 11.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance Slightly in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks drifted up yesterday in light trading. Market professionals held back, awaiting inflation news today and tomorrow as the bond market again approached but then pulled back from long-term interest rates of 7 percent.
Companies related to the computer industry, whose share prices have generally risen recently, benefited from the small rally. Computer makers like I.B.M. and the Digital Equipment Corporation, semiconductor companies like Motorola and Intel, as well as software companies like Novell and Oracle, all saw their share prices rise. 
 There was little economic news yesterday to move markets. Trading was therefore light with 260.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange changing hands, the second-lowest volume since Feb. 4 when the Federal Reserve Board nudged up short-term interest rates a quarter- point. "It was a very, very quiet day," said Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research at Chemical Securities.
Yesterday's volume compares with an average daily volume of more than 300 million shares since the Fed rate increase.
The Dow Jones industrial average seesawed widely yesterday, dropping as low as 3,856 shortly after 1 P.M. and then rising to as much as 3,871 shortly after 3 P.M., then dropping once again. The Dow settled at 3,862.98, up 0.28 point.
Since the Jan. 31 peak of 3,978.36, the Dow has fallen more than 115 points, or about 3 percent. Some market professionals believe the Dow is in for a price "correction" of 5 percent or more, or at least 200 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 generally paralleled the blue-chip Dow and rose 0.95 point, to 467.39. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 3.60 points, to 792.80.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.48 point, to 259.01. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks, 1,159 to 949. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.08 points, to 468.06.
The Federal Reserve is in a quandary. Both stock and bond market professionals are almost uniformly calling for the Fed to raise interest rates to fight inflation, yet there is little or no evidence of inflation so far. Inflation hurts the long-term value of bonds, thus depressing bond prices, and also raises the borrowing costs of corporations, thus hurting stock prices.
The Labor Department is scheduled to report the February Producer Price Index today.
Telefonos de Mexico's American depository receipts were the most actively traded stock yesterday at 5.6 million shares. Telmex dropped steadily from the beginning of the session, declining 3 1/4, to 62 1/4. One A.D.R. represents 20 ordinary shares.
Telmex stock, because it accounts for one-sixth of the Mexican stock exchange, is often used by portfolio managers as a proxy for Mexican stocks and is thus vulnerable whenever foreign investors become concerned about Mexico.

Dollar Rises Against Yen After Cellular Phone Deal

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, after the United States and Japan reached a final agreement over the weekend on a trade dispute involving Japan's cellular telephone market.
It also inched higher against the German mark and several other European currencies. 
 The dollar began rising in overseas trading in reaction to the move by Japan in giving Motorola Inc. greater access to its cellular telephone market, and its surge continued in the United States.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.16 Japanese yen, up from 104.95 yen on Friday. It also rose to 1.6893 marks from 1.6842 marks.
The yen surged earlier this year amid worries that a trade war might erupt between the United States and Japan and that American officials would press for a stronger yen as a means of gaining leverage in the dispute.
But the yen's strength has waned recently amid signs that the trade tensions may be cooling off.
 
Bank Ratings in Review
 The yen suffered a further blow in late New York trading trade after the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it had placed the debt ratings of the Bank of Tokyo, the Mitsubishi Bank, the Sanwa Bank and the Sumitomo Bank under review for possible downgrading. The news reinforced worries about the dismal state of the Japanese economy.
The yen's retreat against the mark, however, was the bigger session surprise, said a Bank of Tokyo dealer, Belal Khan.
Mr. Khan said the Japanese currency's cross-rate slide "might be a signal that some of the strength the yen had accumulated is slowly being unwound."
Against the mark, the dollar opened slightly higher and then wandered in a very narrow range, with most dealers casting an eye toward tomorrow, when the Bundesbank will announce if and how much it is cutting its repurchase rate.
Traders are also looking to today's report on February producer prices for signs about inflation.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery, the most active futures contract, gained $1.10, to $387.20 an ounce.
The British pound slipped to $1.4970 in New York, from $1.4999 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4350 Swiss francs, up from 1.4225, 5.7410 French francs, up from 5.7305; $1.3601 (Canadian), down from $1.3619, and 1,671 Italian lire, up from 1,667.

Prices of U.S. Securities Down in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday in very thin and quiet trading as investors and dealers nervously awaited the release of the first of February's key inflation reports today.
Traders said higher bond prices generated by last Friday's rally gave a few dealers, who did not bail out during the sharp declines earlier last week, the opportunity yesterday to sell before the release of the Producer Price Index today and the Feburary Consumer Price Index tomorrow. 
 Many traders and investors worry that the reports, even if they show only moderate increases in inflation, will still prompt more selling because of the uncertainity over when the Federal Reserve will move to raise short-term interest rates for the second time this year.
With the bond market so sensitized by the fear of inflation, it did not take long for trading to take a negative tone yesterday, analysts said. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said that its survey of regional business activity in the Southeast found prices rising, both for raw materials and finished goods.
The February prices-paid index rose to 24.5, from 19.5 in January, while the February index for prices received for finished products rose to 15.8 from 12.1 in January. The bond- price declines after the Atlanta report only helped underscore the market's nervousness ahead of today's release of the producer price report.
The price of the 30-year bond in late trading was down 19/32 , to 919/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday.
 
Focus of Other Data
 Other data the market will be focusing on this week include tomorrow's Consumer Price Index and Thursday's Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey of regional business activity, which many remember precipitated the "pre-emptive" increase in short-term rates last month by the Fed.
Yesterday the market opened to a Barron's article that suggested the Fed had intervened quietly last week to stem the rising long-bond yields, which had reached 7 percent in intraday trading on Friday. Traders said they were not sure if the bond market really believed the article, but prices were up in early trading.
Analysts at MMS International said they doubted the Fed would try to manipulate long rates or defend specific levels. The article was denied later in the morning by a New York Fed spokesman.
With few investors in the market and most on the sidelines, the moves were greatly exaggerated, analysts said. Matthew Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said, "It was real hard to fall in love with anything in this market ahead of the numbers."
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said the market appeared to him to be worried that higher energy prices may put pressure on the index today. "But the market is likely to be forgiving if the strength is concentrated in the energy component," Mr. Crandall said.
He said that while the Producer Price Index was a measure of inflationary pressures, many market participants were also aware that the index was more volatile than the Consumer Price Index. "Therefore, strong numbers are less likely to be a surprise to the market," he said.
One reason the Producer Price Index can have less impact is that it does not include prices in the service sector of the economy. The consensus forecast is for an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in the overall producer index, with a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the so-called core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.
Elsewhere, the Treasury was busy selling $25.2 billion of three- and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction, with the average discount rate up over the previous week.

HEADLINE: Canada Weighs Job Incentives

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
Canada may offer tax incentives for companies to hire new workers and may tie unemployment insurance programs to job and skills training, Government officials said today.
Speaking to reporters at the start of the Group of Seven industrial nations jobs conference here, the Canadian Finance Minister, Paul Martin, said the Government must re-examine its tax code to encourage companies to increase employment. 
 "At the present, we have a situation under our tax system that at times of recession companies are encouraged to buy equipment and lay off people, and that's just counterproductive," he said.
"We've got to build in incentives to hire people and to train them. Obviously, the tax act is one way to do that."

HEADLINE: Sally Belfrage Dies; Writer Specializing In Memoirs Was 57

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.
The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick. 
 Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.
Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.
Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins.
 
Youth in Hollywood and London
 Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."
After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.
Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.
She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
It's the Latest Waive: Bargaining for Players

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
Everyone in pro football knew that the National Football League's new odd couple -- unrestricted free agency and a salary cap -- would create weird situations.
But weird enough for teams to shed players because they could not afford them? 
 That is just what happened to the Washington Redskins and the Miami Dolphins and it will probably happen to many more teams before the free-agency period for this year ends July 15.
When the Redskins signed outside linebacker Ken Harvey of the Phoenix Cardinals for $11 million over four years and moved him to the strong side, Carl Banks became superfluos and was waived. That move was logical because it saved the Redskins the $1.5 million they would have had to pay Banks this season.
Then the Redskins waived wide receiver Tim McGee, who was scheduled to earn $1.3 million this season. While McGee was not a world-beater last season -- 39 receptions for 500 yards and 3 touchdowns -- he was still serviceable. And the Redskins need receivers because Ricky Sanders seems ready to defect to the San Diego Chargers, Art Monk is aging and Desmond Howard has been an overpaid bust.
But Norv Turner, the Redskins' new coach, thinks the 36-year-old Monk may have another year left. Turner also thinks the Redskins can sign Michael Timpson of the New England Patriots for much less than the $2 million a year Timpson wants (the Giants and Jets like Timpson, too).
The Redskins, like many other teams, coveted the two prize free-agent receivers -- Tim Brown of the Los Angeles Raiders and Anthony Miller of the Chargers. Both are transition players, and Brown seems headed for the Denver Broncos. He signed an $11 million offer sheet last Friday with Denver. The Raiders have seven days to match it. Miller will probably command between $2.5 million and $3 million a year, more than the Redskins are likely to spend for him because of their salary-cap squeeze.
By shedding McGee, the Redskins gained extra money. They picked up more when Jeff Bostic, their tough, willing center and guard for 15 years, retired at age 35. They spent some of that money when they signed tight end Ethan Horton, an unrestricted free agent from the Raiders, for $2.5 million over two years.
The Dolphins made two moves involving strong safeties. First, they signed Michael Stewart, an unrestricted free agent from the Los Angeles Rams. Then they dropped the transition-player designation from Louis Oliver, making him an unrestricted free agent free to play anywhere.
Stewart signed a three-year contract for $2.8 million, including a $600,000 signing bonus. Although Oliver is probably a better player, his salary this year would have been at least $1,697,000. Now he must find another team because Miami could not afford him.
"There will be plenty of interest in him," said Oliver's agent, Drew Rosenhaus.
Eddie Jones, the Dolphins' general manager, said it was simple economics.
"It was clear Louis would command a high price," Jones said, "and we had to plan with the realization that Louis might not be here."
By signing one safety and freeing another, the Dolphins saved $800,000. So if they now sign another free agent for that much, they will in effect have traded Oliver for Stewart and that new player.
"That's what it's coming down to," said Harvey Greene, a Dolphins' spokesman. "If you sign this guy, you may have to give up that guy."
That dilemma has contributed to the tentative signing pace for the 368 unrestricted and 99 restricted free agents. With this go-where-you-want-to-go period almost four weeks old, only 23 free agents have changed teams and 14 others have re-signed with their old teams.
"We're taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Carl Peterson, the president of the Kansas City Chiefs. So far, his team has signed no one and lost no one.
"We want to see which teams will put themselves into oblivion and which have money left to get players when the music stops," he said. "A few players will be upset that they won't be able to get the money they thought they would, but we've all got to live under the cap. Some people -- clubs, players and agents -- haven't planned for it.
"If the draft were right now, a half-dozen teams wouldn't have the money to pay one player. Most teams don't have more than 30 or 33 players signed now. We have 53, and two or three other teams do, too. And 53 is not 80, and you want to take 80 players to camp. Some teams say they will take less than 80 to camp. Good luck."

Helping With a Hall
Many of New York City's small performing organizations have complained increasingly in recent years that high rental fees have driven them out of the main concert halls. Some have moved their concerts to churches and community centers, some have found smaller, less expensive halls, and some have cut back on their activities. But now Lincoln Center is addressing this complaint with a new program that will subsidize performances at Alice Tully Hall. 
 The program, called the Lincoln Center Community Arts Project, is starting a pilot project this season in which $40,000 is to be distributed to six to eight groups. Each will receive a $5,000 grant, enough to cover the $4,040 hall rental fee and help defray some of the stage labor costs. Lincoln Center is also providing free marketing services, technical assistance and advice.
The first beneficiaries are to be ensembles that have performed at the hall in the past but have drifted away. So far only one performance is scheduled, a free concert by the New York Chamber Ensemble on March 30. Lincoln Center is also discussing presentations with the Caribbean Cultural Center and the Chinese-American Arts Council. No other organizations have been selected yet, a Lincoln Center spokesman said.
This season's performing groups were chosen from among the organizations that responded to a survey of past renters. Next season, the plan is to increase the number of groups to 10 and to start a more formal selection process. Performing groups will submit proposals, and a jury of Lincoln Center officials and arts professionals will make the selections.
The project is being underwritten by a grant from the New York Community Trust, an organization that distributes private bequests. Lincoln Center is also seeking foundation grants.
 
Direct Education
 Orchestras terrified by the prospect of dwindling audiences have said for years that the root of the problem has been the virtual disappearance of music education from public schools. The St. Louis Symphony Society, which manages the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, has just made an unusually direct move into the education world. It has agreed to merge with the St. Louis Conservatory and School for the Arts (known as CASA) to form a joint venture called the St. Louis Symphony Community Music School. The merger takes effect in August and the initial budget has not yet been settled.
The school has 3,000 students, from pre-schoolers to adults. Its programs include instrumental instruction in both classical music and jazz. The school also has four youth orchestras, which have fed into the St. Louis Symphony's youth ensemble. Some of the St. Louis Symphony musicians teach at the school, and the orchestra has for years had a concert series in the conservatory's 800-seat hall. The school has satellite programs in city schools, an outreach project that the new venture hopes to expand.
Other orchestras have educational outreach programs and maintain connections with nearby conservatories. But the St. Louis project seems to be the first case of a major American orchestra having a school under its administrative umbrella. Besides the orchestra, the youth orchestra and now the school, the society manages the St. Louis Symphony Chorus and Powell Symphony Hall, the orchestra's home.
"The merger offers us a forum for our educational goals," said James F. Mann, the orchestra's general manager. "We want very much to make a commitment to education, but very often we would come up with ideas only to find that CASA was already doing them. By avoiding a duplication of effort, we can work more effectively."
 
Hemidemisemiquavers
 *Matthew Epstein, the general director of the Welsh National Opera since 1991, has resigned, saying that the company's financial situation made it impossible for him to continue. In a cordial letter to Lord Davies of Llandinam, the chairman of the innovative company, Mr. Epstein attributed the company's financial situation to reduced government support, a decline in ticket sales because of both the recession and high prices, and an unsuccessful fund-raising drive. Mr. Epstein, who also heads a division at Columbia Artists Management, had completed plans for the company's seasons through 1996. He said he would help find a successor.
*Elektra Nonesuch Records has taken another step in cornering the market in the most popular modern composers. Having already established relationships with Steve Reich, John Adams and Philip Glass, in which the composers oversee recordings of their works, the label has just signed an exclusive agreement with Henryk Gorecki. The company has been lucky for the composer: its 1991 recording of Mr. Gorecki's Symphony No. 3, with David Zinman, Dawn Upshaw and the London Sinfonietta, was a surprise hit in 1992 and 1993. The label has also issued recordings of his "Lerchenmusik" and two string quartets. Under the agreement, Mr. Gorecki will supervise recordings of his Symphony No. 2, "Old Polish Music," "Good Night," "Kleines Requiem fur eine Polka," Beatus Vir, Miserere, Concerto-Cantata for Flute and Orchestra, Two Sacred Songs, "Songs of Joy and Rhythm" and a collection of choral works.
*The Philadelphia Orchestra has added two new conductors to its staff. Andre Raphel Smith, the assistant conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, is moving east to take up the same position in Philadelphia. And Luis Biava, the Philadelphia Orchestra's principal second violinist, will be acting assistant conductor while keeping his playing job. Beginning next season, both conductors will direct nonsubscription performances and children's concerts and will be on hand for last-minute substitutions.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 16, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the Music Notes column yesterday about the appointment of two conductors by the Philadelphia Orchestra misstated one title. At the beginning of the 1994-95 season, Luis Biava is to become a conductor in residence, not an acting assistant conductor.

HEADLINE: Facing Big-City Problems, L.I. Suburbs Try to Adapt

SERIES: Tarnished Haven -- First of two articles

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST ISLIP, L.I.

 BODY:
The Long Island suburbs, which pioneered a new and better way to live in postwar America, are struggling with problems they never expected to reach their door. They have become a bellwether for the nation's older suburbs, trying to adapt to an uncertain and threatening future.
The Island's fiercely local brand of self-government grew up to serve bedroom communities of a like-minded middle class, almost entirely white, pursuing the good life. 
 Now its governments and politicians are finding themselves ill-equipped to deal with economic malaise, racial divisions, spreading poverty, declining population, rising crime -- and unrelenting pressure on governments to accomplish more with less.
Long Island has been geared since World War II to accommodate a growing population. But between 1985 and 1990, according to the latest Census, more than 310,000 people left the area, most of them joining a vast exodus from the New York region. During the same period, only 235,000 people moved to Nassau or Suffolk Counties -- a net loss of more than 75,000 people.
In this unfamiliar era of scarcity, suburban politicians are being forced into the continual balancing, and playing off, of competing constituencies that is routine in the older cities.
Where should tax money go? To sustain the schools and parks that once defined the suburbs, or to pay for the health and social services and courts and the police now needed to cope with afflictions once confined to cities?
Nassau and Suffolk Counties, with a total population of 2.6 million, have the highest rate of AIDS of any suburban area. Infant mortality among black babies, at 18.8 per thousand, is worse than in the South Bronx. Welfare caseloads increased 45 percent between 1989 and 1992.
The Long Island suburbs came to life after World War II as a bedroom community. Yet today, thousands of homeless Long Islanders lack a regular place to sleep.
The difference between the Long Island of today and the Long Island of yesteryear is the difference between Kenneth Euring and his parents.
At 47 years of age, Mr. Euring is about as old as the postwar boom that transformed the potato fields of Long Island into the nation's first modern suburbs.
Back in 1956, when Mr. Euring's parents chose to move to East Islip from Queens, Suffolk County was a haven of quiet streets, good schools and abundant parks for children. Passers-by said "good morning" to friends and strangers alike. Doors went unbolted at night.
But the Long Island that fulfilled the elder Eurings' dream of a better life is long since gone.
Today Mr. Euring cannot name most of his neighbors, who increasingly include renters. Many of the manufacturing jobs that fueled the postwar expansion have evaporated. They seem certain to grow scarcer with the impending acquisition of Grumman by a larger aerospace manufacturer, a move widely expected to result in more layoffs.
Mr. Euring, laid off from Grumman after 24 years, now works at Home Depot for less than half his former salary. His wife works two jobs; the family shops at food warehouses and scrimps on gas. Worried about crime, Mr. Euring made sure his two teen-age daughters learned how to shoot a pistol.
 
'We're Going Down, Down'
 "You do what you have to do to survive," Mr. Euring said. "We're going down, down."
The troubles facing Long Island and other postwar suburbs -- which originally provided a refuge from urban crowding for returning G.I.'s -- are not as great as those of cities, but the suburbs' resources are usually much more limited. If one measure of a great city has traditionally been its ability to extend opportunity to all, America's suburbs have been judged by their success in tailoring services to those who can pay for them.
Some suburbs, like those around Minneapolis, have begun to form political coalitions with the urban core, rather than competing with them, said David Rusk, a consultant to urban and suburban governments and author of "Cities Without Suburbs."
Here on Long Island, the language of civic life is of "tough decisions" and "hard choices" that will ultimately determine whether Long Island can adapt to a new age.
 
Decline
Problems Migrate On National Scope
 According to Eric Alexander of the Nassau-Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless, 40,000 people were homeless on Long Island in 1992, two-thirds of them living in emergency shelters or doubling up with relatives, and the rest sleeping in vacant buildings, abandoned cars and doorways. The number has grown by a third since 1987, he said, but it has not dropped with signs of economic recovery.
Katherine S. Newman, a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, likens the downturn on Long Island and the California suburbs, regions that lived on military contracts, to the decline of Rust Belt cities and towns a decade or two ago.
"They were faced with exactly these kinds of problems," she said. "I think Long Island is in deep, deep trouble."
Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia and author of "Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States," agreed. "Suburbs increasingly represent the problems of society as a whole," he said. "They're not really refuges anymore."
 
Still, Enviable Advantages
 To be sure, the suburbs are not New York City. New York's welfare caseload alone, at 1.1 million, nearly equals the entire population of Nassau County. In New York City, one in seven residents is on welfare; on Long Island, one in 38.
And Long Island retains some enviable advantages. Median incomes in Nassau and Suffolk, measured in the 1990 Census before the full impact of the recession, were $60,619 and $53,247 -- among the highest in the country. Its better schools are among the nation's best.
But in notable ways, the Long Island created after the war is eroding. Home foreclosures on the Island, so low during the 1980's that Suffolk County stopped tracking them, increased more than 500 percent to 6,375 last year from 962 in 1988. The high cost of housing, utilities and taxes on Long Island is hurting residents and forcing commercial manufacturers to turn away as well. Since 1989, Long Island has lost more than 110,000 jobs.
 
Government
Local Walls Keep Solutions Out
 It is far from clear whether the Long Island that grew up in an earlier, less demanding era can handle the problems that have come with maturity. Its fragmented political system, rooted in local control, at times seems stymied in dealing with islandwide or countywide issues. And its residents and politicians must decide how to divide dwindling resources among a broader array of competing demands.
"As the populations move out, the urban problems move out as well," Professor Jackson said. "Suburbs are not so much a place as a process."
Nassau County, for example, maintains 70 public tennis courts -- a traditional suburban amenity, the sort of "quality of life" factor that helped attract people in the first place. But can the county continue to pay for such amenities while facing the need to cut financing to the Nassau County Medical Center, which provides health care for many of the county's poorer residents?
Older residents, burdened with huge property tax bills, have exerted increasing pressure to cut school costs. But will such cuts threaten the quality of education -- a traditional drawing card of young families to the suburbs? Indeed, between 1980 and 1990, the share of children on Long Island who left the public school system for private schools increased by a third, to 23 percent from 17 percent.
The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, recently complained that state and Federal mandates claimed 70 percent of the budget. He said he would seek private owners for the county's geriatric center and health clinics, and for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The county also plans to sell the Nassau County Medical Center in Hempstead or transfer it to private management.
 
Spending on Poor Is Rare
 Hugh A. Wilson, director of the suburban studies center at Adelphi University, says that while Nassau County will match Federal or state funds, "very, very rarely" will it go it alone in spending money on the problems of the poor.
"That's the consensus here," Mr. Wilson said. "People left those problems in the city, and they don't want them following them out here. And if they do, they don't want to recognize it. They deny it."
Another complicating factor is the high degree of local control in government, which originally assured homeowners of a say over any changes in their immediate surroundings. The result has been to create a total of 1,037 different taxing authorities on Long Island, covering everything from schools to water to sidewalks.
That, in turn, has helped drive local taxes to the highest levels in the country and made Long Island too expensive for many young couples.
In addition to driving up the cost of government, the high degree of local control strips county government on Long Island of the power to impose solutions to countywide problems on individual towns. General problems typically become political footballs, some of which eventually land in the least powerful communities.
 
No One Is Responsible
 "Because decision-making is so diffuse, there's a lack of accountability, and not the kind of follow-through to implement decisions, so the public doesn't know who to praise or who to blame," said Patrick J. Halpin, a Democrat who served as Suffolk County Executive from 1987 to 1991. "It's always easier for politicians to do nothing, but a region like Long Island will pay a heavy price for the inaction of local politicians."
But so sacrosanct is the concept of home rule that when Mr. Halpin appointed Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, to head a tax-relief commission, the panel's 1992 recommendations for streamlining government drew barely a flutter of interest.
And local interests remain powerful. When Canon U.S.A. wanted to move its North American headquarters from Lake Success to a larger plant near the horse farms of Brookville two years ago, homeowners on the wealthy North Shore blocked the move, though it would have saved about 1,500 white-collar jobs.
And while business leaders complain that the lack of affordable housing is a major deterrent to expanding or relocating on Long Island, middle-income towns seldom feel moved to allow subsidized housing.
Dr. Koppelman and others ask whether mature suburbs can even replenish themselves.
 
Island Is Beyond Its Means
 "If you were to empty Long Island of its 2.7 million people and told them all they could come back tomorrow morning at 9 A.M.," Dr. Koppelman said, "the overwhelming majority wouldn't be able to afford to live here." That means not only a population stretched to its credit limit, but also a growing insecurity and fear of any change that could upset the precarious balance.
Opposition to subsidized housing on Long Island has been stubborn. Many of its postwar residents were G.I.'s buying tract houses with low-interest Veterans Administration loans. Today, many of those same people oppose subsidized housing, fearing that it will depress housing values and draw minorities to their communities, said James M. Morgo, director of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that builds subsidized housing. When such houses are built, they usually appear in depressed areas unlikely to attract middle-class workers.
John O'Connell, director of the Nassau County Health and Welfare Council, calls this the "bar the door" syndrome. "It's a mentality that says, 'I've got mine, the hell with you,' " Mr. O'Connell said.
Mr. O'Connell sees a shift in the attitudes of suburbs like Long Island. Once, he said, "it was the best instincts in people that drew them to Long Island: clean water, space for kids, good schools."
"Over 30 years, that has changed into a negative karma," he said -- "into, 'Cut my taxes, because I don't see the common good any more.' "
 
The Future
 Broken Contract With the Young

The hard choices facing Long Island, to one extent or another, are the choices of suburbs everywhere. And at times they seem to suggest the end of the postwar dream of an ever better life with each new generation.
"The social contract that's supposed to bind generations is coming under tremendous strains," said Professor Newman of Columbia.
John Juliano, 61, a real-estate agent for Levittown Equities, says that those now shopping for homes are typically better educated and harder working than their parents, but cannot afford the homes their parents' generation is trying to sell. Mr. Juliano, who worked as a milkman when he moved to Levittown in 1960, says that couples who now buy Levittown homes are older, white-collar parents, both working full-time.
Ebba and William Lehmann have retired in the Plainedge home they bought 40 years ago, when their street was but a dirt road. They would not dream of moving off Long Island. But she acknowledged that Long Island was beyond the reach of their sons, who are 42 and 40.
"We had much easier lives than our parents," said Ms. Lehmann, who is 68 years old, "and I don't think our kids are going to have as easy a life as we did. They rent, and they can't afford to assume the responsibilities we assumed at younger ages."
 
Working Through High School
 Richard Wesley, who has taught social studies at Massapequa High School for 26 years, sees successes and struggles in his classroom. Some families still prosper. Mr. Wesley had no difficulty finding students for a summer trip to Europe. But at the same time, nearly all the seniors at Massapequa High work part-time.
"There are a lot of families being held together by the barest thread," he said.
Planners here hope Long Island's pool of educated, productive workers will attract new businesses, but the high costs of energy, housing and transportation -- 97 percent of the freight moves by truck over congested highways -- drive up production costs. The new equation leaves little room for yesterday's skilled, blue-collar workers.
"The kinds of jobs people are talking about creating are low-wage manufacturing jobs, assembly-line jobs," Professor Newman said. "Even in high-tech industries, the jobs are low-paying."
More disturbing, she said, many of those leaving the Island blame the declining quality of life. That is a stinging rejection for suburbs that once lured growing families with good schools and safe, open spaces.
"The quality of life is sending people away," said one 29-year old businessman, who spoke at Kennedy International Airport as he waited for the plane to New Mexico, where he plans to move his Farmingdale sporting goods business next year. He did not want to be identified because his companion, a banking executive and the mother of their child, has not told her employer she will be leaving.
"When you are paying a lot in taxes and the roads are choked up and the quality of life problems are still there, you ask yourself, why am I here?" he said.
NEXT: Minority families on Long Island often find only a stunted version of the suburban dream.

HEADLINE: Michigan Votes School Finance Plan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15

 BODY:
Michigan voters today approved a constitutional amendment to raise the state sales tax and cigarette tax to replace property taxes as the means of supporting the state's schools.
With 88 percent of the statewide vote counted, the amendment had 70 percent of the vote. 
 The measure on the ballot required people to vote yes or no on the plan, which raises the state sales tax to 6 percent from 4 percent as of May 1 and triples the tax on a pack of cigarettes to 75 cents from 25 cents.
The proposal also slightly decreases Michigan's flat-rate income tax, from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent and limits property assessment increases to the inflation rate or a maximum of 5 percent a year.
 
One Tax or Another
 Voters had little choice but to raise taxes one way or another. The Michigan Legislature abolished most of the traditional financing of schools based on property taxes last July, and the public schools would not have had sufficient funds to operate had not some new revenue source been tapped.
Had the proposal been defeated, the Legislature required that a backup plan automatically take effect, increasing the state income tax to finance schools. The backup plan would have partly compensated for the loss of property tax by boosting Michigan's flat-rate income tax to 6 percent from 4.6 percent and increasing the cigarette tax by 15 cents a pack.
The vote followed a costly and bitter political battle, which began last July when the Legislature stunned Michigan by voting to abolish $7 billion in property tax revenues.
That money had been the mainstay of public school financing in Michigan for years, and the lawmakers canceled it with nothing to replace it.
 
Voters Given Last Word
 Lawmakers in both parties said that action came as a desperation move to force the issue after years of debate over how to finance education in the nation's eighth-largest state. The state had endured several crises when voters refused to raise local property taxes and school districts had to close, and there was widespread agreement that the traditional method of relying mainly on local property tax revenues was outdated and unfair. But there was profound disagreement about how to replace it.
After months of wrangling, the legislature agreed in December on a compromise in which the voters would have the final say about raising the 4 percent state sales tax.
That triggered a bitter and costly battle, in which many political and opinion leaders campaigned for the sales tax and cigarette tax plan, while the main teachers' union and the tobacco companies fought it.
Governor John Engler, a Republican who was the proposal's leading supporter, said his plan was "good for the schools and good for the state." The Governor, a conservative Republican, is up for re-election in November, and his chief Democratic opponents concede that Mr. Engler's re-election chances will be enhanced by the proposal's success.
 
Likened to Rates in Other States
 Mr. Engler argued that raising Michigan's sales tax would merely bring it in line with the rates in many other states, while raising the income tax would tend to hurt the state's ability to attract new businesses, especially in economically troubled Detroit.
That logic appealed to Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a Democrat who last week broke with many in his party and endorsed Mr. Engler's plan.
The Michigan Education Association, which represents 97,000 teachers in the state, has been vehement in its opposition. "Funding remains extremely unstable," under the proposal, Julius Maddox, president of the teachers' union, said last week.
"The income tax, unlike a sales tax, represents a much more dependable source of revenue for the schools," he added.

HEADLINE: Sometimes a Company Must Become a School To Be a Good Business

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CLARKSDALE, Miss.

 BODY:
Delta Wire hardly looks like much.
A windowless factory building in a small town in the lost back stretches of the mud-rich Delta, the company is an oasis of industry in a land of cotton crops and scrubby fields. With only 120 employees, it is small by city standards -- minuscule next to its top competitors -- a humble place, where the offices are uncarpeted and the attitude is unpretentious. 
 In the Delta, though, the company is a beacon, a place where wages are good and jobs are stable for employees who run advanced machinery to make, among other things, wire for radial tires. It is also part lesson and part cautionary tale: To do business in rural Mississippi, the Delta Wire Corporation first had to educate its work force. Often, that meant "1 plus 1 is 2," said George F. Walker, the company's founder and president.
"We had a great supply of human talent, but no education," Mr. Walker said, reminiscing about the company's beginning in 1978. "We had adults come here who literally could not write their name. And we had to say to them, 'Now you are going to learn to read a micrometer. And now you are going to learn how to do statistical process control on a computer.' I had to hold their hands. I had to hold my own hand. It was awesome."
Delta Wire is now winning awards from major tire manufacturers for the quality of its products.
 
Difficult Transition
 Though making the transition from school to work poses problems for young people from Los Angeles to Brooklyn, it is most difficult in places like the Mississippi Delta, a stretch of flood plain between the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers with there is little industry, low educational standards and entrenched poverty. Marshall Smith, an Under Secretary of Education, said preparing students for work is equally daunting in much of the South as well as in Appalachia and on Indian reservations across the country.
When President Clinton talks of education programs that address changing business needs, it is easy to conjure up images of high school students in lab coats concentrating on their computers screens as they develop into the skilled work force of the future. In some places -- like South Carolina, whose former Governor, Richard W. Riley, is now the Education Secretary -- those kinds of programs are already happening as a result of business initiatives, local school experiments and private financing.
But in the Mississippi Delta and other chronically depressed and traditionally agricultural areas, the transition from field to factories is extremely slow. Here, it is not the nuances of new technology that students need to learn, though they would also benefit from that, but reading, writing and arithmetic.
 
Congress Gets Involved
 The Federal Government is offering help. Legislation passed by Congress in January and supported by Education Secretary Riley and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich would provide about $300 million in seed money to help some states improve their math and science courses, cooperate with local businesses and help students learn the language and work skills they will need in a competitive economy. The legislation -- two separate bills from the House and Senate -- will soon go to a conference committee, where differences will be resolved.
Formal education has never been a big part of life in the Delta, where it was historically denied slaves and sharecroppers. Mississippi put such a low priority on education for so long that until Gov. William F. Winter threw his administration behind advances in the educational system in 1982, there was no mandatory attendance and no provision for kindergarten. Even now, high school graduates often read at a fourth-grade level and understand only rudimentary math, according to state education officials.
Those students who do excel often leave the region, draining it of talent, potential entrepreneurs and future teachers. The migration has also helped set in motion a cycle of despair for those who live in poverty in rural Mississippi, including 36 percent of the state's school-age children, most of whom are black. Only one state, Louisiana, ranks behind Mississippi in the rural poverty rate for children, according to a study released by the General Accounting Office last month.
Overcoming those problems will take time, money, energy and good will.
At the Shelby Die Casting Company, a few miles to the south in Shelby, the best intentions have run against wall after wall of frustration. In a search for new employees, the company gave 25 high school seniors an eighth-grade math and reading test last year. Only eight scored 86 percent or higher, said Lois B. McMurchy, the company's training coordinator.
"You cannot get literate people," she said. "Forget other skills."
Like Delta Wire, Shelby Die Casting tried to start a program to help workers gain minimum skills. It has had mixed results. The problems with the local schools are so intractable, Ms. McMurchy said, that the company is thinking of closing the plant in Shelby and expanding its operations in Fayette, Ala., where "a high school degree is a high school degree."
The chasm between the classroom and the working world made a passionate reformist of Governor Winter soon after he took office in 1980. That year he watched 900 potential jobs slip away when a Chicago-based electronics company halted plans to build in Mississippi. The Governor winced at the company's reason: the state did not have enough educated workers or good enough schools. Instead, the company opened its new branch in South Carolina, where Governor Riley had already embarked on educational changes.
In Mississippi over the last decade, a group of programs, initiatives and experiments has helped ease the transition from school to work.
Delta Wire's story is one with a happy ending: jobs that pay well. "People will stay in school if they see a light at the end of the tunnel," Mr. Walker said. His factory, for many, has been that light.
In some cases the starting point is in classrooms where teachers are taught how to teach. One state-backed program pays math teachers $45 a session to give up their Saturdays and attend crash courses on how to teach geometry, trigonometry and calculus. Each Saturday session covers two weeks of math courses, said W. Ray Cleere, the Commissioner of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. Though basic, the training is crucial, he says. "We're just not quite ready for the wonderful world of computers," he said.
Down the road, in Itta Bena, a program called Career Beginnings offers mentors, introductions to the local community colleges, some practical training and a pool of volunteers to urge students on.
Run by Robert Moore, the director of the Mississippi Valley State University's Center for Economic Development, it helps 90 students each year to stay in school and plan for the future. That is precious few students out of the general population, but Mr. Moore shrugs at the question of size and says: "That's what we can handle. We hardly have a budget. At least it is a start."
Though the program does not help teen-agers train for specific jobs, it has placed almost 90 percent of its participants in two- or four-year college programs and prepares them for the workplace in everything from attitude to options.
 
Leaving for a Better Life
 Carolyn Sell, a 21-year-old junior at Mississippi State, was one of Career Beginnings' first students. Though she had a child while in high school, her mentor encouraged her to keep up with her studies. Now, when she finishes college, she will be the first person in her family to do so. She plans to work in Chicago, Georgia or Texas. But her departure, she hopes, will at least lead to something better than her mother's job, cutting catfish strips for the minimum wage.
"No one answer is enough," Mr. Cleere said. "Some people just need encouragement. Others need remedial work. We've got to work at all levels. We can't just wait until the next first grade gets to high school."
That fact has been all too clear to Janice Goree, who has coordinated Career Beginnings programs throughout the state.
"The Clinton program seems to open the door for addressing a number of problems," Ms. Goree said. "But some of our problems are relatively basic. We have kids who have never seen an elevator before. They are just not ready to go on to a business environment."
Driving his car in the gathering dark of the Delta, C. Thompson Wacaster, looked ahead with a mix of frustration and hope. "Right now there's just an incredible mishmash of stuff out there," said Mr. Wacaster, vice president for educational programs and research at the Phil Hardin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that channels money into educational programs and research. "There are tens and tens of programs just in Mississippi. Some work. Some don't. But we all share a sense of urgency."
Slapping the steering wheel and pointing with pride at a landscape awash in a vermilion and lavender sunset, he said Mississippi no longer has a choice. "We have so far to go," he said. "Communities are dying. They are dying right before our very eyes."

HEADLINE: EASTERN UTILITIES IN UNUSUAL PACT: A SMOG TRADEOFF

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
In the first deal of its kind across state lines, a New Jersey utility will clean up its generating stations so boilers in Connecticut can emit more smog-producing chemicals.
The deal will bring a small reduction in pollution regionwide and probably will cut smog in New York and New Jersey, but that is not the main goal. 
 It will change where the pollutants are emitted and at what time of year, reducing the damage, and it will help companies meet the reductions required by the Clean Air Act of 1990 at the lowest possible cost, proponents say.
The Clean Air Act authorized what amounts to a free market in pollution. It encouraged businesses to reduce their emissions more than the law required by giving them the right to sell their surplus savings -- in effect, rights to pollute -- to companies that found it cheaper to buy the rights than to cut their emissions themselves.
 
Trades for Sulfur Dioxide
 Similar trades have been made with sulfur dioxide, the chemical that causes acid rain, drawing criticism from environmentalists. But trades in smog-producing nitrogen oxides are not expected to attract such criticisms, in part because the deals must be approved by environmental officials in the states where the extra pollutants will be emitted.
In fact, a New Jersey utility is able to sell pollution rights to a Connecticut company because Connecticut is downwind of it. Fewer emissions in New Jersey benefit both New Jersey and New York without creating more smog in Connecticut.
The New Jersey utility, Public Service Electric and Gas, said today that it would cut its emissions of nitrogen oxides during the next five years by 2,400 more tons than the law requires, probably by adjusting a coal-fired plant in Jersey City, among other steps.
Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, will buy the rights to emit 500 of those tons, and pass them along to customers, like small factories or hospitals that operate boilers, that would find it extremely costly to comply with the Clean Air Act.
Both utilities called the sale an experiment, intended to create a market in which the rights to emit hundreds of thousands of tons will be traded every year.
"It's a toe in the water, a kick at the tires," said Eric B. Svenson, manager of regulatory support at Public Service Electric and Gas, based in Newark. The purpose, he said, is to encourage other potential buyers and sellers to come forward, "to encourage people to make reductions where it is most cost-effective to do so."
Trading in pollution credits, which is favored by economists and some environmentalists, seeks to achieve emissions reductions at the minimum cost by allowing the cleanup to be made wherever it is cheapest.
For example, to reduce nitrogen oxides by one ton it might be cheaper to have a utility switch a generating station from coal to natural gas than to have a university install a scrubbing system on a small boiler used to provide steam heat on campus. The utility estimates it can create the reduction for $1,000 a ton, and the university can buy it, avoiding its own cost, which could be hundreds of dollars a ton higher.
An auto body shop, which might have to build a painting booth to control emissions from wet paint, might face a cost of $15,000 or $20,000 to cut a ton of smog-producing chemicals, experts said.
The price for pollution credits, advocates hope, will be determined by trading among hundreds of buyers and sellers.
 
A Pollution Broker
 In this case, the pollution credits will be bought by a broker, the Clean Air Action Corporation of Tulsa, Okla., at cost. Clean Air Action will sell them at market price. The allowances Northeast Utilities is buying will be priced at whatever the market price eventually turns out to be.
Ben G. Henneke, president of Clean Air Action, said his company would retire 10 percent of the credits, so total nitrogen oxide output would be 140 tons lower over five years. In addition, he said, Clean Air Action will pay Public Service Electric and Gas to create the allowances in summer, when smog is a problem. But buyers would use them all year long. So some pollution would be shifted into winter, when smog is not an issue.
Since smog drifts across state lines, some states can achieve clean air only if upwind neighbors clean up. Mr. Henneke said that the only way states like Connecticut and Massachusetts could meet the standards, without "invading New Jersey or Pennsylvania," would be to approve deals like this with upwind states.
 
Directional Correctness
 Unlike trading in the right to emit chemicals that cause acid rain, the nitrogen-oxide trades are supposed to be "directionally correct." That means that the sellers must generally be upwind of the buyers. The effect of the trades, then, is to have the pollutants emitted further downwind, with fewer people to be exposed to ozone before it blows out to sea.
Officials not directly involved in the trade praised it. Langdon Marsh, Acting Commissioner of Environmental Conservation in New York, said that if companies in Connecticut bought 500 tons from New Jersey, that was 500 tons that did not blow over New York. Pointing to the interstate nature of smog, he noted that one of the monitoring stations that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency uses to determine New York's compliance is in Stratford, Conn.
 
A Regional Market
 At the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an organization of top air pollution officials from New England, New York and New Jersey, Michael Bradley, the executive director, said, "It could be a catalyst to a regional market that would help quite substantially in reducing the ozone levels in the summertime."
Finding a way for the small companies to comply at low cost is essential, said William L. Stillinger, Northeast Utilities' director of technology and transmission planning, "if we're going to try to avoid businesses' shutting down and moving out of area."
The agreement in the announcement is simply a memorandum of understanding, partly because neither New Jersey nor Connecticut has completed writing the regulations under which such trades could take place.

HEADLINE: Employer-Paid Health Care Backed by House Panel, 6-5

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
President Clinton won a victory today as a Congressional subcommittee voted 6 to 5 to support his proposal to require all employers to help buy health insurance for their employees.
In the year's first vote on health care, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health defeated a Republican proposal to eliminate the mandate on employers from any comprehensive bill intended to guarantee health insurance for all Americans. 
 Today's action, the first vote on such legislation in the 103d Congress, was not decisive. At least four other committees will vote on similar legislation. At this stage, any health care bill is a work in progress, whose provisions may be dropped, replaced or amended later in the legislative process.
The health subcommittee is often described as somewhat more liberal than the full House or the Senate, so today's close vote suggests that the struggle over the employer mandate will continue.
 
Daggers Are Flying
 The employer mandate is a central element of President Clinton's health plan and of the alternative proposed by Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the subcommittee. Mr. Clinton and many other Democrats maintain that there is no feasible way to achieve universal coverage except by requiring employers to pay for most of the cost.
One Democrat, Representative Michael A. Andrews of Texas, joined the four Republicans on the subcommittee in opposing the employer mandate. The proposal to eliminate that part of the bill was offered by Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa, who said it was "a fundamental dividing line" between Democrats and Republicans. All six votes for the employer mandate were cast by Democrats.
Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said Mr. Grandy's proposal was "a dagger in the heart of the bill," because it would eliminate the means to achieve and pay for universal coverage.
But Representative Bill Thomas of California, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, retorted that the employer mandate was "a dagger at the heart of small business."
Moreover, Mr. Thomas asserted, "This is the mother of all entitlements, cradle-to-grave health insurance, paid for by business."
 
Threat of Veto
 Mr. Stark, a California Democrat, said President Clinton would veto the bill without an employer mandate. Mr. Stark, like Mr. Clinton, wants to require employers to pay at least 80 percent of health insurance premiums for workers. Under Mr. Stark's bill, as under the President's, all Americans would be entitled to a standard package of health benefits.
By identical votes of 6 to 5, the subcommittee today rejected several other Republican proposals. One, offered by Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, would have set a limit on tax breaks available to employers and employees who provide or receive health benefits exceeding those in the standard package.
Under current law, there is no limit on the tax deductions that employers may take for the cost of employee health benefits, and the insurance coverage is not counted as income for employees. Mr. McCrery would have limited such tax breaks to the amounts needed to pay for an average-cost insurance plan in a given region.
 
'Competitive Discipline'
 Mr. Andrews praised the proposal to limit tax breaks, saying it would "impose a new competitive discipline," forcing employers and employees to pay more attention to the costs and benefits of various insurance plans.
But Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, opposed the idea of a tax cap, saying it would increase taxes for "hundreds of thousands of middle-income families" who now have benefits that exceed the minimum under Mr. Stark's bill.
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said that aerospace workers in his district had given up pay raises to secure good health benefits. "Why should we force people to give up benefits that they fought for and that make up a good health care system?" he asked.
Many large employers now offer health benefits more generous than the minimum package described by Mr. Stark. He would require such employers to continue providing those additional benefits for at least five years.
By a vote of 6 to 5, the subcommittee rejected a Republican proposal to eliminate the five-year requirement.
 
Family Coverage
 Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican who wanted to eliminate the requirement, said: "This is an issue of equity among employers. Some employers have voluntarily provided generous health insurance for their workers. This would, in effect, penalize them for that."
But Mr. Stark said the five-year requirement was needed "to protect otherwise defenseless workers from employers who might see this bill as an opportunity to cut costs."
Mr. Stark's bill, as originally proposed, would have required employers to pay 80 percent of the premiums for their employees and the workers' children, but would not have required employers to contribute to the cost of coverage for spouses.
By a 6-to-4 vote, the subcommittee decided to require employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of "family coverage," including insurance for spouses if employees wanted it. Representative Gerald D. Kleczka, Democrat of Wisconsin, who offered this amendment, acknowledged that it would expand the employer mandate, making it more objectionable to Republicans and many small businesses.
Under Mr. Stark's original proposal, insurance coverage for a family might have been split in strange ways. A worker, for example, might get coverage through an employer, while the nonworking spouse would enroll in a new public program, to be known as Part C of Medicare.
Employers with more than 100 employees would generally have to offer private insurance under Mr. Stark's bill. Smaller companies could buy private coverage or could enroll employees in the new Medicare program.
Mr. McDermott, who favors a "single payer" program of national health insurance financed by the Government, offered an amendment that would let all Americans enroll in the proposed Part C of Medicare. Under his proposal, employers of any size could have bought coverage for their workers through the new Medicare program. The amendment failed on a tie vote, 5 to 5.
The bill being devised by the subcommittee is a mix of private and public health insurance. Mrs. Johnson said, "This mishmash is going to put the squeeze on businesses and industries that have got to grow" in a strong economy. "This plan will force some people in my district to go out of business," she predicted.
But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said, "There is no historical justification" for predicting such loss of jobs.
"When we pass legislation to expand the social safety net," he said, "it raises everyone's standard of living."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on New Talk Of a German Rate Cut Soon

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Widening speculation that Germany might cut interest rates this week pushed the dollar higher yesterday against the mark and other European currencies.
Some traders said the German central bank would reduce rates at its meeting tomorrow in an effort to stimulate the economy. 
 Others mentioned the possibility of a cut in the key discount rate, which is now at 5.25 percent. Others say that the other key rate, the Lombard rate governing overnight lending, now at 6.75 percent, is likelier to come down.
Lower German interest rates generally affect the dollar favorably, as traders sell lower-yielding, mark-based investments.
In late New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.6973 marks, from 1.6893 marks on Monday.
 
Statement by Kantor
 The dollar, however, slipped against the Japanese yen on a bleak American assessment of trade relations with Japan. The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, told a Congressional panel that economic ties with Japan were in "serious disrepair."
Currency dealers said the remark undermined hopes that the agreement last weekend to open the Tokyo-Nagoya cellular-telephone market to foreign makers would lead to an overall easing of trade tension.
"People listening to Kantor may have felt he was a little combative and that the trade war isn't quite over," said Andrew Gonzalez, a trader at the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
Before Mr. Kantor's statement, the dollar had reached an intraday high of 106.60 yen, spurred in part by the Federal Reserve Board's report that industrial output rose four-tenths of 1 percent in February, higher than expected. But in late trading, the dollar fell to 106.10 yen, from 106.16 yen on Monday.
Gold rose in New York after slipping in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange, the April gold contract gained 40 cents, to $387.60 an ounce.
The British pound slid to $1.4906 in New York, from $1.4970 on Monday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's quotes, included: 1.4440 Swiss francs, up from 1.4350, 5.7725 French francs, up from 5.7410; $1.3637 (Canadian), up from $1.3601, and 1,673 Italian lire, up from 1,671.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 15

 BODY:
Philip Morris, fighting off a number of stringent anti-smoking measures, was last year's biggest spender on efforts to lobby members of the New York State Legislature, followed by a state teachers' group and New York City, according to a report released today.
In all, 1,142 organizations, from private corporations to public authorities, paid a record $38.5 million last year for lobbying efforts to influence state legislation, an 11 percent increase over 1992, the annual report from the New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying said. 
 It was the 14th consecutive year of increased spending on lobbyists, who try to sway legislators in private meetings, mailings, dinners and receptions on behalf of clients. Groups spent a total of $22.1 million five years ago and only $5.7 million in 1978.
Philip Morris, which was not even among the top ten spenders in 1992, nearly tripled what it paid for lobbyists last year to a total of $623,637. The company hired seven private and two in-house lobbyists as the Legislature considered an increase in the cigarette excise tax and sweeping restrictions on smoking and tobacco advertising.
Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, Democrat of Manhattan and the Legislature's chief sponsor of anti-smoking legislation, said the company's effort had mixed results. He said it was influential in reducing a proposed increase in the excise tax, which is now 56 cents a pack, and helped knock off two contentious measures in an anti-smoking bill.
But he said that the bill, which now would impose restrictions on smoking in schools, passed the Assembly last Monday and that the state in general is considered to have some of the nation's toughest laws against smoking.
"This is a very sophisticated industry, probably with more on the line than any other industry we deal with," Mr. Grannis said. "They are clearly battling against all reasonable odds. But their profits are so great that they justify the expenditures of these large sums of money."
Karen Daragon, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said the lobbying efforts were to insure that the company's voice was heard in Albany.
"We've been doing what we have always been doing, which is supporting issues which are important to our 11,000 employees and numerous consumers throughout the state," she said. "Certainly every other major business in the state is doing the same thing."
 
Familiar Faces
 Aside from Philip Morris, the list of top 10 spenders on lobbyists was virtually the same as last year. The second-highest spender was the New York State United Teachers, which spent $586,352 last year and was at the top of the list for 1992. The City of New York, which runs its own lobbying office in Albany, kept its spot as the third-highest spender, at $457,410.
The vast majority of the money spent on lobbyists represented the salaries of the state's 1,832 registered lobbyists and the cost of courting legislators in receptions, so-called "lobbying days," in the Capitol and at dinners and lunches.
Milton Mollen, the lobbying commission's chairman and a former New York City Deputy Mayor, said the amount of lobbying money in the report represented only about half of the total actually spent on lobbyists. Now lobbyists are only required to report efforts to influence pending legislation and rate-setting.
Not included, Mr. Mollen said, are lobbyists' efforts to encourage a legislator to introduce a bill -- or to prevent its introduction -- or when an organization seeks a state contract. The commission is seeking seven changes to expand the definition of lobbying and to increase the commission's reach. Four of the proposals are included in Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's package of proposed bills this year.
Besides their lobbying efforts, of course, many interest groups also spend thousands of dollars for campaign contributions to legislators.
Though Mr. Mollen speculated that the recession has in part driven the rise in reliance on lobbyists, Robert Malito, a lobbyist with Davidoff & Malito, said the issue is the increasing complexity of governmental regulations.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Turning Plowshares Into Swords

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The press to develop an electric car has become a holy quest for environmentalists, who seek an antidote for smog, traffic noise and the nation's reliance on oil. But lately, this peacenik technology has found an unlikely patron: the Pentagon, which sees battlefield uses for electric-vehicle systems.
Although some environmentalists express misgivings about the Pentagon's patronage, in the last few months the military has been dispensing money to various civilian electric-car ventures, including a Georgia company at work on a computer-controlled battery charger; a Connecticut maker of fuel cells, and a Massachusetts company that has been converting gasoline cars to battery power and now wants to design an electric vehicle. 
 Where environmentalists see opportunities for quiet traffic and clean air, military strategists see the makings of scout vehicles that slip almost silently over enemy terrain and armored personnel carriers that have no exhaust pipes and so cannot be spotted by infrared detectors.
"At night, they can't see you, they can't hear you, they don't know you're there," said Maj. Richard C. Cope, a marine who is leading the military's charge into electric-vehicle research.
Major Cope is a project manager for the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA. (During the cold war it was called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, widely known as Darpa.) Without fanfare ARPA has become one of the main sources of money for various technological pieces of the electric car, including electrochemical batteries; batteries powered by spinning flywheels; new types of charging systems; electronic controllers, and various other components.
From the beginning of 1993 to the end of 1995 ARPA expects to spend $68 million, with private industry adding more, for research into electric and hybrid vehicles.
This technology transfer can make for strange partners. Environmentalists tend to be "the same people who in the 1960's were protesting a war," said Sheila Lynch, who heads the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium. But in peacetime, she said, if a big civilian project needs Government help, there are advantages to working with the military.
"No one can expedite a project faster than the Defense Department," she said, "because they have a battle attitude."
The warriors return the compliment. In many areas, Major Cope said, "the commercial guys are so far ahead of us" that he said he was happy to let private industry concentrate on components for the electric car-pool crowd.
"We can take the same motors, the same controllers, and put them in a Humvee," Major Cope said, using the military abbreviation for the "high-mobility multipurpose vehicle" that has replaced the jeep.
 
Quiet Military Patrons
 Little wonder, then, that the military has quietly become the main research patron for dozens of small civilian projects in important electric-vehicle technologies.
For example, $300,000 from ARPA helped Electronic Power Technology of Norcross, Ga., develop a computer-controlled battery charger. Last month at the Atlanta Motor Speedway, the battery charger helped set a world record for distance traveled by an electric vehicle in 24 hours. While the company hopes its charger will lead to electric "filling stations" for battery-powered cars, the Pentagon is thinking about electric fueling depots for a future Desert Storm.
Even as the spinoff of military technology into civilian products seems to be going the way of the fallout shelter, a pronounced trend has developed in the opposite direction -- from civilian workshop to military lab -- and it already has a name.
 
Process Is Called 'Spin-On'
 "They call it 'spin-on,' " said one Government scientist, Dr. Roger W. Werne of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, long a leading weapons laboratory that is now lining up joint, nonmilitary projects with private industry.
Meanwhile, the Army's Construction Engineering Research Laboratory in Champaign, Ill., is spending $18 million for a dozen fuel cells from the ONSI Corporation of South Windsor, Conn. The devices combine hydrogen and oxygen to make electricity, with water as a byproduct.
The Pentagon is installing one at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to provide electricity for instruments that track missiles. Base commanders see fuel cells as one way to help comply with California's increasingly strict air-quality laws. Quiet and reliable, such cells could also provide electrical power for remote bases. On the civilian side, such fuel cells are being used for experimental pollution-free buses.
ARPA sponsors six regional consortiums, including the one headed by Ms. Lynch, that are made up of equipment manufacturers, electric utilities, government agencies and other groups interested in electric cars. Financing through these consortiums has made possible projects like the electric car.
Solectria Inc. of Wilmington, Mass., is at work on such a design, which may cost $1.3 million. ARPA is paying half. In such cases, funding that amounts to crumbs by military standards is whole loaves for struggling civilian enterprises.
Some environmentalists are wary, even if resigned to the trend. "It troubles me that any of our resources should be used for the purposes of preparing widespread destruction," said Barry Commoner, the director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems, at Queens College, part of the City University of New York. But if scientists and engineers avoided any work that had military uses, he said, "that would stop you from working on almost anything."
The military, in turn, sees little strategic danger of a battery-powered truck's falling into the wrong hands.
"Thinking of how potential adversaries of United States would be able to use this stuff militarily against us, the world has changed," said Lennie Siegel, director of the Pacific Studies Center, a public interest information center in Mountain View, Calif. "There is no one, who if you gave them a few key secrets, would become an adversary of the United States."
Indeed, there are important electric technologies that the military would love to see American private industry develop before anyone else in the world. Major Cope of ARPA cited energy storage, which could be mechanical, as in a flywheel, or electrochemical, as in a battery. The armed forces -- which in the past helped create photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity -- are interested in power-storage devices that might have scores of uses, including the operation of communications equipment in remote areas.
 
Power Flow a Goal
 Another goal is better and cheaper electronic components that can control the flow of power, permitting rapid start-up and shutdown.
Military scientists also expect better electrical storage and control to allow development of exotic weapons -- like magnetic shields that could be briefly switched on to bend the course of incoming rounds, deflecting them from their targets.
Or brief bursts of large amounts of power might be used to fire rounds from a gun at speeds of up to 7 kilometers a second, instead of the 1.5 kilometers a second that a conventional gun achieves, Major Cope said.
Another Federal source of money for civilian research and development is the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, but its budget of less than $200 million this year is not even half what ARPA receives.
The military agenda worries some environmentalists, like Richard E. Sclove, a technology policy specialist at the Loka Institute, an association of scholars and environmental activists in Amherst, Mass. "Why not go directly for the civilian technologies you want," he said, "when everyone is hoping for peace dividends, when there is some prospect of global demilitarization?"
Gregory A. Bischak, executive director of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, a nonprofit group in Washington, contends that channeling funds through the Pentagon can give civilian research and development a military bias.
"Every year the National Science Foundation has a long list of eligible and eminently qualified projects that are not funded, or underfunded," he said, as does the National Institutes of Health. But because they have no obvious potential military benefit, he said, they are not financed.
But most advocates of electric cars are happy to have the money, whatever the source and the motives.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
A Meeting Fit for Detroit's Contrasts

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15 Alas, Motor City.

 BODY:
Detroit has never been known as the Paris of the Midwest. Even at the best of times it was more of a monument to the oily, smoke-belching, spark-flying spirit of American competition than a natural home to the cultural subtleties of opera, architecture and fine art or a natural host to the worldly and elite. Hard hit now by streamlining in the automobile industry, by high crime and unemployment, it struggled to put its best face forward this week as host to the two-day jobs conference of the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
 "Ah, yes," sighed a visiting Frenchman late Sunday. "Detroit. I like it. Wonderful architecture. All this glass. But then," he shrugged and gave what the French call a moue, a slight pursing of the lips coupled with a disconsolate shrug of the shoulders, "the rest, it's like Pakistan."
While doing a radio interview this morning from his room on the 67th floor of the immense glass mountain that is the Renaissance Center, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich answered the question -- Why Detroit? -- with a wave of his hand toward the gray, still-icy Detroit River and the gray, gutted reaches of the once prosperous city just beyond.
Detroit, he said, was a fitting host to the Group of Seven conference, because it epitomizes the problems being discussed.
Several hours later, James Desler, an assistant to Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, chatted with Mr. Reich's press liaison, Mary Meagher. "You know," he said, stretching his arms lazily and gazing out across the river toward a low gray skyline on the far bank, "Detroit is actually quite pretty in the sunshine."
"Jim," corrected Ms. Meagher. "You are looking at Windsor. That's Canada."
Even the city's public relations materials could not completely avoid hinting of Detroit's problems. A brochure suggesting investment in the city has photographs taken in dim light and it hawks, among other attributes, a system set up to inventory vacant land and buildings, of which there is an unwelcome surplus.
On Monday, as visiting foreign ministers were chauffeured from the Fox Theater, where President Clinton gave his opening address, to Cobo Hall, where the conference ended this afternoon, they rolled, sirens blaring, down streets swept clean for their visit but filled with boarded-up storefronts and closed businesses with steel grates over the windows.
A delegate from Germany complained that when he went to look for a small gift for his wife he found the downtown weirdly empty and the Renaissance Center filled with Burger Kings and Taco Bells but few stores he cared to wander into.

 
 
High Tech Awes and Irritates
 Backstage, among the dozens of government workers who helped pull the conference together, there were several mild complaints. "Talk about a productivity conference," one man said. "Well, the computers they set up here all have Minesweeper and Solitaire on them. So here's this conference about increasing productivity, and the volunteers and staff are playing computer games."
He added that there had been such a proliferation of cellular telephones and walkie-talkies that "we have people standing around talking to each other on the phone who are, like, 20 feet away from each other."
"I think it's the information highway on overload, the information autobahn," he continued.
Another government worker used a quiet moment to send a fax to California to inquire about a conference scheduled for later this month. Within seconds, a response slid into the incoming basket.
"Wow!" she said. "This is incredible! If only the government could work like this."
Asked to elaborate, she gasped and said: "No, no, no, no. I'm a government worker. They'll fire me. But look, I mean this is really something. It's just what everyone has been saying, that the private sector is lean and mean. It's competitive. That's what we need. But the government, I can't imagine it. Oh, God. Don't quote me."

 
 
No Bonanza for Cab Drivers

At the ersatz public park set up inside Cobo Hall, where the trees were as plastic as the kites lodged coyly in their branches, police officers, government staff members and the members of the news media mingled all day over hot dogs, barbecue beef, bagels, egg sandwiches, baked beans, macaroni and half a dozen other classics of American cuisine. But the fake hot dogs used in one display were made in Italy. And the water served was Swedish. "Hmm. Not so good for a city trying to get back to 'Made in America,' " said Eric Andrus, a staff member of the United States Information Agency who helped coordinate news media arrangements.
Outside, where the trees were real and the sirens blared as ministers and secretaries moved around, taxi drivers groused that the jobs conference was making their lives more difficult.
On Thursday, Mayor Dennis W. Archer called the city's taxi drivers to a meeting in Cobo Hall. "He asked us to sell the city," said Gary McJennett, a 27-year-old driver who said he was banned from selling ice cream during the Pope's visit several years ago and has now been been forced from his usual taxi stand.
"Thursday afternoon they get us all together and tell us to really help out," he said. "Then they sold us out. I was at my place and some cop comes up and says, 'Get these blanking cabs out of here and don't come back until the G-7 is gone.' So, great. I can go up and down Woodward and pick up people going to the crack houses. But I'd rather make my money taking people back and forth to the airport."

 
 
Scenery Almost Steals Show
 Even the conference highlight had its distractions. When President Clinton made his welcoming address, he stood in a floodlight, center stage, in the 5,000-seat Fox Theater. Built in 1927 and refurbished by the owners of the Little Caesars pizza chain in 1988, it is, depending upon one's perspective, either a monument to the city's past glory or an homage to monumentally bad taste.
Usually home to music concerts, rock revivals and theatrical extravaganzas, the theater made a stunning, quite distracting, backdrop to the President's remarks. While Mr. Clinton spoke of jobs, international finance and changing economies, many an eye wandered across the gilt decorations crowding the walls and ceilings. Kitsch in the way that only America can be kitsch, gold and red and brilliant, even in the half light from the stage, the walls flaunted a wild gathering of lions, tigers, birds, cherubs and bare-breasted Shivas, who couldn't quite handle the lotus position and so crossed their feet rather awkwardly at the ankles.
High above the President, a huge elephant's head, gold with ivory tusks and a huge rhinestone-studded crown, kept a careful watch.
As the speech ended, a nattily dressed British representative headed out. Asked his opinion of the hall, he nodded and nodded and then gave that most British of responses: "Mmmmmmm. Yes. The theater."
Then he was gone, a figure vanishing in Motor City.

HEADLINE: Accent Is on Education as Global Jobs Talks End

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15

 BODY:
Government officials from the United States and other leading industrial nations agreed today that the only way to create more good jobs in the face of rapid technological change was to upgrade education, particularly for those who are least skilled.
The final statement, read by Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury, at the close of the two-day international jobs seminar stressed this, along with more familiar themes, such as the importance of not adopting protectionist policies to guard shrinking job markets and of stimulating economies to insure growth. 
 The conference here was attended by finance, labor and economics ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, Britain and the United States.
But the newest theme, and the one that was highlighted in the final statement, was how to get new jobs and preserve existing ones at a time when technology is making some jobs obsolete as quickly as it is producing new ones. Unless that issue is dealt with, many ministers said, workers in their countries will increasingly see technological innovation as an enemy and not a friend.
There was a consensus among the officials here that the rapid changes in technology, from robotics to the information highway, were revolutionizing the workplace to a degree most of them had not quite caught up with in their government programs. The result, particularly in Europe and the United States, has been a widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers, with more and more of the unskilled being out of work or poorly paid because of their low education levels.
While economists have remarked on this phenomenon for some time, the conference was the first time it was addressed as a global problem by Group of Seven policy makers.
Why is this problem more critical now than before? The ministers contended that the pace of technological change and the rate at which it was affecting the workplace had speeded up, with more educated workers benefiting, while more routine workers are being displaced.
For instance, a new set of computer-operated machine tools creates jobs for those with the appropriate education, like highly skilled engineers, designers and operators. But it may remove jobs for those trained to do only the manual, assembly-line work that can now be performed by those machines.
The same is true for advances in word processing, which have made routine typing and secretarial jobs less in demand, but have increased the demand for those who know how both to type and to operate specialized software.
 
'Lifelong Learning'
 "The cycles of innovation become shorter and shorter," said Norbert Blum, Germany's Minister of Labor and Social Affairs. "Therefore, we have lifelong learning. I think it is a false belief that well-trained and qualified people are not endangered by unemployment. In all our jobs we have to be very flexible, and we should be ready to retrain at any time. Retraining is the duty of management."
Indeed, if there was one thing that all the ministers here agreed upon, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, it was that the only way out of this predicament was improved education for all sectors of the population, so that the skill gap and the wage gap between the most educated segments of the population and the least educated would be narrowed.
She and Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said educational needs would be taken into account by the Clinton Administration as it devised its programs to aid people in moving from welfare to work, from one job to another and from school to work. Both of them also stressed the critical importance of getting the private sector in the United States to invest more in education, as the Germans and Japanese have done.
 
A Call for Changes
 "The income of the unskilled is falling in absolute and relative terms," Ms. Tyson said, "and that suggests that the only long-term solution, given the technological changes, is targeting programs on the unskilled, and revamping education and training with regard to the unskilled."
American officials said there were things to emulate in the German system, which features apprenticeship programs and the placing of young people from high school into skilled jobs.
The only Group of Seven country that has managed to balance higher education, advancing technology, improved productivity and low unemployment is Japan, American officials said. But even the spokesman for Japan's delegation, Seiichi Kondo, said that Japan, which has a long tradition of lifetime employment and a private industry that invests more than any other in education, was beginning to worry about how long it could keep its aging work force fully employed. The system that worked in the past "may not necessarily be the vehicle" for the future, Mr. Kondo said.
 
Some Crucial Differences

 
 In Japan, most college and high school graduates seem to leave school with skills that are complementary to the demands of a highly technologically advanced marketplace, American officials say. In the United States, only those with university degrees, or some specialized extra training beyond high school, acquire such skills, while those with just a high school degree or less do not.
Europe has the same gap, only its less-skilled workers are generally less willing to accept the lower-paying jobs that their American counterparts often do. In part, this is because Western Europe offers generous unemployment benefits. Therefore, outside of Germany, at the unskilled level, the Europeans have a big problem of unemployment, and not just a problem of low wages.
A paper delivered to the conference by the French Government noted, for example, that in France, "the mismatch between labor supply and demand is especially acute for unskilled workers."
The French paper added, "The solution to this problem implies a stronger link between the training system and the business sector," including "targeting 100 percent of the young people leaving school with professional training."

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks 2d Tax Cut, Aimed at Middle Class

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 15

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman produced her first state budget tonight with the promise of an additional tax cut aimed at the middle class. She proposed to wipe out several state agencies to help pay for it and appealed over the heads of the State Legislature for New Jerseyans to keep up the pressure for smaller government and lower taxes at all levels.
Her $15.4 billion budget, which is for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, was only precariously in balance with the help of an $800 million one-time source of savings. Governor Whitman said she would pay for $589 million in income tax cuts over 18 months by eliminating the Department of Higher Education and turning state campuses free to govern themselves. She called for closing the Office of Public Advocate and folding its public-defender functions into the Department of State, and for ending state ownership, and funds for, New Jersey's public television network. 
 "Not everyone will be happy with this budget," the Governor declared in a speech to the Legislature this evening. "You will hear complaints about particular cuts, questions about why I kept my promise to cut taxes. But tax cut or not tax cut, we would have to cut spending this year."
 
Minimizing the Pain
 The Governor has sought to minimize the pain by taking nibbles from each state division's budget instead of bites. Besides saving $7.38 million by eliminating the Department of Higher Education and laying off the state's $100,225-a-year Chancellor by July 1, the proposed budget would trim support for higher education by $11.5 million, or 1.7 percent, and require a 3.5 percent tuition increase, the smallest such increase, she said, in 10 years.
The state's subsidy to New Jersey Transit, the state-operated bus and rail commuter system, would be cut by $7 million, to $241 million, but would not require a corresponding fare increase under the proposed budget.
Elsewhere in the spending plan the Governor proposed savings as diverse as reducing street lighting on rural roads,, cutting state grants to New Jersey's private universities by 25 percent and closing 7 of the state's 39 armories.
"The Russians are not coming, except hopefully as tourists," she joked to laughter and applause in the well of the Assembly, where the Republican-dominated Legislature and a tumultuous crowd of supporters listened.
The Governor's proposed income tax cut for New Jersey's 3.6 million taxpayers, effective next Jan. 1, would provide a 10 percent rate reduction for up to $80,000 in annual earnings for joint filers, a 2.5 percent reduction for income between $80,000 and $150,000, and a one percent cut for incomes above that level.
For a family earning $50,000, the tax cut proposed this evening would produce a tax savings of $103 on top of the $51 a year provided by the 5 percent cut enacted on March 7. For a single filer earning $50,000, the new reduction would translate into a saving of $208.
The single filer's savings are greater than for a couple earning the same income because of the progressive nature of the tax code and because single payers tend to have fewer deductions than married couples.
Governor Whitman declared to loud applause that she would hold to her promise to seek an additional tax cut in next year's budget.
Tonight's speech and its accompanying spending plans are the culmination of a strategy adopted by Mrs. Whitman when she sought to energize her flagging Republican campaign for governor with a promise to cut state income taxes by 30 percent over her first three years in office. Derided at first, the tax cut pledge caught hold with voters in the closing weeks of the campaign and gave Mrs. Whitman a come-from-behind victory over Jim Florio, the Democratic incumbent.
This evening her speech was embellished with high notes of personal triumph: "I kept my promise," she said of her tax cut pledge. "I did it," she said of a plan reduce her State House staff.
The reaction has been jubilant from the Assembly's Republican majority, where tax-cut sentiment is running high.
In the Republican-controlled Senate, considered more liberal than the Assembly, the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, praised the Governor's budget but emphasized that since the Senate is the budget-writing house, it will be up to it to conduct "careful reviews of the proposed budget."
Predictably, some of the state's traditional power centers were dismayed. The state teachers union, whose animosity to Mr. Florio helped defeat him, has already vowed to fight Mrs. Whitman's plan to change pension and health care financing plans and eliminate a 2 percent subsidy to public employee pensions.
State employee unions are already angry about proposed layoffs of 600 workers, a measure that Mrs. Whitman, during the campaign, had said she would seek to avoid.
 
'The Bottom Line'
 "Governor Whitman will probably win some praise from people on Main Street tonight," said Joseph V. Dorio, the Assembly's Democratic minority leader, "but the litany of speculative fiscal maneuvers in her budget may jeopardize New Jersey's standing in the month's to come. The bottom line on this budget shows a reduction in state aid to municipalities and schools while spreading the use of dubious one-shot budget gimmicks to the local government level."
Yet Mrs. Whitman is confident that she is part of a national movement of Republican governors who have seized on public frustration with rising taxes and unresponsive government have acted to drive state costs and bureaucracies to lower levels.
Tonight she spoke of New Jersey and its 7.7 million inhabitants as if it were a mini-nation responding to Ronald Reagan's supply-side stimulus. "The more money you have to spend," she said, addressing those watching her on television, "the more the economy will grow. You elected me to cut taxes and government spending in order to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. That's exactly what my tax cuts will do."
Yet she called for some spending increases that, she said, would produce savings later. These initiatives include a boot-camp program for first-time offenders, a privatized drug treatment center attached to the Hudson County Jail. Prisoners with drug habits would have to pass the treatment regimen before being released on parole, she said.
She also asked for more money to promote tourism and she proposed sharply increased spending for the Office of State Planning, which manages growth and development.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rose Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Inflation remained subdued in February despite a surge in energy costs that drove the Producer Price Index up by five-tenths of 1 percent, the most since last spring, Government figures showed today.
Not counting energy, which has since declined, prices received by producers of finished goods were unchanged for the month and up less than 1 percent over the last year. 
 Separately, the Federal Reserve reported that severe weather inflicted less of a setback to industrial production than had been assumed, as output from the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
 
Busy Auto Sector
 The automotive sector was especially busy as factories turned out cars and light trucks at a sizzling annual pace of 13.6 million, a rate that exceeded plants' formal capacity.
"The economy struggled through the bad weather better than most people thought," Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, said. Automobile output, he added, "basically maxed out," even surpassing a very strong pace of sales.
Still, the robust economy exhibited few signs of inflation; today's price report was regarded as unlikely to significantly accelerate the Fed's efforts to head off inflation pressures by raising interest rates. Bond traders greeted the price report warmly, and interest rates fell sharply. [Page D18.]

 
 
An Unsettling Note
 The main unsettling note was a jump of 2 percent in the price of raw materials other than food and energy, the fifth consecutive month of sizable increases in these "core" crude goods.
So far, higher prices for materials like iron and steel scrap have not been transmitted to later stages of production and thus constitute only a red flag, not an alarm siren, according to Donald E. Maude, an economist for Scotia McLeod in New York.
The five-tenths of 1 percent overall rise in the Producer Price Index's finished goods index, which matched that of last April, was only slightly more than had been expected and was combined with a significant slackening -- to a rise of just one-tenth of 1 percent -- when the erratic food and energy components were excluded.
Energy, which accounts for about 13 percent of the index, surged 2.8 percent last month, the Labor Department's report showed. The price of home heating oil soared 23.5 percent after falling slightly in January, and gasoline rose more than 6 percent for the second straight month. Residential gas rose 1.2 percent following a small January decline.
 
 
Food Prices Ease
 Food prices eased four-tenths of 1 percent, mainly the result of a 25 percent slide for fresh and dry vegetables.
Goods at the intermediate stage of production moved up four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the most since February 1993. But this also was mainly the result of energy, including an 18.1 percent surge for diesel fuel.
Once again, durable goods used in manufacturing, like hot rolled steel bars, gained in price, while nondurables like organic chemicals eased. Durables were up four-tenths of 1 percent, twice the January increase, while nondurables fell two-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month.
The price of construction materials eased two-tenths of 1 percent as what appeared to be weather-related declines for softwood lumber, plywood, millwork and plastics more than offset sharp increases for nonferrous wire and cable and for gypsum products.
The index of crude prices fell 1.3 percent last month because of a broad-based drop for energy materials that was in sharp contrast to higher energy prices at the intermediate and finished stages of production, the report also showed. Prices rose for iron and steel scrap, wastepaper, aluminum base scrap, copper ores, raw cotton and leaf tobacco while lower prices were recorded for cattle hides and pulpwood logs.
 
 
Industrial Production
 The report on industrial production, which covers nearly one-third of the economy, showed a ninth consecutive monthly advance that came as a surprise to many analysts. Expectations had dimmed when the Government reported on March 4 that the average factory workweek had been chopped by 42 minutes last month, an extraordinarily big change.
But as it turned out, factory output climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month, to 5.4 percent above the comparable month a year earlier. Production of durable goods, paced by cars, trucks, computers and related parts, jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent while output of nondurables moved up two-tenths of 1 percent.
Output from coal mines and oil and gas wells advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent, but utility production fell 1.3 percent following a 3.6 percent January burst.
American industry operated plants at 83.4 percent of capacity last month, up only slightly from the 83.3 percent to which January was revised but three-tenths of a point higher than the 83.1 percent rate initially reported for that month.
American plants making cars and light trucks ran at 100.2 percent of rated capacity last month, up from 92.6 percent in January and probably the fastest pace since this statistical series was started in 1977.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip as Market Ignores Inflation Report

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In a departure from recent trading sessions, the stock market closed mixed when the bond market went up yesterday. It is a parting of the ways that may be repeated today, when the Consumer Price Index, the best known gauge of inflation, is released.
The markets were perhaps of two minds about inflation. Before the stock market opened, the Producer Price Index for February was released, and its favorable news on inflation should have cheered both the stock and bond markets. 
 But after first rallying, all the main stock indexes fell sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss, while the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes were basically unchanged.
 "This is just a nervous market that is unable to accept good inflation numbers at face value," said Alan R. Ackerman, a market strategist for Reich & Company. "Candidly, this is a good time to protect principal," and sell stocks, he said, "because the market is so nervous."
That the stock market did not follow the bond market was possibly a result of technical factors. Traders said that since some stock options expire on Friday, investors might have wanted to exercise them before the deadline, the triple-witching hour, when three sets of options and futures contracts simultaneously expire.
Also, computer-driven trading appeared to have speeded up a sharp price drop that began around 1:45 P.M.
But Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen & Company, cast doubt on those explanations, saying that witching hours have have had little effect on the market in recent years. "Options accelerate trends, but they do not create them," he said.
The Dow industrials dropped 13.39 points, to 3,849.59, and the broader S.& P. 500 fell 0.38 point, to 467.01. The Nasdaq index rose 0.72 point, to 793.52. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.02 point, to 258.99, on relatively heavy volume of 329.3 million shares. Advancing stocks led decliners, 1,138 to 1,000. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.07 point, to 468.13.
But bond prices rose and stayed up, restraining for a second day the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which brushed perilously close to 7 percent on Friday.
 
 
Good News on Core Rate
 At first, the bond market's reaction to the Labor Department's report on producer prices was puzzling because it was not immediately apparent that the news was good. The Producer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent, more than Wall Street economists' expectations of four-tenths of 1 percent. But the core rate -- stripped of food and energy prices -- was up just one-tenth of 1 percent, or half that of expectations. Rising inflation reduces the value of fixed-income securities.
Four stocks dragged down the Dow industrials more than 12 points. They were: United Technologies, down 1 3/4, to 68; General Motors, down 1 1/4, to 61 1/2; McDonald's, down 1 1/4, to 60 1/2, and Boeing, down 1 1/8, to 46 3/4. Some investors might have been concerned about the possibility of a continued costly strike at two G.M. brake-parts plants.
Perrigo, a maker of generic cough and cold medicines sold under store brand names, was the most actively traded stock yesterday at 10 million shares. Retailers have cut back orders for its products, and shares of Perrigo fell 5, to 22 3/8.
The second-most-active stock was Catellus Development, a property developer and asset manager based in San Francisco. Its shares fell 3/8, to 7 1/4. Last week, the company announced a fourth-quarter loss of $13.2 million, quadruple its $3.44 million loss a year earlier.

Interest Rates DeclineOn New Inflation Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates fell sharply yesterday, as traders and investors greeted this week's first inflation report warmly. But the rebound in the market was only enough to offset Monday's sharp losses.
The positive tone in the market was established early in the session, following the Labor Department's release of February's Producer Price Index. The index showed an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent over all and one-tenth of 1 percent when food and energy were excluded. While slightly higher than analysts had expected, the index painted a fairly benign inflation picture. 
 Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates, also received a lift from the Federal Reserve, when the central bank said yesterday morning that it was going to buy Treasury notes and bonds maturing on and after October 1994 to add cash to the banking system. The Fed action was intended to address a seasonal shortage of reserves that if left unanswered could cause short-term rates to move higher than current Fed policy warrants.
 
 
'Coupon Pass'
 The process is called a "coupon pass" and is something the Fed does a few times a year. The announcement itself did not surprise the bond market, since economists had been expecting the move for some time. Traders said the "coupon pass" also presented dealers with an opportunity to sell Treasury securities that had been piling up in inventory since a Feb. interest rate increase by the Fed.
However, when the Fed informed the dealers how much it would purchase, the dealers were disappointed by what they considered a lack of aggressive buying by the Fed. Bond prices as a result moved down off their highs of the day.
Near the close of the New York cash market, the 30-year bond was up 22/32 of a percentage point, to 921/32 for a yield of 6.89 percent, down from Monday's close of 6.95 percent. Intermediate and short-term maturities also enjoyed a rebound from Monday's selloff: the yield on a 3-year note fell to 5.33 percent from 5.36 percent, and the yield on a 10-year note fell to 6.44 percent from 6.51 percent.
 
 
'Where We Thought'
 Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said yesterday that "the February Producer Price Index for finished goods was basically pretty much where we thought it would be."
While the overall index was a little stronger than expected, the core was a little smaller than expectations and analysts said that was what the market responded to.
"I could never understand why so much is made of the core number, which excludes food and energy, major parts of the price indices," Mr. Fine said. In the Producer Price Index, food and energy account for 35 percent of the index; in the Consumer Price Index, they account for 25 percent.
"Petroleum, for example, an energy component, is also ingrained in other areas of the economy and not counted as energy," Mr. Fine continued. "But I suppose if you want to starve in a dark room and not travel, than maybe inflation excluding food and energy is acceptable."
Even as bond prices held on to modest gains across the curve, the upward momentum began to fizzle in the afternoon, as investors began to look toward the release today of the latest Consumer Price Index. Analysts at MMS International, a Wall Street research firm, said in a report that "some short positions were shaken out by the better-than-expected 0.1 percent core, as well as by the anticipation of the Fed's coupon pass."
 
 
Additional Data
 Other data released yesterday included the February industrial production and capacity utilization figures. Economists in a Reuters survey had expected the numbers to be unchanged for production and at 83 percent for capacity use. The Federal Reserve Board reported that February industrial production rose four-tenths of 1 percent and capacity use rose to 83.4 percent, its highest since 83.9 percent in June 1989.
Traders said the report temporarily caused prices of Treasury securities to sag slightly. According to some economists, the output and capacity use data showed manufacturing activity remained strong. MMS International analysts said it reinforced elements in the Atlanta Federal Reserve's regional index on Monday and the National Association of Purchasing Management index last month, both of which showed manufacturing activity picking up.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gasoline Prices Up Sharply; Data Show Dip in Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gasoline futures rallied sharply yesterday as traders correctly bet that petroleum industry data would show a reduction in supplies.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.23 cents, to 46.11 cents a gallon. Other energy contracts also gained, with light crude for April delivery settling 34 cents higher at $14.83 a barrel; April home heating oil rising 1.27 cents, to 44.63 cents a gallon, and April natural gas rising 0.54 cent, to $2.104 for 1,000 cubic feet. 
 Investors in energy futures were speculating that the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory data, released after trading ended, would show that gasoline stockpiles were dwindling.
The report showed gasoline stocks had dropped 95,000 barrels in the latest week, with crude stocks slipping 5.284 million barrels.
The reduction could mean higher prices, particularly with the current high demand and with oil supplies backed up on an important trade route through the Bosporus in Turkey, said Tom Bentz, director of the energy division for Quantum Financial Services in New York.
About 100 ships stood at anchor yesterday because the Bosporus remained closed as an oil tanker continued to burn after a weekend collision with a freighter.
Investors also predicted that the stronger American economy would lead to increased seasonal demand for gasoline.
"We've seen outstanding demand this year for refined products, and all indications are that it will continue through another six months and well past that," said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover Inc. in Bronxville, N.Y.
On other commodity markets, corn and soybeans futures prices ended mostly lower after a relatively quiet trading session. Wheat futures prices advanced.
Wheat for delivery in March settled 1 cent lower, to $3.3175 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade. March corn fell 3 cents, to $2.7725 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at $1.26 a bushel, and March soybeans were 1.5 cents lower at $6.865 a bushel.
Wheat futures gained on National Weather Service forecasts of normal-to-dry conditions in winter wheat growing areas, which are already dry. The losses in corn and soybeans futures were attributed mostly to technical movements after Monday's strong gains.
A report released after the trading session Monday showed lower-than-expected weekly soybean export shipments, and the weather service predicted normal to below-normal rain in the Midwest, which could allow a smooth start to planting of the new crop.
Prices of both corn and soybeans continue to be underpinned by tight stocks after last year's Midwest flooding.

HEADLINE: New Injury Pattern Linked to Air Bags

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
AIR bags and automatic seat-belt systems, while undoubtedly saving lives, are also transforming the kinds of injuries that people get in serious traffic accidents, emergency room physicians and Federal researchers say.
Crash victims in cars equipped with such devices tend to suffer crushed ankles, shattered legs and other trauma to their lower extremities, said Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein, a trauma surgeon who is the director of the Department of Transportation's crash study at the Ryder Trauma Center of Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Fla. They may also suffer internal injuries that would probably not be noticed at the scene of an accident, Dr. Augenstein added. 
 While such injuries may cause lifelong disabilities, he said, the victims would almost certainly have died were it not for the new safety devices.
 
Questions Remain
 There is no doubt that air bags are saving lives in front-end collisions, said George Parker, the associate administrator for research and development at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington. But questions remain.
Now that airbags are coming into widespread use, Mr. Parker said, what are the consequences for drivers and passengers who get into accidents? Do the airbags themselves cause injuries? Why are there injuries when people wear seat belts as well as use airbags? And what is the nature of those injuries?
To find out, the agency is financing a five-year study at the Ryder Trauma Center, which treats most victims of catastrophic automobile accidents in the Miami area. Today, Dr. Augenstein will present a three-year progress report to officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, detailing the injuries suffered by 100 people treated at the center after head-on collisions.
 
Two Recommendations
 The administration has already issued two recommendations based on its continuing study of air-bag effectiveness, Mr. Parker said. One is that the police or paramedics at the scene of an accident lift the air bag to see if the steering wheel has been deformed. If so, the victim may have internal injuries and should be taken to a hospital for observation.
Second, rear-facing infant seats should not be placed in the front seat if the passenger side has an air bag. Such seats come too close to the air-bag mechanism, he said, and the force of inflation could harm the child. Front-facing child seats are safe, he added, but the back seat is the safest spot for young children in car seats.
Mr. Parker said that in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, 211,758 people were hospitalized nationwide because of crash injuries. Of these, 88,663, or 42 percent, had been wearing seat belts. An unknown fraction of them, Mr. Parker said, would also have been protected by air bags, which were first widely introduced in 1990-model cars.
 
Change in Injuries
 In the Miami study, 20 of the 100 victims were wearing seat belts and had driver-side air bags, Dr. Augenstein said. The bags protected their heads and torsos but, because of the force of the crash, their legs still came into contact with a hard part of the car. "We are beginning to see many very, very severe lower-extremity injuries, like ankle fractures, crushed feet" and broken femurs and hip bones, he said.
Drivers protected by air bags can also suffer internal injuries that are not apparent at the accident scene, Dr. Augenstein said. There may be no blood or broken bones, he said, but the driver's abdomen may still hit the steering wheel, especially if there are multiple impacts. Lacerations of the liver, bowel and spleen are not uncommon, Dr. Augenstein said. Such injuries may need surgery or careful observation in an intensive care unit.
Internal injuries are far more likely if the crash victim is not wearing seat belts, allowing the victim to slide up and over or around the air bag, Dr. Augenstein said. Air bags are not a substitute for for both shoulder and lap seat belt restraints, he said. In fact, air bags work best when both belts are used.
In the Miami study, 80 crash victims were riding in cars equipped with systems in which shoulder belts close automatically but lap belts must be buckled by hand. The injuries varied depending on the severity of the crash, Dr. Augenstein said, but every person who wore only the shoulder belt and failed to buckle the lap belt -- 7 of the 80 -- suffered liver lacerations. The absence of a lap belt lets the pelvis slide forward, he said, so that the automatic shoulder belt does not grab at the shoulder, but exerts maximum force at the right upper part of the abdomen, near the liver.
No one has been seriously harmed by the air bag itself, he said.
Automobile safety engineers are looking for ways to protect the lower body in severe crashes, Mr. Parker said. Some manufacturers are strengthening the car's lower level so that it does not crumple on impact, he said, but more research is needed.

HEADLINE: The Pub: A Center Of Ireland in Exile

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
WHEN Giles Cooper was growing up in County Kerry, Ireland, he was so poor he slept with his only pair of shoes stuck under the bedposts, so that no one could steal them without lifting the bed and waking him up.
Now, Mr. Cooper is a contractor and no longer poor. Last Christmas, when he and two friends spent $200,000 to open Tom & Jerry's Bar and Restaurant on Elizabeth Street, on the edge of SoHo, Mr. Cooper was a happy man. From the exterior he may resemble Willie Nelson, down to the ponytail and the bandanna around his head, but in his heart, he will always be an Irishman. 
 "I always wanted to open a pub," Mr. Cooper said. The bar, with gleaming white walls inset with glass brick, is an Irish dream made real. On weekends, it is packed. And the people are not there for the food. There isn't any food -- yet.
To many of the Irish, whether in Ireland or in New York City, a pub is not just a bar, a place to grab a bottle of beer or a pint of Guinness stout, dark and bitter, yeasty and filling. In Ireland, a pub is the cultural epicenter, the place where people go at night. In New York, the pub serves much the same function, especially tomorrow, on St. Patrick's Day.
As Irish immigration to New York increases, so do the numbers of new pubs. Through much of the 1960's and 1970's, when the economy in Ireland was good, the United States drew few Irish immigrants. But since 1986, when United States immigration law changed, many young Irish men and women, most of them single and in their 20's, have been moving to America.
In 1992, 3,116 people from Ireland emigrated to New York City, and many of them settled in Queens, says Frank Vardy, a demographer at New York City's Department of City Planning. The favorite neighborhoods are Sunnyside and Woodside, where the Irish live side-by-side with Koreans, Chinese and Colombians. Other immigrants move to a Little Ireland along the Bronx-Yonkers border.
At pubs, people find gossip and jobs, boyfriends and girlfriends -- and sometimes husbands and wives. A pub is where there are dart games and seisiuns (pronounced se-SHOONS) -- informal gatherings for singing plaintive songs, whose roots are medieval ballads, accompanied by guitar, fiddle and bodhran (bow-RAWN), a drum.
"Your social life in Ireland is to go to to the bar," said Jimmy Tuohy, Mr. Cooper's partner in Tom & Jerry's. The third partner is Jo Janes, a former bartender and the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. ("I'm helping people sin, and he saves them," she said.)
Mr. Tuohy, who grew up in Ireland, said his native town, Kenmare, had 1,000 people and 30 bars.
Irish pubs in New York, with their fish and chips, beer and dart games, represent comfort. Some look much as they do in Ireland. At Fiona's on Katonah Avenue in the Bronx the Irishness begins with the architecture. There are carved dark wood arches and paneled walls, and an etched glass wall divides the bar and lounge area from a passageway that leads to the restrooms. In Ireland, the glass wall, always sandblasted and opaque, was traditionally used to divide the men from the women. The area where the women sat, and sometimes priests as well, was called the snug.
At Fiona's on a recent Thursday night, two women's dart teams, one from Fiona's, the other from the Hide-Out Bar, also in the Bronx, played for their league's championship.
Sometimes a dart missed the board and bounced off the Tiffany-style chandelier. Ping. Three hours and hundreds of darts later, the game was over.
The Hide-Out had won, and the women got rowdy.
The winners shook bottles of beer, covering the tops with their thumbs, and sprayed each other until their faces and blouses were soaked and sticky. Some of the women grabbed Patsy Kindelan, the Hide-Out's owner, and hoisted him onto their shoulders. He waved -- feebly.
Then the women from the Hide-Out did the glory run. They climbed up on the bar and ran up and down, shimmying and screaming for joy. As the women hollered, Danny Doohan, the owner of Fiona's, did what most Irish pub owners do, at the end of a game. He brought out shepherd's pie for the teams.
Across town, at Sidetrack's, a popular bar and restaurant in Sunnyside, there are no darts. "They're dangerous," said Andrew Breslin, Sidetrack's owner. "And it's a family restaurant."
Even without darts, Sidetrack's is Dermot G. Robinson's "local." "It's where you go regularly," said Mr. Robinson, a 35-year-old house painter who lives in Sunnyside. He is at Sidetrack's three times a week. If someone telephones for him and he isn't there, the staff takes a message.
Sidetrack's is Greta Wood's local, too.
"I come here Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday for lunch and dinner," said Ms. Wood, 39, a building superintendent in Queens.
While agreeing that Irish social life is centered on pubs, the new immigrants resent the stereotype that portrays the Irish as heavy drinkers. And there is proof that they are right. In "Alcohol Use in Ireland," published last year by the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, Denis Conniffe and Daniel McCoy report that in 1990, the alcohol consumption per adult was less than half that of France or Spain.
But when the Irish do drink, it's not necessarily Irish brands, like Harp lager or Guinness stout. At the pubs, they were drinking Molson, Amstel, Heineken, Coors, and vodka and Coke.
At the bar, Irishmen (but not Irishwomen) have their own etiquette about paying for drinks. When a man buys the first drink, he leaves the change, a stack of bills, on the bar, and when a friend comes by, he asks, "What will you have?" The bartender takes the money from the bar, returns the change, and not a word is said about the bill. At the end of the night, without any words being spoken about the crass subject of money, each person has bought his friends a round of drinks.
"It's a courtesy to buy a round of drinks," said Brendan Keenan, a 31-year-old instructor at the New York Restaurant School in Manhattan.
Ask an Irishman what he thinks about Irish food, and his answer is a joke. From Mr. Keenan: "Irish food is a six-pack of Guinness and a pint of potatoes." From John O'Callahan, who sells carpets and curtains in Queens: "Boil it dead. Cook it dead." After the jokes, comes the defense.
Probably no Irish chef will claim that Irish food ranks with French food. "The French live to eat," Mr. Keenan said, "and the Irish eat to live." But he would say that when the ingredients are farm- or river-fresh, and not overcooked, Irish food is simple yet tasty.
Still, concerned about Ireland's poor food image, the Irish Government began to put more money into cooking schools in 1963 and, later, to send Irish chefs to the Continent for cooking competitions. Now, at least four European-trained Irish chefs work at the Plaza, Regency and Waldorf-Astoria hotels in Manhattan. The St. Patrick's Day menu at the Waldorf-Astoria's Peacock Alley restaurant will feature a refined variation of the Irish stew. Conrad Gallagher, the sous-chef, will braise, not boil, the lamb shanks, and to the richly aromatic dish spiced with fresh thyme and rosemary, he will add fingerling potatoes and porcini.
When the Irish get homesick in New York, they crave an Irish breakfast: a platter of fried bacon (rashers), sausages (bangers), black pudding (a sausage made from pork blood) and white pudding (a white pork sausage), fried potatoes, fried tomatoes and triangles of toast.
At 1 in the afternoon, on a recent Saturday, the Irish Coffee Shop, a seven-month-old restaurant in Yonkers, was packed. Almost everyone was eating the Irish breakfast, a huge array priced at $6, enough food for two people. On weekends, the restaurant cooks 150 Irish breakfasts a day, and on weekdays, at least 50.
Patricia Kennedy, a 25-year-old nurse who lives in Yonkers, ordered the breakfast, without rashers.
"I ate too many rashers at home," Ms. Kennedy said.
How often was too many?
Nearly every day.
But the yearning for an Irish breakfast was still there.

HEADLINE: Standing Up to China

 BODY:
When dealing with China, it sometimes helps to see matters through Chinese eyes. As Beijing views it, a great power must always insist on being treated with due respect. To behave otherwise is to acknowledge inferiority and therefore to forfeit influence.
During Secretary of State Christopher's weekend visit to Beijing, Chinese leaders aggressively asserted what they see as the prerogatives of China. They deliberately humiliated America's highest-ranking diplomat by temporarily rounding up some of the country's most prominent dissidents, and by detaining several Western correspondents trying to report on the crackdown. 
 The purpose of the roundup was to prevent Mr. Christopher from hearing any independent views on the human rights issues he is required to evaluate before making a recommendation by June on renewing China's access to the most favorable American tariff schedules.
For the sake of a healthy U.S.-China relationship, Washington is now obliged to respond with equal firmness. To kowtow to Chinese bullying would be to repeat the mistakes of the Bush Administration, which squandered American influence by its consistent refusal to press human rights issues. That was what first provoked Congress to force annual showdowns over linking continuation of China's trade privileges to progress on human rights.
The Clinton Administration needs instead to be forthright about its continued determination to insist on human rights progress. It especially needs to dispel China's impression that it can exploit differences between various policy makers in the Administration, Congress and the business community. Such miscalculation can only increase the likelihood of a rupture both sides would prefer to avoid.
China, despite its pose of cool indifference, desperately needs the $20 billion hard currency surplus it earns from its trade with the U.S. to carry on with its ambitious economic development plans. And U.S. business frankly wants to maintain access to one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies. For their part, human rights advocates recognize that China's continued economic growth and openness contribute to domestic pressures for more responsive, less dictatorial government.
Even so, the Clinton Administration has a clear right under international law, and an obligation under U.S. law, to link China's trade status to minimum human rights goals. The Administration has demanded nothing unreasonable or demeaning, for the most part asking only compliance with international agreements to which China already subscribes. Washington seeks an end to the export of goods produced by slave labor, freer emigration for relatives of exiles and detainees, humane and lawful treatment of prisoners, and respect for the cultural traditions of Tibet. On most of these issues it has not set rigid benchmarks but is looking for "overall significant progress."
The Administration can use the remaining two and a half months provided by last year's executive order to give China the greatest possible incentive to demonstrate progress. But Mr. Clinton must make clear that if Beijing continues to try to blow past the whole issue with deliberate human rights provocations, it will be making a very big mistake.

HEADLINE: Black Summit Can't Exclude Nation of Islam

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People remains committed to our historic mandate to challenge racial exploitation, discrimination and bigotry. We will not be diverted by attempts to mischaracterize our efforts to convene African-American leadership to confront collectively the profound issues affecting African-American communities of the United States. 
 "The N.A.A.C.P.'s Mistake" (editorial, March 7) criticizes us for inviting Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, to a coming summit meeting of African-American leaders. But not to invite Mr. Farrakhan to participate in a critical dialogue with dozens of other national leaders would be a serious mistake.
An invitation to him or to other African-American leaders does not constitute an endorsement of the teachings or philosophies of the organizations they represent. We are not seeking to fabricate unity or consensus out of diversity, but we are convinced that diversity and dialogue are not mutually exclusive.
We believe that as the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, we have a responsibility to sponsor a summit meeting for African-American leaders on such issues as unemployment, alienation, drugs, violence, health care, education and lack of economic opportunity.
We are prepared to respect the integrity and independence of the organizations we invite to this summit, planned for the spring, and we expect reciprocity.
Dialogue and accord are taking place all over the world between longtime adversaries who recognize the need to work for a common interest. What's wrong with dialogue among parties with radically different perspectives right in the United States?
We all know that race relations were severely affected by the now infamous Kean College speech of Khalid Muhammad. The N.A.A.C.P. condemned his demagogic diatribe in the strongest terms, as throughout our 85-year history we have denounced all manifestations of racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry.
As we seek to forge new relationships, we also work to strengthen our relations with other groups and individuals in America's multiracial and multicultural mosaic. Just two weeks ago in New York, a leadership delegation of the N.A.A.C.P. held a productive meeting with leaders of the Anti-Defamation League. Moreover, the N.A.A.C.P. values the active participation in its affairs of its many white and Jewish members.
Yes, we are at a watershed moment in the war against prejudice in the United States. But we are also at a crossroads in the war against growing poverty, hopelessness and despair in urban and rural communities of America, the struggle against rising misery and degradation among millions of Americans.
Unemployment in the African-American community is twice the national average. Homelessness is rampant. Fratricide is claiming far too many young lives. Jails and prisons are overflowing with young African-American and Latino males.
Talking to one another will solve more common problems than throwing stones and shouting at one another.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Cuts Cash Awards To Landlords for Homeless

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has ordered drastic cuts in a program that has awarded landlords thousands of dollars in incentives for providing apartments to homeless families living in shelters.
Administration officials said the bonus program paid some landlords too much money. They said the reduction would not hurt the program in part because of recent increases in Federal rent subsidies. 
 The reduced payments, which the administration expects will save $18 million in state and city money, come on the heels of proposed budget cuts that would eliminate city financing for a program that creates housing for single homeless men and women. Housing advocates describe these programs as a central element of a successful effort that has movedthousands of homeless people from shelters to private housing.
Administration officials say neither cutback will affect the availability of permanent housing for the homeless, and they say that both will help the city economize as it is faces a budget gap of more than $2.3 billion.
But advocates for the homeless said they feared that the combined cuts could decimate more than 10 years of efforts to move the homeless from shelters to permanent housing. In the last decade, the two programs have produced more than 10,000 permanent apartments for the homeless.
The latest cut, which took effect Monday, reduces the bonuses that landlords receive for making their apartments available to shelter residents through the Emergency Assistance Rehousing Program, or E.A.R.P. Until Monday landlords had received a flat grant of $2,300 for every family member placed in new apartments. The new rate is a sliding scale, with a minimum of $1,000 per two-person family to a maximum bonus of $5,000 for families of eight or more.
Landlords who have apartments in the pipeline as of last Friday, and who have contracts with the New York City Housing Authority and tenant leases signed by June 30, will receive bonuses based on the higher schedule.
Joan Malin, the Commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, said she felt that the new schedule of incentives would remove what she characterized as generous payments to landlords who place big families. "With the old schedule," Ms. Malin said, "there was no cap on the size of the bonus landlords could get. So a landlord could get $20,000 or more for each family accepted."
"There is no doubt that there is little housing available for large families," Ms. Malin said. "But there was a concern that for the top levels on the schedule, the payments were out of whack with the market."
She added that the administration does not believe the cuts in the cash bonuses will hurt the program, in part because recent increases in Federal rent subsidies will shift the incentive from the one-time bonus to the higher rents.
She said by raising the fair market rent levels, participating landlords would get higher rents and more landlords would qualify for the program. "It opens another band of the market to us," she said.
But several landlords said yesterday that they would probably stop participating because of the cuts in the bonuses.
"They have just destroyed the program," said Ira Kellman, a landlord who had not heard about the bonus cuts.
Mr. Kellman, who rents to about 30 E.A.R.P. tenants in Harlem, said the change in policy was a further disincentive for participation.
 
'It's Not Worthwhile'
 "After a point," Mr. Kellman said, who like other landlords complained about burdens of dealing with three agencies and the risk of seeing apartments stand empty while tenants were placed, "it's not worthwhile."
Mr. Kellman said that just this week he was considering offering 5 or 10 units that had recently become available in his complex to the city for tenants from the program. But he said he would need more information before making a decision.
In addition to the cuts in the bonus program, a provision in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed capital budget for the next three years would eliminate $89 million in city spending for the S.R.O. Loan Program, which helps nonprofit groups that develop single-room housing with support services for single homeless people. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which administers the program, hopes to make up the cut with Federal money.
 
Cuts Found Troubling
 Gretchen Buchenholtz, executive director of Association to Benefit Children, which operates Rosie and Harry's Place, a shelter in East Harlem, said she found the cuts in the bonus program "troubling and potentially short-sighted."
"If this move is going to reduce the number of apartments available to shelter residents," she said, "then more families will be stuck in shelters for a longer period of time, resulting in the long run a greater financial cost to the city and a greater human cost to the families."
The program was established in 1982 to help find private alternative housing for the homeless. But owners did not embrace it until 1986, when the State Legislature approved a bonus of $2,300 to landlords for each person in the household the first time a unit's lease was signed.
When the real-estate market was booming and few apartments were available, the payments encouraged landlords to renovate their properties to lease them to the homeless. To participate, landlords must sign 32-month leases and are paid fair-market rent through a combination of Federal rent subsidies and the tenant's public assistance income.
 
2 Programs Stepped Up
 After struggling through most of the 1980's with various ways to meet the needs of a growing population of homeless, the city stepped up both the bonus program and the S.R.O. Loan Program and saw them as an increasingly important component in its commitment to reduce the use of welfare hotels. Last year 2,300 shelter families found permanent homes as a result of the incentive program, and Ms. Malin said the agency's goal is to use it to find permanent homes for 2,700 families.
Since 1988 the S.R.O. program has developed 3,800 single-room apartments for homeless people.
Ms. Buchenholtz said she is most concerned about where the homeless families will go if the landlords abandon the program.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a New York City program that awards cash incentives to landlords who provide apartments for homeless families misstated the minimum payment in some editions. It is $1,000 for housing a two-member family, not $1,000 per person.

HEADLINE: The Whitewater Fallacy

BYLINE: By Ernest Dumas; Ernest Dumas is a columnist for The Arkansas Times.

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Reliable sources tell me that the word "incestuous" is coded into the computers of all news media people writing about Arkansas and Whitewater. Press the F1 key and a reflexive sentence will describe the illicit political and financial culture from which the President of the United States sprang.
So long have Arkansans endured the hillbilly caricature that defensiveness is part of their genetic code. They know why the incest metaphor seems so natural to Washington reporters, whose picture of Arkansas is of an ethical Dogpatch where savings-and-loan schemers bed their sisters and then get their idiot spawn appointed to the state regulatory agencies. 
 The coziness of Arkansas politics, government and finance has been a staple news theme since reporters came to Little Rock in the Presidential campaign and discovered what a small place it was. You could stroll down the sidewalk and see all sorts of local big fish. In a little plate-lunch cafe a block from campaign headquarters you could see bankers, Supreme Court Justices and what passed locally for big-time lawyers forking down meat loaf and tossing jolly ripostes across the tables.
Much of the reporting has focused on the connections of the staid old Rose Law Firm, where Hillary Rodham Clinton and three other Clinton Administration officials worked -- including Webster Hubbell, the now-departed Associate Attorney General.
The political-incest theory, in which the Rose firm plays a large part, might appear to be a reasonable explanation of why the fumbling White House would create a genuine crisis from a pathetic little investment fiasco and one of the smallest S. & L. belly-flops in the country -- in neither of which does the known record suggest any wrongdoing by the Clintons.
Or by anyone else in the government in Arkansas. And that is the trouble with the explanation. There is no doubt that Mr. Clinton hired cronies like Mr. Hubbell and that the White House sprang into a defensive crouch when questions began to be asked about the Clintons' financial dealings. But the idea that the wreck of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and the scheming of its erstwhile chief, James McDougal, were shielded by friendly state officials is a myth. Despite Mr. McDougal's support for Mr. Clinton, the government's demeanor toward him was anything but friendly.
A former aide to Senators John L. McClellan and J. William Fulbright, Mr. McDougal had been Governor Clinton's economic development adviser in his first term, in 1979 and 1980. He believed that hidebound Arkansas bankers -- who invested in U.S. securities rather than lending to local entrepreneurs who might have created jobs and growth -- were at the root of the state's woeful poverty.
When Mr. McDougal left the government and went into the banking and savings-and-loan business, he set out to prove his theory. Everyone (or at least every good Democrat) deserved a loan, whether needed or not; from that would flow abundance for all.
A couple of years later, with Mr. Clinton back in office, his Bank Commissioner, Marlin Jackson, drove up into the Ozark woods to tell the directors of Mr. McDougal's tiny bank to curb his free-wheeling lending outside its territory, specifically including loans to the Clintons for the Whitewater development project.
And it was Mr. Clinton's Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who along with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board forced Mr. McDougal's removal from control of Madison Guaranty after an accounting firm's examination condemned its lending and investment practices in 1986. She petitioned for a Federal takeover of the company in 1987.
It is widely accepted that in 1985 Mrs. Schaffer approved an unprecedented issuance of preferred stock in after a plea from Hillary Clinton on Madison's behalf. But this "approval" was a little different from the way news accounts have painted it.
The Dallas regional office of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board had encouraged the troubled savings and loans in the region to recapitalize. Madison talked about issuing preferred stock, and a lawyer at the Rose firm wrote a memorandum asserting that state law did not bar such an issuance by a state-chartered savings and loan. The memo noted at the bottom that a copy had been sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mrs. Schaffer replied, in a now famous "Dear Hillary" letter, that preferred stock was not barred by state law. But an issuance would have had to be approved by Mrs. Schaffer, and Madison never proposed one -- either because it could not have withstood the disclosure requirements or because it could not have found buyers.
The caricature of an incestuous government seems to be based on Mr. Clinton's practice of hiring friends, some of whom turn out to be competent, others knaves. But no example comes to mind of a contrary policy anywhere in this country. That too many people know each other and have business and social relationships is an indictment of small cities everywhere. But the real difference is that in small places the little secrets are known, while in places like Washington, Chicago and New York they are unknowable.

HEADLINE: FIGURE SKATING;
Judge Accepts Harding Plea In Conspiracy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

 BODY:
A 10-week whodunit that captured world attention for the unlikely backdrop of figure skating came to an inconclusive halt yesterday when Tonya Harding pleaded guilty to a single charge in the Jan. 6 assault on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan.
In a plea agreement in a Portland, Ore., District Court, Miss Harding admitted to conspiring to hinder prosecution of the case, a felony offense. But what the agreement did not include -- and now might never be known for certain -- is the full extent of her knowledge of the attack in Detroit, where Miss Kerrigan was struck on the knee with a collapsible metal baton. 
 Miss Harding acknowledged no further involvement beyond what she has already said -- that she learned of the attack only after it was committed and failed to tell authorities what she knew. She has consistently denied any role in the attack.
 
An Unanswered Question
 The conspiracy charge carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a fine of $100,000. Under Oregon sentencing guidelines, however, she will not serve any prison time. She received a probation of three years, a fine of $100,000 and an order to perform 500 hours of community service.
While the unknowable might lack the scope and urgency of other celebrated but unresolved crimes, the extent of Miss Harding's role in the case had remained the single burning question. As such, it fed a growing fascination with a case that featured an unlikely brazen act, memorable characters and legal maneuvering, all amid the otherwise genteel world of sequins, lace and classical music on ice.
But if Miss Harding harbors any remaining secrets, she will no longer skate with them as an amateur. As an additional condition of the agreement, she must resign from the United States Figure Skating Association, a move that means she will be ineligible for the world championships next week in Japan.
By other terms of the agreement, Miss Harding agreed to contribute $50,000 to establish a fund for Special Olympics in Oregon, to reimburse the county $10,000 in legal expenses and to undergo a psychiatric examination.
Miss Harding's plea came at the end of a day on which several witnesses testified before a grand jury deciding whether Miss Harding or any of at least three others involved in the assault would be indicted. Among those appearing was her former husband, Jeff Gillooly, who had told Federal investigators that Miss Harding was involved in planning the attack.
 
Scheduled to Leave
 Miss Harding was scheduled to leave today for Japan in what was to be her final performance before she planned on turning professional. Thus, her competitive career will end with an eighth-place finish at the winter Olympics last month in Lillehammer, Norway, where Miss Kerrigan was second behind Oksana Baiul of Ukraine.
Jerry Lace, executive director of the skating association, said the organization's executive committee would meet today to decide whether to continue its disciplinary proceedings against Miss Harding. One of the possibilities, Mr. Lace said, is that Miss Harding could be stripped of the national championship she won in Detroit in January.
 Dressed in a black suit, Miss Harding stood somberly beside her lawyer, Robert C. Weaver Jr., as Judge Donald H. Londer of the Multnomah County District Court made certain she understood the agreement and all that it implied. Her only statement to the court after the 15-minute hearing was, "I would just like to say that I am really sorry I interfered," although it was not immediately clear whether she meant interfering with the case or Judge Londer's vacation.
He had cut short a trip to the Oregon coast to be in court.
Outside the courtroom, surrounded by reporters, Mr. Weaver said: "This ends the biggest part of what has been an unending nightmare for Tonya Harding for the last few months. She realized that she placed too much value on her goals and her career and not enough on herself. She's committed herself to get into a program she will examine why she has been involved in so many destructive relationships so that she can prevent them from happening again."
He added: "Tonya has to take care of Tonya now."
Throughout an investigation by Federal authorities and law enforcement agencies in Oregon and Michigan, Miss Harding maintained that she never knew more about the assault than what she learned several days after her Jan. 10 return to Portland from the national championships, which she won.
After initially denying she knew anything about the attack and sticking to her story for nearly nine hours in a Jan. 18 interview with the F.B.I., she changed her position in the next two hours to reveal she had learned that people close to her had been involved.
Those people included Mr. Gillooly, with whom she was living at the time. Mr. Gillooly had told the same Federal investigators in an earlier interview that Miss Harding was involved in planning the attack from the beginning, and that, in fact, it was her idea.
Mr. Gillooly, an unemployed former warehouse worker, pleaded guilty to a single count of racketeering on Feb. 1. The grand jury is still considering whether to indict three other men who have told authorities they played a role in the attack. They include Shane Stant of Phoenix, whom authorities say struck Miss Kerrigan; Derrick Smith, also of Phoenix, who confessed to driving the getaway car, and Shawn Eckart, the heavyset body guard and lifelong friend of Mr. Gillooly's who has told authorities he received $2,000 from Mr. Gillooly to pay the others to carry out the attack.
It is possible that Miss Harding could be called to testify if these men are indicted and the cases go to trial.

HEADLINE: Michigan Votes for Revolution In Financing Its Public Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 16

 BODY:
In the nation's most dramatic shift in a century in the way public schools are financed, Michigan will begin using sales and other taxes, not property taxes, to pay for its 3,286 schools.
The experiment also includes provisions to begin equalizing spending by rich and poor districts throughout the state by giving each district a minimum of $4,200 a student, $1,000 more than the poorer districts now spend. The plan is being examined by several states; 28 are now mired in lawsuits about the inequities of financing from property taxes. 
 Approved by 70 percent of voters in a heavy turnout on Tuesday, the Michigan plan will end the state's 100-year reliance on property taxes, which here, as in other states, have galvanized property owners into a powerful political force trying to limit spending.
 
Conservative Impulse
 Backed by Gov. John M. Engler, a conservative Republican who faces re-election this fall, the plan was intended to help improve schools without increasing the burden on property owners. Less than 10 percent of school financing would come from property taxes, accomplishing Mr. Engler's initial goal, as well as equalizing expenditures in rich and poor school districts, a goal liberals have sought in many states for more than 20 years.
"It is a huge vote," Mr. Engler said by telephone today. "The property tax had been a terrible problem in the state because of the relentless increases for schools. We were approaching an educational meltdown, and it was the root of the inequities in the per pupil spending among districts."
Under the plan, which goes into effect on May 1, the state sales tax will increase to 6 percent from 4 percent, and cigarette taxes will triple, to 75 cents a pack. This will generate more than $2.1 billion a year, the State Treasury Office estimates. Property taxes will be reduced by about $1.9 billion.
 
Drawing Keen Interest
 Although school officials across the state as well as critics wonder whether sales tax receipts are too volatile to support public education in the future, the state's venture into uncharted terrain has drawn keen interest from other states. In the last month, the Wisconsin Legislature approved two competing proposals that would limit a school district's reliance on property taxes. Officials from Vermont, South Carolina, Rhode Island and New Hampshire have asked for detailed projections of the financing plan.
All told, 28 states are in court over the way they finance public education. In most cases, civil rights groups and coalitions of parents have alleged that state aid to supplement property taxes does not close the gap between rich schools and poor ones.
"The mere fact that Michigan has done this means that other states are going to think about it," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany, part of the State University of New York. "It's good for Michigan because property taxes were very high."
Under the plan, Michigan, which ranked eighth nationwide in property tax burden, will raise $1.8 billion to $2 billion from additional state sales taxes, replacing the same amount in property taxes. And the cigarette tax, which would raise the price to an average of $2.55 a pack, would add $350 million in the 1994-95 school year. As a result of the plan's passage, the state education budget in the next school year will increase about 6 percent, to $10.2 billion from $9.6 billion this year.
The gap between rich and poor is not as pronounced in Michigan as in some states facing court challenges. The poorest districts spend about $3,200 a student, and the richest, $10,000. In New York, for example, the richest district spends nearly $46,000 per student, while New York City averages $6,644 for each student.
The Michigan plan will narrow the gap between rich and poor by giving districts a minimum of $4,200 a student and limiting spending increases by wealthier districts.
School officials had mixed reactions today to the vote. Some said the new plan would do for now.
 
'The Best Option'
 "Although this is still not the complete answer to equitable, adequate and stable funding of the schools in our state, it does provide the best option at this time," said David L. Snead, superintendent of Detroit Public Schools, the nation's seventh-largest school system with 169,000 students.
But in the state's richest district -- Bloomfield Hills, just north of Detroit -- officials lamented the passage of the plan. The district spends $10,400 a student, but the new plan will limit increases in state financing to 1.5 percent a year or less and limit what districts themselves may spend.
"Our schools won't look too different for the next two years," said W. Robert Docking, the superintendent. "But eventually, the state revenue cap will catch up with the district."
And that, he said, could require the district to increase elementary class sizes or cut things like foreign language classes for elementary grades and the extended high school day that allows students to take seven classes instead of five or six.
"I am pleased that the lowest-financed schools will receive more assistance," he added. "That absolutely had to happen." But not, he said, at the expense of affluent school systems.
Had the plan been defeated, the Legislature had already approved one to replace property taxes with income taxes by raising them to 6 percent from 4.6 percent. The backup plan won the support of the Michigan Education Association, the 127,000-member teachers' union, which argued that sales tax receipts were too likely to be reduced by recession. Data over the last 20 years from the Michigan Department of Treasury indicated that the sales tax revenue has grown in each of the last 20 years except one.
But Governor Engler had vowed to reduce property taxes when first elected three years ago. In doing so, he seized on the simmering discontent that other politicians from across the political spectrum have tried to do.
 
Appeal in Both Partiesxx
 "Property taxes as a political issue doesn't play more in one party than another," said Chris Pipho, a school finance expert with the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based nonprofit group that conducts education research for states. "Property taxes have a way of being a good issue for candidates of either party. When the public feels that property taxes are too high, politicians have to rise to that occasion."
After failing to win voters' support last year for a similar effort to revise school financing, Mr. Engler succeeded this year in presenting residents with what they saw as a palatable alternative -- the sales tax. Michigan's 4 percent sales tax was one of the lowest in the nation and even with the increase it will be near the national average.
The Governor campaigned heavily for the proposal. Even his Democratic opponents concede that his re-election bid was enhanced by the plan's lopsided victory.
Other states that have tried to move to a system of equal school district financing have found those efforts blocked by legislators from affluent districts who do not want to see a forced reduction in spending for their constituents' children.
But that did not happen in Michigan, State Senator John Kelly, a Democrat who represents the affluent Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe, said on Wednesday. He attributed that to the affluent disctricts' being principally represented by Republicans loyal to Mr. Engler and a plan critical to his political future after winning an upset victory in 1990 by less than one percent of the vote.
"Besides, with the aging population, 70 percent of their voters do not have kids in the schools, and lowering the property tax was a much greater priority for them," said Mr. Kelly, adding that others care less since they have joined a growing trend and placed their children in private schools.
In the late 1970's, California property owners rebelled leading to the landmark Proposition 13, which limited property-tax increases. But even in that state, property taxes still supply about one-third of school financing, with the rest coming from state sales taxes, income taxes and other taxes.
In Michigan, the reluctance of property owners to pay for greater shares of public school cycle finally ruptured a year ago, when the public schools in Kalkaska, about 240 miles northwest of Detroit, shut down three months early after voters rejected three property tax increases.
In the Kalkaska public schools, which stand to benefit under the new plan, the outlook today was uncertain. With the guaranteed amount from the state, the district will see its per student spending rise to $4,200 next year from $3,800 this year, but the Superintendent of Schools, Doyle Disbrow, said today that he was uncertain whether Kalkaska would have enough money in coming years to pay for an increasing number of programs required by the state.
"I'm still concerned," Mr. Disbrow said. "The only thing I hope is that the Legislature with the Governor's help at least makes sure the funding is there for schools over the next few years."

HEADLINE: Persistent Racial Segregation Mars Suburbs' Green Dream

SERIES: Tarnished Haven -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROOSEVELT, L.I.

 BODY:
When Marshella Atkinson's parents decided to leave Brooklyn for Long Island, the enthusiasm of friends and teachers made her smile with anticipation.
Perhaps they pictured the swimming pools of nearby Levittown, or the shopping centers of Garden City, or the well-stocked library and spotless corridors of Plainview-Old Bethpage High School. Ms. Atkinson is not sure. 
 But four years later, the 16-year-old does know one thing: They could not have meant Roosevelt, where boarded-up houses dot the walk home from high school and people complain that their streets are last to be plowed by the Town of Hempstead, where Roosevelt is the most troubled section.
"I think they set it up so that when a black family moves here, it ends up in Roosevelt," said Ms. Atkinson, a junior at Roosevelt High School. She glanced at a hole in her classroom ceiling where tiles had been ripped away. Graffiti scarred the walls. "I thought it was going to be a dream place," she said.
Drawn by the promise of escape from inner-city congestion and violence, more and more families like the Atkinsons are moving to America's suburbs. Like the white middle class before them, they come for a home of their own, good schools, open spaces and relative safety, everything that the suburbs symbolize in the American narrative.
But segregation is not declining as black and Hispanic people move to the suburbs, according to John R. Logan, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Albany, who has studied segregation around 10 major cities. Nationally, 1 black person in 3 now lives in the suburbs, but even those with middle-class incomes usually end up in middle-class pockets of poorer neighborhoods.
Lily-white communities tend not to become integrated but to remain largely lily-white, with the addition of well-defined minority precincts. On Long Island, 95 percent of black residents are concentrated in 5 percent of the census tracts. According to census data, the average white person in Nassau County lives in a census tract in which only 8 percent of the residents are black or Hispanic. The average white child attends a school that is just 9 percent black.
In New York City, by contrast, the comparable figure is 18 percent on either score, or more than twice the degree of integration, said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, director of the Program of Applied Social Research at Queens College of the City University of New York, who analyzed the data.
Suffolk, slightly less segregated than Nassau, is more like suburbs around the country, Professor Beveridge said.
 
Laws Have No Effect
 "Both within cities and suburbs, Hispanics and blacks are segregated, and they're forced to locate in the least desirable communities," Professor Logan said. "And I see no evidence that any change in civil rights laws or fair housing legislation is having any effect."
Of course, some blacks choose to live in black neighborhoods. Others opted for integrated areas that white flight has since rendered mostly black. Still others can afford only the cheapest suburban housing. But a great many blacks complain they are never shown the full range of housing choices or are discouraged from buying in predominantly white communities.
Once they arrive, blacks find that the suburban landscape and the suburban way of life increase racial isolation: The tendency to restrict parks, libraries and other amenities to local residents; to rely on cars rather than on mass transit, and to emphasize home rule in government promote a segregated existence, no matter what the intent.
 
White Flight
Integration, Then Racial Isolation
 While the Long Island suburbs, in their postwar expansion, were providing the blueprint for an America of the automobile age, the plan accepted white prejudices of the day, typically restricting the emerging communities to "members of the Caucasian race."
Federal laws now bar discrimination, but mechanisms of segregation endure. James Thomas landed in the Suffolk County hamlet of Bellport after a thwarted attempt to buy a house in white Port Jefferson 33 years ago. Mr. Thomas's mailman, who was white, offered to sell Mr. Thomas his Cape Cod in Bellport for $10,500. "You have to take where you can get," the retired factory supervisor said.
For 20 years, Bellport remained a "solid, good community." But what he thought was steady integration turned out to be a white hemorrhage. A decade ago, Mr. Thomas realized that the people moving in were no longer working class or middle class but getting by on government aid. Bellport became as blighted as any city neighborhood, its streets lined with prostitutes and certain corners given over to drug dealing.
Mr. Thomas looked across the hedges at a house that had burned down several months before: a jungle of exposed wires and half-fallen floors. For him, the delay in razing the house, since removed, was sure proof of the Town of Brookhaven's disregard for blacks. "You can't tell me that this would be left to stand this way in a white neighborhood," he said.
 
Services Dwindle
 Whites who bought homes in the suburbs typically began a lifelong climb up the social and economic ladder. Many blacks are forced to watch their investment decline as whites flee, poorer minorities move in and services dwindle. Homeowners like Ed Larson of the North Amityville Taxpayers Association meet to enlist police against drug peddlers, prostitutes and street crime, problems that seldom preoccupy their white counterparts.
"If the American dream is to buy a house in the suburbs, send your kid to a good school and have some grass, yes, it's the American dream," said Hugh A. Wilson, director of the Institute for Suburban Studies at Adelphi University. "If it's also to do that in an integrated setting, then for blacks, it's not fulfilling the dream."
Some blacks complain that isolation feeds a quiet acceptance of racism. Alton Williams, first vice president of the Nassau County Guardians, which represents black police officers, said he was shocked to see a white supremacist flyer on another officer's bulletin board. It showed a smiling blond child with the caption "MISSING: A future for white children in America."
"The fear is that if people from the inner city come out to this pristine land, it will be ruined," said Melvin Boone, president of the Guardians. "And by saying 'people from the inner city,' who are they talking about?"
"They're talking about me," Mr. Williams replied.
Mr. Boone nodded. "And about me," he said.
 
Fragmented Power
Property Taxes Punish Blacks
 In Roosevelt, 70 of the 92 members of the volunteer fire department are black. But last week the New York State Attorney General disclosed that for 26 years blacks had been kept out of a fraternal group that provided insurance for Roosevelt firefighters. The group was ordered to open its doors and pay $53,000 in retroactive benefits.
While overt racism is not the norm, many experts say that political and institutional barriers work against minority residents.
For example, the tax system on Long Island appears to penalize minorities. According an analysis of Census data, blacks on Long Island and in many other suburbs pay higher rates of property taxes than homeowners in more affluent white communities. Poorer blacks in effect subsidize wealthier whites.
In Suffolk County, blacks pay 17.6 percent higher property taxes than whites on homes of comparable market value, while in Nassau the figure is 5.6 percent. The data, which compared homes bought by blacks and whites in the 1980's, may actually understate the disparity by not including property taxes for longtime homeowners.
Tax experts say the disparity reflects voter pressure that protects the status quo and deters governments from reassessing properties in a timely fashion. As real estate values in many white communities soared throughout the 1980's, homes were seldom reassessed. When growing numbers of minority families were funneled into suburban neighborhoods where values dropped as whites began to flee, their homes were not reassessed downward either.
Overtaxing minority communities contributes to the higher number of foreclosures in these areas, said George Peterson of the Urban Institute. Money that homeowners could have spent on upkeep goes instead to pay bloated tax bills, planning officials say. Roosevelt's residents, like Sheila Caballero, executive director of the I Am Corporation, a nonprofit group that works to build self-esteem among black youngsters, say the neighborhood has only become more run down with the years.
 
No Blacks Elected Countywide
 Neither Nassau nor Suffolk has ever elected a black to countywide office. Nassau is under a court order to overhaul its form of government for failing adequately to represent the county's minority residents, 14 percent of its population.
At the town level, officials are typically elected at large, making it difficult for black or Hispanic people to be elected or to win support for issues important to their neighborhoods.
Ms. Caballero, who has campaigned for a youth center in Roosevelt, says the Hempstead Town Board, which elected its first black member last year, is consistently more attuned to the wealthier voters of Garden City. "Everywhere we turn, we're in a box, and we can't figure out how to get out of that box," she said.
 
The Next Generation
Patchwork Quilt Of School Districts
 In the public schools, too, many minority residents say they are ill served by a patchwork of school districts that protects local control over enrollment, programs and curriculum. The combination replicates in suburbia the disparities that the New York State Department of Education recently said most glaringly divide school districts in white, middle class suburbs from minority, low-income urban districts.
Recently, Raymond Mattry, a program coordinator for I Am, took some Roosevelt students to Plainview-Old Bethpage High School, where the New York Civil Liberties Union had come for an anti-hate workshop. Akilah Watkins, a junior from Roosevelt, seemed shocked by the contrast between her own high school and Plainview, with its almost all-white student body.
At Roosevelt, library books from the 1930's describe the Treaty of Versailles as the last word in arms limitation. The football team works out in a cramped room lighted by a bare bulb, on equipment that Joseph Vito confesses he borrowed from his town's recreation center. ("I don't think they noticed it's gone," the gym teacher said, ducking his head in embarrassment.)
At Plainview, the science chairman, Saul Reine, shows off his newest addition: a dedicated computer network that he was able to buy despite budget tightening.
"If you walked into our high school, you'd be surprised," Ms. Watkins told the audience. "It isn't anything like this."
During a later tour of Plainview-Old Bethpage, Gail Weinstein, an assistant principal, described extra steps the school takes to help students succeed: a ninth period set aside for remedial help and teachers monitoring the halls, both of which are written into the teacher contract.
The library door was open, the tables were filled with students. In the weight room, where one wall was covered with mirrors, a custodian dropped to his knees upon seeing some chewing gum on the carpet. "Oh, terrible," he mumbled and scraped it clean.
"There's a misconception that affluent communities don't have problems," Mr. Reine said. "They do. It's just we have a safety net to catch the children, to help them when they fall."
At both schools, students said that segregation created a gap in their education. "We aren't exposed to people of a different race," Ms. Watkins said.
At Plainview-Old Bethpage, student officers were discussing several proposals at a recent meeting: establishing an anti-vandalism fund, sectioning off a lounge in the cafeteria, helping the environmental club.
None of the youths expressed any defeatism until the subject was race. The students said they missed contact with black and Hispanic people, but suggested such exposure should have begun in elementary school.
"I think it would be a good thing, but I can't see it happening," said Shari Glockner, student vice president. "I feel so sheltered in this community."

HEADLINE: States Moving to Ease Tax Burden

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
From Maine to California, nearly a score of states are moving to cut taxes, while several others are taking steps to shift levies sharply away from a reliance on local property taxes.
As a consequence, 1994 is shaping up as the first year since 1985 in which the total weight of taxes imposed by state governments is expected to ease, a report being published today says. 
 "The season for cutting state taxes is here," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany and author of the report. "I'm surprised. I thought there would be very few tax cuts this year, but it's pretty widespread."
Heading the parade is Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who enacted the first stage and proposed the second in her pledge to cut New Jersey income tax rates by 30 percent over three years. If the entire plan is approved by the Legislature, it would represent the largest overall reduction in a state's taxes in the 1990's.
 
Few States Increasing Taxes
 But Governor Whitman is far from alone. Lower taxes in one form or another are on the agenda in almost half the states across the country.
In particular, several states in the Northeast -- New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- are worried about further losses of people and jobs. Those worries have prompted them to compete for business with New Jersey and lower-tax states in other regions by offering tax cuts that, while much smaller, are often directed at encouraging companies to create jobs.
New Jersey and New Mexico have adopted first installments on multiyear tax reduction programs, and 17 other states are considering plans to lower taxes. Only a handful of states, including Alaska, Hawaii and Vermont, are considering tax increases.
Reasons for tax cut proposals vary from state to state. But a common thread is the improving national economy, which has fattened state coffers across the country.
 
'The No. 1 Frustration'
 With the recession over almost everywhere except in California and parts of New England, many governors, including several seeking re-election this year, are in a position to offer at least modest tax reductions before the voters go to the polls in the fall. Even in California, Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed a $135 million package to reduce taxes for those with incomes under $40,000 and offer companies a $1,000 tax cut for each new job created.
Republicans are more likely to offer state tax reductions. Democrats are joining in to promise some tax relief to a constituency of mostly middle-class residents often hard-pressed to maintain their standard of living.
"We're in a semi-tax-revolt mode here in Wisconsin," said Walter J. Kunicki, speaker of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly. It recently approved the speaker's proposal to eliminate local property taxes to finance education. "Rising property taxes are the number one frustration, driving farmers off their farms, the elderly out of their homes and essentially basing the quality of education upon where you are born," Mr. Kunicki said.
In a broader context, Vic Fingerhut, a Democratic poll taker and political consultant, argued that the pressure to limit both taxes and state spending reflects a two-decades-long squeeze on the earnings of average workers.
 
Property Tax Out of Favor
 "Democrats have been forced to act more like Republicans because of the decline in real incomes," he said. "Families want to hold on to every penny they have and that makes it really tough for the public sector."
Frank Luntz, a Republican poll taker, said Democrats and Republican incumbents alike "want to be on the side of the taxpayer when they go into an election season, not the side of the tax collector."
Wisconsin's Democrats want to follow Michigan's lead and replace lost property tax revenues with other revenue sources. Oregon and Nebraska, among others, introduced property tax relief in recent years. South Carolina, Idaho and Vermont are considering measures that would either cut property taxes or partly replace them with other revenue.
"There is a very significant trend in many states away from the property tax," said Scott Mackey of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. "Rightly or wrongly, it is perceived as particularly unfair."
 
Tax Breaks for Businesses
 An even more popular choice for tax reductions these days are state taxes on business.
"States increasingly feel they are in a very competitive marketplace for jobs," said Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich. "Business today is much more footloose. That places very intense pressures on states to escalate the economic incentive war."
To be sure, the scale of the proposed state tax cuts for 1994 are comparatively modest. With no change in taxes, state revenues should reach about $390 billion in the coming fiscal year, according to Mr. Gold of the state study center. Over all, state tax changes enacted this year are likely to add up to less than $3 billion in reductions.
That compares with a net state tax increase of $1.1 billion last year and $1.4 billion in 1992. The recession years of 1990 and 1991 took a heavy toll of state budgets, prompting states to increase taxes by $9.2 billion in 1990 and $14.4 billion in 1991, the center's research shows. The figures do not take account of local taxes.
Still, state taxes rarely fall at all. The last year in which state taxes declined was in 1985, when a booming economy allowed lawmakers to cut taxes by a net $1.3 billion while still expanding government services.
Since the beginning of the 1960's, the only period other than 1985 in which taxes were reduced was from 1978 to 1979. Ignited by the Proposition 13 property tax revolt in California, some states sharply cut taxes, while others reined in spending and held back on tax increases.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cancels Talks With North Korea Over Atom Inspections

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The United States today canceled high-level talks with North Korea scheduled for next week and stepped up planning for military exercises with South Korea because of the North's refusal to permit international monitors to complete their inspection of a key nuclear installation.
The action brought Washington full-circle in its long negotiations over efforts to stop North Korea's suspected program to develop nuclear weapons. 
 When North Korea allowed international inspectors to visit its sites two weeks ago, the Clinton Administration presented the move as a potential breakthrough. But then North Korea refused to allow monitors to take some samples from its plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon. Now, even optimists in the Administration are beginning to lose hope that a diplomatic solution will be reached.
A South Korean official said there was only "a slim chance" that the North Koreans would relent and allow the inspections soon.
 
Energy Agency Meets Monday
 Representatives to the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, plan to take up the inspection issue on Monday. Administration officials said the agency's board of governors was expected to issue a final demand that Pyongyang allow the inspectors to return to finish their work. If the North Koreans refuse, the board is likely to recommend that the matter be referred to the United Nations Security Council so it can consider imposing economic sanctions.
"This time the North went too far," an Administration official said. "There are no more carrots. We pushed the limit with our Feb. 25 agreement."
American and South Korean officials consulted today on holding the joint military exercise the two countries customarily conduct in the spring to rehearse the defense of South Korea. The exercise was suspended for this year on condition that the North Koreans allow the inspections to proceed and agree to an exchange of envoys with the South, neither of which has occurred.
A South Korean official, who asked not to be identified, noted that his Government had publicly committed itself to proceeding with the exercise if the North Koreans balked at allowing the inspections. He said his Government would have "no choice" but to go ahead with the exercise if the Atomic Energy Agency determined that North Korea would not yield on nuclear inspection, but added that the timing of the exercise remained a question.
 
Curbs on Scheduling
 The exercise is commonly held in the early part of the year before the onset of the planting season in South Korea so it does not interfere with farming. If it is not held soon, a State Department official said, Washington and Seoul will have to wait until the fall.
Washington, however, would have other ways to show its disapproval of the North Korean stance. Navy officials said two aircraft carriers were in the Northern Pacific. American ships could conduct exercises in the Sea of Japan as a signal that the United States has the means to enforce economic sanctions.
Providing details about the inspections, officials said the Atomic Energy Agency specified in advance what sort of monitoring it wanted to conduct at North Korea's seven officially disclosed nuclear sites. The North Koreans agreed to the plan.
Once the inspections were under way, however, the monitors encountered problems when they sought to take samples from the plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang. The North Koreans allowed some samples to be taken but stopped the inspectors from taking others.
Adding to the suspicions, one of the seals that inspectors had placed on nuclear equipment in the reprocessing plant was discovered to have been broken. "There was an association between the broken seal and the need to take the sample," an Administration official said.
That raised the possibility that the North Koreans had used the plant to handle plutonium it had produced or had reprocessed plutonium from a secret supply of fuel rods that it had previously removed from the reactor.
Washington complained about the restrictions on the inspectors, hoping that they would be allowed to finish their work before they left North Korea. But the North refused.
While officials said the North Korea stance had led the Administration to cancel the high-level talks, which were scheduled to begin in Geneva on Monday, the State Department officially kept open the slimmest of hopes that the talks might yet proceed.
"It would appear that that meeting on Monday is now doubtful," said a State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry. "I don't see how it's going to happen."
The failure of diplomatic efforts would make economic sanctions the main means of compelling North Korea to submit its nuclear installations to proper inspection.
 
Asians Cool to Sanctions
 But Asian nations have always been reluctant to support sanctions for diplomatic and economic reasons, and this has reinforced the ambivalence in the Administration about taking forceful action to contain North Korean nuclear development efforts.
The support of China would be crucial because it is a member of the Security Council and has a long border with North Korea. But China has never been supportive of sanctions, and American relations with Beijing are strained.
Japan is also reluctant to support measures to cut off financial transfers to North Korea from Koreans living in Japan.
A South Korean official said it was important to "keep the dialogue open" between North and South Korea and noted that talks between the two sides on the exchange of envoys are scheduled to continue on Saturday.
Mr. McCurry said Secretary of State Warren Christopher was encouraged to pursue diplomacy during his recent trip to China and Japan. "I cannot say in either location there was enthusiasm about sanctions," he said.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Is Taking Rapid Road to Recovery

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 16

 BODY:
Two months after it was jolted by one of the most powerful and costliest earthquakes to hit the United States, Los Angeles is making a fast recovery.
Southern California's economy, already showing signs of pulling out of recession, is getting a jump start from the $15 billion in reconstruction aid that has started flowing in: $11.5 billion in Federal and state money and $3.5 billion in insurance payments. In June, Californians will vote on a $2 billion bond issue for quake repairs. 
 The latest unemployment survey uncovered a significant post-quake dip in joblessness in Los Angeles in February, to 9.7 percent from 11 percent.
Nancy Bolton, who specializes in the California economy for the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "It's a one-shot thing, not a permanent creation of jobs and markets, but every little bit helps when you've been through what Southern California has been through."
 
Segue Into Economic Pickup?
 While unemployment might start to rise again once the reconstruction winds down, the setback might not be particularly great, Ms. Bolton said, because the economy could be producing more jobs here by early summer.
Today, workers are rebuilding Angelenos' freeways with a headlong vengeance and are hammering dawn to dusk on crunched houses, offices and malls.
True, a few residents have fled, hastened by the hundreds of aftershocks that cause no new damage but are a reminder that the "big one" is still to come. Many people have lost jobs, homes and businesses and will not soon recover, if ever.
But for the most part, Los Angeles is picking itself up off the mat one more time after being floored earlier by recession, riots, fires and mud slides.
"I'm toughing it out, and I'm going to make it," said Laura D'Angelo, the owner of Kids At Heart, a children's novelty store in the Northridge area of the San Fernando Valley, the epicenter of the quake.
"I'm open for business even though the ceiling is still sagging and one wall is propped up," said Ms. D'Angelo, whose store was closed only six days. "I don't say things are good. Not yet. Sales are off at least 30 percent."
The quake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, left 61 people dead, 9,000 injured and 25,000 homeless. It seriously damaged more than 30,000 houses, apartments and businesses, many beyond repair, and left perhaps 250,000 others with minor damage.
State disaster officials still do not know how many jobs and businesses have been permanently lost. Nor have they been able to compute lost wages and sales, though initial indications are that tourism, an economic pillar of the region, is holding up well. Gov. Pete Wilson has estimated the overall cost of the quake at more than $20 billion.
Despite such losses, the recovery effort is providing a much-needed economic boost, as often happens in disasters. It is creating jobs in construction and markets to offset some costs of the destruction.
More than 450,000 applications for disaster aid have been submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a national record in requests for recovery money, and the agency has so far handed out $870 million. After investigators uncovered a few early cases of fraud, officials said they had begun careful cross-checks for bogus applications.
The people who lost their homes in the quake have found new homes -- there was an 8 percent housing surplus at the time of the quake -- or they have moved in with friends or relatives. Frequently, it is a spare, uncomfortable and costly existence, but it is a step back toward normality.
 
'It's a Good Life'
 "Our house is in danger of collapsing, so we sleep in what's left of the garage," George Wolfus, a Northridge optometrist, said this week. "We lost all of our china, and so we're eating off paper plates. Eventually, we'll get it all back together. It's a good life."
But Mr. Wolfus has still not been able to repair and reopen his office.
"I can't take much more of this because I've got no cash flow," he said. "The damage is so bad that I may eventually have to move to a new building. But places are opening up everywhere as more repairs get done."
The progress is not difficult to track.
The yellow barrier tape that building inspectors strung around badly cracked structures is steadily coming down. Disappearing, too, are the plywood and plastic sheets nailed up to cover collapsed walls and smashed windows.
In the Los Angeles areas worst hit by the tremor -- the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood -- and in the adjacent city of Santa Monica, every street and shopping plaza is crowded with contractors' trucks loaded with lumber and brick.
"Before the quake, business was bad and I was doing maybe one job a month," said Joel Johnston of Johnston's Construction. "Now I'm doing two or three a week. Things are at a nice pace."
Lest anyone miss the recovery, many malls and stores have hung bright orange banners that proclaim "Open!" and "We're Back!"
While insurance will cover a good part of the quake damage -- 40 percent of the structures in the Los Angeles area are covered to some degree -- many property owners still face substantial repair bills. Quake insurance policies, which cost about $2 for each $1,000 of coverage, typically carry deductibles of 10 percent or more.
"My damage turns out to be just exactly the amount of my deductible -- $30,000," said Alan Holleb, a screenwriter whose $300,000 house in Santa Monica was badly cracked. "It's going to be a financial strain."
For the moment, Mr. Holleb is making do with his own patching work. He has been unable to find a contractor who is not booked with other quake recovery jobs.
Perhaps the most telling sign of recovery is the repair work on a half-dozen crippling breaks and 200 less serious cracks and strains in the region's 600 miles of freeways. The contractors, promised a big bonus for completing the job early, are well ahead of schedule.
State highway officials say the break in the Santa Monica Freeway, which runs west from downtown to the Pacific Ocean, will be repaired by May, a month early. The crumpled spans have been hauled off and the framework is up for pouring new concrete.
 
Road Work Ahead of Schedule
 "Normally a break like this would take a year to repair," said Jerry Baxter, district director for the California Transportation Department, "but we're going to get it done in just four months."
The rebuilding of the collapsed intersection of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, north of Los Angeles near Santa Clarita, is proceeding more slowly. Because that intersection incorporates soaring overpasses, the reconstruction will not be complete until the end of the year.
In the meantime, how bad are traffic jams?
Ever resourceful when it comes to the automobile, Angelenos have found ways to work around most of the breaks, reducing to 20 minutes the average delay in commuting to work. In the days immediately after the quake, 90-minute delays were common.
Back then, in a burst of "telecommuting," many people began working out of their homes or neighborhood offices, communicating with their headquarters via computers. But the drivers quickly drifted back to their old commuting habits as traffic delays were reduced.
The widespread damage the quake inflicted on freeways has impelled state officials to speed up a lagging $1 billion program to strengthen highway bridges throughout California so that they will be less subject to tremors. No bridge that had already been strengthened was damaged on Jan. 17.
Computing the cost of repairing a damaged freeway or house has been difficult enough; figuring up the psychic damage is all but impossible.
"There's still a lot of anxiety and fear," said Dr. Patricia Mendoza, the director of a counseling program set up after the quake by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.
At that time the project received more than 100 calls an hour. Two months later, it still gets as least 250 calls a day.
 
Pyschological Troubles
 "They're more intense and they take longer to handle now," Dr. Mendoza said. He said callers tell of sleep deprivation, an abiding emptiness after losing worldly possessions, suicidal impulses and hours spent worrying about the "big one," the giant earthquake that seismologists say is inevitable here because of geologic pressures building deep in rock stratas.
Jan Farquhar, a medical technician, has not requested counseling, but she said the quake had left her "a nervous wreck."
"Sometimes I wake up in the night just scared to death," Ms. Farquhar said. "I keep wondering when the next quake is going to hit."
She has decided not to wait around for it. "I've been thinking about moving to Georgia," she said, "and now I'm going to do it."
Though solid numbers are hard to come by, moving companies report a post-quake increase in moves to other states.
But earthquake experts say the migration will probably not last. They note that San Francisco, Tokyo and other cities hit by quakes initially experienced some flight but within a few months began to add population.
For those Angelenos who have decided to wait for the big one, there is a new niche store in the Glendale Galleria in San Fernando Valley, not far from the epicenter of the quake. It is called Be Ready Disaster Preparedness and offers everything from dried food to hard hats. It also sells pepper spray to chase off looters.

HEADLINE: Despite Foe, Burmese Junta Finds a Silver Lining

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
The generals who run Myanmar in many ways hold a tighter grip on the country than at any time since their 1988 crackdown on the democracy movement, even as they ponder whether to open negotiations with the woman who has threatened to end the military's decades in power.
Their foe is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner who is now in her fifth year under house arrest in the capital, Yangon. 
 While the junta has ruled out early talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, military commanders have conceded that they may eventually want to open up some sort of dialogue with her. In February, she was permitted her first non-family foreign visitor since 1989, an American Congressman. The military's sudden willingness to consider talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has puzzled some diplomats and Burma scholars if only because the situation for the generals had otherwise seemed so promising.
 
Good News for the Junta
 Recently, there has been no shortage of encouraging news for the junta. The long-stagnant Burmese economy is growing, bolstered by the discovery of natural gas offshore and market reforms; the military has reached peace agreements with several ethnic rebel groups; the army has found a reliable arms supplier across the border in China, and the opposition movement once led by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been all but crushed, its leaders either still in prison or too frightened to act.
"We do not like the army, but we cannot deny that it is in control," said a member of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, which won a landslide victory in a national election in 1990 that was voided by the military. "Aung San Suu Kyi is the last hope of the people."
Diplomats are hoping that the decision to allow Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to break her silence indicates a new pragmatism on the part of Myanmar's military leadership, particularly Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the steely-eyed director of military intelligence who appears to head the junta.
 
End of an Era
 "This may be the sign that the Ne Win era is over," said a diplomat, referring to Gen. Ne Win, the military leader whose isolationist policies during more than a quarter-century in power turned the country this resource-rich country into one of the poorest nations on earth. General Ne Win, who is in his 80's, is said to continue to play an important advisory role to the Government.
"Khin Nyunt and those around him may have decided that it is time for Burma to re-enter the world," another diplomat said, using the former name of Myanmar. "Not because they have to. Perhaps just because it is embarrassing for the generals to be such pariahs in the world."
Admired for his intelligence and feared for the security apparatus he leads, General Khin Nyunt seems to understand the dangers posed to his own position in the junta should he act unilaterally in dealing with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. He is not, therefore, moving quickly to accept the offer of talks with the democracy leader.
He emphasized in an interview on March 6 that the decision must be made by all of his colleagues in the Government, and that it would take time. "This is not a matter to be taken up lightly," he said.
Yet even as he dismissed Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as a woman "who has no political background in this country" and whose loyalty to Myanmar was in question because she had lived abroad much of her life, he said that he had recently sent senior military officers "who report directly to me" to talk with her in hope of some sort of dialogue.
 
Seeks Better Relations With U.S.
 For the first time, he seemed to suggest reasons for the junta's willingness to make concessions to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, including its desire for normal diplomatic and trade ties with the United States, which has led the international campaign to isolate Myanmar because of its dismal human rights record.
"Prior to 1988, relations between Myanmar and the United States were always very close," the general said. "And we want to go back to that relationship." The United States has cut off all aid to Myanmar and has refused to post an ambassador here for several years.
The junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, formally took power in 1988, replacing what was then a civilian-led but military-dominated Government. The generals assumed total control of the Government in the midst of a bloody army crackdown on democracy demonstrations, in which soldiers are believed to have killed 2,000 to 5,000 followers of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
From the day the junta took power, foreign governments and human rights groups have been blistering in their criticism. In February, a special human rights investigator for the United Nations, Yozu Yokota, asserted that "atrocities are being committed consistently and on a wide scale by the soldiers of the Myanmar Army."
In January, Amnesty International reported that while there had been "certain incremental improvements" in the human rights situation in Myanmar, torture and other abuses by the military were still common.
 
Central Planning Abandoned
 The junta has won praise for one of its policies -- its decision to abandon 30 years of central planning, known as the "Burmese Way to Socialism," and embrace the free market.
The result is most obvious in the streets of the major cities. Yangon, -- still better known to the outside world by its former name, Rangoon -- now pulsates with capitalist energy.
Market stalls are overflowing with imported goods, most of them from neighboring China and Thailand, and the city's streets, once empty, are crowded with new foreign cars. Private hotels and restaurants have opened. Because farmers are now free to sell at market prices, there were bumper crops last year, including a near-record rice harvest.
 
What Price Silence?
 "It's like China," said an engineering student at Yangon University, once the center for the democracy movement and today a virtual armed camp, with plainclothes military intelligence officers believed to be on every corner of the campus. The student looked repeatedly over his shoulder as he whispered to a stranger. "The Government is trying to buy our silence with a better economy," he said.
According to official statistics, the economy grew last year by 10.9 percent. While many foreign embassies believe the figure to be overstated, the true figure -- perhaps 4 to 5 percent -- is still impressive after several years in which the economy stagnated or shrank.
The economy is expected to be strengthened over the next several years by revenues from large deposits of natural gas recently detected offshore. A consortium that includes the French energy company Total is reported to have discovered at least five trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Andaman Sea, worth billions of dollars.
Investors from several neighboring countries are looking more seriously at Myanmar. "Should you be interested in one person or in 42 million people?" the Minister for National Planning, Brig. Gen. David O. Abel, said when asked about Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. "Investment is growing. Business people aren't interested in politics."

HEADLINE: As the Boss Goes, So Goes the Secretary: Is It Bias?

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Women in professional jobs have workplace issues like the glass ceiling and the mommy track.
But now there is one for secretaries: rug-ranking. 
 "If the secretary's pay is based on her boss's status, not on the content of her job, that's rug-ranking -- treating her as a perk like the size of his office or the quality of the carpet on his floor," said N. Elizabeth Fried, a labor consultant based in Dublin, Ohio. "Secretaries are the only ones in the corporate world whose pay is directly linked to the boss. Instead of a career path of their own, most secretaries have had a hitch-your-wagon-to-a-star reward system."
Though women have advanced into many male-dominated fields, 3.5 million women work as secretaries, making secretarial work the largest job category for women nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Some managers see nothing wrong with paying secretaries on the basis of their boss's status. Those who work for high-level bosses generally have high-level responsibilities and access to confidential information, these managers say. They also point out that many people within a business rise and fall with their mentors, even where there is no direct link between their boss's status and their pay.
Rug-ranking bothers many advocates for women in the workplace, however; they find it altogether too reminiscent of the days when women were legally chattel and socially dependent. And banking on someone else's success can be just as perilous in the working world as in the domestic one: a private secretary displaced by her boss's demotion or retirement can be left in the lurch just as much as a homemaker is displaced by divorce or widowhood.
"It's just like the woman who marries the successful man and gets the better home," said Karen Nussbaum, director of the Women's Bureau of the Labor Department, and founder of 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women. "Women workers need to have objective standards on which they can rise, and their pay should be based on skill levels and job responsibilities."
Many large corporations have got the message. For a variety of reasons -- sensitivity to women's issues, fear of litigation, changing economics and reshaped secretarial duties -- they are quietly revising the way they pay secretaries, adopting compensation standards based more on job content.
Last year, Xerox began evaluating and paying secretaries based on the duties they perform, not on the level of manager to whom they report.
"The recommendations came from a team, made up mostly of secretaries, who studied the issue for a long time," said Tom Abbott, a Xerox spokesman. "Another thing they recommended was that they be called administrative assistants, which we now do."
 
New Roles for Secretaries
 Feminist concerns aside, rug-ranking may be on its way to extinction because most secretarial work itself is being transformed.
"The connection to an individual boss is becoming much less common," Ms. Nussbaum said. "With more bosses learning to do their own data entry, and downsizing, most secretaries now work for a half-dozen different bosses, far away in another room, or even in another building."
Ms. Fried, who has surveyed secretarial compensation periodically since 1988, has found a significant move away from rug-ranking since she began her questioning. In her 1993 survey of 478 companies, only 28.7 percent based secretarial pay solely on the level of the manager, compared with 46.9 percent in the 1988 survey.
"I think the whole issue of compensation in pink-collar positions is something corporations are looking at," said Paul Salvatore, an employment lawyer in New York. "Where there's an alleged inequity, employers know a plaintiff's lawyer will not be far behind."
 
Legal Challenges
 Rug-ranking has not often led to litigation, in part because the system has worked well for so many secretaries who stayed with one boss for many years, earning higher pay as the boss climbed the corporate ladder.
But in an era of corporate reorganizations and reduced workforces -- and at a time when voice mail and word-processors have made private secretaries a dwindling breed -- the system works less well.
And recently, in a few scattered cases across the country, rug-ranking has created legal headaches for corporations.
Elaine Truskoski, an executive secretary at ESPN, the television sports network based in Bristol, Conn., filed a legal complaint alleging sex discrimination after her boss was demoted in a corporate reorganization -- and so was she.
"It was ridiculous," said Ms. Truskoski, who had had a private office as secretary to an executive vice president, Allan B. Connal. "My job skills didn't change when he got demoted. And no one else in the department got dropped a grade because he was gone. It was like I was his personal property."
 
Complaint Withdrawn
 Ms. Truskoski, 46, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging that because the rug-ranking system applied only to secretaries (all the ESPN secretaries were women), it was a form of sex discrimination.
She withdrew the complaint after ESPN promised to end the practice. But then ESPN put her to work photocopying all day, gave her 30 days to find a job within the company comparable to her old one -- though none were available -- and finally dismissed her.
Michael Soltys, a spokesman for ESPN, said that Ms. Truskoski had been offered three secretarial jobs at the same pay, but not as an executive secretary.
But Ms. Truskoski filed suit in Federal court, contending that the company was unfairly retaliating for her complaint about the pay system. Last spring, she won reinstatement to a secretarial job paying $30,000 a year and was awarded $115,000 to pay her legal bills.
Since then, a few other secretaries have made similar claims. Usually they involved a boss retiring and the secretary being displaced by the new boss's secretary.
"One of my clients has a case where an executive retired, and his replacement wanted to bring her own secretary with her," said Greg Rasin, a New York employment lawyer. "They offered the old secretary a position for a lower executive, and they didn't cut her salary, but they did red-circle it, so she wouldn't get a raise again soon. She has filed a complaint."
 
'An Ego Thing for Boss'
 Mr. Rasin said he was not asked for advice until after the fact, but he said he would not have advised the company to behave any differently.
"I don't think this is discrimination; I do think a person has the right to bring their own secretary," he said. "I don't see that this situation is so different from what happens when I.B.M. names a new chief executive officer and suddenly there's a lot of people in high levels resigning. It may not be as formal as with secretaries, but lots of people are linked to their bosses."
Still, some plaintiff lawyers who handle employment litigation say that even if rug-ranking is not found to be a form of sex discrimination, the practice may be vulnerable to class-action lawsuits based on the idea of comparable worth, namely that jobs of comparable difficulty should be paid comparably.
"I think it's mostly an ego thing for the boss: their name on the door, their rug on the floor, their secretary gets more," said Judith Vladeck, a New York employment lawyer. "It isn't really about paying secretaries for their work."

HEADLINE: Budget Wizardry in New Jersey

 BODY:
Popular, yes. Prudent, no. That describes Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's first budget.
She has delivered what she promised New Jersey voters. She is cutting taxes without at the same time cutting school and municipal aid in a way that forces property tax increases. But she works this wizardry with a large dose of gimmicks to cover a deficit that her tax cuts enlarged. 
 Mrs. Whitman won election on a promise to slash personal income taxes 30 percent. Even before tipping her hand on spending cuts, she persuaded the Legislature to approve an initial tax cut. Now, in her budget message, she seeks another.
For the year starting July 1, Governor Whitman outlined $15.5 billion of state spending, close to the current level -- a clear break from the past pattern of yearly increases, and no small accomplishment. In the details, she proposes to trim a little here and add a little there, still not revealing basic priorities.
She spoke of "remaking government" but proposed only to kill two agencies with small budgets, phase out support for public TV and sell two marinas. On some counts her ax was well aimed, like eliminating an outdated state subsidy to public employees.
Mrs. Whitman had also promised she would not cut municipal or school aid, so local jurisdictions would not be forced to raise property taxes. Her budget holds to this promise with imprudent gimmickry. It reduces state aid, though without injury to municipal or school budgets, because it would also reduce their annual contributions to their pension and health plans.
Since the Governor would not tinker with the pension plans themselves, this simply postpones contributions to another day -- and another governor. Meanwhile, local authorities say they must raise property taxes if state aid is not increased -- because they are already committed to paying higher salaries.
Mrs. Whitman also resorts to a bundle of one-shot revenues, of the sort she criticized in her campaign against Gov. Jim Florio. These are unspent deposits totaling $85 million in state trust funds -- for things like pollution prevention, recycling and relief for children with catastrophic illness. These will be a help in balancing this year's budget, but no help for the future. Indeed, they pose potential future problems if the state economy is in another recession when the money is needed.
Mrs. Whitman made her tax-cut promise late in last fall's campaign, when she was trailing. That promise now drives her budget. It is obviously popular. But she has yet to devise a long-term plan free of gimmicks.

The Poly Lobby

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
The "poly lobby" the legion of psychological charlatans who claim their machines can unerringly detect lying -- suffered a severe setback when it was revealed that Aldrich Ames, the accused Russian mole, passed two polygraph exams.
The merchants of sweat at the F.B.I. moved quickly to protect their livelihood by putting out word that the machines worked -- but that incompetent C.I.A. polygraphers had read the results wrong. 
 The C.I.A. angrily disputes this leak from the poly lobby even as it reviews old cardiovascular charts of top officials. This leads to a Catch-22: Nobody can tell who's lying because each side knows how to beat the lie detector.
Washington's reliance on this device, which often wrongly accuses nervous truth-tellers and clears cool liars, may have led to the execution of 10 or more of our agents in Moscow.
Consider the possible fallout, if spymaster Kryuchkov followed the usual tradecraft: Before arresting our spies during the middle and late 80's, the K.G.B. fed false data for years to these doomed agents. No wonder C.I.A. analysts completely misread the size of the Soviet economy, which led them to egregiously mis-estimate the percentage going to armaments, and finally to the greatest intelligence fiasco of the cold war: failing to predict the likelihood of Soviet economic collapse.
I remember going out to Langley during the William Webster directorship for an on-the-record argument on this central subject; his deputy, Robert Gates, mightily resisted the appointment of a "team B" of eminent private economists to challenge the disinformation being swallowed by his analysts.
Now the C.I.A. is on a belated molehunt to find higher-ups who advanced Aldrich Ames's career. The world is turned upside down: Golitsyn is more credible, Nosenko less; Angleton was right and Colby tragically wrong; Yurchenko was not a real defector but a dangle. Among our best espionage writers, the legendary Epstein looks wiser than Wise.
As red-faced security teams retrace the feline steps, let us hope they remember the cost in agents' blood and agency failure of foolish reliance on the merchants of sweat.
Incredibly, however, the well-connected poly lobby has hornswoggled a group of Clintonites charged a year ago with a review of security procedures at C.I.A., N.S.A. and Defense. In its recent report, the section on polygraphs is an invitation to further undermine national security while diminishing personal freedom.
After accurately stating "there is no physiological response that is unique to deception," the report on "Redefining Security" then proceeds with exquisite evenhandedness.
Among the polygraph's "advantages": It scares those untrained in ways to beat the machine, sometimes eliciting admissions of guilt without the use of physical torture; it has been praised in a series of self-serving reports by the poly lobby; and it is supposedly "cost effective," saving "the considerable cost and time of conducting a background investigation." (Tell that last to the families of our dead agents.)
The poly's listed drawbacks: "Lack of scientific validity," found in Congressional studies in 1983 and 1991, and "unless the validity of the process can be demonstrated, there is nothing to prevent a practiced deceiver from passing a polygraph examination." More to the essence of American justice: "there will be occasions in which innocent people are falsely accused and guilty people avoid detection."
Then a sentence beginning "also" -- hastily added at the end, after the alleged mole was discovered -- piously decries "overreliance" on polygraphs when financial checks should be undertaken, "increasing the likelihood of spies being hired. . . ."
Does the Clinton panel urge curtailment of this abomination? Just the opposite. It calls for a new West Point for polygraphers; the further infection of the defense establishment with the moral standards of the espionage world; worst, research into "other methods of detecting deception" -- which means forcing brains into PET scans.
The Clintonites, influenced by the poly lobby, became so focused on mechanical defenses that they lost sight of the freedom America seeks to defend.

HEADLINE: Why Take the Half-Step of Clinton Health Plan?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Alliances for Progress" (Op-Ed, March 6), Prof. Paul Starr is on the money in pointing out that "with the rise of managed care, employers now choose which doctors and hospitals their workers and families use," calling this "an extraordinary usurpation: no one would tolerate an employer's dictating its employees' choice of schools or housing." 
 Professor Starr also notes that America's health care system is burdened by "staggering administrative costs" of 40 cents on the dollar. He then states that the health alliances in President Clinton's plan are the best way to fix both problems.
Yes, "the economies of joint purchasing" might "cut the high administrative costs that plague the insurance market." But by how much? And presenting consumers several managed care plans wouldn't give us what we want. Is it much of an improvement to let insurance companies, rather than employers, tell us what health care providers we can use, even with a choice of plans?
Look at it this way: Today I'm healthy. I don't know if I'll get sick next year, much less what specialists an illness may require. So my choice of a health plan will be like a shot in the dark, perhaps on a friend's recommendation, or maybe just because it's the least expensive. What happens if I become ill and am not favorably impressed with the plan's services? I'll be stuck with it until the next "open enrollment" to make a switch. And, if I've recovered by then, I will be no wiser in judging the merits of other plans competing in our mythical health care "free market."
It's odd that Mr. Starr reviews only Representative Jim Cooper's bill and a talked-about opening of Medicare to those younger than 65 as alternatives to the Clinton proposal. There is a better solution: the Wellstone-McDermott-Conyers single-payer bill (S. 491, H.R. 1200). Many experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, say it will save much more money than the President's plan. Better yet, instead of a choice of insurance plans (all containing financial barriers like co-payments and deductibles), it will give consumers what they really want: full freedom to choose their health care providers -- with no out-of-pocket expenses for medical services.

Inflation Data Hurt Gold; Dollar Drifts a Little Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower in light trading yesterday after showing little reaction to a Government report of low inflation. But the report on February's Consumer Price Index depressed the prices of gold and other precious metals.
The Labor Department reported that February consumer prices rose 0.3 percent, an annualized rate of 3.3 percent. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, and so the dollar showed almost no reaction after release of the much-anticipated report, traders said. 
 The consumer price survey followed Tuesday's Producer Price Index, a measure of inflation on the wholesale level. The producer price report showed an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in February, but when food and energy were excluded, the gain was one-tenth of 1 percent.
"Certainly, the question is, where is the inflation?" Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at Chemical Bank, said.
Dealers had expected the dollar to rise if the reports showed greater-than-expected inflation. They reasoned that the Federal Reserve would respond to signs of inflation by pushing up short-term interest rates to cool economic activity.
The higher rates would make the dollar more valuable against other currencies. With that possibility less likely, the bond market rallied, pushing down the yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond to 6.80 percent from 6.89 percent on Tuesday.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted yesterday at 106.05 Japanese yen, down from 106.10 yen on Tuesday. It also fell to 1.6885 German marks from 1.6965 marks. The British pound advanced to $1.4945 from $1.49075.
At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $2, to $385.60 an ounce, while May silver fell 8.6 cents, to $5.402 an ounce. April platinum dropped $3, to $403.40 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange
The reports of low inflation led gold investors to ignore news that a strike at South Africa's richest mine had entered a third day. The mine's owner had said output could be affected if the strike went beyond four days. Peter Cardillo, director of research for Westfalia Investments in New York, predicted, "Given the fundamentals and present world economic situation, prices are going to remain in the doldrums unless something unforeseen happens."

HEADLINE: Congressional Economist Backs Arms Budget Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Congress's chief economist said today that the Pentagon's $1.2 trillion long-range budget was sufficient to pay for the troops and equipment the military says it needs to carry out its future fighting strategy.
The official, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the House Armed Services Committee that the Defense Department might have overstated projected savings from base closings and underestimated environmental cleanup expenses and possible cost overruns on new weapons. But he said the budget office was "relatively sanguine" about the affordability of the plan. 
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has said the Pentagon's budget through 1999 would be short by $20 billion, largely because inflation estimates are higher than originally projected. But Mr. Reischauer seemed to play down the shortage today, saying that even if the inflation estimates turned out to be true, they amounted to only about 2 percent of the long-range budget.
"By our judgment, the force structure and the budget are roughly consistent, although there is a lot of uncertainty," Mr. Reischauer said.
 
Importance of Endorsement
 The endorsement from Mr. Reischauer, who has challenged the military's budget projections in the past, is important because lawmakers from both parties, and even some of America's senior military commanders, have criticized the Pentagon's plan as unaffordable or unworkable.
Lawmakers listened somewhat skeptically to Mr. Reischauer's analysis. Some Republicans and conservative Democrats say the Administration is cutting too far, too fast for the military to meet its worst-case strategy of fighting two regional wars simultaneously.
"I am convinced that there are significant mismatches between the Clinton defense strategy and the Clinton defense program and budget," said Representative Floyd D. Spence, Republican of South Carolina.
Liberal Democrats contend that the Pentagon could cut more without undermining national security. "With real defense spending projected to remain above 80 percent of the cold war average, we must ask whether defense spending has really been cut as far as possible without undue military risk," said Representative Ronald V. Dellums, a California Democrat who heads the committee.
The Administration's plan cuts $100 billion from what the Bush Administration proposed to spend through 1999, but it backs the same two-war strategy.
Mr. Reischauer said the Pentagon could cut another $23 billion over five years and still meet the requirement to fight two wars.
The budget office focused most of its analysis on the Pentagon's assumptions, and the possible flaws in its approach. In addition to the potential shortfalls because of inflation, Mr. Reischauer said the Pentagon might have overestimated savings from base closings by as much as $10 billion over five years and underestimated environmental cleanup costs by $20 billion.
 
Other Possible Savings
 He also cited several areas where the Pentagon might reap further savings beyond what was included in the budget plan. The Administration might reduce the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal, resulting in additional savings of $8 billion over the five years, the budget office estimated. In addition, the Pentagon is overhauling the cumbersome system it uses to buy more than $50 billion a year in new weapons. New, more efficient techniques to clean up contaminated sites at military installations could yield more savings.
The budget office also endorsed the Pentagon's assumptions that the declining number of American troops, dropping to 1.4 million by 1999 from 1.7 million now, would be sufficient to fight the two-war strategy.

HEADLINE: Publisher Pulls a Textbook In Furror on Sexual Content

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
A publisher has decided not to sell a health textbook in Texas rather than make hundreds of revisions demanded by state officials after the book was criticized by anti-abortion groups and others for its discussion of condom use, homosexuality and other sexual issues.
The publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Inc., of Austin, Tex., said it was pulling its 700-page high school health text out of the huge Texas textbook market not only because making scores of requested revisions was economically unfeasible but also because ethical issues were at stake. 
 "Some of the mandated revisions are in opposition to the fundamental philosophy of our program and are potentially injurious to the students of Texas," William A. Talkington, Holt's president wrote to Education Commissioner Lionel Meno. "We simply cannot produce a product that does not provide children with adequate instruction on life-threatening issues." The state released the letter on Tuesday.
The publisher's decision came after months of Texas Board of Education hearings in which family-planning, anti-abortion, gay-advocacy, fundamentalist Christian and other groups debated the merits of five health texts, written by Holt and four other publishers.
 
What Was Objectionable
 The board, which buys all textbooks for the state, last month requested a total of 400 revisions in the five texts, with the largest percentage of them for the Holt book, including the deletion of toll-free numbers for gay and lesbian groups and for teen-age suicide prevention groups.
The state wanted to see passages on homosexuality abridged, the addition of language describing Texas's sodomy laws and the deletion of a number of clinical illustrations, including a self-examination for testicular cancer and two comparing circumsised and uncircumsised penises.
"This underlines how hard it is getting to produce a textbook that appeals to a general audience and to satisfy all the pressure groups," said Gilbert T. Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council, a private group based in New York that reviews curriculum materials. "Especially in books dealing with health and sex education, highly opinionated, sometimes obsessive people come to the table -- from the homophobic to the libertine -- and publishers are increasingly inclined to retreat from subjects that bring so many marketing headaches."
Holt is the only publisher so far that has decided against making the revisions for Texas, which is planning to spend $7.5 million on the health texts. The other publishers appear to be seeking to comply with the state's requests, said Roger R. Rogalin, vice president of the Association of American Publishers, a trade organization.
 
'They Are Not Happy'
 "I know they are not happy, but they may stay in there," he said.
Textbook sales in Texas represent about 8 percent of the $2.2 billion national market for textbooks. The state is second only to California, which represents about 12 percent. Texas is also one of 22 states in which government committees must approve all texts sold in the state. Because Texas controls such a large market share, publishers often develop texts to meet the standards set by its 15-member Board of Education and then market them nationwide.
Peter Farwell, vice president of Harcourt General Inc, the corporation in Massachusetts that owns Holt, Rinehart and Winston, said yesterday that the changes would have made the book, titled "Holt Health," too expensive.
"When you look at the costs of making the changes, versus the potential sales, it wasn't feasible, especially because the changes made it a Texas-only book," Mr. Farwell said. "We created the book by talking to a lot of administrators and teachers involved in health education, who told us what they felt kids needed to know in order to deal with their health. The changes would have left out issues we feel are important."
Della May Moore, spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Education, said yesterday: "We regret that Holt has left the process, but we have a long cooperation with them and we're sure we'll be working with them again."
For a decade, Texas's official tastes in health education have swung wildly, Mr. Rogalin said. "The problem here is that the state asked for one thing and then changed their mind when the books were all done," he said. "And it was done for political reasons. This was another case in which factions of the religious right are getting more involved in boards of education all over the country."
 
'I Had No Choice'
 Monte S. Hasie, a board member and a stockbroker from Lubbock, was one of those who pressed for the deletions. He said he considered the Holt book unacceptable under any circumstances. He said, "I had no choice but to try to correct them."
Mr. Hasie said he was not opposed to sex education "done appropriately," but considered many passages and sexual illustrations in the Holt text too explicit.
"I didn't think this stuff should be part of the public schools," he said. "They were promoting homosexuality as an acceptable alternative life style and promoting sex as being O.K. if you use a condom. We were going to put Playboy and Penthouse out of business."
Rosemary D. Merriam, a spokeswoman for the Texas Family Planning Association, said that there were 49,000 teen-age pregnancies in the state, the second-highest number in the nation, and that the deletion of family planning information from textbooks could worsen the problem.
"We were upset because Holt's was a well-written book that doesn't talk down to children, and this means there will be less choice for Texas school districts on health education," she said.

Long-Term Rates Fall As Inflation Data Ease

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates on Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday after back-to-back reports showed inflation rising at a restrained pace.
Late in the day the price of the Government's 30-year bond was up 11/16 , to 933/32 , for a yield of 6.80 percent, down from 6.89 percent on Tuesday. Short-term bills and intermediate notes also rallied, with three-month bill rates down to 3.51 percent, and six-month bill rates falling to 3.77 percent, both dropping by four basis points. 
 The yield on an intermediate-term three-year note fell five basis points, to 5.28 percent, while the closely followed 10-year note was down eight basis points, to 6.36 percent.
 
Another Report Coming
 But many traders said they believed it was too early to say whether the recent selloff in the bond market, which drove long-term rates to nearly 7 percent last week, was over.
One reason is that there is still another report on inflation, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve index of regional business activity, scheduled for today.
Although many analysts argue that the Philadelphia index is not a good barometer of price increases, it was the jump in the price components of this index last month that accelerated the slide in bond prices. That pushed the yield up through the 6.50 percent level.
The selloff began on Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25 percent, in an effort to head off any acceleration in inflation.
"Right now market sentiment is in a tug of war, with few new facts to back up the argument on either side," said Matthew Alexy, a government-securities trading specialist at CS First Boston.
 
Uncertainties Remain
 There are still uncertainties, he said, that must be addressed before determining if the selloff is over. One uncertainty is that the market is still unclear about the Fed's policy and whether the central bank will push up short-term interest rates a second time. The Fed's policy-making body meets on Tuesday.
And even if the inflation news remains good, traders and investors have to worry about the pace of economic growth, Mr. Alexy said. The severe winter weather and the California earthquake may be making the pace of growth at the beginning of the year appear slower than it is.
If the spring brings signs of faster growth, inflation worries will pick up again and there could be renewed selling.
But yesterday, after the report that the February Consumer Price Index was up a restrained three-tenths of a percent, investors bought Treasuries as quickly as they sold them when the concerns about inflation were at their peak.
The price index was what the market expected. The core rate, which excludes food and energy, was also up three-tenths of a percent. The energy component was up 1.6 percent, while home fuel oil prices rose 6 percent because of the cold winter.
 
Weather Distorts Data
 Nicocles L. Michas, vice president of research at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross Inc., said the consumer index, like the Producer Price Index on Tuesday, which rose five-tenths of a percent, showed modest price pressures. But he said he thought the market needed at least a month or two to get a handle on the rate of economic growth and potential buildup of inflation pressures. The winter weather, he said, had distorted much of the data from the first two months. "You have to establish a trend, and that may not show itself until at least April," he said.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue Inc., a company in Ashland, Mass., that provides research and analysis for retail and institutional investors, said he thought the producer and consumer indexes should help solidify the markets and calm them after a touch of hysteria.
"The data we're getting is close to reality, which is basically an uptick in inflation," Mr. Frank said. "That means that the more optimistic views in the market will be corrected. Except for temporary spikes, I don't see long-term interest rates much higher than they are right now, and perhaps lower by year end."
 
Housing Starts Slow
 The February housing data yesterday showed housing starts up 4.1 percent, to a 1.3 million annualized level, with January data revised to a drop of 22 percent, from a decline of 17.6 percent.
Some economists said they expected housing to rebound when the bad weather ended, but others were not so optimistic. They noted that the Government's report also showed that applications for building permits were down for the second consecutive month in February, falling 7.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.25 million homes, after declining 8 percent in January.
The Treasury announced a planned $28 billion sale of new two- and five-year notes next Tuesday and Thursday, with the size of the sale unchanged from its last sale. In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered yesterday at a price to yield 4.97 percent, while the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.85 percent.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Is Spurring Mexican Deals in U.S.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 16

 BODY:
During the heated debate last year over approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, critics in the United States warned that the accord would encourage American employers to shift their resources south to Mexico.
Yet in the four months since Congress voted in favor of the agreement, the boldest acquisitions so far have been made by Mexican companies in the United States. 
 Since November, Mexicans have signed multimillion-dollar contracts to buy all or part of a major American bus manufacturer, one of the largest bakeries, and 39 Westin hotels spread across the United States. In some smaller deals in both countries, Mexicans and Americans have formed joint ventures, with the Mexicans retaining majority control. So far, the deals have not caused jobs to cross the border in either direction.
While the free-trade pact did not create financial incentives for Mexican companies to acquire businesses in the United States, it did create a psychological climate that has led some Mexican business owners to believe that they can compete on an equal footing with the Americans. In fact, the groundwork for the biggest projects was laid before the pact was signed, in anticipation that it would indeed take effect on Jan. 1. 1994.
"There probably were some people who thought it was going to be a 100 percent flow from the United States to Mexico," said Daniel Servitje, president of the cookie division of Grupo Industrial Bimbo, which is buying 50 percent of a Texas bakery and forming a joint venture to sell its products in the United States. "If they are surprised because Mexican companies have been aggressive, it's probably because they really haven't devoted much time to understanding our country."
The spate of deals in the wake of the trade agreement cannot compare with the powerful position that United States companies have held in Mexico since before the pact was signed. Companies like Ford and General Motors have operated here for generations, and control the domestic automotive market.
But the recent Mexican acquisitions have drawn attention to a new breed of Mexican businessmen, who say they are ready to compete in the international market. And they have quieted, at least temporarily, concerns that companies in the United States would flood over the border in search of $1-an-hour workers, even if some jobs have been relocated.
The cross-border deals have put the Mexican companies in a position to fight off American competition by moving first to expand their own reach. They are doing this as some American companies going into joint ventures gain access to Mexican industrial practices that they often do not understand or fully trust.
The bakery deal, for example, gives Bimbo (pronounced BEEM-bo), Mexico's largest baking company, a crack at the United States market, in which it has dabbled over the last year selling tortillas.
 
Learning Needed on Both Sides
 "What we felt," Mr. Servitje said, "was that as our two countries strengthened their relationship with Nafta, we, too, had to have a better understanding and knowledge of how the baking industry operates in the States." Mr. Servitje is likely to become a board member of the new joint venture.
Under the terms of the letter of intent signed by Bimbo and Mrs. Baird's Bakeries Inc. of Fort Worth, Bimbo will buy 50 percent of the family-owned company, and together they will form a joint venture in the United States called QFS Foods that will distribute a range of Bimbo bread and cake.
Mrs. Baird's does not intend to sell its products in Mexico for now, but Mr. Servitje said that could change.
The surprising financial strength of the Mexicans in making these acquisitions offers evidence that there is more money in the hands of business and industry here than anyone knew. It proves that Mexicans intend to be major players in the Nafta era.
But while their head start makes Mexican businessmen look smart now, some analysts here fear that American companies who accept a minority stake in order to get into the Mexican market may push for majority ownership once they have a foothold, relegating their Mexican partners to a junior role.
"Foreigners know that in the mid-term, two or three years hence, their technological expertise, their management expertise and their capacity to innovate are going to prevail," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an international consultant in Mexico City. "Eventually, that will give them a chance to dilute Mexican participation in the venture and give them control."
Mr. Servitje of Bimbo does not agree that American companies could wrest control from Mexicans in a few years, because, he says, the Mexican takeovers are based on business common sense.
"In this world of change, anything can go," Mr. Servitje conceded. "It all depends on how strong the company is and how clear are the intentions of its executives."
In another large Mexican-initiated deal, Consorcio Grupo Dina, which a few years ago was owned by the Mexican Government and lost $25 million a year, created one of the first companies to emerge after the approval of Nafta by buying Motor Coach Industries International of Phoenix, which has plants in the United States and Canada.
 
Valuable Technology
 The acquisition gives Dina a greatly expanded market while Mexico battles a domestic recession. It also gives the company access to more advanced technology, which will come in handy as it tries to fight competition from the bus division of Mercedes-Benz.
The recent deal for the Westin hotels may best exemplify the new Mexican corporate spirit. The $708 million transaction was made with a kind of business savvy Americans have not often associated with Mexican companies. Bernardo Dominguez, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Mexico City, has signed a letter of intent to buy a company, with the help of Salomon Brothers and a group of United States and Mexican private investors. The hotel chain is much larger than his own three-resort property in Mexico.
The Westin chain was founded in the United States in 1930. It was sold in 1988 to the Aoki Corporation of Japan, from whom Mr. Dominguez is now buying the 39 hotels.
Such deals have shown how eager Mexican businessmen are to play in the big leagues.
"Now comes the real competition, when that Mexican entrepreneur who can put a few things together no longer has the Government standing in his way," said John P. McCray, an associate professor of strategic management at the University of Texas at San Antonio. "That Mexican works hard; he's got one hell of a lot of endurance, and a lot of family pride."
There is an impetus for the Mexican companies to move fast. The wave of confidence in the trade agreement's wake may not last long, with a presidential election coming in August, a less than fully resolved revolt in the southern state of Chiapas, and persistent talk of a devaluation of the peso -- something that could curb the ability to raise cash.
 
Diverging Views of Mexicans
 Mr. Ramirez, the consultant, commented: "Now they have the resources with which to finance growth over the next few years at a cheap exchange rate. In a sense, they are giving greater values to their own companies, so that when foreign investors come into Mexico in a serious way, the Mexican companies will be worth 50 to 100 percent more than if they had not gone into a joint venture now."
Mr. Ramirez believes that the Mexicans' position of strength will not last long. But Arturo Acevedo Aceves, chief of research at the Vector brokerage house in Mexico City, expects the acquisitions to continue for a while and perhaps gain strength as financial mergers take place, making lenders more sympathetic to Mexican needs.
Other big corporations from the United States made their moves before the trade agreement was signed. Last spring, Anheuser-Busch purchased an 18 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo, one of Mexico's largest brewing companies. Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have bought into Mexican bottlers. And Bell Atlantic announced a billion-dollar purchase of part of the Mexican cellular telephone company Iusacell.
Since the American Congress approved the trade deal, some jobs have indeed moved south, as the pact's opponents predicted. Last Thursday, Nintendo of America relocated some assembly operations for its video games to two border plants in Mexico, laying off 136 workers in Seattle.

HEADLINE: Price Data Show Mild Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Higher charges for energy helped push consumer prices up three-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Government said today. But most economists say they still believe that inflation remains at bay.
"There is little, if any, evidence that inflation is heating up," said Laurence H. Meyer, a consultant in St. Louis. But he added that the trend of progressively less inflation that marked most of the last decade had probably come to an end. 
 The reassuring news on inflation in February comes as the Federal Reserve prepares for a strategy session on interest rates next Tuesday.
 
Home Building Cool
 A separate Government report today showed that the pace at which builders broke ground for homes ticked up only slightly last month after collapse in January.
The cooling in home construction, which had been one of the strongest sectors of the economy in the second half of 1993, and the reduced nervousness about inflation helped the bond market advance, as long-term interest rates dropped sharply. [Page D16.]
Although housing starts were hurt by unusually severe weather in both months, industry specialists said it appeared that rising interest rates had also taken a toll on activity and that the near-boom conditions of 1993 were over. Rates on conventional mortgages have climbed to 7 5/8 percent this month, from a low point of 6 3/4 percent in October.
Unusually strong winter demand for energy was the dominating factor for the Consumer Price Index, as was the case on Tuesday, when the Labor Department reported an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in inflation at the producer level in February. Excluding energy, consumer prices edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent for the second straight month. Producer prices were also almost flat, excluding energy.
The energy component, which accounts for 7 percent of the consumer's market basket and which had risen only once since April, jumped by 1.6 percent in February. But since then, oil prices have fallen.
While the Federal Reserve watches the price indexes, these gauges tend to look backward -- the consumer index's services component is an official lagging indicator -- and the central bank is seeking to head off revived inflation before it appears on the horizon.
Services rose four-tenths of 1 percent in price last month, and 3.3 percent for the three-month periods ending in November and February, the report showed.
 
0.9% Rise in New York
 The New York metropolitan area posted the largest price increase of any of the five big cities for which monthly price figures for February were included in today's report.
The rise in the New York area totaled nine-tenths of 1 percent, mainly because of a jump of 2.3 percent for shelter. Patrick C. Jackman, a department official, said the increase reflected an unusually large number of New Yorkers who moved and whose rent-regulated apartments were thus allowed to fetch higher rents.
Prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in Philadelphia and two-tenths of 1 percent in Chicago, while they were unchanged in Los Angeles and one-tenth of 1 percent lower in San Francisco.
Nationally, the heavily weighted housing component, accounting for 41 percent of the consumer index, rose an exceptionally big four-tenths of 1 percent last month. All household fuels rose, with heating oil up 7.2 percent.
Medical prices advanced three-tenths of 1 percent for the fourth straight month, bringing the 12-month inflation rate for this sector to less than 5 percent for the first time since the early 1970's.
Food prices eased three-tenths of 1 percent, the second consecutive decline, as fresh fruits and vegetables fell 3.4 percent.
 
Transportation Costs Up
 In contrast, transportation costs reversed course and climbed five-tenths of 1 percent on higher prices for gasoline, new cars and finance charges, partly offset by a rare decline for used cars.
The price of apparel, not yet reflecting the introduction of spring lines, eased slightly for the third consecutive month. Clothing prices are now also a bit lower than in February 1993.
With both food and energy excluded, so-called core prices moved up three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as the average for the final three months of last year.
Real average weekly earnings, the department also reported today, fell 1.5 percent last month as a result of a decline in hours worked and higher prices partly offset by a rise in hourly earnings.
The Commerce Department's tally of housing starts showed an annual rate in February of 1,309,000, up 4 percent. But this regained only a small part of the ground lost when starts plummeted by 22 percent in January, to a revised rate of 1,258,000.
David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said activity lost to severe weather might not be made up now that mortgage rates had climbed nearly a percentage point from their lows.
"It seems pretty clear that the bottom of the interest rate cycle occurred last fall," Mr. Seiders said.
Housing starts rose in the Northeast and South last month, but declined in the West and Midwest.
Permits for future construction fell by 7.8 percent last month, to a rate of 1,251,000. Only the Northeast managed a gain, and it was a slim one from a very depressed pace.
Figures on shipments of mobile homes, which lag a month, showed producers delivering at a 316,000 annual rate in January, up 2.6 percent from December.

HEADLINE: For a Furniture Maker, a Taste of a Global Future

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Miss.

 BODY:
It was August, when this part of the country sags under a slathering of humidity and heat. T. Scott Berry was up the road from here at a dealers show in Tupelo, displaying some of the furniture he makes. He was in the back of a warehouse, not doing much of anything, when he got a call from the desk. A man was there to see him.
"So I go out and there's this guy standing there," Mr. Berry recalled. "I almost threw him out, but I said, O.K., I'll talk to him." 
 Three months later, at the invitation of the Chinese man who came to call, Mr. Berry, a descendant of Arkansas mule traders and Mississippi furniture makers, was in Beijing trying to figure out how to work China into plans for his family company, the Johnston Tombigbee Furniture Manufacturing Company. He returned with a deal to have the Chinese make chairs for him; the first shipment will arrive next month.
 
Entering the Global Market
 "I was trying to move as fast as possible," said Mr. Berry, 40, a tousle-haired redhead who charges like a halfback through his vast factories, clambering over conveyor belts, scrutinizing racks of rough wood bedposts and calling out to many of his 1,000 employees by name. "It could be the future."
Here in Columbus, a town of 23,800 people, of white-columned antebellum mansions and a main street languorous in its pedestrian traffic, the global economy seems to intrude in a scattering of Japanese cars, a handful of Chinese restaurants and not much else. But for Johnston Tombigbee, the future probably lies as much in China -- in cities like Dalian, in what used to be Manchuria -- as it does in America's Southern heartland.
China, with Asia's fastest-growing economy, has aggressively sought out international markets for its growing industries, including furniture. Chinese business officials are diligently trolling the waters of trade shows, scrutinizing merchandise, buttonholing manufacturers, looking for deals. And furniture makers like Mr. Berry are often obliging in an effort to lower manufacturing costs and increase profitability.
Mr. Berry's new Chinese partner, a man named Yang Yijian, who he said preferred to be called James, quoted Johnston Tombigbee prices for the chairs that were two-thirds lower than what Mr. Berry pays in countries like Brazil.
"I said to myself, where is cheap labor and massive amounts of raw material?" Mr. Berry said. "I thought it was Brazil, but now it looks like it's China."
Although Taiwan has exported furniture to the United States for several years, China has made a big push only in the last year, according to Bruce Plantz, the executive editor of FDM Furniture Design and Manufacturing, a trade publication.
For the first nine months of 1993, furniture imports from China were worth $225 million, up 56 percent over the corresponding period of 1992. And combined imports from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines were up 52 percent from 1992, to $687 million. During 1993, the value of the United States wholesale residential furniture market was about $18 billion, according to Mr. Plantz.
For Johnston Tombigbee, the cheap labor and materials in China are the backbone of an expansion strategy. With reported sales of $40 million last year, Johnston Tombigbee ranks 139th among the top 300 makers of furniture in America, according to FDM. But Mr. Berry says he intended to move up the ladder by expanding into higher-end furniture, which he has started to make in Honduras and the Philippines, and by reducing the number of parts in other finished products to make them easier to produce in China.
"I see my furniture being made mostly of foreign-made parts," Mr. Berry said. "I would say that foreign countries like China will play a big part of it. With all the growing Government intervention in manufacturing, whether it's the E.P.A., OSHA, workers' comp, we'll get to the point where we'll be an assembler and packager. That's what will happen."
 
A Company's Revival
 Seven years ago, Johnston Tombigbee had all but collapsed, largely the result of family warfare and not a small bit of neglect and weak management, Mr. Berry said. He had quit the family business -- "I had all I could stand," he recalled -- and was wandering around Brazil, looking for someone to make some furniture he could sell in the United States. Then his wife called.
"I told him the company was going to be sold," Ruth Berry said, "and I told him to get home and fix it. It was worse than moribund."
Mr. Berry hurried back to Columbus and the shards of the family business.
The factories, including the original brick factory, were silent. There were no orders, no piles of lumber, not a piece of furniture. And 1,000 people were out of work. "It was pretty scary," Mr. Berry said, "but when you're 34, 35, you're bold." Boldness, in this case, meant three plans for the business, ranging from liquidation of remaining assets, to a partial restart of the factories coupled with some importing of furniture, to a complete start-up of all the factories.
"We did a full-blown massive restart," he said, "and that's where we are now."
Johnston Tombigbee is among the small, specialized furniture makers battling for the great American middle-class home market. The company, in its modest prime, specialized in wooden beds, dressers and side tables -- what is known in the trade as "promotional bedroom furniture."
While the company still produces wood furniture cheaply, China holds the promise of even lower costs. That is why Mr. Berry agreed to give the Chinese an opportunity to make what is known as a sled chair, about the simplest and cheapest wood chair made. It sells for about $50. With a padded fabric-covered seat and back held together by two square-shaped wooden frames, the bottoms of the squares mimic runners on a sled.
Mr. Berry recalled telling Yang Yijian during his visit to Tupelo that "when you get back, I'll fax you a print of the chair and send you a sample so you can make it."
"He quoted me an outstanding price on it, an unbelievable price," Mr. Berry said. "This chair costs me $12.50 from Brazil. James gave me a quote of $4.50."
Mr. Yang told Mr. Berry that he represented the Guangming Furniture Company in Dalian in northeast China. Within a month, the company had shipped some samples of a sled chair frame to Mr. Berry in Columbus. He sent back some of his bedposts and bought a ticket to Beijing.
"When I showed up at the Grand Hotel, they had these bedposts all made for me," Mr. Berry said. "It was pretty clear that they could absolutely do what I needed done."
While a good proportion of the furniture sold in the United States is made abroad, none of the sort of nine-piece ensembles that grace the bedrooms of middle America are manufactured there. "There are too many parts," Mr. Berry said. "So far it doesn't make any sense."
But with the prices Guangming is offering, Mr. Berry is redesigning his furniture to reduce the number of parts for pieces like dressers, and to make the parts interchangeable.
Mr. Berry still finds his relationship with Mr. Yang somewhat enigmatic. "I'm not sure who I'm dealing with with James Yang to a certain extent," he confessed. "But it was obvious to me that James was the kind of guy I could make a relationship with and the kind of guy I could do business with."
Next month, Mr. Yang will come here with a vice president from the Guangdong Development Bank, one of China's new lending institutions that is looking for investment deals with American companies. Mr. Berry said that while sled chairs and bedposts are a start, a deal with a Chinese bank to build a furniture factory in China is now a growing possibility.
Mr. Berry said he did not yet know the long-term implications of foreign manufacturing on his business or on the size of his work force. "We can't meet all our orders as is," he said.
Yet he is proceeding with caution. "I just put my toe in it with the sled chair," he said. "But now, I'm up to my knees, but cautiously, to see if any sharks are out there. But if this works, it's a gold mine."

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed as Dow Falls on Late Selling

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
At last, stock traders believed good news about inflation yesterday. After some hesitation, most leading stock indicators followed the trend in the resurgent bond market and closed higher in active trading.
The exception was the Dow Jones industrial average, the most closely watched stock barometer, which had climbed steadily into positive territory by 2:30 P.M. But in the session's final seconds, the Dow dropped more than 13 points, probably because of high-speed computer trading. 
 At 4 P.M., the Dow appeared to have closed at 3,861.39, up 11.8 points, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets. But that did not reckon with a late deluge of sell orders. By the time the Big Board's Superdot computer system caught up, the Dow industrials had dropped 1.44 points to 3,848.15.
 
Huge Computer Program
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, estimated that a huge computer program involving as many as 6 million shares was executed close to or at the end of the session. Which Wall Street firm executed the program will not be known for weeks, when securities firms disclose trading records.
Philip H. Smyth, a market analyst at Birinyi, said such "market on close" sell programs are sometimes used near "witching hours." There will be one Friday, when three sets of futures and options expire.
Birinyi Associates has detected 18 other late declines in the Dow, probably resulting from computer trading, since January 1993. The largest occurred on June 18, 1993, when four such computer programs helped drag down the Dow some 25 points.
These programs often involve leading stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, which overlap with most, if not all, of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, Mr. Smyth said. The programs are often favored by passive investors who want a portfolio that simply mirrors the broad market.
 
S.& P. 500 Rises 2.41
 The S.& P. 500 rose 2.41 points, to 469.42, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.47 points, to 798.99. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.35 points, to 260.34, on volume of 306.8 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks, 1,346 to 803, on the Big Board. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.69 point, to 469.82.
Meanwhile, stock traders' counterparts in the bond market bid bond prices up and dragged yields down for the third time in four sessions. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond reached 6.80 percent, down 9 basis points, or hundredths of a point, from the previous day.
Both the Consumer Price Index, released yesterday, and the Producer Price Index, released on Tuesday, showed scant inflation. Rising inflation hurts both stocks and bonds.
The Federal Reserve Board is to meet next Tuesday to decide, among other things, its policy on interest rates, in effect, a referendum on inflation. This week's inflation data will be among the critical factors that the Fed governors will consider.
 
Interest Rates Drive Markets
 Interest rates on Government bonds have been the major factor driving both the stock and bond markets, said Martin D. Sass, a money manager. His M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. manages $2.1 billion, apportioned as $600 million in stock, $1.4 billion in bonds and $100 million in cash.
His firm's researchers have concluded, after looking at 15 years of data, that every half-point rise or fall in the 10-year Government bond leads to a 200-point rise or fall in the Dow industrials.
So what will happen in today's session? Mr. Sass laughed and said: "I hate to make day-to-day projections. The stock market day-to-day is almost a random event."
The most active stock yesterday was Centex Telemanagement, with 12.5 million shares traded. It rose 5 5/8, to 10 1/2, after MFS Communications announced a tender offer of $9 a share. Centex manages phone services for corporations, and MFS offers local phone connections to corporations.
Telefonos de Mexico's American depository receipts were the second most actively traded stock yesterday at 10 million shares. Telmex, whose shares fell 1 3/8 on Tuesday, recovered yesterday, rising 7/8, to 61 3/4, possibly on bargain hunting.
