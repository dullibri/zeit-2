HEADLINE: Thailand Evicts 4,000 Hmong to Laos

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
In a quick, one-day operation, Thai soldiers with riot shields and clubs evicted more than 4,000 Hmong asylum seekers from a holding center Monday and forcibly repatriated them to Laos, where they say they face retribution from their government.
 ''They have been sent on their way back to Laos,'' said the government's chief spokesman, Panitan Wattanayagorn. ''They have officers waiting for them in Laos already, and Thai officers are accompanying them in the process.'' 
 Thailand acted despite protests from the United Nations and human rights groups. Even as the soldiers were trucking the Hmong over the Mekong River into Laos, the United States government was calling on the Thai government to stop.
 ''We deeply regret this serious violation of the international humanitarian principles that Thailand has long been known for championing,'' said a State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly. ''The United States strongly urges Thai authorities to suspend this operation.''
 But Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Thailand had received assurances that the returnees would be well treated and ''that these Hmong will have a better life.''
 A total of 4,371 men, women and children were removed from the camp and sent by bus for processing, said Sunai Pasuk, the Thailand representative of Human Rights Watch, who has been closely monitoring the eviction, which was closed to reporters.
 He said 130 people identified as leaders and their bodyguards had resisted repatriation and were being detained in a mobile prison before being handed over to the Lao military at the Friendship Bridge, which spans the Mekong River.
 The United States has a special interest in the fate of the Hmong, a mountain tribal group that was enlisted by the Central Intelligence Agency during the 1960s in a ''secret war'' in Laos.
 ''They could walk in the mountains like the wind,'' William Lair, the operative who recruited them, said in an interview last year. ''I thought at the time what great guerrillas these people would be.''
 They died in large numbers on a mission to tie down units of the Communist Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese soldiers and helping to rescue downed American pilots.
 The 4,000 asylum seekers are a last remnant of as many as 300,000 Hmong who have fled Laos over the years since the Communist victory in 1975. Half of these were settled in the United States, and many others returned to Laos, most of them voluntarily.
 The group deported on Monday included economic migrants as well as others who fit the definition of refugees with ''a well-founded fear'' of persecution, experts said.
 Some carry the scars of apparent battle wounds from an insurgency of several hundred fighters that continues today in the mountains of Laos. Several older Hmong were among those who had fought with the Americans.
 Reporters were kept away from the holding center at Huay Nam Khao, in the remote hills of Phetchabun Province 200 miles north of Bangkok, but some witnesses said they saw a large number of children in the covered trucks of deportees.
 The military began by rounding up ''potential troublemakers'' after cutting off cellphone service and restricting food and medical care to the camp for several days, said Mr. Sunai of Human Rights Watch.
 ''Such coercive, intimidating and brutal measures are clearly the opposite of the concept of 'voluntary repatriation,''' he said. ''As a result of what Thailand has done to the Lao Hmong today, Prime Minister Abhisit sinks Thailand's record on contempt for human rights and international law to a new low.''
 One year ago, soon after Mr. Abhisit took office, Thailand faced criticism from rights groups when its military turned away 1,000 ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, setting them adrift at sea in boats without motors.
 Mr. Panitan said Thailand had received assurances from the Lao government that the returnees would be granted amnesty on their return.
 ''We have no reason to believe that they will be harmed,'' he said. ''We have been repatriating Laotian Hmong for the past few years. This is the 19th time, and they seem to be fine. Their living conditions seem to be better when they return.''
 The current group of 4,000 is the largest to be sent back to Laos in many years. The Thai government has restricted access to them, barring reporters from the camp for the past three years and turning down requests by the United Nations to interview them to determine their eligibility for resettlement abroad.
 In May the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders pulled its workers out of the camp because of what it said were abusive conditions, including ''arbitrary detention of influential leaders to pressure refugees into a 'voluntary' return to Laos.''
 A separate group of 158 Hmong asylum seekers being held near the border with Laos has been interviewed by the United Nations, which has determined that they are ''people of concern'' who could face persecution if they are deported. The Thai government has said that this group will also eventually be sent back to Laos.

HEADLINE: Iran's War on Its People

 BODY:
We are inspired by the bravery of Iranians who continue to demand their rights, even in the face of their government's relentless and shameful brutality. Iran's leaders are so desperate to repel a rising tide of popular unrest that even Ashura -- which marks the death of Shiite Islam's holiest martyr -- is no longer sacred. 
 The anniversary, which fell on Sunday, is supposed to be a time of peaceful commemoration. Even during war, Iranian governments have honored the prohibitions against violence during a two-month period surrounding Ashura. Tehran's current rulers have proved again that their only belief is in their own survival.
 On Sunday, the police opened fire on a crowd of protesters, reportedly killing at least 10 people, and arrested hundreds more. Government forces are also believed to be behind the assassination of Ali Moussavi, nephew of the opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leading candidate in June's fraudulent presidential election. On Monday, opposition Web sites reported that several opposition figures were detained, including former Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi; Emad Baghi, a human rights activist; and three of Mr. Moussavi's top aides.
 The government is trying hard to keep the Iranian people, and the world, from learning the full extent of its abuses. Foreign correspondents have largely been barred from the country. Journalists there risk their lives when they dare to do their jobs. Redha al-Basha, a Syrian journalist with Dubai TV, has been reported missing. He was last seen in the midst of the protests, surrounded by security forces. He must be released unharmed. Thankfully there are still many people -- journalists, bloggers, concerned citizens with cellphone cameras -- who are determined to get the word out. 
 The protests began when Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, stole the June election for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The government killed and imprisoned protesters and many feared the movement would flag. It hasn't, and the demands for reform seem to have won significant support from important members of Iran's clerical class. 
 President Obama is right to remain open to dialogue with Iran and to continue looking for a peaceful resolution to the dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. He is also right to condemn the violence against Iranian civilians and to place the United States on their side, as he did in his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize and in comments on Monday.
 The government still appears to have firm control of the main levers of power, including the brutish Revolutionary Guard and the Basij militia. But Ayatollah Khameini -- who helped lead the 1979 revolution against the shah -- should not ignore the echoes of history when protesters defy the death blows of security forces and chant ''Death to the dictator'' on the streets of Tehran. 
 The Iranian people are demanding what all people have a right to demand: basic freedoms, economic security, and the knowledge that their government is committed to protecting, not killing its citizens.

HEADLINE: An Underground Campaign

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 LAWMAKERS debating health care reform in recent weeks haven't been reticent about blaming trial lawyers for driving up the nation's medical costs by pursuing large malpractice awards.
 Trying to fend off any limits to patient lawsuits, the lawyers decided to press their arguments in a new location -- the subway system here. Lawmakers and their aides arriving on Capitol Hill by Metro, as the subway is known, pass through a blizzard of brightly colored ads on the platform and the walls and hanging from the ceiling.
 They bear the lawyers' message that nearly 100,000 people die each year from medical errors, and that tort reform won't fix the health care system. 
 ''We wanted a prominent space to educate key people about the number of people who are killed annually by medical errors,'' said Anthony Tarricone, president of the American Association for Justice, formerly known as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
 The lawyers, who introduced their subway campaign this month, anticipated that they would be a target for senators looking to control health care costs, said Mr. Tarricone, a Boston plaintiffs' lawyer. During the debate, several senators introduced amendments, including one called ''loser pays'' -- meaning the person who loses the lawsuit must pay all the legal costs -- to clamp down on medical liability lawsuits. None was adopted.
 The trial lawyers argue in the ads that patients need legal recourse because preventable medical errors are the sixth-leading cause of death in America, killing at least 98,000 people a year. (The ads' tag line is: ''Tell Congress to Put Patients First. There Are 98,000 Reasons Why You Should.'') The campaign Web site, 98000reasons.org, calls that number equivalent to two 737s crashing every day for a year -- and the ads include two small images of planes. 
 The figure comes from a 1999 report called ''To Err Is Human,'' from the federal Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. This is the most recent nationwide figure, said Mr. Tarricone, who added that the number of deaths and injuries could be higher because the ''problem has only gotten worse.''
 Business groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, say litigation creates cost beyond settlements and awards and the malpractice insurance to cover them. They say it also encourages doctors to practice ''defensive medicine'' -- practices like ordering more tests than needed in order to avoid being called negligent. But the lawsuits are the flashpoint. 
 ''The threat of these 'jackpot justice' suits against doctors is one of the reasons health insurance premiums are rising faster than the rate of inflation,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona.
 Senators introduced a number of amendments in recent weeks to limit awards in medical malpractice lawsuits and lawyers' fees -- typically about one-third of a jury award -- and to restrict patients' ability to bring lawsuits against hospitals and other health care providers. None has passed, but plaintiffs' lawyers say they are very much in Congress's crosshairs. 
 ''A lot of folks have been asked to sacrifice under this legislation,'' Mr. Kyl said on the floor of the Senate. ''The one constituency that hasn't been asked to sacrifice anything is the trial lawyers.''
 And it's not just Congress: Trial lawyers were alarmed in September when the White House said it would support state-run programs to test alternatives to litigation in malpractice claims.
 The lawyers' ads started in print, on the radio and online in September. Advertising began this month at Union Station, a transit hub on Capitol Hill near the Senate buildings, to coincide with the Senate's debate. 
 The bright blue ads in the subway feature yellow sans-serif type urging Congress ''to put patients first.'' Large banners at the Union Station Metro station tell the stories of two plaintiffs, including Blake Fought, 19, of Blacksburg, Va., who died when an intravenous tube was removed incorrectly.
 Their stories and six other cases are included on the ''98,000 reasons'' Web site. The campaign also includes print ads once a week in the newspapers covering Congress, including Politico, The Hill and Roll Call. In addition, the group advertises online with The Huffington Post, The Washington Post and Politico, among other sites, and sponsors a public radio station's Capitol news roundup during morning drive time.
 But the subway blitz is drawing the most notice. Blackbarn Media, a Web development and design firm in Alexandria, Va., created the campaign. Sarah Fox, the creative director, said she used ''vibrant, almost shocking colors'' to emphasize ''the effects of medical mistakes on real people. And we chose clean typography to focus on the staggering number of deaths.''
 The American Association for Justice solicited its members to support its campaign, which included buying a monthlong ''station saturation'' package that CBS Outdoor sells for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. 
 Union Station has 33 positions, including billboardlike posters, canvas banners and freestanding backlit displays -- along with vinyl applications on floors and pillars. ''Our most popular stations are Union Station and Capitol South, on the other side of the Capitol, as well as the Pentagon station, which is a favorite of defense contractors,'' said Ron Rydstrom, the transit authority's marketing director.
 Trial lawyers are not the only advocacy group to try to influence decision makers this way. The National Association of Broadcasters, the Cancer Action Network and the Pew Charitable Trust have also bought Metro ad space, he said. The cost varies. The trial lawyers paid about $100,000 for the month.
 ''We're easy to demonize,'' Mr. Tarricone said, ''but the price was well worth it to make sure the rights of patients aren't bargaining chips in this process.''

HEADLINE: Should Old Articles Be Forgot

BYLINE: By WILLIAM FALK. 
William Falk is the editor in chief of The Week magazine.

 BODY:
OVER the past year, Americans have spent an average of 11.8 hours a day consuming information, sucking up, in aggregate, 3.6 zettabytes of data and 10,845 trillion words. That, said the University of California, San Diego, researcher who computed these figures, is triple the amount of ''content'' that we consumed in 1980.
 Thanks to this gargantuan download from all forms of media, we now know vastly more than we did a year ago about bankers' bonuses, Sarah Palin, ''death panels,'' Glenn Beck, where Barack Obama was born, Jon and Kate, and cocktail waitresses who have spent quality time with Tiger Woods. 
 Hidden among that avalanche of diverting gigabytes were some developments of more enduring significance. Here are just a few: 
 ROBOTIC WARFARE The use of drones became a central part of the American antiterrorism strategy this year, with President Obama sanctioning about 50 Predator strikes -- more than George W. Bush approved in his entire second term. As Jane Mayer of The New Yorker reported earlier this year, most of the targets of these assassinations were in the tribal regions of Pakistan, with as many as 500 people killed. Those killed in the missile attacks include many high-ranking Qaeda and Taliban figures and dozens of women and children who lived with them or happened to be nearby. 
 The military is so enthusiastic about these remotely piloted planes that it is building new ones as fast as it can (including a more heavily armed version called the Reaper). It also announced that it will deploy drones to scour the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean for drug smugglers. What's more, the government is now working on ''nano'' drones the size of a hummingbird, which would be able to pursue targets into homes and buildings.
 CAR CRAZY IN CHINA This year, China surpassed the United States as the largest consumer of that iconic American machine -- the automobile. China's emerging middle class has fallen in love with cars, with sales up more than 40 percent over 2008; there are now long waiting lists for the coolest and hottest models, ranging from the Buick LaCrosse to BMWs. Automakers are expected to sell 12.8 million cars and light trucks in China this year -- 2.5 million more than in America. 
 China's auto boom, of course, has major implications for global efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The nation of 1.3 billion is on pace to double its consumption of gasoline and diesel over the next decade.
 REAL WORKING WIVES In more than a third of American households, women are now the chief breadwinners. This reversal of traditional roles was accelerated by a brutal two-year recession, in which 75 percent of all jobs lost were held by men. 
 Even in homes where both spouses work, one in four wives now earns more than her husband. That's partly because of rising education levels among women, falling salaries in manufacturing and blue-collar jobs and the growing need for both spouses to bring home a paycheck. Wives' earnings, said Kristin Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, have become ''critical to keeping families afloat.''
 A NEW SOURCE OF STEM CELLS Scientists re-engineered regular skin cells from mice into stem cells that are just as versatile as embryonic stem cells. To demonstrate that these re-engineered adult cells could be used to create any kind of cell in the body, the Chinese research team inserted just a few of them into placental tissue and developed them into healthy mice. ''We have gone from science fiction to reality,'' said Robert Lanza, a cell biologist. 
 If further research on the new technique proves successful, it may create a viable means for scientists to use a patient's own tissue to produce a replacement liver, kidney or other organ -- without the ethical concerns attached to the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. But reprogramming adult cells opens the door to a new ethical problem: a rogue scientist could use the method to create human beings from a few cells scraped from a person's arm. ''All the pieces are there for serious abuse,'' Mr. Lanza said.
 TEEMING WITH PLANETS Astronomers are closing in on identifying distant worlds that may have the right conditions to support life. Techniques for detecting ''exoplanets'' are becoming more sophisticated, and over 400 have been discovered so far -- 30 in October alone. This year brought two particularly intriguing finds. One is Gliese 581d, orbiting a star at a distance that could indicate surface temperatures not so different from Earth's. Astronomers also discovered a ''waterworld'' composed mostly of H2O, which would be a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life if it were just a little farther from its sun. 
 The discovery of Earth-like planets, with water and moderate temperatures, is now so likely that the Vatican held a conference of astrobiologists this year to discuss the theological repercussions of extraterrestrial life. ''If biology is not unique to the Earth, or life elsewhere differs biochemically from our version, or we ever make contact with an intelligent species in the vastness of space, the implications for our self-image will be profound,'' said Chris Impey, a professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona.
 Discovering that we have company in the universe, in fact, might open our eyes to what's important on Earth.

HEADLINE: To Inhibit Inflation, Fed Offers to Set Up Interest-Bearing Deposits

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve on Monday proposed allowing banks to park their reserves at the central bank, a move aimed at weaning the economy off extraordinary infusions of cash and curbing inflation. 
 The Fed would create the equivalent of a certificate of deposit that pays interest to banks for keeping some of their reserves -- which are currently estimated at more than $1 trillion -- for up to one year. That would help offset some of the $2.2 trillion the central bank has fanned out into the economy during the financial crisis. It also would allow the Fed to quickly entice banks to take more money out of circulation in case inflation emerged as a serious threat in the near future.
 The proposal was the latest sign the Fed is intensifying its efforts to scale back the vast amounts of money it pumped into the economy at the height of the crisis. 
 As the economy recovers, Fed officials worry that if banks keep too much cash tied up in reserves that might later lead to a boom in credit and result in inflation. Low interest rates and a weak dollar have raised concerns about rising prices, although the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said inflation is not a near-term danger. 
 Fed officials emphasized that the proposal for the ''term deposit'' program would have no immediate implications for monetary policy, and would probably not go into effect for at least a year. 
 Mr. Bernanke has mentioned it as a possible tool to withdraw money from the economy when it gained momentum.
 For the moment, the proposal is mostly symbolic, said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. He does not consider inflation a significant concern because lending remains weak and banks are still skittish about turning reserves into credit lines.
 ''It will calm folks down that we're not going to have this sudden inflationary pressure,'' Mr. Ely said. ''It gives the Fed a little more control.'' 
 The investments would likely have a maturity of one to six months, and their interest rate would be set through auctions. Banks would not be allowed to withdraw the funds until the term deposits mature. 
 Currently, banks can earn 0.25 percent on their excess reserves by lending them to other institutions. Banks have been reluctant to lend reserves because of increased pressure from policy makers to keep higher amounts of cash in reserves. 
 Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said term deposits could emerge as a popular investment vehicle in the long term, though the immediate effect would most likely be subdued. 
 ''Banks would rather show the Fed as a counterparty than another bank,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''It just looks better in an era when memories of credit problems are quite fresh. And now they earn interest, too.''

Red Flags Ahead
 For Smaller Banks
During the financial crisis, it appeared that America's small banks could do no wrong. President Obama said the world would have been better off if the entire financial system had been more like them. 
 Legislators tried to ease their burden, often at the expense of their bigger competitors. Community bankers even won a meeting last week with the president to try to persuade him to reduce regulatory red tape. 
 But while it's true that the nation's 8,000 small banks avoided the worst excesses of their large rivals and are healthier, they're not yet out of the woods. Most of the 140 banks that failed were small, and regulators expect more to follow. As Bank of America, Citigroup and other hulks of the financial firmament have shored up their balance sheets, the small bank fraternity could see more pain ahead.
 Take net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans -- a measure of the relative health of loan portfolios. For banks with less than $5 billion in assets, these amounted to just 0.25 percent in the third quarter, compared with 1.53 percent at larger banks, according to SNL Financial. But the percentage actually declined somewhat from the second quarter for the big banks. However, it rose to 0.25 percent in the third for the small ones, up from 0.2 percent in the second quarter.
 One of the biggest problems smaller banks face is more exposure to commercial real estate, a sector that investors expect has further to fall. That could result in greater asset write-downs for this corner of banking. Losses on real estate could lead to more failures and easily stymie lending, particularly to smaller businesses.
 Though they account for less than 12 percent of banking assets, financial institutions with less than $1 billion in assets make nearly a third of all loans of $1 million or less to businesses, the Independent Community Bankers Association says. Less lending could have powerful negative consequences for an economy already struggling to rebound.
 For now, America's smaller banks have more capital, make more on their assets and have fewer problem loans. But as defaults in the commercial real estate arena begin in earnest next year -- and consumers continue to feel the economy's pinch -- the relative fortunes of the small fry and leviathans of finance will almost certainly converge.
 A Russian Repeat?
 After a devastating economic crisis, Russia seemed to be changing its ways. But an unexpected rebound in export prices has eased the pressure. As the boom gains strength, memories of tough times are fading fast. So are the reforms. 
 That was the story in 2000. Then, Russia rebounded spectacularly from the 1998 financial crash. It could also be the story for 2010. 
 Russia is poised for economic recovery, but not a particularly healthy one. The country still depends too much on commodity exports. When prices fell, Russia's gross domestic product slumped; G.D.P. is estimated to end the year down by 7.5 percent. But with prices up, the government spending and foreign capital coming into the country, 5 percent growth is possible in 2010. 
 Russia has a few pluses. Its financial system is less indebted than that of more developed peers. Strong neighboring Asian economies are big markets. And the latest crisis has spurred some reforms, including a revival of the moribund privatization program and a re-energized a bid to join the World Trade Organization. A new nuclear weapons treaty with the United States will be welcomed around the world. 
 But the reform drive is largely superficial. Indeed, there is less push than a decade ago. Vladimir V. Putin, now prime minister, has become more of an obstacle than a change agent. The fate of the imprisoned oligarch Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky is an ominous example. His second trial, which should end in the spring, could extend his prison sentence by many years. 
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putin's protege, seems to have the desire to do more, but as yet he lacks the necessary clout. If he does get more authority, the result could be a paralyzing fight with Mr. Putin, rather than big changes. 
 Investors may be willing to overlook the Russian economy's structural woes, but they shouldn't forget the country has had a crisis almost every five years. Watch out in 2013.

HEADLINE: Year of the Tiger And Its 3 Hurdles

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
For China, 2009 was a momentous year. The People's Republic turned 60, and Beijing staved off economic disaster with a staggering 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) stimulus package. The stage is set for an eventful 2010. China's economy is poised to become the world's second largest. But all may not go well. 
 There are three broad concerns for the coming Year of the Tiger on the lunar calendar: inflation, protectionism and inequality. 
 One type of inflation has already arrived. As a result of some $1.5 trillion of government-mandated bank lending in 2009, combined with speculative capital flowing from abroad, the prices of financial assets like stocks and property have exploded. Beijing clocked a record land-sale price in 2009 and Hong Kong a record apartment price. The first batch of stocks on Shenzhen's new growth-stock market doubled on their first day of trading. The second batch, just over a month later, tripled. 
 While asset prices soar and the cost of basic commodities like oil and iron ore remain high by historic standards, retail prices are barely increasing. Many central banks and governments face this confusing situation, and none of them have an obvious solution. A rise in policy interest rates could take cash out of consumers' and producers' pockets, slowing growth to a crawl. In Beijing, that sounds like political suicide. 
 In the semi-controlled Chinese economy, the authorities have turned to restrictions on lending to try to reduce the monetary pressure. But that may not succeed. The strong links between banks and local governments mean new loans don't always go to the most productive channels. 
 Next year's lending target is 25 percent less than 2009's. But perhaps two-thirds of the disbursed money will go to sustain half-finished infrastructure projects, leaving little for new business investment. 
 If tighter policy slows growth too sharply, the government could decide that inflation of any sort is the lesser evil. But monetary instability carries its own political and economic risks. 
 Protectionism could be another problem. Trade skirmishes surfaced in 2009: the United States slapped tariffs on Chinese tires, and China did the same on American and Russian steel. Those are special cases, but the low exchange rate for China's currency can be considered an unfair export subsidy which lures American consumers into overspending. 
 Some economists are already arguing that Chinese currency inaction justifies tariffs for the sake of balancing trade. Disgruntled politicians in Washington could join in, especially if the American unemployment rate, already at 10 percent, keeps rising. They could claim that Chinese production threatens to accelerate global warming. True or not, trade restrictions would severely disrupt China's still export-dependent economy. 
 The third risk, inequality, is the least visible but the most dangerous. It's a genuine issue. The mix of fast-rising asset prices with wages that are hardly budging must be widening the gap between owners and the property-poor proletariat. The reported unemployment rate of 4 percent ignores an estimated 150 million migrant workers, while fewer than 70 percent of graduates have jobs. 
 The biggest worry for policy makers is that an idle and unequal populace will create unrest. A recent survey by the Zhejiang Academy of Social Sciences cited in the South China Morning Post found that 96 percent of respondents ''resent the rich.'' It is no accident that Xinjiang province, which saw riots in 2009, has one of China's biggest wealth gaps. 
 The available measures suggest China is becoming more unequal at an alarming rate. In 1983, China's Gini coefficient, a measure of economic inequality, was 0.28, roughly the same as Sweden, Japan and Germany. By 2007, the Asian Development Bank estimated China's Gini coefficient of 0.47 -- closer to Argentina and Mexico. That pace of acceleration is virtually unheard of. 
 China could probably address each of these three problems, one at a time. Inflation can be micromanaged through a controlled bank system. Protectionism can be quelled with diplomacy, unrest with force. The last 30 years -- in which China's sustained growth has exceeded anything recorded -- is a triumph of mind over matter. But if all three challenges arrive at once, the Year of the Tiger could prove fierce indeed.

HEADLINE: Denver Ski Train's Run Is Ended by Legal Dispute

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Through 69 years of service, since the days of lace-up ski boots and leather straps, the ski train from Denver to the Winter Park ski area carved a deep tradition in the psyche of Colorado's winter landscape. On weekends from the city's Union Station, and through the sunburned apres-ski parties on the way back down, the train evoked an alpine culture before the Interstate, and the mega-resort, and the high-season traffic jam. 
 But now the train may have chugged its last.
 Its new operators, who took over this year after a previous operator had said the money-losing enterprise was unsustainable, abruptly canceled the season on Monday night and said that thousands of tickets bought in advance would be refunded.
 The villain was not the recession, said Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific Holdings, a private company in Chicago that operates excursion and tourism trains in six states and in England, but insurance and legal uncertainty in a dispute with Amtrak, the publicly supported passenger rail provider. 
 Amtrak was to provide engine crews for the line, and has been saying for weeks that Iowa Pacific had not prepared properly for the season and that train safety could not be guaranteed. As a result, Mr. Ellis said, advance bookings had fallen.
 Mr. Ellis said Amtrak had in effect scuttled the ski train by insisting on inordinate liability insurance levels that made operation unviable.
 ''The ski train is heavily reliant on advance bookings, which came to a complete halt last week,'' Mr. Ellis said in a statement. ''In addition to losing the revenue from the initial runs, it became clear that this delay will result in market uncertainty, resulting in insufficient sales for the train to be self-sustaining for this season.''
 Amtrak, which has been vilified here in Denver in recent days for its stance about the ski train -- including in an excoriating editorial in The Denver Post on Sunday -- said in a statement that it was ''willing to bring the ski train back,'' but that Iowa Pacific had been selling tickets before all the contractual arrangements and safety inspections were resolved.
 A spokesman for Amtrak, Marc Magliari, said the insurance issue was partly driven by the number of rail cars and passengers that Iowa Pacific planned to move, which was higher than the previous ski train operation. What had been originally presented as an excursion line, which carried lower insurance premiums, was ultimately deemed by federal rail regulators to be comparable to commuter service, thus requiring higher coverage, Mr. Magliari said.
 Mr. Ellis, asked if he might try again, said that provisions had already been made to have the ski train's cars moved to Iowa Pacific's other tourism lines, and that 13,000 tickets bought in advance would be refunded by the end of the week.
 ''You're asking the guy who's lying on the mat after the sucker punch if he wants to go at it again,'' Mr. Ellis said in a telephone interview. ''If circumstances changed and it became possible for us to reasonably look at again, sure. But at this point we're looking at other opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Study Shows Jobless Rate Varies Widely Across City

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The unemployment rate for New York City has risen to 10 percent and above in recent months, but a new study shows that joblessness ranges from nearly twice that figure in some neighborhoods to only half as much in others. 
 The situation is worst in the East New York section of Brooklyn, where the unemployment rate for the third quarter of this year was 19.2 percent, according to the study, by the Fiscal Policy Institute. That means that almost one-fifth of the adults living in East New York could not find jobs; it does not account for those unemployed residents who did not bother seeking employment. 
 At the other end of the spectrum, not surprisingly, were the neighborhoods that flank Central Park. On the Upper East Side and Upper West Side, near the depths of the recession last quarter, the unemployment rate was just 5.1 percent.
 Manhattan's most populous section, Harlem and Washington Heights, had by far the borough's highest rate of unemployment, at 13.6 percent. In the Bronx, only the southern and central section was worse off, with a rate of 15.7 percent, according to the report.
 James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said that racial disparities also were striking.
 In three of the five boroughs -- the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan -- unemployment among blacks exceeded 15 percent. Unemployment among Hispanics was 15 percent or higher in five neighborhoods. But white unemployment exceeded 15 percent in only one neighborhood -- East New York, where, at 25 percent, it exceeded the rates for blacks and Hispanics.
 The disparity appeared to be most pronounced in the neighborhoods of western Brooklyn, including Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. Nearly half the black men living in that section -- 46 percent -- were out of work, compared with just 3 percent of white men and 7 percent of Hispanic men, according to the study. But among women in western Brooklyn, Hispanics had the highest rate of unemployment, 23 percent, compared with 14 percent for black women and 4 percent for white women.
 Citywide, the unemployment rate for black men was 19.9 percent, compared with 11.9 percent for Hispanic men and 7.6 percent for white men. For black women, the citywide rate was 12.1 percent, compared with 11.6 percent for Hispanic women and just 7.1 percent for white women.
 The city's jobless rate dropped to 10 percent in November, down from 10.3 percent the month before.

HEADLINE: 4 Sunni Guards at Checkpoint in Baghdad Are Found Dead

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and MOHAMMED HUSSEIN; Sa'ad al-Izzi contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Four Awakening Council members were found dead early Tuesday, apparently killed as they stood guard at a checkpoint in a northern neighborhood of the capital, the police said, in a continuation of the escalation of violence against them in recent weeks. 
 Awakening Councils are neighborhood-based groups of Sunnis, many of them former insurgents, who are now paid by the Iraqi government. They are credited, along with the increase in American troops, with helping to diminish violence in Iraq. 
 But 15 Awakening members have been killed around the country this month, including five slain in the same Baghdad neighborhood as those who died in Tuesday's attack. 
 Members of the Awakening Councils, who typically operate checkpoints and provide security in Sunni neighborhoods, are often targets of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and other Sunni extremist groups. They regard the Awakening Councils as traitorous because many Awakening members quit insurgent groups to ally themselves with the United States military and the Iraqi government in return for steady pay.
 The Iraqi government has pledged to find them jobs with the army and the police, but integration with Iraqi security forces has been slow and characterized by mutual mistrust. 
 Instead of getting relatively well-paying jobs with the police or army, many Awakening members are unemployed, while others have been hired as municipal laborers, some working as street sweepers.
 The four Awakening members found dead on Tuesday had been operating a checkpoint in the Mashahda neighborhood in north Baghdad, according to the police and members of the Awakening Councils.
 They were found by other Awakening members around 4 a.m. Three of the men had been fatally shot, while the fourth had been beheaded.
 It was the third attack at an Awakening checkpoint in the Mashahda neighborhood during the past three weeks. On Dec. 7, around 5 a.m., two checkpoints there were overrun by gunmen who killed five Awakening members.
 ''These attacks are aimed at getting rid of us so Al Qaeda can return,'' said Awad al-Halbosi, an Awakening Council leader in the area. ''We have proved that we are qualified enough to get rid of terrorism, but the government does not provide us with decent jobs.'' 
 Also Tuesday, the Iraqi government announced that a court had handed down a death sentence against three men for their roles in a truck bomb in June that killed at least 68 people and wounded nearly 200 others.
 Absul Sattar al-Beriqdar, a spokesman for the Iraqi court system, said the defendants had been arrested in October and had confessed to carrying out the bombing in the northern town of Taza. The men are to be hanged, officials said. No other information about the case was immediately available.
 On Tuesday, a bomb exploded around noon in a parking lot near the Transportation Ministry, wounding seven people, the police said.

HEADLINE: Wholesome Hamlet's Horror Sends a Jolt to the System

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The last shot of Michael Haneke's ''White Ribbon'' is haunting not because it sums up the unnerving, at times horrifying series of events that have filled up the previous 2 hours 25 minutes, but rather because it seems to unfold as if none of them have taken place. Taken alone, the film's final image might conjure a mood of gentle, pastoral nostalgia. Here, in glowing, understated black and white, we glimpse part of a world that used to be. The camera sits inside an austerely beautiful village church that is illuminated by winter morning sunlight, its pews filling with congregants whose dark clothes and weathered faces bespeak hardy old virtues of work, faith and family. 
 By now we know otherwise. The only comfort offered by ''The White Ribbon,'' a chronicle of small-town German life on the eve of World War I, is that the social order it depicts has vanished from the earth. Good riddance to the good old days! But at the same time, Mr. Haneke may intend that sense of distance, of pastness, to be illusory, so that the strangeness of these people and their doings is shadowed by an uncomfortable sense of recognition. We fool ourselves if we think bygones are bygones. We're on a guilt trip down memory lane. And though the road twists and turns and reveals some pretty scenery, in the end we arrive in a familiar place, to be lectured and scolded by a filmmaker whose rich craft disguises the poverty of his ideas. 
 Our guide is the village schoolteacher, played on screen in his relative youth (by Christian Friedel) as an earnest, chubby-faced bumbler and in voice-over narration (by Ernst Jacobi) as a ruminative old man. This teacher, who like most of the adult characters in the film is not referred to by name, is by far the most benign -- if also the most ineffectual -- authority figure in a place that turns out to be a veritable theme park of patriarchal abuses. 
 The wholesome facade of this hamlet, with its tidy brick houses and wind-swept wheat fields, where residents tip their hats and address one another with unfailing formality, masks a carnival of cruelty. Children are beaten and molested. Women are silenced and humiliated. Workplace accidents claim the lives of innocent farmwives. Horses and house pets are maimed, cabbages are wantonly decapitated and the only force more fearsome than the brutality of fathers is the innocence of children. 
 Mr. Haneke, born in 1942 and perhaps the most lauded living European filmmaker with a surname other than Dardenne, traffics in shock and terror, but in a cerebral, systematic way. His films rarely foreshadow their jolts or speed up their plots to generate suspense, but rather proceed, with almost meditative calm, to weave a cocoon of dread around intimations of mystery and implications of violence. 
 ''The White Ribbon,'' which won the Palme d'Or in Cannes and the top European Film Award this year, is a rare foray out of the clamor and anomie of modern urban Europe that is Mr. Haneke's favored setting. The film also marks his return to his native German after a decade of mainly French-language films. In it, he uses the sharp elegance of Christian Berger's monochrome cinematography (achieved by shooting in color, then draining it away), the grammatical precision of old-fashioned speech and the pageantry of period drama to lull and also to inflame the audience's expectations. The effect is something like a ghost story, the horror of which is at once elusive and pervasive. What is happening here? Why is it happening?
 The answer to the first question: a lot of weird stuff. The town doctor (Rainer Bock) is injured when his horse trips over a wire strung across his gate, apparently for just that sinister purpose. That apparently inexplicable crime is followed by others, including the abduction and beating of one small child and the near blinding of another. There are whispers and denunciations, and visits from the police, but no solutions are forthcoming.
 Instead, as suspicions multiply, we are led on a tour of several households, which taken together offer a sociological composite portrait of guilt and repression. The schoolteacher, whose courtship of a milky-fresh young woman named Eva (Leonie Benesch) provides hints of tender comedy, traffics mainly in rumors and surmises while the camera assumes a position of omniscience. (Unless, that is, it is the vehicle for the narrator's retroactive speculation or self-protecting deceit, which is not unthinkable.) 
 In due course we enter the homes of the Baron (Ulrich Tukur), the town's principal employer and landowner; the doctor, a widower with two children and an interesting relationship with the midwife (Susanne Lothar); the steward (Josef Bierbichler); a tenant farmer (Branko Samarovski); and, perhaps most important, the pastor (Burghart Klaussner).
 Each of these men, with the partial exception of the poor farmer, represents a different face of power. And each one, accordingly, manifests his own special brand of awfulness, mistreating those close to him with methods appropriate to his station. The Baron is cold and sarcastic with his wife (Ursina Lardi). The steward beats his children in a state of volcanic rage, while the pastor does the same in a mood of pious sorrow. 
 Monstrous as these daddies are, their children may be worse. A gaggle of towheaded darlings walks through the film, their mild smiles so sinister that they might have wandered in from the 1960 British science-fiction horror chestnut ''Village of the Damned.'' Anyone who has seen Mr. Haneke's ''Cache'' or his twin versions of ''Funny Games'' will be aware that he does not believe in the blamelessness of youth. Quite the contrary: children, in his world, carry the sins of their parents in concentrated, highly toxic form, and are also capable of a pure, motiveless, experimental evil. 
 What will become of these particular blond children, who are either demons or victims, driven to mischief by severe paternal discipline or so intrinsically bad that no punishment could suffice? Do the math: it's 1914. In 20 or 30 years, what do you suppose these children will be up to? Our narrator, well into old age, tells us that he is revisiting the strange events in the village to ''clarify things that happened in our country'' afterward. 
 But ''The White Ribbon'' does the opposite, mystifying the historical phenomenon it purports to investigate. Forget about Weimar inflation and the Treaty of Versailles and whatever else you may have learned in school: Nazism was caused by child abuse. Or maybe by the intrinsic sinfulness of human beings. ''The White Ribbon'' is a whodunit that offers a philosophically and aesthetically unsatisfying answer: everyone. Which is also to say: no one.
 The teacher may be Mr. Haneke's obvious surrogate: an intellectual whose pursuit of the truth is enabled by his inability to change anything. But really the filmmaker is closer to the pastor, his chosen emblem of blindness and hypocrisy. After caning his children for a minor infraction, the pastor makes his oldest son (Leonard Proxauf) and daughter (Maria-Victoria Dragus) wear white ribbons, which serve both as emblems of shame and reminders of the purity of soul they are in danger of sacrificing. ''The White Ribbon'' is offered to its grateful, masochistic audience in a similarly punitive and yet oddly forgiving spirit, as a reminder of just how awful we are and how much worse we used to be.
 ''The White Ribbon'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, violence, repression.

HEADLINE: In the Loftiest of Buildings, High Art Still Finds a Home

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The practice of adorning New York real estate with major sculptures and other artwork stretches back at least as far as the 1930s. And even during today's tough economic times, the tradition is holding up. A number of major works of art have been installed in Midtown Manhattan in the last few months. 
 In October, for example, the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation hung a 5,000-pound rotating sculpture from the ceiling of the atrium of 805 Third Avenue. On the other side of Manhattan, Silverstein Properties has bought a 29-foot-long playground sculpture by Tom Otterness for a new park adjacent to two of its apartment developments on West 42nd Street. 
 At Lever House, the landmark International Style skyscraper by Gordon Bunshaft on Park Avenue, Aby Rosen, a principal of the building's owner, RFR Holding, has offered a quarterly show of art in the lobby and courtyard since 2003. And Park Tower Group recently agreed with Christie's to regularly display sculptures, which would later be auctioned, in the lobby and outdoor plaza of 535 Madison Avenue, a 37-story office building. 
 According to Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York region of CB Richard Ellis and a former deputy chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefellers were among the first New York real estate developers to use outdoor sculpture to beautify their buildings, installing works by Paul Manship at Rockefeller Center and by Jean Dubuffet at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.
 Such art ''has always been the mark of a Class A developer and property,'' she said. ''The Rockefellers set the pace in the 20th century.'' 
 For a noteworthy Class A office building, art can ''provide the right image,'' said Lisa Austin, a Miami-based corporate art consultant. ''If you've got a really beautiful piece of architecture, the art can be the final exclamation point.'' 
 Joel Straus, a corporate art consultant in Chicago, said that sculpture can also add a ''human element.'' He added, ''Often in New York, buildings are overscale; sculpture can bring the scale down.'' 
 Studies done by the Urban Land Institute, a real estate research group, show that ''amenities count, and these can include public art,'' said Maureen McAvey, executive vice president for the institute's initiatives group. ''This is true for both residential and office buildings.'' 
 ''There's always the caveat that the art has to be well done and well thought through,'' she added.
 Cohen Brothers spent $330,000 to acquire and install a 5,000-pound sculpture, made by Christian Eckhart from aluminum, steel and mirror stainless steel, that hangs above the three-story retail atrium at 805 Third Avenue as part of a $14 million renovation of the atrium and adjacent office lobby. There was no art in the atrium before.
 The bronze Otterness playground sculpture -- a giant figure that is 30 feet wide, 29 feet long and 19 feet high, with slides going down one arm and both legs, and 25 six-inch figures crawling over its body -- sits in a new quarter-acre park behind One River Place and Silver Towers, two apartment buildings that occupy the south side of West 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues.
 One River Place opened in 2006. The first stage of Silver Towers opened last June, and it is to be finished next spring. The park, which initially opened in 2000, was closed in 2006, when construction began on Silver Towers; it will reopen in the spring. 
 Larry A. Silverstein, chief executive of Silverstein Properties, said the price for the Otterness sculpture was seven figures, but he would not be more precise. Another person with knowledge of the purchase valued it at $1.2 million. 
 Michelle Isenberg, a corporate art consultant in Hollywood, said in an e-mail message that the Otterness work ''reinforces a brand. A building with a Tom Otterness playground piece is an intelligent, whimsical experience, which goes beyond the usual plastic, metal and wood equipment that might be presented as part of a family-friendly development.'' 
 Mr. Otterness said that the sculpture also ''marks the building. There will not be another building in New York with that in its footprint.''
 Installed in early December, the newest exhibit in the Lever House art collection was created by Richard Woods, who wrapped columns at the base of the building with plywood and covered them with strips of vinyl decorated with various textile patterns; the work was bought for $300,000.
 Mr. Rosen said he began the Lever House art collection to gain recognition for the building, on the west side of Park Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets. ''Park Avenue is usually very corporate and boring,'' he said. ''We wanted to create an interesting environment for people to come and visit.'' 
 Mr. Rosen owns the Lever House art collection with Alberto Mugrabi, an art dealer. Although Mr. Rosen said he had no commercial motive in starting the art collection, he stands to gain financially if works in the collection appreciate. 
 Perhaps the most unusual art display, from a business perspective, involves the arrangement recently struck by Park Tower Group and Christie's. The developer is exhibiting sculptures at 535 Madison Avenue, an Edward Larrabee Barnes building at the northeast corner of 54th Street. 
 The artwork, which Christie's will later auction, will change regularly and be on display in the building's newly renovated 2,250-square-foot lobby and its 4,870-square-foot plaza. No money is changing hands between Christie's and Park Tower Group.
 The sculpture ''is a great amenity for the building and for the public, with the plaza,'' said Alfred D. Bradshaw, executive vice president of Park Tower Group. He said the collaboration gives Christie's ''a different venue for displaying art.''
 According to Marc Porter, president of Christie's Americas, the Park Tower Group arrangement is Christie's first with a real estate developer. He said the auction house hoped to adopt the concept in other cities. 
 In the first exhibit, which ran for six weeks in the fall, Christie's lent Park Tower Group four sculptures by Francois-Xavier Lalanne and Claude Lalanne, including a bronze elk that was displayed in the plaza. The sculptures were auctioned this month in Christie's 20th-century decorative art and design sale.
 All of the sculptures that had been displayed were sold at prices above Christie's estimates. The elk, for example, had been estimated to sell for $100,000 to $150,000, and actually went for $266,500.
 Mr. Porter said Christie's arrangement with Park Tower Group let ''experienced buyers who had already been collectors see the art in a distinguished urban setting. It galvanized their interest in the objects.''
 One possible risk of the arrangement, Ms. Austin said, is potential ''damage to works of art owned by other people.'' Mr. Porter said Christie's would insure whatever art is displayed.
 Some art and real estate professionals said they were not surprised by developers' continued interest in buying art, even during a recession. ''If the developers have money and are interested in art, they are going to spend it,'' Mr. Straus said. ''These guys do it because they have a passion for it.'' 
 Art is ''depressed in price like every other asset class,'' said Frank Liantonio, executive vice president of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield. ''Smart developers are taking advantage of the market for art, and combining it with their real estate holdings to give their buildings a slight edge,'' he said. 
 But, he went on, ''one might say, in this economy, who cares about sculpture or art? Just give me the cheapest rent out there.''

HEADLINE: In Heart of Iraq, a Plan to Revive the Pulse of a Central Artery

BYLINE: By RIYADH MOHAMMED and JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Some city planners here do not want to leave to chance what Iraq will look like after American forces leave. Working with the Baghdad municipal government and the provincial council, engineers here have drawn up the largest Iraqi reconstruction project since the American-led invasion of 2003, a $5 billion plan to rebuild the city's economic and cultural main street. 
 On a recent morning, Ahmed Jabbar, 48, looked at a computer rendering of the future and was not impressed. He runs a men's clothing store on Rasheed Street, once a thriving Ottoman-era commercial artery but now battered by nearly three decades of war and sanctions. In the drawings, Rasheed Street appears as a glistening pedestrian mall, with palm trees and restored porticoes above the two-story, columned shops. 
 Mr. Jabbar kicked at the sidewalk in front of his store, a product of a smaller recent reconstruction project. 
 ''They spent $7 million on this stupid sidewalk,'' he said, ''and it's tilted so that when it rains, the water comes into the stores. With such people in government, we will have the same circumstances forever.'' 
 The revitalization plan, presented to the provincial council this month, is the most ambitious vision put forward of a new Iraq, a testimony to the decline in violence of the last two years. The engineering firm, Al Miemari, modeled its plan on the reconstruction of Beirut after 1990, which created thousands of jobs and drew billions of dollars of foreign and local investment to the Lebanese capital. 
 It is a sign of optimism here that people are even thinking about such a large-scale project. 
 ''The best reply to terrorism is to insist on the reconstruction of Baghdad's most important street,'' said Kamil al-Zaidi, who leads the Baghdad provincial council. ''It is a message for everyone. We will go on.'' 
 But first the project faces more prosaic nemeses. Before it has even been made public, it has set off three investigations into charges of corruption, a widespread problem that has severely hindered improvement in Iraq after the war. 
 ''Everything in the project is suspicious,'' said Abbas al-Dihlegi, who runs the provincial council's integrity committee. With billions of dollars expected from private investors, both foreign and Iraqi, officials and shopkeepers on Rasheed Street suspect that much of the money will end up in the pockets of politicians or connected contractors. The watchdog group Transparency International recently named Iraq the fifth most corrupt country in the world, out of 180 nations studied. 
 Mr. Dihlegi said the initial $7 million contract to draw up the plan and provide a short list of contractors was awarded to Al Miemari without competitive bidding from other firms. ''That is against the rules,'' he said. He noted that one of the firm's partners, Thaeir al-Faili, was a former deputy minister of reconstruction and a current member of the board of Baghdad's investment commission, which will grant all contracts for work on the project. 
 ''This is a conflict of interest,'' Mr. Dihlegi said. 
 Mr. Faili said no other engineering firms chose to bid on the contract, now being investigated by the Commission of Public Integrity. 
 Mohammed al-Rubaiei, chairman of the provincial council's strategic planning commission, said that because the project would be financed by private investors, through a company of shareholders that would include the street's property owners, it would deflect the corruption and cronyism that pervaded government projects here. 
 Taghlub al-Waeili, who owns the engineering firm, said the corruption charges were brought by his competitors to slow progress. 
 ''The real corruption is when you stop the reconstruction of the country under false accusations,'' he said. And besides, he added, a little bit of grease may a worthwhile price to pay. ''If you knew that the World Trade Center's towers were built with $100,000 of corruption,'' he said, referring to the buildings and not their history, ''what would you choose? Build them or leave them unbuilt?'' 
 Mr. Rubaiei conceded that the project faced a number of obstacles, including the continued possibility of violence. ''We agree that Iraq is not totally ready as an investment environment,'' he said. ''But we can't just wait forever.'' 
 Work will not begin for another year, he said.
 The street, designed by the Ottomans in 1916 and modeled on Paris, has figured in much of Baghdad's history: Sunnis and Shiites planned the overthrow of British rule in 1920 at Hayder Khana Mosque. A Communist uprising filled the street in 1948. Saddam Hussein began his political career there in 1959, in an assassination attempt on Abdul Kareem Qassim, the country's first prime minister. 
 ''Nothing happened in Iraq that Rasheed Street didn't have a major role in it,'' said Yaseen al-Nussayir, who wrote a book about the street. 
 On a recent afternoon, the crumbling facades of Rasheed Street bore only muted testimony to their past, when Iraq -- flush with new money from oil in the 1950s -- celebrated its wealth in the shops and theaters of its oldest street, where Western and Arabic architectural styles bumped shoulders in an optimistic glow of midcentury modernism. Windows are now broken or covered with dust; shutters hang limp from their hinges. At the city's oldest cafe, men smoked hookahs on the sidewalk because there was no electricity inside. 
 The new plans show nine wide plazas and a streetcar passing through a low-slung strip of shops with ironwork balconies that would not be out of place in a small city in Florida. The engineers identified 254 buildings as historical or heritage sites to be preserved where possible; in 1984, there were 526. 
 For Muwafaq al-Taei, visiting the street on a recent afternoon, the decaying buildings evoked a secular, liberal past far different from the Baghdad that is materializing today. Like many middle-class Iraqis his age, Mr. Taei, 68, embraced communism and the artistic and social movements of Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, living them out on Rasheed Street. 
 ''We had the most advanced cinemas, even 3-D cinemas,'' he said. ''I saw 'Helen of Troy' here the same time it was in England.''
 Mr. Taei, an architectural planning engineer, said the reconstruction plans were shortsighted, in part because the car-free zone was unworkable, and in part because Baghdad today lacked the infrastructure -- municipal or cultural -- to regenerate the life that made Rasheed Street. ''You don't jump to the end product,'' he said. ''Rasheed is an end product.'' 
 For Mr. Jabbar, who runs the men's-wear shop, it is premature to start making plans for the future. 
 ''These seven years have made us go back a century because of corruption,'' he said. ''We are not the first country invaded in a war, but we have a government that has accomplished nothing but corruption.'' He pointed to the weathered balcony across the street, which until recently had been maintained, but was now being dismantled. ''Rasheed Street was the center for Baghdad economic life, but now it's destroyed,'' he said. ''Government corruption destroyed it.''

HEADLINE: Audiences Laughed To Forget Troubles

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Forget the box-office statistics. We all know 2009 was a big year, more than $10 billion in tickets sold. And dig beyond which marketing campaigns were the slickest and which studio had the most market share. That's all important at a certain level, but what does the year tell us about the kinds of stories and the styles of filmmaking that resonate with Americans at a time of economic anxiety and partisan animosity?
 The picture is always a little cloudy when you try to clump movies together by year. On one level, the adult drama is dead, with a spate of intelligent, solidly reviewed films (''State of Play,''''Duplicity,''''The Soloist,'' ''The Informant!'') given the cold shoulder by moviegoers. But every now and then one slips through: ''The Blind Side,'' about a woman who helps a homeless boy succeed at football, came out of nowhere to become one of the biggest hits of the year. 
 Even so, this year delivered some clear lessons for Hollywood. Among them: audiences don't flock to see just any superhero (''Watchmen,'' despite massive prerelease buzz, underperformed while ''Astro Boy'' barely registered at all); torture-porn is over, with the ''Saw'' franchise finally hitting a wall; and people seem more interested in seeing stars -- John Travolta, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Julia Roberts, Will Ferrell -- on tabloid television shows than on the big screen.
 Perhaps the biggest lesson of the year, however, was a positive one. Moviegoers decided that relatable, nonthinking comedies -- a little raunch but not too much, please (''Bruno'' seemed to push it too far) -- are the perfect balm for the recession.
 ''The Hangover,'' which cost about $35 million to produce and sold $459.4 million at the global box office, is exhibit No. 1. But audiences also responded to ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop,''''The Proposal'' and ''Couples Retreat,'' which Universal Pictures smartly opened its wallet to film in Bora Bora. 
 The comedies that worked, noted Todd Phillips, director of ''The Hangover,'' were ones that audiences could see happening to them. In his film, about four men who go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, ''the chemistry of these four guys and the brush with which their friendship was painted felt very authentic,'' he said. ''People could relate to it and picture themselves going through it.''
 Oh yeah, and ''The Hangover'' was actually funny. In the social-networking age, movie fans can spot a stinker (''Did You Hear About the Morgans?'') from a mile away. ''You have to deliver on expectations -- there can't be any deception,'' Mr. Phillips said. '' 'The Hangover' worked because there was nothing to go home and Twitter negatively about.''
 Some grit broke through -- ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire'' defied the odds and found an audience -- but interest in fantasy, a strong theme from previous years, grew even stronger. Gargantuan special effects were part of the draw (''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,''''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,'' ''2012''). But a desire to hide from layoffs and bank failures and the Octomom for a couple of hours was even more powerful.
 ''There will always be room for the gritty adult drama, but it just really seemed that people wanted to escape into a world of fantasy this year,'' said Rob Marshall, director of the musical ''Nine.''
 Roberto Orci, a co-writer of the recent ''Star Trek'' and ''Transformers'' movies, said even big, splashy fantasy pictures can flop if they forget that basic cinematic element: story.
 ''If you can't take out the gimmick and still have a story, then you don't have anything,'' Mr. Orci said. ''If you look at 'Star Trek,' it's all about relationships and character -- here are two opposites who grow up and see in each other the thing that each other lacks. If you remember story, audiences will never have buyer's remorse.''
 Animation was another powerful cinematic current in 2009. ''Up,''''Monsters vs. Aliens'' and ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' were among the Top 10 best-selling movies of the year, with ''Disney's A Christmas Carol'' and ''Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs'' not far behind. The verdict is still out on ''The Princess and the Frog,'' a throwback to the hand-drawn musicals of Disney past that is still playing, but the quirky ''Coraline'' crossed over from the art house to the multiplex, selling $122 million at the global box office. And don't forget those blue warriors of ''Avatar,'' a film that opened late in the year and has most of its money-making weeks still ahead of it.
 ''People are looking for something they haven't seen before,'' said Pete Docter, director and co-writer of ''Up,'' which is about the adventures of a cranky 78-year-old who ties thousands of balloons to his house. ''For us, that was part of the attraction of using an old man as the central character.''
 He added: ''A lot of people scratched their heads. For, us it seemed like a great opportunity for comedy and to avoid bland-protagonist disease.''
 In many ways 2009 was the year that women reasserted their power at the multiplex. With ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon,'' teenage girls officially became as potent an audience as their fanboy brethren. And Hollywood is constantly surprised when audiences of older women can power a movie to blockbuster status (''Mamma Mia!''), and this year was no exception. Also this year studios tried a smidge harder to pay attention to that niche, rolling out pictures like ''Julie & Julia'' (with Meryl Streep, now 60), ''The Proposal'' (with Sandra Bullock, 45) and ''It's Complicated'' (Ms. Streep again).
 Anne Fletcher, who directed ''The Proposal,'' said she loved the fact that Ms. Bullock and Ms. Streep are such hitmakers. ''What stands out to me about this year is the range,'' she said. ''There was something for everybody.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Cool to Positive Economic Data

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
In a day of lackluster trading, Wall Street stumbled -- ever so slightly -- for the first time since Dec. 17.
 All three major indexes closed lower as reports on home prices and consumer confidence did little to excite buyers.
 The major indexes had risen modestly early in the day, but slipped as the dollar strengthened and tugged on commodity prices. A stronger dollar makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers. The drop in commodities weighed on energy and materials stocks. 
 Trading was quiet, as it has been in recent days, and many investors left at the end of the day for a long New Year's weekend. 
 Economic reports looked stronger but failed to motivate investors. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose to 52.9 in December from 49.5 in November. That was slightly better than economists had forecast.
 The index remains well below what is considered healthy. A reading of 90 or more signals a solid economy. The index, however, has recovered significantly from a historic low of 25.3 in February.
 The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller's home price index rose in October for a fifth consecutive month, edging up 0.4 percent. The index was off 7.3 percent from October 2008, roughly in line with expectations.
 Analysts said there were few surprises in the economic numbers to drive the market.
 ''The reports we're seeing broadly reinforce the expectations we've had,'' said James M. Baird, partner and chief investment strategist for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich. ''It's slow and steady. It's not explosive improvement.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.67 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 10,545.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.58 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,126.20, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.68 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,288.40.
 Despite a lackluster Tuesday performance, Timothy Speiss, chairman of Personal Wealth Advisors practice at Eisner in New York, said he expected to see the market build on recent gains at the start of the new year and through the first quarter.
 ''We're going to be building momentum,'' Mr. Speiss said.
 Government bonds inched higher Tuesday ahead of an auction of $42 billion of five-year notes. The Treasury Department is issuing a total of $118 billion of debt this week as part of its current effort to finance its stimulus programs.
 Energy prices flattened Tuesday with a majority of futures traders taking the holiday week off, though a stronger dollar helped keep a barrel of oil below $79. It settled at $78.87 a barrel.
 Retail gasoline prices increased for the fourth consecutive session, the first time they have done that since October. The national average climbed a half penny overnight to a new national average of $2.608, according to auto club AAA, Wright Express and the Oil Price Information Service.
 A gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is 2.1 cents cheaper than it was a month ago, but nearly $1 more expensive than a year earlier.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 11/32, to 96 17/32. The yield fell to 3.80 percent, from 3.84 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Putin Says U.S. Antimissile Plan Stands in Way of New Arms Treaty

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said Tuesday that the main obstacle to replacing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, is Washington's plan to build a missile defense system, which he said endangered the cold war-era balance of power. 
 ''If we don't develop a missile defense system, a danger arises for us that with an umbrella protecting our partners from offensive weapons, they will feel completely safe,'' Mr. Putin told journalists during a working visit to Vladivostok. ''The balance will be disrupted, and then they will do whatever they want, and aggressiveness will immediately arise both in real politics and economics.'' 
 To preserve the balance, he said, Russia must develop new offensive weapons to counter the missile shield -- or the United States must provide Russia with data on its missile defense plans in exchange for data on Russian weapons development.
 It was not clear whether Mr. Putin's comments, which were widely reported in the Russian news media, reflected a new Russian position or a negotiating tactic in the final stages of the Start talks, which American officials have said are close to a conclusion. 
 But Mr. Putin's comments came three weeks after negotiators missed the Dec. 5 deadline for replacing Start, and appeared to reflect a lasting skepticism in Russia about American intentions, almost a year after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that it was time for the two countries to ''press the reset button.''While President Obama has impressed Russian leaders, many question whether he is capable of changing Washington's policies toward Russia, said Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. 
 ''They would say that Obama is serious, he views the world differently, but the U.S. is a very big ship that cannot change its course dramatically in a few months,'' Mr. Trenin said. ''The people who see Russia as a problem are still there, and they can be found at the Pentagon. They also say Obama is here for eight years maximum, and he may not be able to withstand the pressures on him.'' 
 The new treaty would require the countries to reduce their nuclear arsenals by at least one-quarter. Since the spring, Russian officials have sought to tie the Start follow-up talks to changes to the American missile defense plan, which they see as designed to counter their missiles. American officials say the shield is geared toward threats from Iran or North Korea, not Russia, and refused to include missile defense in the negotiations -- a position that Ian C. Kelly, the State Department spokesman, reiterated in Washington on Tuesday in response to Mr. Putin's remarks.
 ''While the U.S. has long agreed that there is a relationship between missile offense and defense, we believe the Start follow-on agreement is not the appropriate vehicle for addressing it,'' he said.
 In September, Mr. Obama announced that he would scrap plans for missile defense system sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, a central irritant to Russia, in favor of smaller ship-based interceptors that might later be positioned on land in Europe. The White House said the decision was a response to changing Iranian capacities rather than Russian complaints. But in any case, Moscow welcomed the move, with Mr. Putin calling the decision ''correct and brave.'' 
 Three months later, most people in the Russian government believe that Washington is advancing quickly toward a missile defense system, and that its goals have not changed, said Sergei A. Markov, a deputy with the governing United Russia party. 
 ''Putin wants to stress exactly that this goal has not been dismissed,'' Mr. Markov said. 
 A major tension is that the two countries are at different stages in their strategic military development: Russia is actively replacing and adding offensive weapons, and the follow-up treaty would require Russia to share information about the testing of new missiles. The United States, meanwhile, is under no obligation to share similar information about missile defense, said Mr. Trenin, meaning ''the whole thing is asymmetrical.'' 
 Mr. Putin's comments left no doubt that he was playing a pivotal role in negotiations with Washington, a task that technically should fall to his protege, President Dmitri A. Medvedev. 
 ''It would be a huge obstacle in the talks if Putin now says we need limits on missile defense as part of this treaty,'' said Steven Pifer, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. ''It would be a huge setback, and it would make the treaty very hard, if not impossible, to conclude.'' 
 At the moment, he said, Mr. Putin's meaning ''is not clear, and I suspect it won't be clear until the negotiators sit down again in January.'' 
 Mr. Markov said he was not surprised the talks had been difficult; from the first, at least for Russia, they have been freighted with outsize importance. 
 ''It's not just about the Start agreement, but about the status of the Russian Federation -- whether Russia is a great power or not,'' he said. ''We have heard a lot from Washington that Russian interests should be limited to Russia's borders. That means Russia is not recognized as a great power. And that's why this negotiation is so difficult, because no one knows what Russia's status is.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Given Access To American Held in Cuba

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
After pressing for more than three weeks for access to an American citizen detained in Cuba, an American diplomat in Havana has finally met with the man grabbed by state security for distributing electronic equipment to community groups, American officials said Tuesday. 
 American officials said a State Department consular official talked with the suspect on Monday at an undisclosed location, which was believed to be one of Cuba's high-security prisons.
 Neither the State Department nor the Cuban government has released the identity of the detainee, who was a subcontractor for Development Alternatives Inc., an international development group based outside Washington, D.C. The company won an American government contract in 2008 to promote the rule of law and human rights in Cuba. 
 The man was arrested at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on Dec. 4 as he tried to leave Cuba, American officials said. 
 The Cuban government notified the American government of the arrest the day after it occurred but resisted granting consular access to the man until Monday. President Raul Castro first mentioned the arrest during a speech before the National Assembly on Dec. 20, citing it as an example of how the Obama administration was engaging in ''open and undercover subversion'' in Cuba.
 In his speech, Mr. Castro cited no specific charges against the man but accused him of illegally distributing ''sophisticated methods of satellite communication to members of the civil society which they hope to form against our people.''
 James Boomgard, president of Development Alternatives Inc., has portrayed the man's activities as legitimate. ''The detained individual was an employee of a program subcontractor, which was implementing a competitively issued subcontract to assist Cuban civil society organizations,'' he said in a statement issued on Dec. 14.
 American officials said he had distributed cellphones and computers, both of which are legal on the island, as well as other communications equipment that might have been restricted.
 Wayne S. Smith, a former American diplomat in Havana who now works at the Center for International Policy, said in an interview on Tuesday that the Cuban government saw the detainee's surreptitious activity as a continuation of the Bush administration's efforts to undermine the Cuban leadership.
 ''They're upset that the U.S. government is sending people down with equipment that the Cubans object to,'' said Mr. Smith, who favors normalizing relations with Cuba and has been in touch with Cuban officials about the arrest. 
 American government programs intended to promote democracy in Cuba have also been the focus of intense criticism over the years. A report by the Government Accountability Office in 2006 found that nearly all of the $74 million that the United States Agency for International Development spent to foster democracy in Cuba over the previous decade had been distributed, without competitive bidding or oversight, to Cuban-exile organizations in Miami rather than groups in Cuba itself.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Election Aides Said to Get Customary Bonuses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The number of votes Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg received in November plunged from his previous total in 2005. His margin of victory nose-dived. And the turnout at the polls? It sank to a modern record low.
 But at least one number did not plummet this election season: The size of the bonuses that Mr. Bloomberg showered on his campaign workers.
 The mayor, a billionaire former Wall Street trader, is reaching into his own pocket to dole out the same generous checks to his staff that he did after winning office in 2001 and 2005 -- 20 percent of each worker's total wages, according to two people involved in the campaign. 
 The bonuses, many exceeding $20,000, suggest that Mr. Bloomberg has brushed aside pressure to reduce the big payouts as a sign of humility in the wake of a narrow victory. 
 Even though Mr. Bloomberg spent at least $102 million of his fortune on the mayoral race, easily eclipsing his previous record of $85 million, he won by 4.6 percentage points, compared with 20 percentage points in 2005. 
 ''Every component of the Bloomberg re-elect, from rolling back term limits to campaign spending, was a reminder that our mayor is the richest person in the city,'' said Michael Tobman, a political consultant who was not affiliated with any of the mayoral candidates in 2009. ''No reason for that to change with win bonuses, especially when deviating from past practice would hint that the end result was totally unexpected.''
 Over the next few weeks, Mr. Bloomberg is expected to pay post-campaign bonuses totaling well over $1 million, and probably much more, said the two people involved in the campaign, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the money. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign employed 120 people this year, compared with 79 in 2005, so the assumption, according to one of the sources, is that the overall bonuses will exceed those granted in 2005.
 Howard Wolfson, a spokesman, declined to comment, but said the campaign would disclose its expenditures, as required, with the city's Campaign Finance Board on Jan. 15.
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign staff, fearing that the mayor might link the payouts to his showing at the polls, had fretted over the bonuses for weeks. 
 But they need not have worried. 
 Checks -- perhaps ranging from as little as $1,000 to $400,000, if the 2005 bonuses for Mr. Bloomberg's top managers are matched -- began landing in bank accounts in the last few days. 
 The timing is awkward: Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday at City Hall for his third term, and has shied from any display of lavish spending for the event, even dispensing with the traditional post-ceremony party. 
 The breakdown of bonuses is not known, but rough calculations of the windfalls are possible. Christopher D. Cerf, a former deputy chancellor with the Department of Education who became a top policy adviser, received almost $33,000 for two months of work, according to campaign disclosures, and would receive an additional $6,600.
 Basil A. Smikle, a political consultant, should pocket $23,368, in addition to his salary of $116,841.
 And Francis S. Barry, the mayor's chief speechwriter, who switched from a job in City Hall to the campaign in its last month, is on target for a bonus of $1,570, based on $7,850 in wages.
 But the 20 percent figure is a mere guideline, and a lucky few are likely to receive much more. In 2005, for instance, Mr. Bloomberg gave his top three salaried campaign workers -- Kevin Sheekey, Patricia E. Harris and William T. Cunningham -- bonuses ranging from $300,000 to $400,000, which in some cases exceeded their pay.
 This year, the three highest-paid campaign workers, based on their biweekly salaries, were Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager, and Ms. Harris, a deputy mayor who joined the campaign late, at $13,750; and Maura Keaney, the field director, at $8,500.
 Mr. Bloomberg has never disclosed how he calculates bonuses, but the process appears to be governed by a combination of performance, gratitude and whimsy. 
 In 2001, when he won by 2.4 percentage points, collecting 744,757 votes, he paid out a total of $850,000 in bonuses, campaign finance records show. In 2005, when he won by 19.4 points and garnered 753,089 votes, he gave out $1.55 million.
 Comparable bonuses may raise eyebrows as the city copes with the worst recession in decades, and the mayor mulls big layoffs among New York's work force. 
 Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, said the ''bonuses to campaign workers again this year are no surprise given his past practice, but this year's practice may sit worse than the ones before, with so many New Yorkers struggling financially.''
 The mayor and his aides argue that since Mr. Bloomberg is using his own money, how he chooses to spend it is irrelevant. And they bristle at reminders of his relatively narrow victory, saying several of the region's politicians -- including another former Wall Street mogul, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey -- lost their re-election bids. Mr. Bloomberg held on, despite a sour economy and anger over his undoing of term limits.
 ''I don't think the margin of victory was narrow,'' the mayor said not long after the Nov. 3 election when asked if he would pay bonuses to his campaign staff.

HEADLINE: Policy on Iran: Words or Warheads?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''There's Only One Way to Stop Iran'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 24):
 Alan J. Kuperman proposes the most dangerous idea of the coming year: bombing Iran's nuclear sites, which some suspect are intended not only for nuclear power but also for nuclear weapons. Yet his own argument undermines the case for attacking Iran.
 As Mr. Kuperman suggests, Iran's demagogic president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, may have rejected President Obama's compromise offer on nuclear fuel not because rejection helps him build a bomb but because a ''tough'' stand plays to Iranian national pride. Such pride goes far beyond Mr. Ahmadinejad's supporters -- which is why opposition leaders have repeatedly warned the West that harsh sanctions or a strike would be a gift to the regime. 
 Iran's nuclear facilities are buried and dispersed. A strike would be ineffective while killing many civilians. The political reaction would be explosive -- including in nuclear-armed, unstable Pakistan.
 David Keppel Bloomington, Ind., Dec. 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Alan J. Kuperman advocates American military airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, claiming President Obama's diplomatic efforts have failed.
 Mr. Kuperman argues, ''If nothing else, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that the United States military can oust regimes in weeks if it wants to.'' And replace them with what?
 Does Mr. Kuperman recall that in 1953 the C.I.A. ousted an Iranian regime that was replaced by the brutal shah? Eventually Iranians overthrew the shah and installed a theocracy, for which we are now paying a price.
 It is time we realize that the Middle East is like a hornet's nest that we strike at our peril. Mr. Kuperman concedes, ''Negotiation to prevent nuclear proliferation is always preferable to military action.'' But he is too quick to claim that diplomacy has failed. I say give Mr. Obama a chance to earn his peace prize.
 Jerry Wallingford San Diego, Dec. 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Alan J. Kuperman is correct to argue that airstrikes have become the only plausible avenue to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
 It is widely appreciated that a nuclear-armed Iranian regime poses an existential threat to Israel, but it is also a huge risk for the United States if Iran becomes a nuclear weapons power.
 Whatever the political, economic and security risks for the United States that might be entailed in a last-resort military strike upon Iranian nuclear facilities, they will be nothing against the shadow of nuclear blackmail under which the United States will be obliged to live once Iran gets such weapons.
 Even if Iran never fires them at the United States, who really believes that Iran won't give such weapons to terrorists? And who believes that, once having such weapons, terrorists won't use them on the United States? And even if neither uses them, what unending series of concessions and retreats will the United States have to undertake to ensure that this continues?
 Once Iran gets the bomb, our freedom and security may well be compromised beyond anything we imagined.
 Morton A. Klein National President Zionist Organization of America New York, Dec. 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It was appalling to see Alan J. Kuperman's recommendation that the United States bomb Iranian nuclear facilities because Iran has refused to agree to the terms proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency for processing nuclear fuel abroad. 
 Mr. Kuperman's proposal, if carried out, would be likely to kill a large number of Iranian civilians, unite most Middle East nations against the United States, destroy the rapidly growing dissident movement in Iran, end any Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, end allied support of American efforts in Afghanistan and encourage Iran to resume and accelerate a nuclear weapon program that most experts believe was suspended six years ago. That is too high a price to pay. 
 The better solution would be a Middle East nuclear-free zone, but that would require that Israel acknowledge and then destroy its own secretly developed nuclear arsenal, currently the only nuclear threat in the region. 
 Thomas A. Halsted Gloucester, Mass., Dec. 24, 2009
 The writer is former executive director of the Arms Control Association.
 To the Editor:
 While I agree with Alan J. Kuperman's conclusion that only airstrikes will bring Iran's nuclear program to a halt, his choice of targets is highly questionable.
 Not only is it likely that Iran has nuclear facilities that are still unknown to Western intelligence agencies, but also some are undoubtedly so well bunkered that heavy bombing will not destroy them. Further, bombing these targets would likely arouse the animus of much if not most of the Iranian populace.
 Iran is a military dictatorship controlled by the Revolutionary Guards -- neither Ayatollah Ali Khameini nor President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad can act against the guard's will.
 So if we instead target all Revolutionary Guard bases and offices, we would eradicate the source of this hyperaggressive militarism, and also remove a painful thorn from the side of the Iranian people.
 Marshall E. Schwartz Oakland, Calif., Dec. 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Alan J. Kuperman opines that the only way to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons would be to bomb the nuclear facilities in Iran. That strategy is fraught with risk. Meanwhile, effective sanctions will not get the required support in the United Nations Security Council. 
 A more effective approach would be a total air and sea blockade of Iran: nothing in and nothing out until it fully complies with United Nations resolutions and inspections.
 A blockade would be a serious message of resolve to our allies in the region, and it could devastate an already weak Iranian economy and possibly strengthen the hand of the Iranian opposition. The Saudis and Persian Gulf states should be asked to provide sufficient oil to stabilize the oil market.
 While a blockade is an act of war, a blockade to exact compliance with international treaties and Security Council resolutions serves the interests of peace.

HEADLINE: China Is Willing to Spend Big In Afghanistan, on Commerce

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Behind an electrified fence, blast-resistant sandbags and 53 National Police outposts, the Afghan surge is well under way.
 But the foot soldiers in a bowl-shaped valley about 20 miles southeast of Kabul are not fighting the Taliban, or even carrying guns. They are preparing to extract copper from one of the richest untapped deposits on earth. And they are Chinese, undertaking by far the largest foreign investment project in war-torn Afghanistan.
 Two years ago, the China Metallurgical Group Corporation, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, bid $3.4 billion -- $1 billion more than any of its competitors from Canada, Europe, Russia, the United States and Kazakhstan -- for the rights to mine deposits near the village of Aynak. Over the next 25 years, it plans to extract about 11 million tons of copper -- an amount equal to one-third of all the known copper reserves in China.
 While the United States spends hundreds of billions of dollars fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda here, China is securing raw material for its voracious economy. The world's superpower is focused on security. Its fastest rising competitor concentrates on commerce. 
 S. Frederick Starr, the chairman of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, an independent research organization in Washington, said that skeptics might wonder whether Washington and NATO had conducted ''an unacknowledged preparatory phase for the Chinese economic penetration of Afghanistan.''
 ''We do the heavy lifting,'' he said. ''And they pick the fruit.''
 The reality is more complicated than that. The Chinese bid far more for the mining rights to the Aynak project and promised to invest hundreds of millions more in associated infrastructure projects than other bidders. It is a risky venture that has not yet proved to be economical, and it has already been dogged by allegations of bribery.
 But the Aynak investment underscores how China's leaders, flush with money and in control of both the government and major industries, meld strategy, business and statecraft into a seamless whole. In a single move, Beijing strengthened its hold on a vital resource, engineered the single largest investment in Afghan history, promised to create thousands of new Afghan jobs and established itself as the Afghan government's pre-eminent business partner and single largest source of tax payments.
 An Odd Global Pairing
 Afghanistan is not the only place where the United States and China find themselves so oddly juxtaposed in the post-9/11 world. China is investing more in extracting Iraqi oil than American companies are. It has reached long-term arrangements to buy gas from Iran, even as the government there comes under the threat of Western sanctions for its nuclear program. China has also become a dominant investor in Pakistan and volatile parts of Africa.
 But it is in Afghanistan where China's willingness to take risks for commercial and diplomatic gain are most striking.
 China Metallurgical Group, often called M.C.C., will build a 400-megawatt generating plant to power both the copper mine and blackout-prone Kabul. M.C.C. will dig a new coal mine to feed the plant's generators. It will build a smelter to refine copper ore, and a railroad to carry coal to the power plant and copper back to China. If the terms of its contract are to be believed, M.C.C. will also build schools, roads, even mosques for the Afghans.
 The sweeping agreement has some experts rubbing their eyes in disbelief. ''It's almost as if the Chinese promised too much,'' said one international expert who, like some others interviewed, refused to be identified for fear of alienating the Afghans or the Chinese.
 But even if elements of the agreement fall through, the Chinese have already positioned themselves as generous, eager partners of the Afghan government and long-term players in the country's future. All without firing a shot.
 Nurzaman Stanikzai was a mujahedeen in the 1980s, using American-supplied arms to help drive the Red Army from his homeland. Today he is a contractor for M.C.C., building the Aynak mine's electric fence, blast wall, workers' dormitories and a road to Kabul.
 ''The Chinese are much wiser. When we went to talk to the local people, they wore civilian clothing, and they were very friendly,'' he said recently during a long chat in his Kabul apartment. ''The Americans -- not as good. When they come there, they have their uniforms, their rifles and such, and they are not as friendly.'' 
 American troops do not, in a narrow sense, protect the Chinese. The United States Army stations about 2,000 troops in Logar Province, where Aynak is located. But an Army spokesman said they generally patrolled well south of the mine area and had not provided direct security for Chinese investors or mine workers. 
 The Afghan National Police, which does protect the mine, was largely built and trained with American money. The 1,500 guards the police have posted in and around Aynak are special recruits not drawn from the main force, according to Maj. Gen. Sayed Kamal, who heads the National Police. 
 But the conclusion is inescapable: American troops have helped make Afghanistan safe for Chinese investment. And there is no sense that either government objects to that reality. As diplomats and soldiers alike stress, the war in Afghanistan was never motivated by commercial prospects. Had an American company won Aynak, some Afghans noted wryly, critics inevitably would have accused the United States of waging war to seize the country's mineral wealth. Moreover, if China succeeds in developing Aynak and generating revenue for the Kabul government, that helps achieve an American goal.
 ''To the extent that the Chinese bring Afghanistan up to speed and start paying a billion dollars a year in royalties,'' a Western government official who has followed the Aynak project said, ''that would mean that Afghanistan is on a firmer ground to start paying for its own security.''
 China Stays Out of War Effort
 The Chinese, meanwhile, have rebuffed requests to join the Afghan war effort, saying that national policy forbids military action abroad except as part of a peacekeeping force. Instead, China's foreign policy is based on commerce. Its state-owned companies have been snapping up energy and mineral resources worldwide for years now, often by overwhelming competitors with lavish offers. 
 In 2006, for example, another state-owned goliath known as C.M.E.C. swept bidding for one of the world's largest known iron ore deposits, in Gabon, by offering to build a 360-mile railroad to the nearly inaccessible mine site, two hydroelectric dams to power the mine and a deepwater ocean port to export the mined ore.
 Such splurges are both national strategy -- China's goal is to control long-term access to critical commodities -- and a matter of necessity if Beijing is to keep its industrial empire running. With 700 to 1,000 steel mills to feed, China is the world's largest importer of iron ore. Similarly, China already imports 40 percent of the world's copper.
 If the Aynak venture differs from those in the past, both international and Afghan experts say, it is because it appears to be as much a strategic coup as a commercial one.
 Opportunity in Southwest Asia
 The United States views Southwest Asia mostly as a security threat. China sees it as an opportunity. Decades of military cooperation with Pakistan, which shares India as a rival, have flowered into an economic alliance. A Chinese-built deepwater port in Gwadar, Pakistan, on the Gulf of Oman, is expected eventually to carry Middle Eastern oil and gas over the western Himalayas into China.
 Afghanistan, which borders both Iran and Pakistan, drew scant attention from China until the middle of this decade. 
 Aynak's riches had been known since Alexander the Great's armies forged copper there 2,300 years ago. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, its geologists took core samples and mapped the Aynak deposit, but were never able to begin mining.
 The Soviets were succeeded by Osama bin Laden, who used Aynak as a training camp while planning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. After the American-led invasion of Afghanistan, Afghan geologists rescued the Soviet surveys of Aynak and hid them until exploration could resume.
 That exploration -- a detailed overflight of much of the country by American surveyors in middecade -- showed Afghanistan to be far richer in oil, natural gas, iron, copper and coal than anyone had imagined. Aynak, in particular, was judged a world-class copper deposit, not just huge but of unusually rich quality, and the government chose it as the first major mineral concession to be auctioned to developers.
 To minimize corruption, the Afghan government decided, on the advice of American advisers, to ask the World Bank and a Colorado geological consulting firm to help oversee the bidding. A report last month in The Washington Post quoted an American official as charging that the Chinese swayed the bid with $20 million or more in bribes to the mining minister, Muhammad Ibrahim Adel, who was recently dismissed from the Afghan government in part because of the allegations. Mr. Adel has denied the charge.
 Foreign experts say that the possibility of bribery in Afghanistan, one of the world's most corrupt nations, can hardly be ruled out. But they also say that the Chinese bid was so clearly superior to others that any bribe money may have been incidental to the outcome.
 ''This was not a backroom deal. This was not Adel, sitting in Beijing, cooking this up,'' said one of several international experts interviewed for this article. ''This was thoroughly vetted by the governments of the day.''
 A. Rahman Ashraf is a veteran geologist and senior adviser on mining to Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai. Mr. Ashraf intervened in 2002 to stop Aynak's mining rights from being sold under the table to a Korean bidder. 
 ''Our wish was that this process must be very transparent,'' he said of Aynak, ''because this is the first time. If it is not transparent, then nobody comes to the others.'' 
 China won the bid, he said, for good reason: it offered a package deal, from power plants to railroads to smelters to coal mines, that no other bidder could match. And it promised to staff the entire venture with Afghan laborers and managers -- many of whom must be trained from scratch in a country with little mining expertise.
 ''After five years, it's only Afghan engineers,'' he said. ''Only in administration do the Chinese stay.'' 
 Indeed, outside experts here say, the striking aspect of China's Aynak venture is the degree to which it left competitors in the dust. Increasingly, the world's richest remaining mineral deposits are in hostile territory -- malarial jungles, combat zones, unstable nations that possess mineral riches but no realistic way to get them to market.
 With government money and backing behind them, China's state-run giants take risks in places that even the largest private behemoths will not tolerate, and they can add sweeteners -- from railroads to mosques -- that ordinary mining firms are ill equipped to provide. 
 ''The Chinese have sort of raised the bar. They've taken it beyond the scope of just an extractive operation,'' the Western official said. ''The Chinese are willing to step up and take a long-term strategic approach. If it takes 5 or 10 years, at least they have a beachhead.''
 The wild card, of course, is that no outsiders can know how much of China's Aynak venture is in fact brilliant strategy, and how much is merely a potentially ruinous business deal by an overzealous corporation. Beijing's corporate strategy is as opaque as it is overwhelming.
 China Metallurgical, a Fortune Global 500 company that has so many subsidiaries that they are mostly identified by numbers, is a signal example. The corporation reports to the top level of the Chinese government. Big foreign investments like the one at Aynak require blessing at an equally high level. M.C.C. has huge and productive investments around the world.
 Yet hardly all those ventures are successes. An M.C.C. copper mine in Pakistan is widely said to have serious environmental problems. A Pakistan lead mine has been dogged by conflict, including a suicide bombing that killed 29; residents accuse the company's Chinese work force of stealing local jobs. In Papua New Guinea, 14 Chinese workers at an M.C.C. nickel mine were injured in May in a pitched battle with local people who rioted over what they called intolerable working conditions. 
 That bid in 2006 for the iron mine in Gabon? Four years after C.M.E.C. struck its deal, the bargain appears to be unwinding over hints of corruption and global objections to a dam that would destroy Kongou Falls, one of central Africa's most treasured waterfalls. 
 Was Too Much Promised?
 Not surprisingly, that record leads skeptics to suggest that in Afghanistan, M.C.C. may have overpromised and, later, will underdeliver. 
 In interviews here, some experts said that M.C.C.'s Aynak bid was so munificent that the company might be forced to renegotiate lavish payments of copper royalties to the Afghan government. Others predicted that the company would be forced to shift parts of the vast project, like the yet-to-be-built railroad, to international donors. 
 Still others said the company's initial environmental efforts already badly lagged behind the promise in its winning bid to strictly adhere to the Equator Principles and World Bank benchmarks -- the gold standards for environmentally sensitive projects.
 China Metallurgical is not talking. Its officials not only refused to be interviewed for this article, but also sought to prohibit a journalist even from photographing the mine site from afar.
 But the company clearly is undeterred. The Afghan government is seeking bids for its second great mineral project, a behemoth called Hajigak that is said to contain 60 billion tons of iron ore. There are seven finalists -- all companies from India and China. M.C.C. is one of them.

HEADLINE: New Slip in Housing Prices Undercuts Fragile Optimism

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Just as the economy is finally beginning to strengthen, the real estate market is showing new signs of deterioration.
 Prices slipped in many cities in October, new figures show, despite low mortgage rates and a generous tax credit meant to spur sales. Now rates are starting to rise, making it harder for many buyers to afford a house, and the tax credit seems to be losing its capacity to lure them into the market.
 The renewed worries about housing come against a backdrop of improvement in the broader economy. Surveys suggest consumers are growing more confident. That better mood probably helped improve holiday retail sales. The number of people joining the ranks of the jobless is dwindling, while the hiring of temporary workers is up, a traditional harbinger of recovery. 
 Still, economic growth for the third quarter was more modest than originally reported; it was revised down to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from 2.8 percent. Many economists are fretting that housing could drag down the tenuous recovery. 
 ''I'm worried. Everyone's worried,'' said Karl E. Case, the Wellesley College economist who helped design the housing index that provided fresh cause for alarm on Tuesday. ''If prices sink 15 percent from here, which is a possibility, and the 2008 and 2009 loans go bad, then we're back where we were before -- in a nightmare.''
 The figures released Tuesday showed that the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, a widely watched measure of housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, rose 0.4 percent in October from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis. 
 It was the fifth consecutive month that prices were up, but the rate of increase has dropped sharply from the impressive gains of the summer. Prices in nine of the 20 cities were flat or down.
 Some analysts see little cause for alarm. Dan Greenhaus of Miller Tabak said that if prices fell ''a bit further'' it would sop up some of the excess inventory still weighing on the market.
 But others said that the Case-Shiller index showed an increase only because each report is an average of the preceding three months, meaning the strong August market was still a component of the October report. Another factor supporting the index is the seasonal adjustments, which tend to hide any weakness in the cooler months as the pace of home-buying slows.
 On an unadjusted basis, the index was flat. A different housing price index, compiled by the research firm LoanPerformance, fell 0.7 percent in October.
 Mr. Case, who chided himself for his optimism over the summer, said he now believed ''the probability is very high of a serious double dip like 1982.''
 The federal government has mounted an extensive and expensive effort to repair housing. While these actions undoubtedly staved off a total collapse, they are showing signs of fatigue.
 The tax credit for first-time buyers has been extended until next spring, but the urgency that buyers showed this summer, when they believed the credit was about to end, has drained away. The Federal Reserve has intervened in the market to push 30-year mortgage rates to the lowest level in decades, but says that program will end by March 31. Rates have already crept back above 5 percent. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants, are tightening policies for loans in their portfolios. Lenders who sell their mortgages to Fannie and Freddie are becoming more skittish about extending credit. 
 The Federal Housing Administration, which has become an important part of the entry-level housing market, is expected to tighten its standards in the next few weeks. That would further crimp the pool of eligible buyers.
 Faramarz Moeen-Ziai of Bank of Commerce Mortgage in San Ramon, Calif., said many of his clients were struggling to complete deals. ''All this is adding to the downward pressure on prices,'' he said.
 Falling prices are in theory good for buyers. Some housing commentators say prices need to fall much further before houses will be truly affordable. But the drop over the last three years, however necessary, has caused tremendous damage to wallets and to the lubricant of commerce, confidence in the future.
 Falling prices have put as many as a quarter of mortgage holders under water, where the loan balance is greater than the amount the home would fetch. If they lose their jobs, they have little choice but to opt for foreclosure. In a vicious circle, every new foreclosure puts more pressure on the housing market.
 Neree Dastous, a 39-year-old firefighter in a San Francisco suburb, would like to move from his condominium into a three-bedroom house. But the condo is under water, so he cannot sell. Keeping it as a rental pushes his debt-to-income ratio above the new Fannie Mae guidelines. Interest rates are not helping, either.
 ''Anything I can afford, I wouldn't want my kids to live in,'' Mr. Dastous said. ''I need prices to come down, but if they do the value of my condo goes down, too. It's very complicated.''
 Mr. Case, the Wellesley economist, said he was heartened by the minimal pace of housing starts by builders and the exuberant sales volume of existing houses. These two forces should ultimately clear the backlog in the market and prop up prices. 
 Yet for now, prices in many cities are weakening. ''There's no historical data for falling house prices'' on such a scale, he said. ''We don't know how this ends.''
 While the Case-Shiller index has managed gains for the last several months, it is still down 7.3 percent from October 2008 and is off 29.5 percent from its peak. Some analysts predict prices will fall as much as an additional 10 percent. That could swiftly undermine consumers' frail confidence. 
 The Conference Board reported Tuesday that the consumer confidence index increased in December to 52.9 from a revised 50.6 in November. In February, when talk of another Depression was rife, the index was at 25.3.
 ''Part of the reason people are turning more optimistic is a perception that the real estate market has turned,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. ''If that proves to be false, and we think it will be, it is going to come as a surprise to many.''
 Mr. Dastous, the foiled buyer, is already deeply disappointed. He is exploring foreclosures and fixer-uppers, but has no confidence he and his family will be able to move any time soon.
 Housing bloggers have given a name to this phenomenon: house arrest.

HEADLINE: Where Cuts Haven't Hurt Patients

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va. 

 BODY:
 At the heart of the health care debate is the question of whether it's possible to cut medical costs without harming patients. What has happened here in Richmond helps to answer that question.
 Since 1996, the Richmond area has lost more than 600 of its hospital beds, mostly because of state regulations on capacity. Several hospitals have closed, and others have shrunk. In 1996, the region had 4.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 residents. Today, it has about three. Hospital care has been, in a word, rationed.
 Neither the House health reform bill nor the Senate version would impose any such reductions on the nation's hospitals. But the basic idea behind the bills' cost-control measures is similar. They would try to slow the growth of medical treatments, be it through new rules for Medicare, a Cadillac tax on the costliest insurance plans or other measures.
 So take a glimpse at what our future may look like: 
 The quality of care in Richmond is better than in most American metropolitan areas, according to various measures, and it continues to improve. Medicare data, for example, shows that Richmond hospitals do a better-than-average job of treating heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia.
 When I recently asked patients in Richmond whether they felt as if their care had been rationed, they found the question bizarre. ''I feel like there's nothing cheap about the care,'' Janet Binns, a retired school district employee, said. After her elderly father fell down one morning, she e-mailed a doctor and was on the phone with him in minutes.
 Yet when it comes to health care costs, Richmond's rationing has made a clear difference. In 1992, it spent somewhat less than average, per capita, on Medicare -- 126th lowest out of 305 metropolitan areas nationwide. Since then, though, costs have risen at a significantly slower pace than they have elsewhere. As a result, Richmond had the 39th lowest costs in 2006.
 Of course, Richmond is no medical panacea. Some of its hospitals do poorly on Medicare's metrics, and I'm sure some patients there feel that they are not getting care they need -- just as is the case in every other part of the country. But that's kind of the point, isn't it? 
 Richmond has gotten rid of 15 percent of its hospital beds, and its health care still looks a lot like the rest of the country's, only cheaper and a bit better. 
 Peter Bernard -- the chief executive of Bon Secours, the second-largest health care system in Richmond -- has spent the last two decades running hospitals. In 1987, when he became the chief operating officer of a South Dakota hospital, the state had a law similar to Virginia's current one on capacity. If a hospital wanted to build a new wing or buy a new machine, it had to apply for something called a certificate of need from the state and show that the community needed the new service. 
 But South Dakota scrapped that program in 1988, and Mr. Bernard quickly went on an expansion binge. ''When it went away, I busted every franchise my competitor had,'' he told me. He started an open-heart program. He started a neonatal intensive care unit. He built what he called a ''big, huge'' obstetrics practice.
 Suddenly, southeastern South Dakota had vastly more medical capacity than just a few years earlier. 
 In other industries, all that new capacity might have led to a glut, in which workers and equipment sat idle. But health care is different. Doctors and patients tend to believe that more care is better, and patients often don't pay much extra for any additional care. So new doctors, nurses and equipment generally stay busy.
 Dr. John Wennberg of the Dartmouth Medical School refers to this phenomenon as supply-sensitive care. Dr. Marlon Priest, the chief medical officer of Bon Secours, puts it this way: ''If you build 100 beds, they'll get used.''
 Mr. Bernard said he would be happy to do precisely that in Richmond -- to expand, much as he did in South Dakota. His overriding goal is to make his hospitals as successful as possible, not to reform American medicine. Today, though, he can't succeed simply by expanding.
 Virginia requires him to get permission. It is one of 37 states with a certificate-of-need program, and unlike some, Virginia's is more than a mere formality. If a hospital even wants to move, it needs permission to remain as big as it was (which is a big reason hospital capacity has shrunk in recent years). Major hospitals usually win approval for the certificates they request, but the process itself is often enough to discourage them from applying. It's even more discouraging to individual doctors who are thinking of buying, say, their own M.R.I. machine. 
 That seems to be why Richmond is dominated by a small number of group practices. Three orthopedic groups provide essentially all the orthopedic care. One pulmonologist group provides much of the lung care. Richmond doesn't seem to have many of the entrepreneurial doctors, common in some other places, who are extremely aggressive about doing procedures or tests. ''There aren't a lot of people who are on the fringe doing things that are not medically acceptable,'' Dr. Marc Katz, a cardiac surgeon, says.
 Nobody in Richmond thinks that the certificate of need is a silver bullet. Some say the area emphasizes primary care, which holds down costs. Others named Virginia's $2 million cap on malpractice awards. Dr. Sheldon Retchin, head of the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, pointed out that his hospitals self-insure for malpractice -- which gives them more incentive to reduce the costly medical errors that lead to lawsuits.
 But there is little question that constraints on supply matter. Intriguingly, doctors and hospital executives told me that they thought Virginia regulators had become more lax about handing out certificates in recent years. One executive speculated that cost growth had probably picked up in recent years as a result.
 So after my visit, I asked the Dartmouth researchers who analyze Medicare spending if they had any data more recent than the 2006 numbers I already had. They did. And the latest numbers showed that spending growth had indeed accelerated. In 2007, Richmond had the 69th lowest Medicare spending, compared with 39th the previous year. Build the capacity, and it will get used. 
 During the long fight over health reform, skeptics have often suggested that there really is no way to cut spending without hurting people. Insurance companies and labor unions say a Cadillac tax will discourage necessary care. Congressional Republicans have criticized the proposed Medicare oversight commission as an agent of rationing. 
 These concerns are understandable, too. Intuitively, cutting health spending seems as if it should damage health. 
 Yet we now have abundant evidence that it does not have to. That's the lesson of Richmond. It's also the lesson of those model hospital systems, like the Cleveland Clinic, that get excellent results with relatively low costs. More care is not always better care. Sometimes, in fact, it's worse. Just consider the recent research showing that radiation from CT scans will eventually kill thousands of patients a year. 
 Changing our more-is-always-better health system will not be easy. It will require difficult, uncertain decisions. But the alternative to those decisions is the system we have now -- one that features unacceptably spotty care, a Medicare program on the path to insolvency and insurance premiums high enough to eat up workers' pay increases. 
 We can do better than that. It looks as if we are about to try.

HEADLINE: Square Feet: Hints the Worst May Be Over for Office Space in New Jersey

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
The market for office space in New Jersey took a beating in 2009. The vacancy rate swelled to about 22 percent. Rents sank by at least $1 a square foot. And despite its traditional strength as a white-collar job base, the state lost office jobs at a faster clip than the nation at large.
 The question now seems to be whether some faint signs of life will continue in the new year. 
 Some office market specialists said that rental rates had fallen so much and vacancy rates had risen so much that more deals were being struck. Craig Eisenhardt, a leasing specialist with CB Richard Ellis, called the situation a ''flicker of an uptick.'' Based on lease deals from Oct. 1 through the first half of December, he said, ''it looks like we are ending the year with a 21.5 percent vacancy rate. That's down from 22 percent in the third quarter.''
 Daniel Loughlin, the managing director for another large commercial real estate company, Jones Lang LaSalle, agreed. His company predicts an additional 150,000 square feet will be occupied in the final quarter compared with the previous quarter.
 Given the size of the total market, Mr. Loughlin said, such a gain is minimal. And agreements are increasing primarily because of renewals at renegotiated prices, he added. ''But it is still the first time the vacancy rate has declined in seven quarters,'' he said.
 Gualberto Medina, a former state secretary of commerce who heads the New Jersey office of the commercial real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, cited a survey performed last fall indicating that half of the top 500 companies in New Jersey had laid off employees because of the recession.
 The same survey, produced by researchers at Rutgers University who interviewed senior executives during the final three months of the year, showed that 76 percent of companies expected to reduce, or continue reducing, costs in 2010, and 31 percent anticipated more layoffs.
 Mr. Medina said, however, that the numbers might be misleading.
 ''We have to bear in mind that these executives were talking about their intentions while still in a period of severe economic uncertainty,'' he said. ''Those were foxhole predictions. Personally, I see some positive indicators at this point -- and a trend line that is good.''
 Several of the larger office landlords in northern New Jersey reported clear signs of improvement.
 SK Properties, based in Bridgewater, completed more leases, in terms of dollars and volume, this year than it did in 2007 and 2008 combined, according to its chief executive, Justin J. Gingeleskie.
 ''One main factor was the offer we made to all tenants in our portfolio'' of 1.3 million square feet of office properties, Mr. Gingeleskie said. ''We will hold your rent where it is now, with one month free, for a three-year extension; many took advantage of that.''
 But Mr. Gingeleskie also pointed to a ''star performer'' in a growing field, the AMCS Corporation, which does engineering for processing and power plants. It tripled its space and moved to a larger building in Bedminster, from Bridgewater.
 Parsippany, in Morris County, was once a stronghold for Fortune 500 companies. The vacancy rate there rose to 25 percent this year. But a new 100,000-square-foot structure, built speculatively, was fully leased to the law firm Day Pitney, in a deal announced in late October. 
 ''We feel that legal services is one of few areas where some expansion is occurring,'' said Remy deVarenne, senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis's office in the state.
 Mr. deVarenne and other market specialists also pointed to ''small pharma'' and medical research centers as industries that will take up some of the slack left by the big pharmaceutical companies that have reduced their presence in New Jersey.
 The mergers of pharmaceutical giants -- Pfizer with Wyeth, and Merck with Schering-Plough -- have created extensive office vacancies this year, with more disruption to come, said Jerry L. Barta of Alfred Sanzari Enterprises, a large office landlord in Bergen County.
 But Mr. Barta said PharmaNet's renewal of a 122,000-square-foot lease in the Princeton area was something of a positive sign for northern New Jersey, and he mentioned Otsuka America Pharmaceutical's new lease in West Windsor of 67,531 square feet.
 ''New Jersey has lost jobs in the pharma and biotech industries in the last 18 months while other states have expanded,'' Mr. Barta said. ''The picture is definitely not pretty. But at least people now seem to be over the panic stage, and realize the world is not coming to an end, and they can actually get back to running their businesses and think in longer terms.''
 The market for office space on the Hudson River waterfront is beginning a recovery, analysts say. Steven J. Pozycki, the chief executive of SJP Properties, was somewhat less sanguine. His company has an office tower under construction near Times Square in Manhattan, and it developed the Waterfront Corporate Center in Hoboken. 
 ''Manhattan is definitely on the comeback,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''In New Jersey, where the office market has been lackluster for the past two years, we are seeing a slight pickup in the last quarter. The good news is we're not out of gas; the bad news is that it's only less bad than it was.''
 Average asking rents this year sank below $25 a square foot for the first time since 2006, according to CB Richard Ellis. But in select submarkets, like the waterfront, Princeton and Newark, asking rents remain higher, around $30 a square foot.
 However, Mr. deVarenne of CB Richard Ellis added that in 44 percent of the deals made this year, companies did not even post asking rent, but rather ''worked with any potential tenants who came through the door,'' and offered bargain renewals, too.
 Mr. Medina of Cushman & Wakefield said the state's success in luring the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was a ''potential omen of more good things to come.''
 The company is expected to move 1,600 jobs from Wall Street to the Newport Office Center in Jersey City as of 2013, using tax-break incentives.
 Mr. Pozycki, however, said the deal was atypical, since it was negotiated privately with the involvement of state officials.
 ''It's a glass-half-full type of situation,'' Mr. Medina said. ''As we continue to bump along the bottom and read tea leaves, many things become a matter of opinion, or attitude.''

HEADLINE: Up in the Air

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
This was a lost decade for the American stock market. But for much of developing world, it was the Roaring '00s -- a period of soaring markets and breakneck investment that left even some bulls wondering if the good times can last. 
 While the broad American market lost about a fifth of its value in the last 10 years, emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, China and India powered ahead with gains in the double or even triple digits. 
 The numbers are staggering. On Ukraine's PFTS Stock Exchange -- a Wild East of investing that did not even exist until 1997 -- shares soared more than 1,350 percent over the last decade. In Peru, stocks jumped more than 660 percent. Here in India, the Sensex index leaped more than 240 percent. 
 To believers, those heady gains underscore profound shifts taking place in the global economy, where investment dollars, euros and yen whiz across borders and time zones with the stroke of a computer key. As many Americans wait for an economic recovery, money is pouring into the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, as well as into oil-rich Russia and the former Soviet bloc.
 ''What we're living through now is something of epic proportions,'' said Allan Conway, the head of emerging markets equities at Schroders, the big money management company in London. He likened the economic rise of nations like Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the so-called BRIC countries -- to that of postwar Japan.
 Amid all this euphoria, even some longtime bulls wonder if investors are getting a bit carried away. Emerging markets have a history of giddy booms and crushing busts dating back to the 19th century. They collapsed spectacularly in 1997, as a chain reaction of currency devaluations, bankruptcies and recessions rocked East Asia. In 1998, the Russian market plunged more than 80 percent after the country defaulted on its debts. 
 More recently, emerging markets tanked with the rest of the world in 2008, after shellshocked money managers took cash from anywhere that seemed risky. But they were a bright spot in 2009 -- the MSCI Emerging Markets index increased 73 percent in 2009, compared with a 25 percent jump in the S.& P. 500 index. 
 Despite 2009's gains, few predict a major setback today. Since the 1998 debacle, some developing countries have cleaned up their acts, balancing their budgets and improving their trade balances. As their economies grow, domestic investors have become big supporters of these countries' stock markets. With interest rates low around the world, companies based in emerging markets, like their counterparts in the developed world, enjoy access to cheap money. High commodities prices have buoyed stock and bond markets in nations that are big exporters of commodities. 
 But the recent travails of Dubai, where a debt-driven bubble economy is now bursting, provide a powerful reminder that in up-and-coming economies, what goes up can come down -- and fast. That these markets have gained so much, so quickly -- with some white-knuckled drops along the way -- gives some investment professionals pause. 
 Mark Mobius, one of the deans of emerging market investing, said that while developing markets still have room to run, the first half of 2010 could be bumpy. 
 ''We continue to see upside, but with substantial corrections along the way, which could be as much as 20 percent,'' said Mr. Mobius, the executive chairman of Franklin Templeton Investments, which is based in San Mateo, Calif. 
 Some market specialists worry that asset bubbles akin to the one that inflated and burst in the American housing market might be growing in places like China and Hong Kong. Others fret over the risks posed by volatile commodities prices, as well as over the inevitable end of this period of ultralow interest rates. 
 Leon Goldfeld, the chief investment officer for HSBC Global Asset Management in Hong Kong, told reporters this month that HSBC had cut its exposure to Asian equities, anticipating a 10 percent to 15 percent decline in early 2010. After that, Mr. Goldfeld said, Asian stocks would represent a ''good buying opportunity.''
 As long-term investments go, emerging markets seem to have a lot going for them. On average, developing countries have less sovereign, corporate and household debt than developed countries. Their economies are also growing faster than industrialized ones. Merrill Lynch predicts that emerging market economies will grow 6.3 percent next year, while the global economy expands by 4.4 percent. 
 Emerging markets are eclipsing their developed peers in other ways as well. Imports to the BRIC nations are likely to surpass imports to the United States for the first time ever in 2009, according to Morgan Stanley. 
 For the moment, the developing world is the engine of global growth. Emerging markets accounted for virtually all of the year's growth in global output, because developed economies shrank or were flat. Even if developed countries recover completely in 2010, emerging economies will account for 70 to 75 percent of the growth in global output ''for the foreseeable future,'' said Mr. Conway of Schroders. 
 Developing nations are also assuming a bigger role in the world economy. Morgan Stanley predicts that developing countries, including those in the Middle East, will account for 36 percent of total global gross domestic product in 2010, up from 21 percent in 1999. 
 All of this is a big lure to investors. Funds focused on equities in emerging markets attracted a record $75.4 billion this year, far surpassing their previous high of $54 billion in 2007, according to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows. 
 Even after that influx, emerging markets still account for only a small fraction of investment portfolios in United States and Europe, the world's money management centers. Less than 3 percent of assets managed by United States fund managers are invested in emerging markets. That number could double in the next five years, some investment experts say. 
 Even normally conservative investors might be tempted to jump into emerging markets, given the sluggish outlook in the United States and Europe. After a dismal decade for the American stock market, the developing countries might seem attractive. 
 ''Investors are starting to look at this asset class and realize that it is a pretty safe place,'' said Kevin Daly, who manages $1.7 billion in emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management.
 Despite their volatile history, emerging markets strike some money managers as relatively secure places to invest. Of course, such hopes have been dashed before.

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''Hired by Customs, but Working for the Cartels'' (''War Without Borders'' series, front page, Dec. 18) creates the impression that corruption is rampant among employees of United States Customs and Border Protection, or C.B.P., along our southwestern border. That is not the case. 
 As president of the union representing the 24,000-employee C.B.P. bargaining unit, I personally know thousands of C.B.P. officers, and I can tell you that this work force goes about its critical homeland security mission 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with dedication and integrity.
 Certainly, we must recognize and deal promptly and effectively with any instance of corruption. But corrupt officers are the very rare exception among this group of men and women who work so diligently at our nation's 327 land, air and sea ports of entry to protect our country and facilitate the trade that is so vital to our economic well-being.

HEADLINE: The Case for Reform

 BODY:
Reforming this country's broken health care system is an urgent and essential task. Given all of the fabrications and distortions from Republican critics, and the squabbling among Democratic supporters, it is no surprise that many Americans still have doubts. 
 President Obama and Democratic leaders have a strong case. They need to make it now. Here are compelling reasons for all Americans to root for the reform effort to succeed and urge Congress to complete the job: 
 THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS The fact that 46 million people in this country have no health insurance should be intolerable. Every other major industrial country guarantees health coverage to its citizens, yet the United States, the richest of them all, does not.
 Claims that the uninsured can always go to an emergency room for charity care ignore the fact that American taxpayers pay a high price for that care. And it ignores the abundant evidence that people who lack insurance don't get necessary preventive care or screening tests, and suffer gravely when they finally do seek treatment because their diseases have become critical. 
 The American Cancer Society now says the greatest obstacle to reducing cancer deaths is lack of health insurance. It is so persuaded of that fact that two years ago, instead of promoting its antismoking campaign or publicizing the need for cancer screening, it devoted its entire advertising budget to the problem of inadequate health insurance coverage. 
 We consider it a moral obligation and sound policy to provide health insurance to as many people as possible. While the pending bills would fall short of complete coverage, by 2019, the Senate bill would cover 31 million people and the House bill 36 million who would otherwise be uninsured under current trends.
 MORE SECURITY FOR ALL Horror stories abound of people -- mainly those who buy individual policies -- who were charged exorbitant premiums or rejected because of pre-existing conditions or paid out for years and then had their policies rescinded when they got sick. 
 Such practices would be prohibited completely in three or four years under the reform bills. Before that, insurers would be barred from rescinding policies retroactively and the bills would establish temporary high-risk pools to cover people with pre-existing conditions. 
 The legislation would also allow unmarried dependent children to remain on their parents' policies until age 26 (the Senate version) or age 27 (the House version). 
 If reform legislation is approved, employees enrolled in group coverage at work would also be more secure. If workers are laid off -- an all too common occurrence these days -- and need to buy policies on their own, insurers would be barred from denying them coverage or charging exorbitant premiums for health reasons. 
 CUTTING COSTS Americans are justifiably concerned about the rising cost of health insurance and of the medical care it covers. The reform bills won't solve these problems quickly, but they would make a good start. 
 Despite overheated Republican claims that the reforms would drive up premiums, the Congressional Budget Office projected that under the Senate bill the vast majority of Americans (those covered by employer policies) would see little or no change in their average premiums or even a slight decline. Those who buy their own policies would pay somewhat more -- but for greatly improved coverage. 
 Most people who would be buying their own policies would qualify for tax subsidies to help pay their premiums, which could reduce their costs by thousands of dollars a year. And small businesses would qualify for tax credits to defray the cost of covering their workers.
 The inexorably rising cost of hospital and medical care is the underlying factor that drives up premiums, deductibles and co-payments. No one yet has an answer to the problem. But the bills would launch an array of pilot projects to test new payment and health care delivery systems within Medicare. These include, for example, incentives to coordinate hospital and post-hospital care to head off needless readmissions, better coordination of care for the chronically ill, and incentives for doctors to provide a patient's total care for a flat fee instead of charging for each test or service provided. 
 The Senate bill would set up an independent board to spur the use of programs that save money or improve care -- subject to Congressional veto. Optimists believe the savings might come quickly but this could still take many years. Without passing a reform bill, there is little chance of success.
 THE TIME HAS COME For decades, presidents from both parties have tried in vain to reform the health care system and cover the uninsured. Still many Americans wonder, given the deep recession, whether it makes sense to do it now. The first thing to keep in mind is that the C.B.O. says that the reform bills are paid for over the next 10 years and would actually reduce future deficits. 
 The need is clear and the political timing is right with the Democrats controlling the White House, the Senate and the House. If this chance is squandered and Republicans gain seats, as expected, in the midterm elections, it could be a decade or more before reformers have another opportunity. Americans shouldn't have to wait any longer.

HEADLINE: Billions to Fight Foreclosure, But New Loans for Just a Few

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
They milled about the hallways of the cavernous State Supreme Court building in Jamaica, Queens -- 42 homeowners whispering, studying old bills, waiting for a court officer to call their names and wave them, one by one, through a door.
 There, in a dusty, high-ceilinged room with a steam radiator that never stopped wheezing, they took a seat across a table from a lawyer for a mortgage company. Then their work began: trying to persuade a stranger not to foreclose on their home.
 The Obama administration's plan to rescue Americans from foreclosure plays out day after day in rooms like this. On this day, as on most, nothing happened. One lawyer, visibly bored, put in a brief, token appearance. A few others seemed barely familiar with their cases. Another asked for more records, hinting that maybe next month the lender might talk about a settlement.
 Ismail Ali, a silver-haired immigrant from Guyana, hoped to save his home in Ozone Park. ''If it takes you another three months to evaluate me, and I keep paying, will I get a new mortgage?'' he asked, almost pleading. 
 The lawyer shrugged, not unsympathetically. ''I can't answer that for you,'' he said.
 Ten months ago President Obama announced a $75 billion program to keep as many as four million Americans in their homes by persuading banks to renegotiate their mortgages. Lenders have accepted more than one million applications and cut three-month trial deals with 759,000 homeowners. But they have converted just 31,000 of those to the permanent new mortgages that are the plan's goal. 
 In New York City, where 20,000 homeowners faced foreclosure this year, a recent study by the Center for NYC Neighborhoods found that lenders have offered new or trial mortgages to just 3 percent of the homeowners who have sought help.
 Big mortgage companies -- servicers, in the parlance of the industry -- stand at the heart of this program. Many of the servicers that have agreed to participate are subsidiaries of the nation's largest banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.
 They say their performance is improving. ''We ourselves stated that we fell short of our customer service goals,'' said Mary Coffin, executive vice president for loan servicing at Wells Fargo. ''Now we are doing three modifications for every foreclosure.''
 But a drove of critics, including homeowners, nonprofit loan counselors, legal services lawyers and court officials, say these companies are also at the heart of the problem. Servicers, they say, pile delay upon delay, and too often steer homeowners into new mortgages with onerous terms. Some companies have insisted that homeowners waive their right to sue before getting a new mortgage, even though the Obama plan prohibits such demands.
 Administration officials have vowed to shame servicers into action. And New York State lawmakers, like their counterparts in a few other states and cities, have tried to slow the headlong hurtle toward foreclosure by requiring lenders to negotiate with troubled borrowers in court.
 Leonard N. Florio, a court-appointed referee, oversees such sessions in that dusty room in Queens. He is a chatty man and punctilious about not taking sides. But as he watched Mr. Ali, the Ozone Park homeowner, load his piles of bills and receipts back into his shopping bags, he could not help noting a pattern. 
 ''I have yet to see an attorney for a servicer cut a deal,'' he said. ''Update this, update that. I mean, what's the holdup?''
 Loan servicers argue that homeowners are as often to blame: Many cannot show proof of income, and fail to make payments even on modified mortgages. And millions are in bigger trouble than the public realizes, burdened with monthly payments so exorbitant that even a reduced mortgage payment will not save their home.
 The servicing companies make money either way. The Obama program pays them $1,000 for each loan modified, and another $1,000 per year for three more years if the borrower avoids foreclosure. On the other hand, the companies make large sums charging late and legal fees on overdue mortgage payments, and sometimes it is cheaper to foreclose than to cut the mortgage payment. 
 These same companies turned billions of dollars in profits during the fat years of the bubble. Four years ago, lenders strung banners from storefronts in Jamaica and Cypress Hills and Bedford-Stuyvesant, promising ''You will not be turned down!'' A no-documents-needed mortgage was easily obtained, often accompanied by the flimsiest of appraisals. 
 Now the lenders toss up daunting hurdles. Homeowners say they send and resend thick piles of documentation, only to be told that their papers have been misplaced, or that their pay stubs are out of date. Housing counselors dial a dozen times just to get a servicer on the phone.
 ''It's a constant Catch-22: They never give you their name,'' said Gerald Carter, a counselor with the Parodneck Foundation in New York City, which receives city and state money to advise homeowners. ''You call back and say, 'No, I was talking to Bob last time,' but Bob wouldn't give his last name -- not even an employee ID number. So you start over.''
 Last month, the Legal Aid Society of New York sued the federal government and a mortgage servicer, Aurora Loan Services, on behalf of four Queens homeowners. Aurora, which has a $116 billion loan portfolio, was a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers before that firm went bankrupt; it offered loans with interest rates just a bit lower than subprime rates, which are typically a few percentage points higher than rates on conventional mortgages. 
 The lawsuit charges that Aurora, and by implication many other servicers, systematically denied homeowners access to the federal rescue program. And, the lawsuit asserts, the Obama plan provides far too few safeguards for homeowners.
 ''The servicers ignore their obligations, and are throwing unaffordable agreements at people and setting them up for another default,'' said Oda Friedheim, a staff lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.
 Asked to respond, an Aurora spokeswoman e-mailed a statement saying the company tries to prevent foreclosure for its customers.
 Tom Vellucci, 54, is one of the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and a soldier in this army of the potentially dispossessed. Once a maintenance man for an insurance company, with a modest home in Floral Park, Queens, he lost his health and then his job. When a tenant stopped paying rent, he fell behind on his mortgage. A so-called rescue firm offered to negotiate better terms and wheedled Mr. Vellucci and his wife, Maria, out of $8,000 in fees. 
 When the inevitable foreclosure notice arrived in March, the Velluccis called Aurora Loan Services and asked for a break. The company, he said, responded by piling on legal fees and giving them a four-month trial agreement that did not reduce their monthly payment.
 The Velluccis say they drained their savings making payments. Then the couple asked Aurora if they could revise their mortgage terms under the Obama rescue plan. They say the company refused, saying their mortgage was not eligible because it was owned by investors.
 Aurora makes a similar statement about investor-owned mortgages on its Web site. These claims are not true. The Obama program requires companies to make an effort to modify such mortgages.
 Sitting on a bench in the Queens courthouse, where he has become a regular, Mr. Vellucci ran his fingers through thick black hair and shook his head. ''We kept trying to pay on faith, all faith, so we could prove we were honest people,'' he said. ''Now all we look like is stupid.''
 Phyllis Caldwell, chief of the Treasury Department's Home Ownership Preservation Office, is not inclined toward tough talk about servicers, perhaps because the Obama plan, which she oversees, lacks enforcement teeth. Asked about Aurora's refusal to consider modifying investor-owned mortgages, she suggested a reporter call the program's compliance unit. 
 ''If it is reported in The New York Times and someone chooses to audit it, that's important,'' she said. 
 She sees a brighter day coming. ''We are holding the servicers accountable to report to us,'' she said. ''They are being much more transparent.''
 For now, however, the Velluccis and thousands like them dangle perilously close to calamity.
 Born in Italy, Mr. Vellucci and his wife migrated here as teenagers. They raised children, bought a house, lived their dream in Technicolor. Then his kidney gave out and their economic slide began. After court on this day, he would go for dialysis. The couple hope the lawsuit might give them one more shot at the Obama plan. 
 ''I don't sleep at night, I don't sleep at all,'' he said, rising slowly. ''I tell Maria, 'If we lose the house, I want to stop my dialysis.' I want to die, honestly.''

HEADLINE: Japan Unveils a Plan for Growth, Emphasizing Free Trade in Asia

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Still struggling after its worst recession in generations, Japan announced a long-term growth strategy on Wednesday that aimed to tap into the dynamism of its Asian neighbors, create millions of jobs in new industries and drive economic expansion of at least 2 percent a year over the next decade.
 The Japanese economy has eked out growth in the last two quarters as its mainstay exports have rebounded amid signs of recovery worldwide, particularly in China, the country's biggest trading partner. 
 But a swelling public debt and a persistent decline in prices and wages are raising fears that Japan's economic recovery could soon run out of steam. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has been under pressure since he took office in September to come up with a practical plan to reinvigorate Japan's economy.
 ''Indeed, the consensus view is that the economic recovery will at least stall, if not fall into another recession'' early next year, Masamichi Adachi, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a recent research note.
 Mr. Hatoyama's short-term remedy for Japan's economic troubles has been to funnel money to struggling households, including offering new cash subsidies for families with small children and free high school education. 
 But his government has appeared distracted by a dispute with Washington and a campaign finance investigation. And budget constraints have forced Mr. Hatoyama to backtrack on some promises, hurting his popularity.
 ''The new government's ability to take action is being tested,'' he said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''We will do whatever it takes to achieve this.''
 The government's new blueprint for economic growth in the long run is more global in outlook. The government says that it will push to create a free trade zone in Asia by 2020 to leverage the region's economic growth, and that it will make Haneda Airport in Tokyo a 24-hour hub for international flights.
 Japan also needs to become less reliant on the United States and bolster economic ties in Asia, Mr. Hatoyama said.
 ''Until now, our connection with the United States has been very strong. Naturally, this will continue to be the case in terms of our national security. But for economic growth, it is necessary to look closely at Asia as a new frontier,'' Mr. Hatoyama said.
 The plan envisions creating a $540 billion market for environmentally friendly technology and renewable energy that would employ 1.4 million people. It seeks to create 2.8 million jobs in the health and care-giving sectors to serve Japan's aging population.
 The new strategy calls for efforts to more than triple the number of foreign visitors to Japan, to 25 million by 2020, and create new jobs in a bid to support the country's ailing tourism industry.
 The plan aims to expand Japan's economy at an average rate of 2 percent over the next 10 years, with a goal of increasing gross domestic product to 650 trillion yen, or $7 trillion, from the 473 trillion yen projected for the current fiscal year.
 The government will bring the unemployment rate to the 3 percent range in the ''medium term'' from 5.2 percent in November, Mr. Hatoyama said.
 Analysts say those goals are unrealistic, however, given Japan's shrinking population and low rate of immigration. The government has also offered scant details on how its economic plan would be financed.
 ''A lack of government willingness to tackle the severe challenges of fiscal consolidation, and an aging population, prevents firms and households from feeling confident about the future beyond the next fiscal year,'' Mr. Adachi said.

HEADLINE: Midwest Business Activity Expands Beyond Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Business activity in the Midwest expanded more than expected in December, nearly hitting a four-year high, an industry association reported on Wednesday. 
 Employment in the group's report posted its biggest monthly gain since September 2008. 
 The gain in employment, which has been a big concern as the economy struggles to overcome the worst recession in decades, was seen as strong evidence the recovery was gaining some traction.
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer rose to 60.0, its highest reading since January 2006, from 56.1 in November. The result topped analysts' median forecast of 55.
 A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy.
 ''The number is a lot above consensus, and it bodes well for continued solid expectations as far as the economy and manufacturing goes. That's going to be a vital part of 2010,'' said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.
 The employment figure, after employers have been slashing jobs unrelentingly for nearly two years, was also seen as boding well for the economy.
 The report ''hints at the possibility of a positive reading on payrolls in December,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, who called the data ''an unambiguously robust reading on Midwest manufacturing conditions.''
 ''This report supports our view that manufacturing will be the primary driver of recovery over the next two quarters as an end to rapid inventory liquidation and a pickup in global trade drives manufacturing activity,'' Mr. Ryding said.
 The employment index rose to 51.2, from November's 41.9. It was the highest reading since November 2007 and the first time the jobs index has been in expansionary territory since then. It was also the single biggest monthly gain in the jobs index since it rose by 9.6 points in September 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers helped cause a huge downturn in the economy.
 The new orders index rose to 63.5, from 62.8.
 If that optimism is to be borne out, other regional and national reports will have to corroborate the report's evidence of recovery, though progress elsewhere remains uneven.
 In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's monthly manufacturing index fell in December, indicating slowing growth.

HEADLINE: History by Army Lays Out Missteps in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In the fall of 2003, the new commander of American forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, decided on a new strategy. Known as counterinsurgency, the approach required coalition forces to work closely with Afghan leaders to stabilize entire regions, rather than simply attacking insurgent cells.
 But there was a major drawback, a new unpublished Army history of the war concludes. Because the Pentagon insisted on maintaining a ''small footprint'' in Afghanistan and because Iraq was drawing away resources, General Barno commanded fewer than 20,000 troops.
 As a result, battalions with 800 soldiers were trying to secure provinces the size of Vermont. ''Coalition forces remained thinly spread across Afghanistan,'' the historians write. ''Much of the country remained vulnerable to enemy forces increasingly willing to reassert their power.'' 
 That early and undermanned effort to use counterinsurgency is one of several examples of how American forces, hamstrung by inadequate resources, missed opportunities to stabilize Afghanistan during the early years of the war, according to the history, ''A Different Kind of War.'' 
 This year, a resurgent Taliban prompted the current American commander, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, to warn that the war would be lost without an infusion of additional troops and a more aggressive approach to counterinsurgency. President Obama agreed, ordering the deployment of 30,000 more troops, which will bring the total American force to 100,000.
 But as early as late 2003, the Army historians assert, ''it should have become increasingly clear to officials at Centcom and D.O.D. that the coalition presence in Afghanistan did not provide enough resources'' for proper counterinsurgency, the historians write, referring to the United States Central Command and the Department of Defense. 
 ''A Different Kind of War,'' which covers the period from October 2001 until September 2005, represents the first installment of the Army's official history of the conflict. Written by a team of seven historians at the Army's Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and based on open source material, it is scheduled to be published by spring. 
 The New York Times obtained a copy of the manuscript, which is still under review by current and former military officials.
 Though other histories, including ''In the Graveyard of Empires'' by Seth G. Jones and ''Descent Into Chaos'' by Ahmed Rashid, cover similar territory, the manuscript of ''A Different Kind of War'' offers new details and is notable for carrying the imprimatur of the Army itself, which will use the history to train a new generation of officers. 
 The history, which has more than 400 pages, praises several innovations by the Pentagon, particularly the pairing of small Special Operations Forces teams with Afghan militias, which, backed by laser-guided weapons, drove the Taliban from power. 
 But, once the Taliban fell, the Pentagon often seemed ill-prepared and slow-footed in shifting from a purely military mission to a largely peacekeeping and nation-building one, fresh details in the history indicate. 
 ''Even after the capture of Kabul and Kandahar,'' the historians write, ''there was no major planning initiated to create long-term political, social and economic stability in Afghanistan. In fact, the message from senior D.O.D officials in Washington was for the U.S. military to avoid such efforts.'' 
 In one telling anecdote from 2004, the history describes how soldiers under General Barno had so little experience in counterinsurgency that one lieutenant colonel bought books about the strategy over the Internet and distributed them to his company commanders and platoon leaders.
 In another case, a civil affairs commander in charge of small-scale reconstruction projects told the historians that he had been given $1 million in cash to house and equip his soldiers but that bureaucratic obstacles prevented him from spending a penny on projects. It took months to reduce the red tape, the historians say. 
 The historians also say that such anecdotes underscore the resourcefulness of commanders faced with unclear guidance and inadequate resources. But limited manpower still had an impact on operations, the history indicates.
 When the Taliban was on the run in the spring of 2002, Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill, the incoming commander of American forces, traveled to Washington seeking guidance. The message conveyed by the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. Jack Keane, was, ''Don't you do anything that looks like permanence,'' General McNeill recalled. ''We are in and out of there in a hurry.'' 
 Largely as a result of that mandate, General McNeill took only half of his headquarters command from the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C. But as the conflict became more complicated, requiring diplomatic and political operations as well as military ones, General McNeill lacked enough planning personnel, the history suggests. He was replaced in 2003 by an even smaller headquarters unit, the history says. 
 The lack of resources was also apparent in the training of Afghan security forces, the history shows. 
 Early in the war, the training program was hampered by poor equipment, low pay, high attrition and not enough trainers. Living conditions for the Afghan army were so poor that Maj. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry likened them to Valley Forge when he took command of the training operation in October 2002. 
 ''The mandate was clear and it was a central task, but it is also fair to say that up until that time there had been few resources committed,'' Mr. Eikenberry, now the ambassador to Afghanistan, told the historians, referring to the army training program.
 The historians say resistance to providing more robust resources to Afghanistan had three sources in the White House and the Pentagon.
 First, President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had criticized using the military for peacekeeping and reconstruction in the Balkans during the 1990s. As a result, ''nation building'' carried a derogatory connotation for many senior military officials, even though American forces were being asked to fill gaping voids in the Afghan government after the Taliban's fall. 
 Second, military planners were concerned about Afghanistan's long history of resisting foreign invaders and wanted to avoid the appearance of being occupiers. But the historians argue that this concern was based partly on an ''incomplete'' understanding of the Soviet experience in Afghanistan. 
 Third, the invasion of Iraq was siphoning away resources. After the invasion started in March 2003, the history says, the United States clearly ''had a very limited ability to increase its forces'' in Afghanistan.
 The history provides a detailed retelling of the battle of Tora Bora, the cave-riddled insurgent redoubt on the Pakistan border where American forces thought they had trapped Osama bin Laden in December 2001. But Mr. bin Laden apparently escaped into Pakistan along with hundreds of Qaeda fighters. 
 The historians call Tora Bora ''a lost opportunity'' to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden. But they concluded that even with more troops, the American and Afghan forces probably could not have sealed the rugged border. And they deemed the battle a partial success because it ''dealt a severe blow to those Taliban and Al Qaeda elements that remained active in Afghanistan.''
 The history also recounts well-known battles like Operation Anaconda, in eastern Afghanistan in spring 2002. The history ends in the fall of 2005, when many American officials still felt optimistic about Afghanistan's future. Postponed parliamentary elections were held that fall, but Taliban attacks were also on the rise. 
 ''It was clear that the struggle to secure a stable and prosperous future for Afghanistan was not yet won,'' the history concludes.

HEADLINE: Is a Solution Within Reach?

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
FOR Design Within Reach, the company dedicated to popularizing modern design, 2009 was a punishing year. After sales plummeted, a hedge fund came to the rescue with an infusion of cash, then dismissed the chief executive.
 John Edelman, the new chief executive, starts work Monday, and while he hopes to engineer a turnaround, he acknowledged that D.W.R., as it is known, had too many stores, too few compelling products and too many demoralized employees.
 The company's problems are a disappointment to investors, who have seen the stock, once about $18 a share, fall to about 12 cents. But to some in the design world, its troubles are about more than money. 
 Alan Heller, a manufacturer in New York, tells a story that pretty much encapsulates the great promise and subsequent tumult of Design Within Reach. One of Mr. Heller's products is the Bellini chair, a 1997 design by the Italian architect Mario Bellini. It was such a good fit for D.W.R., Mr. Heller says, that it appeared on the back cover of the company's first catalogue in 1999. Over the years, Mr. Heller sold thousands of Bellini chairs through the company. 
 But last spring, Mr. Heller picked up a D.W.R. catalog and found a ''confusingly similar chair'' that wasn't the Bellini. Called the Alonzo, which Mr. Heller believes is a malicious play on his first name, the chair was priced about $50 less than the Bellini.
 Just days after he saw the Alonzo in the catalog, Mr. Heller filed suit against Design Within Reach. (Darren Cahr, a lawyer representing the company, said the suit was without merit; in court filings, he says the chair's distinguishing features are in fact common elements of modernist design.)
 Blu Dot, a designer and manufacturer of sleek contemporary furniture in Minneapolis, sued Design Within Reach in July. According to Blu Dot's president, John Christakos, his company had successfully sold its products through D.W.R. before Ray Brunner became chief executive in 2006. Then, Mr. Christakos said, the company abruptly stopped placing orders. In 2009, he noticed the company selling several products that he said were identical to his; in one case, he said, D.W.R. even used a photo of a Blu Dot table, taken in Blu Dot's studio, to promote its table.
 The lawsuit and the threat of bad publicity may have had the intended effect. Design Within Reach stopped selling the products in question this year; Blu Dot withdrew its lawsuit in October. 
 Indeed, one of the biggest challenges facing Mr. Edelman, 42, is winning back the respect of designers. ''We need the design community,'' said Mr. Edelman, a furniture lover who said he courted his wife at the 26th Street flea market in Manhattan. ''We want them to come to us with their ideas.'' 
 Even insiders like Mr. Edelman say the company's lineup has grown stale, with familiar midcentury pieces dominating the stores each season. ''If it's only the classics, there's no reason for people to walk in,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''We'll always have the classics, but we need new pieces to go with them.''
 One of his first tasks, he said, will be to meet with Mr. Heller and see if they can work things out. It may help that David Rockwell, the ubiquitous designer based in New York, joined the D.W.R. board after the hedge fund took control of the company. The usually gregarious Mr. Rockwell said in an e-mail message that he was not available to speak this week about his role. But he told Jeff Chu, an editor at Fast Company, the business magazine that dissected the company in its December issue, that he had not heard about the legal troubles before Mr. Chu called him.
 Mr. Edelman named Mr. Rockwell, along with Marc Newson, Thad Hayes and David Collins, as designers he would like to work with on developing new products. 
 Critics ask whether designers can trust Design Within Reach, given its history of promoting original design while selling knockoffs. But they may need the company as much as it needs them. Karim Rashid, a designer of sleek contemporary objects in New York, said he didn't know enough about the company's ethics to give an opinion. But, he said, ''if they called me, I would work with them,'' because so little contemporary design is produced in the United States. ''I'm working with about 35 companies in Italy, and not a single one in the U.S.,'' he said. 
 Glenn Krevlin, whose Glenhill Capital bought 92 percent of the company last summer -- when, he said, Design Within Reach was ''running out of money'' -- said he believed the criticisms of the company were overblown. He said the company had never lost a case brought by a designer, and that it had ''voluntarily taken financial hits'' to put the question of knockoffs behind it.
 He argued that the company's troubles were mainly due to hard times in the furniture industry, the result of declining home construction and moribund real estate markets. Sales peaked in 2007 at about $194 million. Its most recent available figures, for the second quarter of this year, show sales of about $30 million, down nearly 35 percent from the same period in 2008. (Other furniture companies have seen similar declines. For the quarter ended July 31, BoConcept, the Copenhagen company that sells modernist furniture, saw revenues drop 21 percent. In St. Louis, Furniture Brands International, which owns such labels like Broyhill, Lane, Thomasville, Drexel Heritage and Henredon, said its second quarter sales were down 35 percent from the same period in 2008.)
 But D.W.R. always appeared to have a mission that extended beyond making money. It seemed determined to do nothing less than change the country's taste -- Americans have tended to prefer traditional interiors -- which may explain why the company's setbacks have caused so much consternation in the design community.
 Design Within Reach was founded in 1999 by Rob Forbes, a former potter with an M.B.A. from Stanford, who believed there was a retail demand among consumers for pieces by the likes of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. (Before, the classics of modernist design were generally available only to architects or designers.) Mr. Forbes began the company with a low overhead; he expected most sales to come through the company's catalog and Web site. And he styled himself an educator as much as a marketer. He also used the Web for a design newsletter, in which he wrote of his passions, including Ducati motorcycles, the sidewalks of Rio de Janeiro and Parmesan cheese, none of which D.W.R. sold.
 He kept the product line closely edited. ''Without Rob, it would have been Pottery Barn Within Reach,'' Mr. Heller said. 
 But even under Mr. Forbes, the company sold knockoffs. Unable to reach an agreement with Knoll, which makes Mies van der Rohe's famous Barcelona chair, it began selling its own version, called the Pavilion. ''I was always reluctant personally, but the business metrics were so compelling,'' Mr. Forbes said. Although he was in charge at the time, he said selling a mix of licensed and unlicensed pieces in the same store ''was a cloudy area. I never liked it.'' 
 Dan Fogelson, the vice president of Emeco, which makes a distinctive line of metal chairs, said, ''There were a lot of knockoffs at the beginning, but we complained, and they took us seriously.'' Eventually, he said, D.W.R. became the largest retail outlet for Emeco products.
 After Design Within Reach went public, in 2004, it quickly added new locations. ''The mantra was, 'Let's open more stores, so we can make our revenue numbers, in order to achieve our growth,' '' Mr. Forbes said. The escalating real estate and personnel costs made profits elusive. In 2007, Mr. Forbes resigned, which he said was the result of ''differences in the company's strategic direction.''
 The company he left behind was troubled. Mr. Edelman, when reached by telephone before he left on a family trip to Mexico, described Mr. Brunner as ''uneven, dictatorial and extremely mercurial.'' On his first visit to the company's headquarters in San Francisco earlier this month, Mr. Edelman, said he found the employees ''hand-shy, like a dog that's been hit.'' (Numerous attempts to reach Mr. Brunner were unsuccessful.)
 Mr. Edelman spent 14 years working at Edelman Leather, the company founded by his parents; it supplies high-end furniture makers. In 2007, he sold Edelman Leather to Knoll, the producer of furniture by the likes of Mies van der Rohe and Eero Saarinen. Knoll, in the meantime, had agreed to sell its Barcelona chairs and other products to Design Within Reach, which ceased knocking them off, and it soon became one of D.W.R.'s biggest suppliers. Mr. Edelman said he took the job at Design Within Reach with the blessing of Knoll's chief executive officer, Andrew Cogan. 
 Mr. Edelman said D.W.R. would stop making knockoffs, though it would not stop making products ''inspired by classics. If you see something in Milan, and go ahead and produce something inspired by it, that's not a knockoff,'' he said. ''It's how the industry runs.''
 But retailers who compete with D.W.R. blame the company for muddying the market with its mix of originals and knockoffs. Nasir Kassamali, an owner of Luminaire, a retailer based in Miami, said that it created confusion ''about what is authentic and what is not. Now a discerning person doesn't want to buy, because the originals and the knock-offs are all mixed up.'' 
 Mr. Edelman is also up against a tough economy. He said he would like to close some stores, but many of them have long leases that are expensive to break. He said he would also be taking a close look at Tools for Living, the company's 700-item collection of accessories -- ranging from a set of 24 chopsticks ($35) to a teak croquet set ($498) -- that was introduced in 2008. 
 And, he said, he will be spending more time and money on the company's Web site, which was part of Mr. Forbes's original vision.
 Despite the company's problems, he added, he expected running it to be fun. Did he say fun?
 ''If you really love midcentury, you love modern and the business of letting people access it,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''You have to love this company.''

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Charges 'Sewer Service' Fraud by New York Debt Collectors

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
The first notice that a debt judgment had been entered against her came in July, said Monique Sykes. Big red letters were splashed across the top: ''Marshal's Notice of Execution.'' 
 ''I was in a panic,'' recalled Ms. Sykes, 29, of the Bronx. ''For like 5 or 10 minutes all my eyes could focus on were those words, 'Marshal's Notice,' and 'lien on property.' '' 
 Ms. Sykes is among thousands of New Yorkers who, according to a class-action lawsuit, are victims of a network of debt collectors who used fraudulent documents to surreptitiously win court judgments -- all without the debtors' knowledge. 
 The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan this week, takes aim at a decades-old practice known in legal circles as ''sewer service.'' This is when a debt collector fails to serve a notice of complaint and then files a false affidavit claiming the notice has been properly served. When the debtor doesn't show up in court, the collector can then apply for, and almost always wins, a default judgment. 
 The first a victim often learns about the judgment is when a bank account is seized or a lien is threatened. The judgments can also ruin a person's credit report. 
 Consumer advocates say the practice has grown in recent years, fueled by the recessionary rise in consumer debt actions and the emergence over the last decade of companies that buy up charged-off debt for pennies on the dollar, then seek to recover the full debt, along with interest, for themselves. 
 The economic collapse has put new scrutiny on the scheme as more and more people have found themselves in debt-related legal actions. In April, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo arrested the owner of a Long Island process-serving company, American Legal Process, for engaging in the practice. 
 The investigation suggested that on hundreds of occasions, servers claimed to be in several places at once, often over distances impossible to cover in a day. The attorney general's office is seeking to vacate more than 101,000 court judgments statewide obtained by debt collection law firms that used American Legal, and has expanded its inquiry into other firms. 
 Valerie Hayes, corporate counsel for A.C.A. International, a trade association of credit-collection companies, said they rely on process servers to provide honest service. She said she did not believe that fraudulent filings were widespread. ''The problem is with a few disreputable process servers,'' she said, ''and I don't think it's limited to the debt-collection industry.''
 But a 2008 report by MFY Legal Services, a nonprofit law firm in New York, found that defendants in consumer debt cases showed up in court less than 10 percent of the time, raising questions about whether they were ever properly served and about the prevalence of sewer service in the industry. 
 The class-action lawsuit filed on Monday goes after an entire debt collection chain, starting with the debt-buying companies, the law firm they hired to collect the debt, and the process-serving firm used to notify debtors. The suit names five debt-buyer firms with variations of the names L-Credit and LR Credit. All are subsidiaries of Leucadia National, a $6 billion publicly traded holding company engaged in various businesses, including timber and manufacturing. The company, which is also named as a defendant, declined comment on the suit. 
 Mel S. Harris & Associates, the law firm named in the suit, did not return phone calls seeking comment. The process-serving company, Samserv Inc., out of Brooklyn, denied allegations that it filed false affidavits of service. 
 ''Absolutely not, absolutely not,'' said William Mlotok, Samserv's owner. Mr. Mlotok said he could not comment on the specifics of the lawsuit because he had not seen it. 
 The lawsuit was filed by MFY, the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project and the law firm of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady. It claims it could represent more than 100,000 victims of judgments won through the actions of the companies in New York civil courts since 2006. A central claim of the action is that most debt-buying firms do not get enough information in the volume data they buy to meet the burden of proof to win a debt case. They therefore seek default judgments. 
 When Ms. Sykes got her marshal's notice, she learned that a judgment had been won against her nine months earlier, but this was the first she had heard of it. A process server claimed in an affidavit that he served notice to her Bronx apartment on July 18, 2008, at 7:15 p.m., giving the summons to a ''Ms. Rolanda.'' 
 A parent of two young children, Ms. Sykes said that either she or her husband, a union carpenter who was looking for work at the time, would certainly have been home then. Further, she said, she had never heard of Ms. Rolanda, nor had any of her neighbors. 
 Ms. Sykes did have an old Chase credit card that had a small balance when she was laid off a few years earlier that she had hoped to repay, but nowhere near the $2,500 judgment won against her. 
 With the help of the advocacy project, she went to court and insisted on a hearing to prove that she had never been served. A lawyer with Mel S. Harris instead offered to settle for $800, then to drop it altogether. She refused, insisting on a hearing. A judge finally dismissed the case, but without prejudice, meaning the company can go after her again.

HEADLINE: Memphis Accuses Wells Fargo of Discriminating Against Blacks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
The mayor of Memphis, A C Wharton Jr., has walked with bile rising in his throat through the streets of Hickory Hill and Orange Mound and Whitehaven in recent years, as house after house in those black neighborhoods has fallen into foreclosure.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Wharton and other city and county officials filed a lawsuit accusing one of the nation's largest banks, Wells Fargo, of singling out black homeowners for high-interest subprime mortgages. 
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tennessee, marshaled a raft of statistics to argue that Wells Fargo offered one lending reality for whites and another for blacks. In Shelby County, which includes Memphis, one of every eight Wells Fargo loans in predominantly black neighborhoods resulted in foreclosure, compared with only one in 59 such loans in white neighborhoods, the lawsuit said.
 Such charges, if proven, amount to reverse redlining -- marketing expensive loan products specifically to black customers.
 ''You drive through our neighborhoods and it's just palpable -- you can see a strong emerging black homeowning community that's gone,'' Mr. Wharton said in an interview. ''The clarity of the patterns just stand out like a sore thumb.''
 The lawsuit is one of several discrimination suits filed against Wells Fargo in the past two years, as city and state officials argue that the bank must take responsibility for the social and economic effects of a decade of loose -- some federal agencies have argued irresponsible -- lending practices. In Baltimore, officials say that Wells Fargo's lending practices tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city millions of dollars in taxes. 
 Lawyers for the City of Baltimore produced two former loan officers who described a pattern of discriminatory practices aimed at persuading blacks to take out what the officers called ''ghetto loans,'' high-interest mortgages. Their affidavits are also cited in the Memphis suit. 
 Last summer, the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, started a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of marketing high-cost mortgage loans to black and Latino customers while selling lower-cost loans to white borrowers with similar incomes.
 The cumulative effect, Ms. Madigan argued, was to turn the black and Latino neighborhoods of the nation's cities ''into ground zero for subprime lending.''
 Wells Fargo officials have consistently declined interviews on the subject and noted only that their loans account for a small fraction of the nation's total mortgage lending.
 A spokesman, Kevin Waetke, wrote in an e-mailed statement that while the bank had not had a chance to study the Memphis lawsuit, ''the allegations referenced in earlier news reports about Wells Fargo's lending practices are baseless and inaccurate.
 ''Other courts have found similar suits against lenders to be without merit,'' Mr. Waetke wrote, ''and we are confident of a similar outcome here.''
 A federal judge in Baltimore has not gone that far, but this month he did suggest he might narrow the scope of that city's lawsuit. The judge said the suit tended to hold Wells Fargo responsible for ''the deterioration of the inner city,'' which, he said, was implausible.
 Memphis and Shelby County officials make a similar argument, if perhaps more grounded in statistics. Memphis draws 70 percent of its budget from property taxes, and so, Mayor Wharton said, rows of vacant homes are like a fiscal dagger to its heart. Shelby County has 40 percent of all the foreclosed homes in Tennessee.
 ''Property tax is the mother's milk of government here,'' Mr. Wharton said. ''Our unemployment is high, our poverty rate is 35 percent; we cannot afford to lose our tax base.''
 Many black homeowners in Memphis, the lawsuit says, could have qualified for prime-rate mortgages, thereby saving themselves tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. That conforms with nationwide patterns, according to a variety of studies. 
 Last spring, The New York Times analyzed foreclosures and subprime lending in New York City and found that black homeowners making more than $68,000 were nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages as whites of similar or lower incomes. (The disparity was greater for Wells Fargo borrowers in New York, where 2 percent of whites and 16.1 percent of blacks in that income group hold subprime mortgages.) 
 What makes the Memphis case particularly nettlesome, said John Relman, a lawyer who represents the city and county, is that statistics suggest that Wells Fargo knew how to write responsible mortgage loans -- for whites. ''Wells knew how to write and get people into low-cost loans,'' Mr. Relman said. ''You just don't see much of that in the black community.''

HEADLINE: Surge in Suicides, Driven by Financial Hardship, Alarms Area's Koreans

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Ali Adeeb and Eunji Jang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They had navigated the move from South Korea and opened a nail salon on Long Island, but by last winter, Yongho and Soonhee Kim were in debt and deeply unhappy. They were fighting a lawsuit over nonpayment of rent on the Long Beach salon and were months behind on rent payments for their apartment in Oakland Gardens, Queens. The bank had repossessed their car. 
 At dawn on Feb. 25, the couple left a note for their 20-year-old daughter outside their apartment door, doused themselves with gasoline and set themselves on fire, the police said. The blaze killed them and destroyed their home. 
 ''They 100 percent lost hope,'' said Mr. Kim's brother-in-law, Chi Kun Park. 
 While the recession has scattered its distress widely, without regard for nationality, many Koreans and Korean-Americans in the New York area worry that it is taking a particularly heavy toll on their community.
 The number of suicides reported to the local Korean Consulate General has more than doubled this year, to 15 from 6 last year, and there were 5 in 2007. All of the dead were Korean citizens, said the consulate, which does not keep statistics on Korean-Americans. The latest suicide came on Dec. 15, when a woman in her early 30s hanged herself in her home in Flushing, Queens, the consulate said.
 The consul general, Kyungkeun Kim, said he believed that the actual total of suicides by Korean citizens might be more than twice as high. The Korea Times, a Korean-language newspaper published in the United States, reported in September that at least 36 Koreans and Korean-Americans in the New York region had taken their lives this year. 
 Money troubles have been the leading force behind the sharp rise, say Korean civic leaders and officials, who are alarmed by the trend. 
 Many Koreans place an extraordinary emphasis on academic and professional achievement, said Sung Min Yoon, the assistant project director at the Asian Outreach Clinic of the Child Center of New York. Failure to get into top colleges, perform well at school or climb the economic ladder can cause deep shame and embarrassment. 
 ''We have a very inflexible mentality,'' Mr. Yoon said.
 Community groups have organized several suicide prevention seminars. The Korean-American director of a funeral home in Flushing that caters to Koreans sponsored two seminars, in New York City and New Jersey.
 Koreans are by no means alone in their concern. An Irish-American community center in Yonkers held a series of mental health workshops in the fall after a spate of suicides among Irish immigrants.
 Even so, the total number of suicides in New York City has dropped: there were 339 in the first 10 months of this year, or about 34 per month, down from 39 per month in 2008 and 39.4 in 2007, officials said. (National statistics are not yet available for the past three years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) 
 The rise in suicides among Koreans in New York, however, mirrors an increase in South Korea, where the suicide rate last year was 26 per 100,000 people, up from 24.8 in 2007 and 21.8 in 2006, said Dr. Myung-Soo Lee, director of the Seoul Suicide Prevention Center.
 This month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that South Korea had the highest rate among its 30 member nations, based on 2006 statistics. A number of prominent South Koreans have killed themselves this year, including former President Roh Moo-hyun, who was implicated in a corruption investigation; Daul Kim, a top South Korean model; and Park Yong-oh, the former chairman of Doosan, South Korea's oldest business conglomerate. 
 Some experts trace the increase in the suicide rate, in part, to the nation's rapid transformation from an impoverished agrarian society to a booming industrial power. Traditional family support systems have fractured, age-old value systems have dissolved and materialism has flourished, they say. And those changes continue to steer the lives of recent emigrants to America.
 ''We are thinking that we're living in the United States, but we still keep the value of the higher expectations and higher achievements,'' said Mr. Yoon, of the Asian Outreach Clinic, who immigrated from South Korea a decade ago. 
 Among the Koreans who killed themselves this year in the New York region was Won Jo Lee, 36, a cabdriver whose body was found, shot in the head, on Sept. 6 in his apartment in Bayside, Queens, the Korean Consulate said. The Korea Times reported that Mr. Lee had been suffering financial difficulties, and it quoted his roommate as saying he had recently been laid off.
 The following day, Kyung-ho Lee, a security guard, set himself on fire at his apartment in Fresh Meadows, Queens, and died, according to the consulate. Mr. Lee, 55, had broken up with his companion and had persistent money woes, The Korea Times reported. 
 On Sept. 11, a Korean-American man hanged himself in the basement of his home in Demarest, N.J., the police said. Neighbors told The Korea Daily, another Korean-language newspaper, that the man, Chungsik Kim, owned 10 clothing stores in New Jersey and was struggling financially. He left a wife and three children, the paper reported.
 But Koreans in New York say none of the deaths have had the impact of the Kims' suicide in February. 
 The couple immigrated in 1990 with their infant daughter. For years they worked at a convenience store on Northern Boulevard in Queens, and in the early 1990s they opened their nail salon. But business started slow and never picked up much, said Mr. Park, Mr. Kim's brother-in-law. 
 About two years ago, the couple started sinking into debt. They suffered silently, however, and except for one small loan from Mr. Kim's brother, they asked for no help from family members, Mr. Park said. 
 ''He's losing money, and he's very private,'' Mr. Park said. ''Instead of asking for money from people, they thought the better way was to commit suicide.'' 
 In the brief note the couple left their daughter, Jieun, who was spending the night elsewhere, Mr. Kim wrote: ''I love you, my daughter. I'm very sorry to leave you alone. It would've been much better if you had a wealthier father.'' Along with the note, they left $40 in cash for her, Mr. Park said. 
 Koreans and Korean-Americans rallied to the aid of the daughter, a graphic design student at Queens College, donating $37,400 in a communitywide appeal for help. She moved in with Mr. Park and his wife. ''We accept her as a daughter,'' he said.
 And she bid farewell to her parents, scattering their ashes in Long Island Sound under the Throgs Neck Bridge.

HEADLINE: Heart-Stopping Fall, Breathtaking Rally

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
This was the year that Wall Street turned a crash into a bang.
 Stock markets will ring out one of their most volatile periods in history Thursday with an incredible rally that replenished half the losses caused by the financial crisis. 
 While the Dow Jones industrial average zigzagged through the last 10 years to finish near its start, 2009 proved to be the best year after the comeback in 2003, which followed another epic crisis, the dot-com bust. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average will likely end the year up more than 20 percent, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index nearly 25 percent. Shares of troubled banks like Bank of America, which tumbled more than 90 percent when markets were packed with fear, are resurgent after they repaid billions the government lent them to make it through the crisis. 
 But whether investors continue to see these gains will depend on more than an economic recovery.
 As the recession ebbs, interest rates are expected to rise in 2010, weakening the fragile rebound that is emerging in corners of the housing market. Unemployment may be peaking, but many Americans are still struggling to pay bills, or even avoid foreclosure. And the government is starting to pull back on the cheap financing it used to stimulate the economy and nurse the financial industry back to health.
 If recent signs of growth fizzle out, markets could once again lose their ebullience, as they have several times in the last two years. A solid recovery would push stocks higher, though few analysts expect the market to repeat its stunning 2009 performance.
 ''There are long, long periods of time when the market and the economy go two different ways,'' said Barry Ritholtz, a professional investor and author of ''Bailout Nation,'' a book about the causes of the financial crisis. ''A rallying market doesn't necessarily mean the economy is healing.'' 
 For much of the decade, the stock market has been a great disappointment. As of Wednesday, the S.& P. index closed 23 percent below and the Dow closed 8.25 percent below where they ended 10 years ago, in 1999. The Nasdaq, the average that was hit hardest by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, is down 44 percent over that period.
 How markets will look in the coming decade will be determined in part by policy makers. A too-rapid withdrawal by the government of fiscal or monetary support for the economy could throw markets into fresh tumult. But if policy makers take too long to let go, they could help to re-inflate bubbles in stock, housing and other markets.
 ''If things are booming, policy makers will feel empowered to remove stimulus quickly,'' said Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. ''If you are an investor, what you actually want is the Goldilocks phenomenon -- not too hot, not too cold.''
 For now, many investors are starting to believe that the painful 10 years just concluded has laid the foundation for a new bull market, just as the misery of the 1930s was followed by a postwar boom. These optimists say the worst of the financial crisis is over now that the big banks are making money once again. 
 While the economy remains weak, their argument goes, it is growing again. Inflation remains tame and interest rates are low. Fewer jobless claims are being filed and some companies, like FedEx, are starting to hire again. Industrial activity is showing sparks of life, while a weak dollar has helped American companies sell more overseas, especially to emerging markets like China and India, which are still growing rapidly.
 ''It's very fair to say we are going to have a less robust recovery than normal,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. But ''that's very different than saying we will have a very difficult recovery or no recovery.''
 Yet more bearish investors, and there are still many of them, see little reason for optimism. They say that the economy will struggle for some time because of problems like rising defaults on commercial mortgages and the large number of Americans who are unable to find full-time work, which reduces consumer spending.
 ''People who have lost their jobs are obviously not going to be consuming very much,'' said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund firm in New York, who is bearish about American stocks.
 They worry that the recovery is still too reliant on government support, some that is scheduled to end soon. The $787 billion federal stimulus package is expected to peter out in the coming months, for instance. 
 At the same time, investors could also grow fearful of the huge bill that America is accumulating to spend its way to recovery. The White House estimates government debt accounted for 90 percent of the economy's total output in 2009, up from 70 percent a year earlier. While the cost of borrowing for the government and others remains historically low today, it could surge higher in the coming years.
 The credit crisis also remains a big concern, as demonstrated by the government's growing financial commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The companies are still saddled with large mortgage liabilities and will most likely receive hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer support. 
 Meanwhile, banks and other financial institutions will face new waves of problems as more borrowers default on commercial mortgages and other loans in the coming year. At the end of September, delinquencies on commercial real estate loans held by banks climbed to 8.7 percent, their highest levels since 1993, according to the Federal Reserve.
 As a result, Mr. Melcher said he did not believe that companies would be able to increase sales and profits very much, or at all. Analysts should get another glimpse of how well companies are doing in a few weeks, when firms announce their results for the end of 2009.
 Given all these challenges, skeptics worry that the breathtaking rally -- the S.& P. 500 index has surged 66 percent since March -- has made stocks too expensive. The 10-year price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, a measure of how expensive stocks are relative to profits, was more than 20.3 in late December, up from 13.3 in March. The average for the last 130 years is 16.4, according to calculations by Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist.
 Mr. Ritholtz said that just as investors were overly pessimistic in March, when stocks fell to their lowest level in more than a decade, they have become irrationally optimistic about the recovery. 
 ''History tells us that this will end with a substantial correction,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia To Handle Abuse Calls Differently

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Barclay Walsh contributed research.

 BODY:
Responding to a sharp increase in homicides stemming from domestic violence, the Philadelphia Police Department announced plans this week to change how officers handle domestic abuse cases.
 While Philadelphia's overall homicide rate has dropped about 9 percent and all violent crime in the city is down compared with this time last year, there have been 35 domestic homicides since January -- a 67 percent increase from 2008. The police say two additional killings are still being investigated and are likely to be added to the tally.
 ''It's something we have to confront because domestic violence homicide is a crime where you know who the perpetrator is and there are often warning signs that the crime is coming,'' said Patricia Giorgio-Fox, the deputy police commissioner. 
 Commissioner Giorgio-Fox added that 21 of the 35 domestic homicide victims had made a total of 178 calls to the police, and that some of the callers had restraining orders against the individuals suspected or convicted of killing them.
 The new police protocol, which is still being adjusted, will involve better data so that officers know when they answer a call if there have been previous reports of domestic violence from the address and whether a restraining order has been obtained.
 The increase in domestic violence in Philadelphia is mirrored nationally, and experts say it is linked, in part, to the recession. In fact, data indicate that domestic violence had been falling in the 15 years before the recession took hold last year.
 In May, the Mary Kay Ash Charitable Foundation released a study indicating that 75 percent of the nation's domestic violence shelters have reported an increase in women seeking help since September 2008. The report also found that 73 percent of these shelters attributed this rise to financial issues.
 Moreover, the increase has come as services for domestic violence victims have been cut. 
 ''Domestic violence is up, and while the poor economy that helps drive the violence is still not rebounded, states are drastically slashing funding for domestic violence services,'' said Sheryl Cates, chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, a federally financed emergency hot line. 
 This year, California cut at least $2 million from the state budget that goes toward financing 94 domestic violence shelters and centers. California accounts for 13 percent of emergency calls, the highest of any state, according to the national hot line.
 Legal aid financing in West Virginia has been cut this year by 62 percent, reducing services to help protect victims of violence, according to the National Organization for Women.
 In Illinois, the legislature reduced financing for domestic violence programs by 75 percent, and scores of domestic violence shelters, sexual assault and other social service programs have been forced to cut staffs, reduce hours and trim other services, the organization said.
 In Philadelphia, the new efforts come on the heels of several highly publicized cases involving repeat offenders, including Willie L. Scott, who the police say shot and killed his former girlfriend in February in front of the couple's 4-year-old daughter. The police had responded to at least 10 calls for help from the house since the start of 2008. 
 Federal data from the National Crime Victimization Survey indicate that domestic violence remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2008, but no numbers are available for this year.
 In 2008, about 552,000 crimes were committed against women by their partners, compared with about 588,000 in 2007. The rate of such violence against women fell by about 53 percent between 1993 and 2008, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
 In recent years, states have experimented with different methods of dealing with repeat offenders. 
 At least a dozen states have begun using GPS technology to try to keep people involved in domestic violence or against whom there is a restraining order away from their current or former partners, according to the federal Electronic Monitoring Resource Center in Denver. Those states allow judges to order people to wear monitors that send a warning to the police and the victim when the individual enters an ''intrusion zone'' -- a circle drawn around the victim's home or workplace or her child's school or day care center.
 Commissioner Giorgio-Fox said the new regulations would take effect early next year. The policy will require police districts to keep their own detailed databases on domestic calls, indicating the nature of the call, whether a restraining order is connected to the address and whether the incident involves a repeat offender. 
 Dispatchers will be required to provide that data when an officer responds to a call. The department will also begin working more closely with city agencies and nonprofit organizations that offer counseling and shelters for domestic violence victims so that people with more training than the responding officers can arrive in emergency cases and try to persuade the victim to leave the premises, she said. 
 ''All too often, officers arrive, hear from both sides and then we have little ability to convince the victim to leave,'' Commissioner Giorgio-Fox said. ''The next time we get the call, it's often too late. So our officers need to be able to judge these situations better and earlier.''

HEADLINE: The Gloves Come Off in a Bay Area Baseball Battle

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
Cities in the Bay Area are natural allies in most matters, sharing as they do a transportation system, generally liberal politics and perpetual fears of a catastrophic earthquake.
 But over the last month or so, the area's three biggest cities -- Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose -- have been in a testy tug of war over the fate of the Oakland A's, the attendance-deprived and stadium-challenged baseball franchise whose history includes four championships, including one over the San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series that was interrupted by an earthquake.
 The source of the tension is the desire by the A's owner and managing partner, Lew Wolff, to move his team to San Jose, the richer Silicon Valley city 40 miles to the south. 
 That plan, which is being reviewed by Major League Baseball, has set off a round of hand-wringing here in Oakland, where residents are suffering sinking civic morale in the face of high unemployment, persistent violent crime and budget cuts. 
 ''Baseball has been synonymous with Oakland since my early childhood,'' said the city's mayor, Ron Dellums, 74, who recalls watching games of the A's precursor, the Oakland Oaks, while growing up in Berkeley. ''It's a part of the history of Oakland, and part of the spirit of Oakland.''
 But in a twist, the biggest ally of the city and A's fans in fighting the move may be the cross-bay rivals, the Giants, who argue that San Jose is their exclusive territory and central to their fan base, something affirmed by Major League Baseball in the past.
 ''The health and competitiveness of the organization depends on these territorial rights,'' said Staci Slaughter, a Giants' spokeswoman. 
 Meanwhile, earlier this month, the San Francisco city lawyer, Dennis Herrera, sent a letter to Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, saying that moving the A's to San Jose would hurt San Francisco and ''undermine the financial viability of the Giants,'' and hinted at legal action if the move was approved.
 Shortly after that, San Jose's mayor, Chuck Reed, shot back, accusing the Giants of interfering with his city's pursuit of a big-league club. ''I certainly think that the San Francisco Giants are being inconsiderate at best,'' Mr. Reed said in an interview. ''And a little bit rude.'' 
 Mr. Wolff declined to comment on his plans for the A's, but has said in recent interviews that the team's decrepit stadium in southern Oakland prevents it from competing financially -- and on the field. In interviews, he has also raised the specter that the team would move out of state rather than stay in Oakland.
 ''We have determined that San Jose is the only option for us in California,'' Mr. Wolff told San Francisco magazine this month. 
 The ultimate decision on where the A's will play lies with Mr. Selig and the owners of the league's 30 teams. The league has been examining options since spring, when another plan to move the team, to Fremont, 17 miles north of San Jose, fell through. At that time, Mayor Dellums and the Oakland City Council president, Jane Brunner, asked Mr. Selig to look for ''a permanent ballpark solution here in Oakland.'' A three-member league committee is expected to give its recommendation on the A's in early 2010.
 Neither a spokesman for Major League Baseball nor the committee would comment until the review was complete. 
 The committee has visited Oakland, and its deliberate methods have encouraged Douglas Boxer, a founder of Let's Go Oakland, a coalition of business and community leaders seeking to keep the A's.
 ''I believe that if this is just a check-the-box experience, they've expended a lot of time and a lot of money,'' said Mr. Boxer, who added that his mother, Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, had also urged the team to stay in Oakland. ''In my opinion the committee went from going, 'Oakland didn't have a chance and couldn't get its act together,' to believing that we have sites that work for both baseball and the city.'' 
 Oakland has been scrambling for alternatives, and on Dec. 10, Mayor Dellums and Ms. Brunner unveiled three potential sites for a stadium downtown, across San Francisco Bay from the Giants' stadium, AT&T Park. 
 Mr. Wolff's major complaint is with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, the aging structure that the A's share with football's Oakland Raiders. Opened in 1966, the Coliseum has been called ugly, uncomfortable and antiquated. And that is from its fans.
 ''It's a horrible stadium,'' said Philipp Miller, 29, an Oakland public school teacher and a regular at A's games. ''I don't think anyone would argue with that.''
 The stadium was renovated in 1996, adding a bank of football-friendly luxury suites. The A's have long argued that the Coliseum has kept fans away and prevented the team from earning the income needed to land big-money players. 
 Of course, the team's recent play probably has not helped. Once a perennial contender, the A's have been in a funk for several seasons, finishing last in the division in 2009, and drawing an average 17,392 fans a game, the lowest in baseball. Home games are often less than half-full. All of which, some say, has its gritty charms. ''You can buy a ticket for $8 and pretty much sit wherever you want,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 Supporters of the move to San Jose say it could solve attendance problems and thus provide more money. San Jose has more than twice the population of Oakland, and a bundle of prosperous Silicon Valley companies. The city also has only one major professional sporting team, hockey's Sharks. 
 ''We're a growing town with a lot of disposable income and a lot of people,'' Mayor Reed said. 
 In the meantime, A's fans will continue to wonder where, and if, they will be able to follow their team. Sara Buckelew, 39, a pediatrician, said that she attended 20 to 40 A's games a year and loved the team, but that a move would break her allegiance.
 ''I'm an A's lifer,'' Ms. Buckelew said. ''But I think them moving to San Jose is giving up on fans like me.''

HEADLINE: Time to Revive Stock Dividends

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN, EDWARD HADAS and ROLFE WINKLER

 BODY:
For the first time in modern stock market history, investors in United States equities are likely to finish a decade empty-handed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is set to provide a negative 0.8 percent average annual total return. Even the grim 1930s did better. While share prices fell, dividends made the average total return positive, by 1 percent a year. 
 Investors may bemoan their misfortune, especially when they consider annual inflation of 2.5 percent in the period, compared to annual deflation of 2 percent in the 1930s. But they can take two small comforts. 
 First, it could have been worse. By Japanese standards, the United States technology stock bubble that inflated share prices at the beginning of the decade was just a baby frenzy. The Nikkei index is still only at a quarter of its all time high, hit two decades ago. 
 Second, shareholders actually got more cash out of the companies than shown in the statistics from S. & P., which oversees the benchmark index. The calculations do not include share buybacks, but these push money to equity holders in much the same way that dividends do. And in 7 of the last 10 years buybacks have been larger than dividends, almost double from 2005 to 2007.
 Over the last generation, regular dividends have increasingly been considered passe. Thirty years ago, 94 percent of S.& P. 500 companies sent quarterly checks to their shareholders. Last year, 74 percent did, according to S.& P. 
 Many companies sticking with tradition have been more miserly. Since 1936, companies have paid an average of 53 percent of their earnings in dividends. Over the last decade, they have offered 46 percent.
 After this meager decade, a steady flow of cash in the hand looks a lot better than potential capital gains in the bush. In financial theory, assuming equalized tax rates, the two have identical value. In practice, though, a relatively steady dividend payout reduces investment risk and keeps corporate executives from taking too many big bets on risky investments and acquisitions. 
 It's time for dividends to come back into fashion. 
 Cutting Their Losses
 Why bother? That's the question more underwater Americans are asking themselves about their mortgages. Trapped in the abyss of negative equity, more will decide to quit paying. That would be a rational response.
 About a quarter of all mortgages in the United States are on houses that are worth less than the unpaid balance of the loan, according to the real estate consultant First American CoreLogic. About half of that group, 5.3 million borrowers, are 20 percent or more underwater. For 2.2 million, the property is worth less than half the mortgage balance. 
 Those folks are called homeowners, but home borrowers would be more accurate. All they own is an obligation to whatever entity services their mortgage. They're essentially renters paying more than market prices for their habitat. 
 That ownership tag is often felt to be important. And Americans trained to believe that a mortgage is a moral obligation fear punishment or a guilty conscience if they walk away.
 But foreclosure is hardly the mark of Cain, especially in states like California and Arizona where lenders have no practical recourse to pursue a borrower's other assets. 
 As more homeowners underwater realize there's no hope to regain their equity, more will reasonably seek to cut their losses. The reduction of liabilities brings immediate debt relief and often a lower cash outlay -- on rent -- for comparable housing. The financial shot in the arm should outweigh the stigma of foreclosure.
 Financial self-interest is likely to be contagious. A study by three economists suggests that when a few borrowers in a neighborhood just say no, others are likely to do the same. 
 Lenders do what they can to keep economic rationality from spreading. They try to extend and pretend with lower interest rates, longer terms, and the pretense that eventually the borrower will make good. They will do anything to avoid the hit to capital that comes from a write-down of the principal.
 Until now, borrower guilt has helped protect bank balance sheets. That is likely to change and usher in a new, painful chapter of the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Shares Little Changed on Light Trading

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks ended the next-to-last day of 2009 little changed as welcome news on manufacturing helped offset a drop in commodities prices.
 The market drew support Wednesday from a crucial economic indicator that signaled growth in Midwest manufacturing for a third consecutive month. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index rose to 60 in December from 56.1 in November. The report found that production and new orders increased and employment improved. 
 A rising dollar and light volume held the market's gains in check. A rise in the dollar makes commodities, and thus the shares of companies that produce commodities, less attractive to foreign buyers. It also hurts the profits of companies that do business overseas.
 Some investors have been buying the dollar in recent weeks on the belief that the economy is improving and the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year. That buying interest comes after a months-long slide in the dollar.
 After a 24.7 percent rise in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year, many investors have closed their books and are making few moves ahead of the start of 2010. Trading has been quiet with fewer players in the market, though light volume can also bring volatility.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.10 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,548.51, its highest close since Oct. 1, 2008. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.22 points, or less than 0.02 percent, to 1,126.42, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 2.88 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,291.28.
 The modest moves came a day after stocks broke a six-day winning streak as reports on home prices and consumer confidence failed to rally investors.
 Gold and other metals fell. Oil prices rose after the government reported that the nation's crude supply fell for a fourth week in a row. 
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 96 20/32. The yield fell to 3.79 percent from 3.80 percent. 
 The government injected $3.8 billion into GMAC Financial Services to help the company deal with losses in its home mortgage business.
 Aetna said it expected to book a fourth-quarter charge of up to $65 million to cover the costs of layoffs and consolidations.

HEADLINE: Drinks? Shake, Stir and Roll

BYLINE: By MARIA RICAPITO

 BODY:
EDDIE ROSS, a designer and former contestant on ''Top Design,'' the Bravo reality show, had known he wanted a bar cart for some time. ''It's Marilyn Monroe, J.F.K. and the '50s Rat Pack,'' he said. 
 But finding the right one wasn't easy. ''Restoration Hardware had one in glass and polished nickel for about $1,300, but I couldn't afford it,'' said Mr. Ross, 31, who writes a blog about decorating and entertaining. And ''I didn't want one that everyone else had. So I kept a lookout on 1stdibs.com, but those were like $3,000.''
 Finally, making the rounds at the Hell's Kitchen flea market one Saturday morning, he spotted a tarnished brass cart with glass trays for $100. ''I literally jumped on it, put my coat on it and ran to the A.T.M.,'' he said. ''All I had to do was clean it up.'' 
 Now it lives in the dining room of his home in Millerton, N.Y., Mr. Ross said, but ''I just love that I can wheel it through the house. I can wheel it into the living room and make a self-serve bar. In nice weather, I wheel it to the porch.''
 Among the many advantages of having a bar cart, he said, is that ''you don't need to have a bartender.'' Besides that, he added, ''It's chic to make a martini using really beautiful things, standing at a great cart -- the suave entertainer making a cocktail for everyone.''
 And ''it doesn't have to be expensive,'' he added, even with all the accessories. ''You can go to Goodwill or the Salvation Army and get a decanter for 99 cents.''
 Bar carts, once a fixture of the American living room, seem to be making a comeback. It's unclear whether this is a trend driven by the desire to save money in a recession -- people drink more during hard times, it's cheaper to drink at home and bar carts are a less expensive way to add a bar to a room than remodeling -- or a nostalgia for a simpler, more stylish time when one didn't have to worry so much about saving money.
 What is clear is that they are appearing ''more and more in shops and spreads in magazines,'' said Robert Passal, an interior designer in Manhattan.
 In his own work, Mr. Passal said, ''we use them often.'' In fact, he said, ''we used them in the past two projects we just did,'' one of them the Manhattan apartment of the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez. 
 ''I just installed a bar cart in Alex Rodriguez's bathroom, as a caddy for towels, bath accessories and personal goods like family photos,'' he said. ''We put some Listerine in a Baccarat decanter and set it on the bar.'' 
 Used more conventionally, for entertaining, he said, ''a bar cart allows guests to participate, rather than having someone pour them a drink. It makes an environment friendly, approachable.'' 
 Mr. Passal, 43, who sells bar carts in his shop in the Flatiron District, Robert Passal Interiors, said he had seen a marked increase in sales in the last year. ''I think they're back in vogue,'' he said.
 He has also been renting them out frequently as props for television and films. ''The new 'Sex and the City' movie took a vintage nickel and chrome bar cart for Carrie and Big's new apartment,'' he said, and the same cart was recently rented out again for a fashion shoot.
 Newell Turner, 48, the style director at House Beautiful magazine, said he had ''definitely seen a resurgence of bar setups in every room of the house -- especially in the living room, dining room and study,'' something he attributes to ''a resurgence of hospitality and of entertaining at home because of the recession.''
 As Scott Salvator, 50, an interior designer in Manhattan, noted: ''What with the recession, real estate is limited -- you can't always designate a whole room for a bar, build it in and do the plumbing. You buy a bar cart and put it there and you're ready to roll. Excuse the pun. And it really is more guest-friendly.''
 Beyond that, Mr. Salvator said: ''Why are bar carts back? Because they're a little bit camp, a little bit retro.'' 
 Tucker Shaw, 41, the food editor at The Denver Post and the author of ''A Man's Place Is Behind the Bar,'' agreed: ''It's the 'Mad Men' kind of resurgence of late '50s or early '60s culture,'' he said. ''People are looking to that time as a nice period to draw on for inspiration because it had style. There were cocktails all day -- or at least it seems so when you see movies and TV. The glasses were cool, there were more opportunities to partake. It seemed to bleed more into everyday life. Having said that, I wasn't alive then, so I don't know.''
 At the very least, bar carts may provide creative inspiration for ''the life you'd like to live,'' said Elaine Griffin, 45, an interior designer and the author of ''Design Rules: The Professional's Guide to Do-It-Yourself Home Style.''
 ''I love bar carts,'' Ms. Griffin said. ''They are so dramatically chic.''
 Of course, ''in the real world,'' she conceded, ''you flop on the sofa after work. Who has the time or energy to mix a martini?''
 For those who do, bar carts and all of their attendant accessories may provide a creative outlet -- what Richard Ocejo, an assistant professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who is writing a book about cocktail culture,calls ''craft consumption,'' a term he uses to describe ''people who buy things as a form of creative self-expression.'' 
 ''A bar cart provides guests with something unique, something you make for them, something you can tell a story about,'' Dr. Ocejo, 29, said. ''You are buying some booze, fruit and kitchen tools, and all of a sudden crafting this different, unique, amazing product for people.''
 He continued: ''People are reaching back in the past for something that was at some point real and true and somehow traditional, putting it in today's context. This generation of mostly young people in cities is looking back to various cultural practices and products of the past and seeing them as better or more authentic than what we're doing today.''
 Or, as Mr. Shaw put it: ''You're a pretty cool dude if you have a cocktail cart. People want to come over.''
 Deborah Needleman, 45, the former editor of Domino magazine, who has a vintage bar cart in her house in Garrison, N.Y., offers another explanation for their popularity. ''They are a signifier of graciousness, good breeding, conviviality and sophistication,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''And they are so wonderfully grown-up. The idea of walking over and fixing myself or my husband a drink after a long day is so visually appealing.''
 But not all bar carts aspire to that level of refinement. Michele Promaulayko, 39, editor of Women's Health magazine, said her bar cart began life as an ancient oil-stained carpenter's workbench she found at the Brimfield flea market. 
 ''I set it up in the entry hallway of my new apartment'' in Chelsea, she said. ''It's a conversation piece because it's authentic and unique -- it still has a big oil stain. Truthfully, I'm a wine drinker, not a hard liquor drinker, but I just liked the whole idea of pouring people a welcoming drink.'' 
 ''What's nice about it is that when you are having people over, your kitchen is so overwhelmed with what you are preparing,'' Ms. Promaulayko said. ''It's kind of nice to have this designated area for people to pour themselves a drink or a glass of wine.''
 Francesca Castagnoli, 40, who runs Motherblogger.com (''a blog about my home and all the things in it''), said she created the bar cart in her Montclair, N.J., house out of an Indian secretary, replacing the top cabinet with a tray that holds bar supplies and is flanked by a pair of Pier One lamps.
 In November, Ms. Castagnoli said, she had a moment when she realized she was having two holiday parties and didn't have nearly enough bar space. The bar cart provided a way to ''make sure people were mingling in the living room and dining room and out of the kitchen'' and ''created a new focal point for the parties.''
 ''My thing was not to make my bar too gimmicky,'' she said. ''I didn't want to make it look like this suddenly crusty retro part of my house. It's a working bar with old-fashioned charm.'' 
 Her party drink of choice is a St-Germain liqueur cocktail, made with prosecco, sparkling water and a twist of lemon. ''It's a wonderful, festive drink, like having sunshine in the winter,'' and the ingredients don't take up too much of the limited space on the cart, she said, acknowledging a drawback that most bar cart users eventually confront. 
 Steven Sclaroff, 45, an interior designer with a vintage furniture store in TriBeCa, put it more bluntly. ''I get having the bar out in plain view, and totally embrace that part,'' Mr. Sclaroff wrote in an e-mail message, ''but I need way more room for bottles et al than a cart generally provides. If you like liquor, they're scrunchy.'' 
 Anthony Giglio, 42, the author of ''Mr. Boston Holiday Cocktails,'' an update of a famous post-Prohibition recipe book, said he dealt with the space problem by using his cart for before-dinner drinks only. ''I have a proper liquor cabinet with my dining room set,'' he said. 
 Mr. Turner, the House Beautiful editor, offered a solution along the lines of Ms. Castagnoli's: ''It's fun to come up with one special cocktail that involves some creativity,'' he said. ''When you do that, you don't have to worry about having the full bar.''
 Mr. Sclaroff, however, said he remained unconvinced: ''I occasionally have them here in my shop if I see a cute one. They can be adorable objects, but even I stop drinking before I would need the liquor rolled up to me.''

HEADLINE: Seeking a Cure For Optimism

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
AMERICANS are an optimistic, can-do lot. We subscribe to the belief that we have a right to not just pursue happiness, but to be happy. No matter how grim the last year has been, no matter how rotten the economy or one's own setbacks, people believe it can all change with the flip of the calendar: all you need do is look on the bright side. 
 Happiness is not just our birthright, it is a growth industry. Beyond the perpetually positive Oprah Winfrey, Tony Robbins and the thinking-makes-it-so gurus behind ''The Secret,'' the Internet offers many new programs for self-improvement. Happier.com was created in the fall with promises of ''scientific solutions for real improvement.'' LiveHappy, a $9.99 a month ''mobile happiness boosting program,'' is based on the book ''The How of Happiness'' by Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, who says that activities like ''envisioning your best possible self'' are ''scientifically shown'' to make people happier.
 Is any of this true? Can an optimistic attitude and a will to happiness lead to a better you in the new year? 
 Recently, a number of writers and researchers have questioned the notion that looking on the bright side -- often through conscious effort -- makes much of a difference. One of the most prominent skeptics is Barbara Ehrenreich, whose best-selling book ''Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America,'' published in the fall, maintains that thinking positively does little good in the long run, and can, in fact, do harm.
 ''Happiness is great, joy is great, but positive thinking reduces the spontaneity of human interactions,'' Ms. Ehrenreich said. ''If everyone has that fixed social smile all the time, how do you know when anyone really likes you?''
 A study published in the November-December issue of Australasian Science found that people in a negative mood are more critical of, and pay more attention to, their surroundings than happier people, who are more likely to believe anything they are told. 
 ''Whereas positive mood seems to promote creativity, flexibility, cooperation and reliance on mental shortcuts, negative moods trigger more attentive, careful thinking, paying greater attention to the external world,'' Joseph P. Forgas, a professor of social psychology at the University of New South Wales in Australia, wrote in the study. 
 Psychologists and others who try to study happiness scientifically often focus on the connection between positive thinking and better health. In the September 2007 issue of the journal Cancer, Dr. David Spiegel at Stanford University School of Medicine reported his efforts to replicate the findings of a 1989 study in which he had found that women with metastatic breast cancer who were assigned to a support group lived an average 18 months longer than those who did not get such support. But in his updated research, Dr. Spiegel found that although group therapy may help women cope with their illness better, positive thinking did not significantly prolong their lives. 
 Ms. Ehrenreich, who was urged to think positively after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer several years ago, was surprised by how many readers shared her visceral resistance to that mantra. She created a forum on her Web site for people to vent about positive thinking, and many have. ''I get so many people saying 'thank you,' people who go back to work after their mother has died and are told, 'What's the matter?' '' she said. Likewise, there are ''corporate victims who have been critics or driven out of jobs for being 'too negative.' '' 
 Such criticism has annoyed those in the burgeoning academic field of positive psychology, which traces to 1998 when the president of the American Psychological Association at the time, Martin Seligman, sought out good scientific research on positive emotion. He found hundreds of studies showing the health benefits of thinking positively. While it is impossible to change one's inherent temperament, Dr. Seligman said, ''it's certain you can change pessimism into optimism in a lasting way.''
 Dr. Seligman, who now runs the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania and makes a rather unflattering appearance in ''Bright-Sided,'' is not pleased with Ms. Ehrenreich's book. In a posting on a positive psychology list serve, he accused ''Barbara I Hate Hope Ehrenreich'' of ''cherry picking'' studies to suit her purpose. 
 ''Where Ehrenreich and I agree -- we're both trying to separate wheat from chaff,'' he said in an interview. ''We just differ on what we think is wheat and what we think is chaff.'' 
 Many experts have come to question the connection between optimism and health. ''Being optimistic is secondary to having health and resources,'' said James C. Coyne, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who conducted a study on positive thinking and cancer and found no correlation between optimism and improved outcomes. ''Ranges of cross-studies have found this,'' he said.
 ''It's easy to show an association between optimism and subsequent health,'' he said, ''but if you introduce appropriate statistical controls -- if you take into account baseline health and material resources -- then the effect largely goes away.''
 Other experts are less definitive. Barbara L. Fredrickson, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has been exploring the function of positive emotions since the early 1990s. Dr. Fredrickson, whose book ''Positivity'' was published this year, differentiates between positive thinking and positive emotion. ''Positive thinking can sometimes lead to positive emotion, but it won't always,'' she said. ''It's like the difference between wearing a T-shirt that says 'Life is Good' and actually feeling deep in your bones grateful for your current circumstances.''
 With that in mind, she cautions that the idea of ''fake it till you make it'' can actually be harmful to one's health. ''What my research shows is that those insincere positive emotions -- telling yourself 'I feel good' when you don't -- is toxic and actually more harmful than negative emotions. We need to become more sophisticated about what is real and what is fake within people's attempts to be positive.''
 Ruth Rossoff, 79, of Philadelphia, said that she has felt tyrannized by the agents of positivity. In September, she said, her husband, who had been ill for some time and had realized he would never again live the kind of life he had been used to, decided he was ready to die. ''After seeing all the people who mattered to him and discussing his decision with me and our adult children, he made his wishes known to the people caring for him in the hospital,'' Ms. Rossoff said. 
 Then a doctor who was covering for her husband's physician stopped by. ''This young man came in and proceeded to tell him about his own mother's miraculous recovery from some illness by sheer willpower and pushed him to try harder to get better,'' Ms. Rossoff said. Her husband, energized, lived a few weeks longer. ''I was livid,'' Ms. Rossoff said. ''My husband suffered a few extra weeks with the same end result by listening to the pep talk.''
 As for Ms. Ehrenreich, she believes that negative thinking is just as delusional as unquestioned positive thinking. She hopes to see a day when corporate employees ''walk out when the motivational speakers start talking,'' she said. ''It's all about control and money.'' Her goal? To encourage realism, ''trying to see the world not colored by our wishes or fears, but by reality.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 31, about the debate over the value of optimism, misspelled the surname of a woman who says the life of her terminally ill husband was prolonged a few weeks by a doctor's encouragement. She is Ruth Rosoff, not Rossoff. The article also referred incorrectly to the price of LiveHappy, which is advertised as a ''mobile happiness boosting program.'' The $9.99 cost is one time only, not monthly.

HEADLINE: Adding Customers Abroad With the Aid of the Import-Export Bank

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Air Tractor, which manufactures crop dusters and other agricultural aircraft in rural Olney, Tex., has been able to duck much of the current economic turbulence because it sells its specialized planes around the globe.
 While selling in foreign markets has risks, small businesses like Air Tractor have been able to establish footholds abroad by relying on the Export-Import Bank of the United States to ensure they are paid for the goods and services they sell outside the United States.
 ''Without the Ex-Im Bank's guarantee, there would be a significant difference in the deals we can make,'' said David A. Ickert, the company's vice president for finance. ''We have been surviving and thriving because of exports.''
 Air Tractor has been exporting its planes for agricultural seeding, fertilizing and spraying since 1995, when it sold its first two aircraft in Spain. Since then, overseas sales have been a boon to a company that employs 200 people in a town with 3,400 residents. 
 The company has tapped into the little-known services that the federal government provides to American exporters by compiling research and information about markets in foreign countries and by helping companies with financing. The Export-Import Bank, which is the official American export credit agency, guarantees loans and provides insurance and direct loans. The Commerce Department and all 50 states also offer help. 
 The bank, which has seven regional offices to help small businesses export their goods and services, authorized $4.36 billion in 2,540 transactions to support small business exports in fiscal year 2009. And the bank, which turned 75 this year, is ready to do more, said Diane Farrell, a member of the bank's board.
 ''We have the capacity to do direct lending, and in these changing times, we will be looking to do more of it,'' she said.
 Congress is urging the federal government to take a larger role in helping small businesses with exports. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship this month approved legislation to bolster small business trade opportunities, and asked the Small Business Administration to appoint an official to focus on international trade programs. Federal lawmakers have also asked Ronald Kirk, the United States trade representative, to appoint a top-level official to open overseas markets to more American small businesses.
 Less than 1 percent of the nation's nearly 26 million small businesses are exporters, said Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the Senate small business committee. Those 240,000 businesses, she said, account for only 29 percent of the United States' export volume, a number that that has decreased in the last 10 years, according to a letter Senator Landrieu and the committee's ranking Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, wrote to Mr. Kirk this year. 
 Even so, some small businesses said that in the current economic slump -- federal statistics show overall exports by the United States fell 11.2 percent from October 2008 to October 2009 -- their sales abroad remained strong and that they had been able to add jobs. Mr. Ickert of Air Tractor said the company had hired 30 people in the last year.
 Engineered Systems and Equipment, a manufacturer of animal feed processing equipment in Caney, Kan., has more than doubled its work force recently, said its owner, Josef W. Barbi. He said the 26-year-old company now had 50 employees, an increase from the 20 in the last 18 months. ''We are one of the few companies in our area who are still hiring,'' Mr. Barbi said. Caney is in an economically depressed part of southeastern Kansas.
 Last year, the Export-Import Bank insured a $500,000 deal for Engineered Systems to sell specialized pellet systems to a Honduran company, Proteina, which makes animal feed. 
 That was one of about $7 million in export deals in the last couple of years that Engineered Systems has made in Latin America. Backing from the Export-Import Bank has been crucial, he said, allowing his company to compete with European rivals.
 While American exporters like Air Tractor are small enterprises, the business they do abroad can be large. Another Export-Import Bank client, Weldy-Lamont Associates, an engineering firm in Mount Prospect, Ill., relied on the bank's financial support to win a $350 million rural electrification contract from the government of Ghana, said Patrick Hennelly, the company's president.
 The firm, with only 13 employees, used to design projects like paper mills in the Midwest, but has branched out to win contracts in Thailand, China and Yemen, Mr. Hennelly said.
 Aided by an Export-Import Bank loan, Weldy-Lamont has taken a five-year electrification project in Ghana where, Mr. Hennelly said, ''we're putting in the wooden poles and stringing the wires to electrify villages across the whole country.''
 The international projects are particularly timely, he said, because ''the current economic crisis has stopped a couple of U.S. projects,'' for his firm including coal and natural gas plants, from going forward.
 Foreign projects can also lead to increased business orders inside the United States, said Kusum Kavia, co-owner and vice president of Combustion Associates, of Corona, Calif. Backed by Export-Import Bank insurance, her company won a multimillion-dollar contract to provide electric power generation systems to Benin. Ghana and Benin are in West Africa.
 Parts for Benin's 80-megawatt power plant power, Ms. Kavia said, come from suppliers in various regions of the United States. The gear boxes, for example, are made in Texas and the gear switchers in Pennsylvania. The generators are made in Ohio.
 The portion of the Export-Import Bank's financing for small business has increased in recent years, with prodding from Congress. In 2002, federal lawmakers told the bank to double small-business financing, from 10 to 20 percent, of the bank's overall authorizations. The bank has met the goal every year since 2006. 
 Still, some lawmakers have said that the bank has cumbersome regulations and has not done enough to help small American businesses compete with heavily subsidized foreign competitors. 
 A 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office criticized the bank's data and systems for tracking financing for small businesses. The bank has introduced Ex-Im Online, an automated transaction processing system to help small businesses and financial institutions speed through its paperwork. The same site, www.exim.gov, also has a small business portal for first-time applicants. 
 Small businesses can increase their chances of cracking the export market by doing their homework first, said Alan D. Andrews, vice president of PNC Bank's global trade and equipment finance group, which works with the Export-Import Bank. That includes checking online state resources, too; each has an export assistance center, he said. 
 Companies can also turn to the United States Commercial Service (part of the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration), which has market research and information about legal and other issues for each country. Its site is www.export.gov.

HEADLINE: Order on Interpol Work Inside U.S. Irks Conservatives

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Conservative bloggers and opinion outlets in recent days have expressed mounting alarm about an executive order by President Obama that extended certain privileges and immunities to the International Criminal Police Organization, better known as Interpol.
 Bloggers have accused Mr. Obama of ceding American sovereignty, painting a portrait of an international police force operating on United States soil without legal restraints. They have also argued that the order is part of a plot to allow international courts to arrest and prosecute American officials for war crimes.
 That theme is making its way from the blogosphere to more mainstream news outlets. 
 In a Web post for the conservative National Review last week, the commentator Andrew C. McCarthy declared that an ''international police force'' could now operate inside the United States ''unrestrained by the U.S. Constitution and American law.'' He also suggested that the order created in the Justice Department ''a repository for stashing government files'' beyond the reach of Congress and the public.
 And an editorial in The Washington Examiner this week declared that ''this new directive from Obama may be the most destructive blow ever struck against American constitutional civil liberties.''
 Obama administration and Interpol officials say the fears and accusations are based on ignorance about how Interpol works and about the context and impact of the order, which was issued on Dec. 17 without any statement.
 ''There is nothing newsworthy here,'' said Christina Reynolds, a White House spokeswoman.
 Contrary to its portrayal in some movies, Interpol has no police force that conducts investigations and makes arrests. Rather, it serves its 188 member countries by working as a clearinghouse for police departments in different nations to share law enforcement information -- like files on wanted criminals and terrorists, stolen cars and passports, and notices that a law enforcement agency has issued an arrest warrant for a fugitive. 
 In the United States, a bureau at the Justice Department staffed by American officials transmits information between law enforcement agencies and Interpol. If a foreign country issues an arrest warrant for a person inside the United States, it is up to the United States government, based on its own laws, to decide whether to apprehend the suspect.
 ''We don't send officers into the field to arrest people; we don't have agents that go investigate crimes,'' said Rachel Billington, an Interpol spokeswoman. ''This is always done by the national police in the member country under their national laws.''
 When public international organizations are operating on United States soil, a law allows the president to grant them certain rights and immunities, just as foreign embassies receive privileges. More than 70 organizations -- including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Bank and the International Pacific Halibut Commission -- receive those rights.
 In 1983, President Ronald Reagan extended some rights -- including immunity from lawsuits or prosecution for official acts -- to Interpol, which was holding its annual meeting in the United States. But Mr. Reagan's order did not include other standard privileges -- like immunity from certain tax requirements and from having its property or records subject to search and seizure -- because at the time, Interpol had no permanent office or employees on United States soil.
 That changed in 2004, when Interpol opened a liaison office at the United Nations in New York City. The office consists of five staff members, Ms. Billington said, and they have access to law enforcement information submitted by other countries with restrictions on who may receive it.
 ''When the office opened in 2004, we said look, we'd like to have the Interpol staff working in the office in New York afforded the same immunities as other international organizations,'' Ms. Billington said. ''It's only for the New York office.''
 The State Department recommended approving the request, but the Bush White House did not complete the matter before its term ended, and so it rolled over.
 The White House said it put out no statement with Mr. Obama's order because it viewed the matter as uninteresting.
 LaTonya Miller, the spokeswoman for the Justice Department's Interpol bureau, said the order would have no effect on the bureau. It routinely receives and responds to Freedom of Information Act requests, she said, and will continue to do so.
 ''Nothing has changed,'' she said. ''We've been really concerned about all the misinformation that has been out there on the blogs.''

HEADLINE: The Arts in 2009

 BODY:
Clockwise, from top: George Gagnidze as Baron Scarpia in the Metropolitan Opera's first new ''Tosca'' in 24 years (its production team was booed on opening night in September); Cate Blanchett won rave reviews in December for her portrayal of Blanche in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' in Brooklyn; a memorial for Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater in June; and the new American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art reopened in May.

 ARCHITECTURE
 In February a remade Alice Tully Hall, above -- the first phase of an overhaul of Lincoln Center scheduled for completion in 2010 -- opened. The womblike performance space was designed by Diller Scofidio & Renfro. At right, the first phase of the High Line, designed by James Corner Field Operations with Diller Scofidio & Renfro, opened in June. It is a series of low scruffy gardens, punctuated by a fountain and a few quiet lounge areas, that unfold in a narrative and seem to float above the noise and congestion below.
 THEATER 
 A revival of ''Hair,'' with Gavin Creel, above, moved from the free, outdoor Delacorte to the expensive, indoor Al Hirschfeld Theater, and audiences still lined up. But shows with London roots dominated the Tonys, especially ''Billy Elliot,'' with 10 awards, including best musical and best actor. That honor was divided among the three boys sharing the title role, including David Alvarez, below.
 TELEVISION
 Viewers had plenty of opportunities to say goodbye to familiar faces and institutions. NBC showed the final episode of its 15-year-old medical drama ''ER,'' left, the series that gave George Clooney, second from left, a breakout role. Oprah Winfrey, right, kicked off a long goodbye when she said she'd leave ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in 2011, while the CNN anchor Lou Dobbs quit that cable news channel on Nov. 11 and was gone the next day. Meanwhile AMC's ''Mad Men'' wrung an entire season's worth of anticipation from an event that its audience knew was coming: the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Charles Gibson anchored his last broadcast of ABC's ''World News'' on Dec. 18; three days later, viewers were saying hello to Diane Sawyer, above right, and, for the first time, two female anchors on competing network news shows.
 POP MUSIC
 The year was not without controversy: Adam Lambert, top left, gave a sexually provocative performance at the American Music Awards; and, at the MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West grabbed the spotlight from Taylor Swift. Also, the musical innovator Les Paul, top right, died. Bruce Springsteen, above, played the final concert at Giants Stadium, and Paul McCartney opened Citi Field.
 BOOKS
 For literature 2009 was in many ways a quiet year--all the quieter because two irreplaceable voices went silent: John Updike, above, and Frank McCourt, left. Mr. Updike, born in Shillington, Pa., turned the life of his fictional alter ego Rabbit Angstrom into an enduring chronicle of 20th-century America. Mr. McCourt came to America from Ireland at 19, and though he loved his adopted land, his greatest book, ''Angela's Ashes,'' is a bittersweet memoir of growing up poor in Limerick. Where Mr. Updike was a stylist, a seemingly effortless weaver of dazzling, texture-filled sentences, Mr. McCourt was a yarn-spinner, whose cadences were hypnotic. What they had in common was personal charm, a voice that could be mistaken for no other, and faithfulness to their roots. Though Mr. Updike moved to the Boston suburbs and Mr. McCourt became a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, each remained in his heart a small-town boy and proud of it.
 CLASSICAL MUSIC
 The Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, above, led the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in January, several months before he took over as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Mr. Dudamel, 28, started his new job in October with a gala opening concert at Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles, during which Mylar confetti rained down on the audience. At left, Alan Gilbert, the New York Philharmonic's new music director, conducting the orchestra in September. He succeeded Lorin Maazel in the job. Mr. Gilbert, a 42-year-old New York native, is the son of Philharmonic violinists past and present.
 FILM
 Yes, folks, 3-D is back. First the animated ''Up'' and then ''Avatar,'' which drove a record-breaking weekend at the box office, had audiences donning funny-looking glasses. Special effects still rule. But the darling of the Oscars was all about people: ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' right, a love story set in Mumbai and directed by Danny Boyle, took the big prize. 
 ART 
 Venice was wall-to-wall art for its biennale, especially in the case of Claire Scoville's projections, top. Despite the recession art buyers were bullish: Andy Warhol's ''200 One Dollar Bills'' went for $43.7 million at Sotheby's, below. The American art world lost an eminence: Andrew Wyeth, right, died at 91.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Familiar Face, and Finding a Coke

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
TO sell soda, Coca-Cola is making matches.
 It is not entering the online dating game but running a Facebook application that scans photographs of faces and tries to find matching images in its database, using attributes like skin color and chin angles.
 The idea behind the application, the ''Coke Zero Facial Profiler,'' is to draw people in with an entertaining game and surround them with a brand message while the profiler uploads and analyzes the photographs. 
 Coke Zero is ''still, in the scheme of things, a relatively young brand,'' said Linda Cronin, director of media and interactive communications for Coca-Cola North America. The company wants to broadcast the message that Coke Zero tastes like regular Coke, and ''coming to the site and interacting with the site helps us accomplish that goal,'' she said.
 Coke Zero was introduced in the United States in 2005. ''We had Coke and we had Diet Coke, but we were missing a no-calorie beverage for people that really love Coke. Diet Coke has a cola taste, but it was never intended to taste just like Coke,'' Susan Stribling, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, said. In addition, young men largely avoided Diet Coke because ''anything that's 'diet,' they think that's for girls,'' Ms. Stribling said.
 Still, ''we didn't want to be Diet Coke for dudes,'' said Dave Shiff, creative director for Crispin Porter & Bogusky, owned by MDC Partners, which handles the advertising for Coke Zero. ''It skewed male in the beginning, but the goal was always that it should not alienate -- a woman should be able to pick up Coke Zero and not feel weird about drinking it.''
 The campaigns have focused on the similarities between Coke and Coke Zero. Advertisements in 2006, for instance, depicted a scene of Coke brand managers fuming over Coke Zero stealing Coke's taste profile and considering legal action. 
 ''What we tried to do is say, 'Hey, look, let's not just say Coke Zero tastes like Coke; let's prove it. What are some of the things that might happen?' '' said Jeff Benjamin, interactive executive creative director at Crispin. 
 That spurred the idea for the facial profiler -- if Coke tastes like Coke Zero, could someone out there look like you?
 The company introduced it in September as a Facebook application, though it began delivering matches only this month, when it had collected enough photographs. (More than 430,000 have been uploaded to date.)
 To use it, a visitor can gain access to the application through Facebook or by visiting cokezero.com and agreeing to let the application pull information from his or her Facebook account. The application examines the Facebook photographs of the visitor, then has the visitor add another photograph from his or her desktop or Web camera. 
 Using facial-recognition software developed by an outside company, the application analyzes attributes like skin color, face structure and angles on the face. ''It basically takes your face and turns it into raw data, then runs your face and matches it through the database of all these different people,'' Mr. Benjamin said. 
 In a test run, this reporter uploaded three different photographs and got threedifferentmatches. All were women, which was a relief, but the matches didn't look like doppelgangers -- they seemed to be based on the position of the face in the photo, and things like the shape of lips, chin and eyes. 
 One of the matches, Julianna Kay Mishkel, of Tampa, Fla., said she had found that the matches were somewhat ''hit and miss -- some I could see the similarities, and some looked nothing like me.'' 
 ''I do see similarities between us, same face shape, smile is similar, and a little bit of similarity in the eyes as well, but our noses are different,'' Ms. Mishkel said in a Facebook message. ''I thought it would be interesting to see if I really did have a 'twin' somewhere out there.''
 After receiving a match, the visitor can contact him or her via their Facebook page -- how frequently people do that, Ms. Cronin said, is ''yet to be seen.'' (Mr. Shiff suggested some other, more humorous, uses that look-alikes might find for the application, like using one another's gym memberships).
 Coca-Cola is gathering data on the application, but with this, as with many new-media projects, it is not entirely clear what the data mean. More than 288,000 people have installed the application, and the average time spent on cokezero.com (Coca-Cola does not have access to time spent on the Facebook version) for the week of Dec. 7, the most recent week available, was more than five and a half minutes. That time is ''comparatively high relative to other programs,'' Ms. Cronin said. 
 There are sprinklings of other data. For example, there have been more than 100 non-English Twitter posts about the profiler, but whether that is good or bad is unclear. 
 Coke will test to see whether the application has changed how people think about Coke Zero, and though ''obviously we want to see an increase in sales, it's very difficult'' to trace it to a single campaign element when there are other elements going on, Ms. Cronin said.
 The effort required just a small media budget and was ''absolutely'' experimental, Ms. Cronin said. ''Internally, we call it a worldwide social experiment to see how this is doing, what does it do for our brand-health measures,'' she said. ''We feel like it's creating the buzz that we want.''

HEADLINE: And 7 Businesses That Did Not Survive

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
That this year has been a tough one for small business is no surprise. But just how tough it has been continues to astound. In the first quarter alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 400,000 businesses with fewer than 100 employees ceased operations, eliminating one million jobs. And it didn't get much better as the year went on. ''This is arguably the worst year for small business since the Great Depression,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com. When the numbers get that big, it can be easy to forget the human beings behind the numbers. Here's a look at seven businesses that failed this year:
 Business: Knight-Celotex, a Northfield, Ill. maker of fiberboard. Opened: 1920. Closed: June.
 At its peak: When Jim Knight bought the Celotex brand in 2001, it was taking in $46 million a year in revenue. By 2006, it was up to $115 million in revenue and 500 employees in four manufacturing locations. It was the world's largest maker of fiberboard. 
 What went wrong: The collapse of the construction industry. Revenue fell to an annualized rate of $50 million in the last quarter of 2008. Soon after, Bank of America -- which had taken over the Chicago-based regional bank that held Knight-Celotex's loans -- declared the company in technical default because its debt exceeded the percentage of cash flow established in its contract. The company was sold in pieces in bankruptcy.
 Looking back: ''One of the key things to be aware of is who your partners are and choose them wisely,'' Mr. Knight, 55, said ''Although all money's green, it's not all the same. It can come at a terrible cost.''
 Business: Rococo, a women's fashion boutique in Houston. Opened: August 2008. Closed: November.
 At its peak: Just four months after its opening, the 1,200-square-foot shop in River Oaks -- Houston's Beverly Hills -- was pulling in $40,000 a month in revenue. In early 2009 Houston magazine called it a top store for style. 
 What went wrong: The owner, Jennifer Watson, 39, says sales started to spiral downward in March. ''I went from $1,000 to $3,000 every day to five days in a row with zero sales,'' she said. Besides the weak economy, she blames the mall owner's decision to raze a local historical building in an expansion: ''People called River Oaks Shopping Center the most hated mall in Houston.''
 Looking back: Currently working as a personal assistant to a local cardiologist, Ms. Watson said she wished she'd rented from a small non-commercial landlord who might have been more flexible when times got tough.
 Business: Yarbrough's Family Restaurant, a Shawnee, Kan., eating place. Opened: 1966. Closed: December.
 At its peak: In its first 10 years, Yarbrough's was the only restaurant in Johnson County. Just down the street from the town's movie theater, it served some 600 people a day. 
 What went wrong: Yarbrough's demographic began to age. And then, when the stock market dropped last year, even loyal customers began to cut their visits from three times a week to once every other week. In addition, the third-generation owner, Michael Yarbrough, says chain restaurants like Applebee's trained people to expect assembly-line food instead of less-than-picture-perfect home cooking. Revenue, from a height of $3,000 a day a decade ago, fell by half.
 Looking back: ''I think me and my wife have done everything we could,'' said Mr. Yarbrough, 40. ''We tried extending hours for breakfast, opening seven days, and even a commercial on TV. I don't know what I'm going to do. I've been here basically my whole life. I made my first pie when I was 8.''
 Business: Kane Steel, a Millville, N.J., steel distributor. Opened: 1955. Closed: November.
 At its peak: In 2004 and 2005, the company was doing $40 million in annual sales and had more than 100 employees. 
 What went wrong: In September 2008, commodity prices suddenly began to plummet and the second-generation owner, Cliff Kane, found himself selling his inventory at cost. And then, with the recession, his sales volume dropped 40 percent. ''You can get costs down over time,'' Mr. Kane said, ''but when you have the revenue drop we had with the margin drop, you can't get small enough fast enough.''
 Looking back: ''I would like to stay in the business,'' said Mr. Kane, who is 57. ''This is all I've known for my professional career.'' On Jan. 4th, he plans to start his job search.
 Business: Body Styles by Mel, a Forest Hills, Md., fitness center. Opened: 2001. Closed: November.
 At its peak: In 2007, Mel Royster moved from a 4,000-square-foot gym to a 16,000-square-foot gym. By 2008, he was pulling in some $65,000 a month in revenue and doing more than 300 personal training workouts a week. 
 What went wrong: Because Mr. Royster, 52, was paying $20,000 a month rent at his new location, he needed a packed house to break even. ''Expanding was the first mistake,'' he said. ''I knew going in that working capital was going to be an issue. But, being stubborn, I did it anyway.'' In early 2009, revenue began to fall, declining to $45,000 a month. 
 Looking back: ''I didn't have the right business people in place to generate the revenue I wanted,'' said Mr. Royster, who believes his employees weren't selling aggressively enough. ''I tried to run it like a family, and I think I got a little too relaxed.''
 Business: Kimberly's Hallmark Shop, a Warren, Mich., greeting card and home store. Opened: 1970. Closed: March.
 At its peak: In 2000, the store brought in about $780,000 at its mall location across the street from the G.M. Technical Center, the car maker's primary engineering operation. 
 What went wrong: G.M. layoffs reduced the Technical Center staff from a peak of more than 20,000 to some 12,000. After last year's gas spike and credit market collapse, businesses abandoned the mall until only four remained. ''Even the dollar store closed,'' said Hallmark's owner, John Greer, 50. ''It was a ghost town.'' With 2009 sales projected to hit only $400,000, Mr. Greer decided to shut down in March.
 Looking back: A retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who bought the store in 2004, Mr. Greer says that if he'd been spending more time thinking about the future he would have moved to a new location. ''I was doing marketing and sales, but you get so caught up you don't pay attention to your growth strategy,'' he said. Mr. Greer has founded Mind Over Management, a consulting firm aimed at helping companies carry out long-term strategies.
 Business: Concierge at Large, a La Mesa, Calif., concierge outsourcer. Opened: 1997. Closed: August.
 At its peak: One of the first companies to offer concierge outsourcing to residential and corporate clients, its revenue peaked at $2.5 million in 2007. By 2008, the owner, Cynthia Adkins, thinks, it was the longest operating luxury concierge service in the United States.
 What went wrong: Corporate clients began cutting perks, and concierge services were one of the first. ''This April, a corporate client of nine years gave us 30 days' notice,'' said Ms. Adkins. ''They were crying when they called. I thought I could cut down costs to meet their budget. I didn't think they'd take it out of the budget.'' Revenue projected for 2009 fell to $80,000.
 Looking back: In retrospect, Ms. Adkins believes she should have sold the business. ''I would have loved to move on when it was doing well,'' said Ms. Adkins, 50. ''I could have parlayed it into something better. But when random calls came interested in me or the company, I wasn't prepared.'' Today, Ms. Adkins is selling CORE, a ''concierge in a box'' set-up and training system based on her business.

HEADLINE: Airlines Struggle Anew With Flier Frustrations

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
For the struggling United States airline industry, the new decade is starting out much like the old.
 Executives at carriers that survived the 2001 terrorist attacks, soaring fuel prices and a rough economy are now scrambling to find ways to minimize the impact of the Christmas Day bombing attempt on consumers' travel plans in the new year.
 The chief executives of several major airlines said this week that they have been in constant contact with officials of the Transportation Security Administration, which oversees security at the nation's airports, discussing the best ways to provide more safety on planes while keeping passengers' comfort in mind. 
 They acknowledge that the procedures have to be unpredictable to be effective. But they also say that the unpredictability could push travelers to avoid airports at all costs.
 They say consumers' perception of the inconvenience while traveling may even hurt the industry more than travelers' worries about another bombing attempt.
 ''I don't think people book away because of fear,'' said one executive, who agreed to speak candidly about the industry's concerns only if he was not quoted by name. ''I think they book away because of inconvenience. If it means three hours in line at an airport, they aren't going to take their trips.''
 In the last few days, airline executives said in interviews that they were most concerned about the impact of increased security on travelers taking short trips -- Boston to New York, New York to Washington, Chicago to Detroit -- given what they saw in the weeks after the September 2001 attacks.
 Even a slight decrease in passenger traffic could be difficult for US Airways and Delta Air Lines, which already have cut back on their East Coast shuttle flights, adding smaller planes to the medium-size jets that traditionally flew the routes.
 To entice more travelers back into the air, several carriers, including United and Southwest Airlines, have stepped up fare sales. 
 The back and forth between agency officials and airline executives has taken place on conference calls and through the airlines' trade group and may have resulted in the relaxation of some of the stiffest requirements that the T.S.A. put in place over the weekend.For instance, the airlines have been able to turn in-flight entertainment systems back on after they were ordered shut down during international flights because their maps show the locations of planes. 
 The pilots can now decide whether passengers are allowed to move about in the last hour of a flight and if they can keep their pillows and blankets, instead of requiring them to stay seated with nothing in their laps.
 The agency extended the rest of the current rules through the holiday weekend, officials said Wednesday night.
 Any drop in travel could put a damper on -- or even reverse -- the fledgling recovery the industry was hoping for in 2010. More financial troubles for the industry, which has lost about $3 billion this year and cut almost 30,000 full- and part-time employees could lead to further cost cuts and fewer flights.
 The fragile airlines were hoping they might gain some profits in 2010 after a two-year downturn in which they were pummeled by record oil prices and a recession that resulted in a 20 percent decline in air traffic, both overseas and in the United States.
 ''Just when things start to stabilize, they get hit with this,'' said Betsy Snyder, a veteran airline industry analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
 While airlines say it is too early to see an effect on bookings this week because so many travelers are on vacation and corporate offices are closed for the holidays, they will begin to see next week whether there is an impact on travel plans. 
 To be sure, the executives say they -- and their passengers -- are resilient and point to the rebound in travel that eventually occurred once the air system stabilized after the 2001 attacks. 
 This week, passengers encountered all manner of security at airports in the United States and abroad, from routine and speedy to lengthy and tight. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that this lack of consistency was intentional and that travelers should learn to expect the unexpected at the airport.
 But some passengers who endured the most stringent requirements this weekend questioned whether they were really effective. 
 ''It gives the impression of our government at work, but it's just to give people some sense of calm,'' said Kenneth Wright, of Phoenix, a medical researcher who flew from Nagoya, Japan, to Detroit on Sunday. He underwent several searches, including a full body pat-down, before he boarded his plane, while inspectors thoroughly searched his carry-on bag.
 Because they bear the brunt of travelers' frustration and anger, airline executives said they could use more help from the government explaining that there is a rationale behind the inconsistencies. Beyond that, their biggest need is to have the situation out of the spotlight as soon as possible, said Henry H. Harteveldt, a senior travel analyst with Forrester Research.
 ''If it's more than a week, we could see even more declines in trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific travel,'' he said. 
 He expects the airlines to try to assuage reluctant passengers with offers of extra frequent flier miles, a tactic they have used regularly when disruptions occur in air travel, and to cut prices to destinations like London, especially in the slow winter travel period. 
 But they may not be able to offer steep fare discounts, at least not for very long, because of their fragile financial situation. 
 ''It's not looking good, for an industry that hasn't been looking good for eight years,'' Mr. Harteveldt said.

HEADLINE: Failed State

 BODY:
New Yorkers should be appalled at their failed state government, particularly their corrupt and clueless Legislature. Scandal and irresponsibility have been Albany's creed for decades. This year, the gang added another outrage to the list: complete fiscal incompetence. 
 The only solace is this: The entire Legislature is up for re-election in 2010. And unless there is a sudden turnaround -- and, so far, we see few signs of it -- New Yorkers have no choice but to vote out all the lawmakers and start over. 
 If there is any doubt left, here are just a few reminders of this year's worst of the worst: 
 WHAT, US WORRY? New York has been on the brink of economic collapse, but the Legislature blithely ignored the problem for months. When the deficit reached a truly alarming $3.2 billion, the lawmakers grudgingly agreed to last-minute fixes while carefully protecting their political buddies and donors. That meant rich school districts on Long Island kept their money (until Gov. David Paterson imposed a temporary, across-the-board reduction), but 500,000 schoolchildren in New York City -- many of whom can't afford it -- will now have to pay to ride the subway to class. 
 Even after draining state savings accounts and using federal stimulus dollars that were supposed to be spent next year, they still fell $500 million short. Next year is now a few hours away. The state is already in the red, and it could be facing a $9 billion deficit by March. Yet there is no sign that legislative leaders have spent much time thinking about how to address this disaster. 
 SCANDALS ''R'' THEM There were so many legislative scandals this year that we're not sure where to start.
 First, there were the revelations -- surfacing only after the Democrats took control in January -- about how Senate Republicans had abused their 40-year majority and secretly used state money to pursue party business. Among the discoveries: a secret plant, with 75 employees, to print Republicans' mail to constituents; a Republican-only television studio; secret Republican Party research staff. The Democrats have closed a few of these scandalous operations, but they have not been energetic about scaling back their own perks now that they're in charge.
 The Republicans' longtime Senate leader, Joseph Bruno, stepped down in 2008 before he was indicted on eight counts of exploiting his office for personal gain. Earlier this month, Mr. Bruno was convicted on two felony counts involving ''theft of honest services.'' 
 The trial offered more instructive and stomach-turning details about the sleazy way that Albany operates. Mr. Bruno ran his private consulting firm out of his posh, taxpayer-financed Capitol office. His Senate secretary, other staff, phones, cars and copy machines were all used to get business and campaign contributions from private clients, some of whom came to him for help in writing and passing legislation.
 Worst of all, it took federal prosecutors to uncover these abuses because there was no explicit New York State law forbidding them. 
 We don't want to prolong the pain, but let's not forget the Republican coup in June, abetted by two of the least-qualified Democrats: Senators Pedro Espada Jr. of the Bronx and Hiram Monserrate of Queens. Never mind that Mr. Espada was -- and is -- being investigated for allegedly living outside his district and failing to report campaign contributions. And Mr. Monserrate already had been indicted for assaulting his girlfriend, who had been slashed -- somehow -- in his apartment by a broken glass.
 Nothing got done for more than a month until these two switched back to the Democratic side. Mr. Espada negotiated another title and salary bonus and more money for his district. He failed, after wide protest, to slip his son into a $120,000-a-year state job. 
 As for Mr. Monserrate, he was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend after dragging her through his apartment lobby and then driving her past several emergency rooms to find a hospital where he would not be recognized. His fellow senators are expected to decide next month whether to oust him. If they have any shame left, they must. He is clearly not qualified to represent New Yorkers. 
 O.K., MAYBE A TOUCH UP So do any of them get it? Not many. After all this sleaze and incompetence, John Sampson, who leads the Democratic majority in the Senate, suggested this week that legislators might need a public relations ''makeover.'' No superficial paint job can cover such a rotten core. What is needed is a sweeping top-to-bottom reform. 
 Democratic leaders say they are considering changes, including an ethics reform package that, with more muscle, might make it possible to rein in some of Albany's worst abuses. There is talk about taming the state's anything-goes campaign finance system, but it will take more than talk and press releases this time. 
 Almost no one is focusing on two other major problems: the gerrymandering that allows so many undeserving incumbents to hold on to power and Albany's relentless greed and influence-peddling. 
 Lawmakers must create a nonpartisan commission for fair redistricting before the maps are redrawn in 2011. Without it, the state will go another decade with no real political competition. They must establish a small, expert financial board to advise the state comptroller on pensions, one unswayed by political pressure or favoritism. And they must enact tough new disclosure laws that require lawmakers to fully, accurately and publicly report the sources of all their outside income. 
 New Yorkers have waited in vain for these reforms. Every year lawmakers promise to do better. And every year Albany has gotten worse. Legislators can either start doing the public's work now, or voters should turn them out. The election is less than a year away.

HEADLINE: Now Yemen

 BODY:
It didn't take long for an Al Qaeda branch, this time in Yemen, to crow about its role in the attempt to blow up Northwest Flight 253. The alleged bomber, meanwhile, told American authorities that he had gone to Yemen to get the explosive device and for training. 
 If there is any good news here, it is that the Obama administration -- which shockingly missed a series of warnings about the plot -- has been paying close attention to Yemen and, in recent months, has stepped up covert operations against Al Qaeda forces there. 
 Washington is providing $70 million over the next 18 months to equip and train Yemeni security forces for counterterrorist operations. And it has provided targeting intelligence and additional firepower -- possibly cruise missiles and drones -- for attacks on Al Qaeda bases. 
 Yemen's government is corrupt and repressive. But President Ali Abdullah Saleh seems to want to cooperate -- so long as Washington keeps a low profile. 
 The administration is now looking at ways to deepen military and intelligence cooperation with Yemen's government even more. But the country is foundering in so many ways that it may be on the verge of collapse. That means the United States and its allies are going to have to devise a broader strategy that also addresses Yemen's desperate economic, political and social problems. 
 The government's control does not extend much beyond the capital, Sana, and it faces an armed insurgency in the north and a separatist movement in the south. As the poorest country in the region, Yemen has an unemployment rate of 40 percent and a population that will double by 2035. Experts predict that it will soon run out of oil (its major revenue-producer) and water. 
 If these problems are not dealt with, there can be no hope of defeating Al Qaeda. 
 Administration officials say that for several months they have been working on an economic development plan for Yemen with Saudi Arabia, Europe, the World Bank and others and expect to hold a meeting in six weeks to agree on a framework. They need to speed up the process. They should encourage mediation, where possible, between the government and its adversaries and urge and help underwrite reform of a prison system that helps breed jihadists. 
 Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen? Americans have a right to feel weary. But the Christmas Day plot is a warning -- we hope in time -- of why it's so important to head off full chaos in Yemen. The last thing the world needs is another haven for Al Qaeda.

HEADLINE: After Angering Parents, Proposed Raffle Ban in Schools Is Rescinded

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
First, it was bake sales. Then, for a few weeks, it looked as if raffles would also be banned.
 At a time when New York City schools are struggling with budget cuts, the Department of Education proposed a regulation this month that would ban parent-teacher associations from holding raffles, a mainstay of fund-raising -- especially after the city effectively banned PTA bake sales in June. 
 Parents were furious. ''Everybody's been going crazy about it,'' said Wendy Vaphides, the co-president of the Parent-Teacher Association at the Michael J. Petrides School on Staten Island, which estimates it lost $1,800 by not being able to hold its annual holiday bake sales this year, and has a raffle scheduled for March. 
 ''It's kind of like an insult to the parents,'' she said. ''Everyone is upset because they are trying to help their child's school in whatever way they can. What else do you want us to do?''
 On Wednesday, however, education officials said that Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein had not known about the proposed raffle ban before it was published, and that he had decided to rescind it.
 The department also said it was considering whether to ease the ban on PTA bake sales during the school day, to make it easier for parent groups to raise money, which they use to plug budget gaps in school programs.
 ''The chancellor determined that while schools needed to scrupulously follow the law, we weren't going to disallow parent associations from holding raffles, especially given the economic climate,'' said David Cantor, Mr. Klein's press secretary. 
 While the rationale for the ban on bake sales was student health, the raffle ban was judged to be a potential legal liability. Raffles can be considered a form of gambling under state laws, and holding one without following a complex array of rules could result in a misdemeanor. 
 Because of legal concerns, the city's Office of Family Engagement and Advocacy, which regulates parent groups, used to say no to PTA's that asked to hold raffles, even though some schools had raffles without asking permission. There was no official ban.
 State gambling rules, according to city lawyers, can be esoteric: Raffle advertisements, for example, must be limited to a description of the event as ''games of chance'' -- and there may be only one sign not exceeding 60 square feet indicating the event. Schools must get licenses for raffles if they raise more than $5,000 -- or $20,000 in a year.
 In preparing a new set of chancellor's regulations for parent associations this year, the Department of Education's lawyers determined that ''there were too many legal risks to having raffles in schools,'' and decided to end them, Mr. Cantor said. The proposed change was published on the Web site on Dec. 11, and was up for a vote by the Panel for Educational Policy on Jan. 26.
 Under the ''revision to the revision,'' which is backed by the chancellor and which the panel will consider on Jan. 26, schools would be able to hold raffles as long as they adhered to state law, Mr. Cantor said. A guide will be prepared outlining the rules.
 The revised rules, also remove proposed bans on PTA participation that parents complained were unfair, including one that would have prevented all Department of Education employees from serving as PTA officers. Now, the restriction will apply only to parents who work at the same school that their children attend.
 Parents who helped raise the alarm about the raffle ban were happy to hear that crisis had been averted. The proposal to ban raffles was reported Monday by The Staten Island Advance.
 Sue Dietrich, a vice president of the Chancellor's Parent Advisory Council, said that at many schools, raffles had become a main source of PTA operating expenses for the year. ''I think they didn't realize the implications,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 2010 Holds Promise for Africa, Australia and Canada

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
This is the final round of discussion with our far-flung panel, which is divided between London, Melbourne, New York, the French Alps and the woods north of Boston. In this digital era, that works for a sports chat. But the athletes, at least for now, still need to be in the same place for a sports event. So let's take a quick look ahead at where they'll gather in 2010. It's an Olympic year with Vancouver looking like a sound choice, as long as the weather is wintry enough in the mountains. It's also a World Cup year with South Africa a symbolic choice, if no guarantee of being an organizational success. What are you and your countries going to be most interested in?
 JEAN-PHILIPPE LECLAIRE, L'EQUIPE MAGAZINE: World Cup soccer, of course. Especially if Les Bleus score goals only with their feet, this time.
 RICHARD HINDS, SYDNEY MORNING HERALD: Tiger Woods' first tournament of 2010 will be huge. If Steve Williams thought he had problems with photographers at the Buick Open... 
 RICHARD WILLIAMS, THE GUARDIAN: Yes, the comeback is always the biggest news. Mike Tyson, Lance Armstrong, Michael Schumacher.
 RICHARD HINDS: How much will the comeback tournament be worth to sponsors/tournament organizers? Next they will be selling redemption.
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED: A victory at that tournament could be the ultimate save for par.
 RICHARD HINDS: Any tournament organizer with a sense of humor will pair Tiger with Jesper Parnevik.
 SHINSUKE KOBAYASHI, KYODO NEWS SERVICE: I am sure the Japanese people will go crazy about the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, with the biggest focus on women's figure skating: the battle between Kim Yu-na of South Korea and Japanese skaters such as Mao Asada and Miki Ando. I traveled all the way to Toronto a couple of weeks ago to cover Kim Yu-na's media day. And among the large number of reporters, who were mostly Korean, I found plenty of Japanese members of the media in this time of recession. It indicates how big the interest is from the Japanese audience.
 JEAN-PHILIPPE LECLAIRE: The problem is that some European countries, including France, seem not to be interested in the Winter Games anymore. Four years ago, the Games were just across the border in Turin. French athletes did quite well, but l'Equipe's sales were not very good, and TV ratings were expected to be higher. It was the same thing for the world ski championships in France in Val d'Isere last February. So Vancouver is going to be a real test for winter sports, and it's hardly in a great time zone for live European coverage. Some of the sports are in real danger. Bobsled, for example, gave us some medals in the past, and this time, we are not even sure to send a team.
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE: Meanwhile, from a domestic standpoint, this is the first time, the United States will enter the Olympics with world champions in bobsled, luge and Nordic combined. In contrast, we are weak in other traditionally strong events, such as women's figure skating. I'm curious to see where that leads the U.S. team. I'd also be interested to see which network wins the rights to televise the 2014 and 2016 Games. Until now, ESPN has cornered every sporting market, except the Olympics. This could be the last frontier for an entity that was never supposed to be able to compete for large events.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Britain and Australia are presumably not quite so curious about the Winter Games, right? Although you Aussies keep producing medals in aerials. Don't need much snow to practice that - contrary to popular belief outside Australia -- and you do have ski resorts. I've even been to Thredbo.
 RICHARD HINDS: The level of interest in the Winter Olympic in Australia has grown over the past three editions or so: partly due to some increased Australian success, partly because greater accessibility in the media to what were once obscure, even quaint sports, has greatly increased. In February, for the first time, there will be several dedicated channels showing every Australian in action. The success of Australian aerialists like Alisa Camplin has been a significant part of the growth in interest here. Given our snowfields are, by international standards, extremely modest, building a ramp seems to make more sense than slushing through the machine-made snow. And the Australian Olympic Committee, which is hungry for medals to justify lavish government spending, targets funding for sports that provide the greatest chance of success.
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE: I should mention that if Canada advances, the Olympic hockey final in Vancouver could be the most important game ever played on Canadian soil/ice in a country that lives and breathes hockey. Only twice has a host nation failed to win a gold medal in a sport at an Olympics: the Summer Games in1976 in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: The Canadians, traditionally a diplomatic lot, seem unusually hard-bent on avoiding another shutout in Vancouver. They have been rationing out access to the venues to teams from other countries. Hope they aren't rationing out the medals.
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: India, and its security problems, will be in the spotlight when the Indian Premier League cricket tournament returns in March and the 19th edition of the Commonwealth Games takes place in New Delhi in October. Nobody gives much of a thought to the Commonwealth Games until they start, but then the public realizes that there is a chance of winning some gold medals -- perhaps even beating the Aussies -- and the country goes mad for a few days. It might happen in the Winter Olympics, too, if the Brits start doing well in something like the skeleton (a good chance there, actually) or the curling.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Richard, you're a Formula One maven. What do you think of Michael Schumacher's chances?
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: Schumacher will win a Grand Prix. He won't win an eighth world championship.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: In tennis terms, I'd say the women's game -- rather down compared to the men in the last couple years -- could be resurgent. Justine Henin is rejoining Kim Clijsters on the comeback trail and both will start their 2010 seasons in Brisbane. Maria Sharapova has switched back to her old service motion so should be better off than in 2009, if her shoulder holds up. You also have Serena Williams eager to redeem herself after the U.S. Open meltdown, Venus Williams eager to remain relevant and young talents like Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azaranka. There are also the Serbs, Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic, who slumped last year but still have game. Lots of old and new faces there, a good combination. As for the men, the big issue for me is whether Rafael Nadal can return to full health and full strength.
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: I can't help feeling that Roger Federer's wins in 2009, marvelous though they were, were slightly diminished in value by the problems Nadal suffered. That should have been one of the greatest rivalries of all time. Now we may remember it principally for Wimbledon '08.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Not a bad match to be remembered by, I'd say. Federer won Wimbledon this year despite playing below his best in the final against Roddick, and also had some rough patches in Paris, so it was hardly easy without Nadal. He had to really scrap, but the fact that Nadal broke down is also a reminder of Federer's durability, the purity of his technique and his intelligent scheduling. Still, I don't see why Nadal can't return to top form. He has a taxing style but has the requisite passion, work ethic and youth. I don't think he's done by a long shot.
 RICHARD HINDS: I would like to get the knee scans before making a call on Nadal. Then have a reputable specialist explain what they mean. An awful lot of wear and tear.
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: The World Cup in South Africa will monopolize the summer, and after England is eliminated, the attention here will switch to Europe's chance of regaining the Ryder Cup in Wales. I wonder if we'll be seeing Tiger at that one. He doesn't enjoy it at the best of times. They don't get paid, you see. And they have to turn up with their wives.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: One wonders how Europe's voluble captain, Colin Montgomerie, will handle the Tiger (and other) questions to come. He doesn't usually miss opportunities.
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: Monty versus the U.S. captain, Corey Pavin, should be worth the price of admission, to the press tent at least.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Any thoughts on the first Youth Olympics in Singapore? Superfluous? Good idea to promote physical fitness among the young?
 RICHARD HINDS: Completely off my radar. How old will the gymnasts be? Three?
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: That presumably will be their official age.
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE: It's too soon to tell on the youth Olympics. It will be a financial flop at first. It's also a redundancy in certain sports. Who will the Chinese enter in the gymnastics competition with all of their six-year olds already booked for London?
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: How about Manny Pacquiao? Presumably we're never going to see Klitschko against Klitschko. Or is boxing just never going to matter much on a global scale again?
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE: Woods vs. Nordegren has it covered.
 RICHARD HINDS: Nordegren makes Ingemar Johansson look like Elmer Fudd. Hard for non-purists to get into ''fight of the century'' lather when it's not heavyweights. But Pacquiao, particularly, remains a great story.
 RICHARD WILLIAMS: And don't forget Lance Armstrong riding at the head of his new Team RadioShack at the Tour de France, with Team Sky funded by Rupert Murdoch's cash and run by the guys who masterminded Britain's track gold medals in Beijing.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Lance won't let us forget -- tweet, tweet. So what about the World Cup?
 JEAN-PHILIPPE LECLAIRE: We all agree at this stage that having it in South Africa is a good idea, but how many of us will still think the same in June sitting in an empty stadium for Mexico-Uruguay, or any other games not involving South Africa, Brazil or England? Security problems will also be a bigger concern than ever before at a World Cup. It doesn't mean it was a bad decision to give it to South Africa, but it does mean we will have to be less grumpy than usual. Anyway, it won't be worse than the Olympics in Atlanta.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: That's hardly crawling out on a limb. Seems to me that giving this to South Africa is worth the hassle. Great message to Africa that the World Cup is not just about letting the world try to qualify but that the world has a chance to stage it, too. Who cares if it's not perfect? Just as long as the fans and teams are safe.
 RICHARD HINDS: The World Cup will be big here. But the result at the end of the year of Australia's bid for the World Cup in either 2018 or 2022 will be even bigger. It could redefine pecking order of local sports if Oz gets the cup.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: I saw that soccer is the most popular participation sport for young boys in Australia now, ahead of swimming and Australian rules football, so it's clearly on the upswing.
 BRIAN CAZENEUVE: Soccer's becoming more popular here, too, but the spectator popularity is skewed toward World Cup time. The Major League Soccer, our domestic league, still has a limited audience.
 RICHARD HINDS: The time zone is the killer here in Australia for the World Cup. It's the only thing that will sap the momentum it creates for the game.
 CHRISTOPHER CLAREY: Takes more than time zone differences to sap the forum, gentlemen. I much appreciate your effort, wit and insights. Until the next time. Thanks, merci, arigato and thanks mate.

HEADLINE: That Was The Year That Was

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Wow, what a long year.
 Just think. At the beginning of 2009, George W. Bush was still in charge of the country, talking about how time had flown since he first ran for president.
 ''Just seemed like yesterday,'' he reminisced.
 This was a sentiment the rest of us did not entirely share. I felt as if Bush had been running things since the Mesozoic Age. 
 But now it also feels as if Barack Obama has been president forever. I'm beginning to wonder if in the 21st century, White House years are going to be like dog years in reverse. Every one is equivalent to seven or eight in the normal human calendar.
 I personally think Obama has been doing a good job, all things considered. The economy is still depressing, but that's an improvement over mind-bendingly terrifying. The rest of the world likes us better, and whenever the president goes overseas he seems to be able to nudge the other countries toward a little progress on some issue on which they had been hopelessly stuck.
 And health care reform. Extremely big deal. Really could pass. Eventually. 
 No matter how difficult the issue, Obama has been sensible, deliberative. Just look at Dick Cheney swooping around like a dementor from Harry Potter, and you have to appreciate how much things have improved.
 But Lord, is it good to bid farewell to 2009.
 And imagine how Obama must feel. Every problem is a long, grueling slog. Even in the last minutes of the year, he was stuck trying to get out of the hole that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had dug when she used the fatal phrase ''the system worked'' after the failed plane bombing in Detroit.
 Napolitano's statements were more nuanced than we're currently giving her credit for, but that doesn't matter. What she said was ill advised on so very many levels, only one of which was the matter of the system not working.
 In a time of crisis, you cannot make any sweeping statements defending the performance of the Department of Homeland Security. In a bureaucracy that big, somebody is screwing up somewhere. 
 Napolitano should have said something like: ''Well, we were so happy that the Swiss guy tackled the underwear bomber. Let's give him a shout-out! Now excuse me, but we have a lot of work to do.''
 Maybe the problem is that the Department of Homeland Security is just too big to function. We know that creating it was a bad move since it was Senator Joseph Lieberman's idea. (This will undoubtedly be a chapter in my upcoming book, ''How Joe Lieberman Ruined Everything.'')
 Remember how hopeful everybody was last winter? Remember when Obama had the bipartisan Super Bowl party? I wonder who he'll invite this time. Captain Sully Sullenberger appears to be the only person left in the country who everybody likes. But the way things are going, we'll probably hear tomorrow that Sully was driven out of his home on New Year's Eve by an angry spouse wielding a hockey stick.
 For Obama, one of the plusses of the first few months of 2009 was that the opposition was so inept. This gave the president momentum while also providing the troubled nation with much-needed entertainment. 
 Remember Obama's first speech to a joint session of Congress? The one that the Republicans followed with a speech by Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who attacked ''wasteful spending'' on monitoring volcano eruptions in Alaska?
 And when Arizona State University refused to give Obama an honorary degree because ''his body of work is yet to come?'' That was in April. And in October, he got the Nobel Peace Prize. Take that, Sun Devils!
 But things really slowed down when we got to health care. Remember the Blue Dog Democrats holding the bill hostage in the House? The bipartisan panel of six senators who spent the summer sending back reports on what a great conference call they had had last Tuesday? 
 Remember Olympia Snowe? Whatever happened to her?
 Remember the Ben Nelson crisis, and the Joe Lieberman crisis, and the plan from the freshman Democrats, and the plan from the moderates, and the revolt of the conservative Democrats and the revolt of the progressive Democrats? Boy, those were fun times. I bet Majority Leader Harry Reid is reliving them right now while he spends New Year's Eve on the floor of his bedroom in a fetal position. 
 The job of governing jumped from difficult to impossible after those right-wing tea parties last summer, which eliminated any Republican notions that if a president won a big election victory and large majorities in the House and Senate then that might be a sign of the American people wanting him to succeed.
 No more. This might allow one to theorize that Glenn Beck wrecked our year if we did not already know it was Joe Lieberman.
