HEADLINE: The Party Of Work

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The American colonies were first settled by Protestant dissenters. These were people who refused to submit to the established religious authorities. They sought personal relationships with God. They moved to the frontier when life got too confining. They created an American creed, built, as the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset put it, around liberty, individualism, equal opportunity, populism and laissez-faire.
This creed shaped America and evolved with the decades. Starting in the mid-20th century, there was a Southern and Western version of it, formed by ranching Republicans like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Their version drew on the traditional tenets: ordinary people are capable of greatness; individuals have the power to shape their destinies; they should be given maximum freedom to do so. 
This is not an Ayn Randian, radically individualistic belief system. Republicans in this mold place tremendous importance on churches, charities and families -- on the sort of pastoral work Mitt Romney does and the sort of community groups Representative Paul Ryan celebrated in a speech at Cleveland State University last month.
But this worldview is innately suspicious of government. Its adherents generally believe in the equation that more government equals less individual and civic vitality. Growing beyond proper limits, government saps initiative, sucks resources, breeds a sense of entitlement and imposes a stifling uniformity on the diverse webs of local activity.
During the 2012 campaign, Republicans kept circling back to the spot where government expansion threatens personal initiative: you didn't build that; makers versus takers; the supposed dependency of the 47 percent. Again and again, Republicans argued that the vital essence of the country is threatened by overweening government.
These economic values played well in places with a lot of Protestant dissenters and their cultural heirs. They struck chords with people whose imaginations are inspired by the frontier experience.
But, each year, there are more Americans whose cultural roots lie elsewhere. Each year, there are more people from different cultures, with different attitudes toward authority, different attitudes about individualism, different ideas about what makes people enterprising.
More important, people in these groups are facing problems not captured by the fundamental Republican equation: more government = less vitality.
The Pew Research Center does excellent research on Asian-American and Hispanic values. Two findings jump out. First, people in these groups have an awesome commitment to work. By most measures, members of these groups value industriousness more than whites.
Second, they are also tremendously appreciative of government. In survey after survey, they embrace the idea that some government programs can incite hard work, not undermine it; enhance opportunity, not crush it.
Moreover, when they look at the things that undermine the work ethic and threaten their chances to succeed, it's often not government. It's a modern economy in which you can work more productively, but your wages still don't rise. It's a bloated financial sector that just sent the world into turmoil. It's a university system that is indispensable but unaffordable. It's chaotic neighborhoods that can't be cured by withdrawing government programs.
For these people, the Republican equation is irrelevant. When they hear Romney talk abstractly about Big Government vs. Small Government, they think: He doesn't get me or people like me.
Let's just look at one segment, Asian-Americans. Many of these people are leading the lives Republicans celebrate. They are, disproportionately, entrepreneurial, industrious and family-oriented. Yet, on Tuesday, Asian-Americans rejected the Republican Party by 3 to 1. They don't relate to the Republican equation that more government = less work.
Over all, Republicans have lost the popular vote in five out of the six post-cold-war elections because large parts of the country have moved on. The basic Republican framing no longer resonates.
Some Republicans argue that they can win over these rising groups with a better immigration policy. That's necessary but insufficient. The real problem is economic values.
If I were given a few minutes with the Republican billionaires, I'd say: spend less money on marketing and more on product development. Spend less on ''super PACs'' and more on research. Find people who can shift the debate away from the abstract frameworks -- like Big Government vs. Small Government. Find people who can go out with notebooks and study specific, grounded everyday problems: what exactly does it take these days to rise? What exactly happens to the ambitious kid in Akron at each stage of life in this new economy? What are the best ways to rouse ambition and open fields of opportunity?
Don't get hung up on whether the federal government is 20 percent or 22 percent of G.D.P. Let Democrats be the party of security, defending the 20th-century welfare state. Be the party that celebrates work and inflames enterprise. Use any tool, public or private, to help people transform their lives.

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Complicates A Tax Shift

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Come January, should Congress fail to act, the United States will face more than immense tax increases and spending cuts. It will also run out of room to finance its large running deficits.
The Treasury Department expects the country to hit its debt ceiling, a legal limit on the amount the government is allowed to borrow, close to the end of the year. That would give Congress only a matter of weeks to raise the ceiling, now about $16.4 trillion, before sending financial markets into a panic.
Congressional leaders have made clear that the debt ceiling will be part of the intense negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff, with many members unwilling to raise the ceiling without a broader deal. That has raised financial analysts' worries of a financial market panic over the ceiling in addition to the slow bleed of the tax increases and spending cuts. 
Congressional action is required to raise the debt limit. The Treasury can jostle payments for a few months. But expenses will eventually overwhelm revenue, putting the administration in the position of choosing which bills to pay. It might stop paying soldiers, for instance, or sending Social Security payments.
In 2011, Congressional Republicans would not raise the debt ceiling without a broader agreement to cut the country's deficit and set it on a better fiscal path. The impasse over finding spending cuts and tax increases to do that led to the creation of the spending cuts on Jan. 1, the same time the Bush-era tax cuts were set to expire.
The threat that the country might not pay all its bills caused a slump in financial markets and led in August 2011 to the first downgrade of the nation's credit rating. It left broader economic scars, too. Many economists contend it hurt economic growth and jobs.
A July report by the Government Accountability Office found that the delay in raising the debt limit increased the country's borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in the 2011 fiscal year. ''However, this does not account for the multiyear effects on increased costs for Treasury securities that will remain outstanding after fiscal year 2011,'' the report noted, adding that the debt-limit fight diverted Treasury's time and resources from other priorities.
This year, Congress will have time to negotiate a broader debt deal before needing to raise the ceiling, even if negotiations spill into January. But the ceiling will be a card in the complex political game that the White House, Senate Democrats and Congressional Republicans are playing.
Much as Democrats see President Obama's veto threat over an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest earners as leverage over Republicans, some Republicans see the need to raise the debt ceiling as leverage over the White House, Republican aides said.
Even if the stakes do not get that high, both parties view lifting the debt ceiling as part of the fiscal-cliff negotiations, and they do not expect Congress to raise it outside of a broader deal.
''Resolving the issues surrounding the fiscal cliff, especially the replacement of the sequester, and the next debt limit increase (likely necessary in February) will require that the president get serious about real entitlement reform,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a letter to conservatives this week, as printed on The Hill Web site.
That has Democrats warning Republicans not to risk the country's credit rating and broader financial stability again.
''They tried it before: 'We're going to shut down the government. We're not going to raise the debt limit,' '' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, told reporters this week. ''They want to go through that again? Fine, but we're not going to be held subject to something that was done as a matter of fact in all previous administrations.''
Economists have warned that the political posturing over the debt ceiling has enormously dangerous economic consequences -- even more so than last year, given the threat of huge tax increases and spending cuts hitting households at the same time.
On Wall Street, analysts have tended to use terms like ''apocalypse'' and ''global catastrophe'' to describe what might happen should Congress not lift the ceiling.
This week, Fitch, the credit rating agency, threatened a downgrade to the nation's credit rating if Congress cannot find a timely resolution.
''Failure to reach even a temporary arrangement to prevent the full range of tax increases and spending cuts implied by the fiscal cliff and a repeat of the August 2011 debt ceiling episode would mean that the general election had not resolved the political gridlock in Washington and likely result in a sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch,'' analysts at the agency said in a statement on Wednesday.
HSBC analysts this week warned clients of ''echoes of 2011'' in the uncertainty and market volatility the ceiling might cause.
And economists at the International Monetary Fund cautioned that the unstable situation in the United States might have international ripple effects.
''For now, a lack of political agreement keeps uncertainty about the fiscal road map unresolved,'' the fund said in a global risk assessment. ''Although bond yields remain low, when contentious political decisions -- such as raising the debt ceiling -- have come due in the past, uncertainty about the outcome led to unfavorable market reactions.''
But other analysts said they would be surprised if the debate over the ceiling became the debacle it did last year. Many Congressional aides said neither side had any interest in causing market panic for political gain.
''Markets are now starting to become the disciplinarians,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ''C.E.O.'s are finally stepping up to the plate and saying, 'Excuse me, we can't do this.' And that puts political donations and jobs on the line.''

HEADLINE: Colorado Democrats Elect State's First Gay Speaker

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
DENVER -- Democratic lawmakers in Colorado sustained a wrenching defeat in the final days of the legislative session last spring. A bill that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples was blocked from getting a full vote in the State House of Representatives by Republican leaders, who knew Democrats had the votes to pass it.
But this week, Democrats here regained control of the House, buttressed by a favorably redrawn legislative map and simmering anger over the civil unions debate. 
And on Thursday, punctuating the moment, Democratic lawmakers elected the state's first openly gay speaker of the House.
The new speaker, State Representative Mark Ferrandino, a Democrat from Denver, was a co-sponsor of the civil unions bill and has vowed to bring it back when the session resumes in January.
''Twenty years ago, Amendment 2 passed in Colorado,'' an emotional Mr. Ferrandino said after his election, referring to a 1992 state constitutional amendment passed by voters that banned laws protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination. ''And now we have our first openly gay speaker. I think that is an amazing turnaround for our state. It speaks volumes for how much we've grown.''
Amendment 2, which led some to call Colorado ''the hate state,'' was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. A separate 2006 amendment to the state Constitution defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman.
Mr. Ferrandino said that the economy and education were legislative priorities, but that in terms of expanding rights for gay men and lesbians, ''civil unions is the thing we really are pushing for.''
California and Rhode Island have openly gay House speakers, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which supports gay candidates. And a lesbian lawmaker will most likely become speaker in Oregon, said Denis Dison, a spokesman for the group.
Over the past two years, Republicans have controlled Colorado's House of Representatives by a single vote, forcing Democrats to seek their support on contentious legislation like on civil unions.
This year, even a special legislative session called by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, in a last-ditch effort to pass civil unions could not resolve the heated impasse over the issue.
But Democrats now have a 37-to-28 majority in Colorado's House and outnumber Republicans, 20 to 15, in the Senate.
Colorado, which is split among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters, also supported President Obama for a second time on Tuesday.
And despite its reputation as a swing state, Colorado has been trending toward the Democrats in recent years, nudged by a growing number of Latinos, who now make up 20 percent of the state's population and who supported Mr. Obama in overwhelming numbers, according to exit polls.
''I give the Obama machine a great deal of credit,'' said State Representative Frank McNulty, a Republican from Highlands Ranch and the departing House speaker. ''They were devastatingly efficient.''
Mr. McNulty, who was instrumental in blocking the civil union vote in May, said Democrats had successfully been identifying like-minded voters for the last six years.
''What they have is a machine,'' he said.
With their newfound power, Democrats also believe they can pass another prized piece of legislation, one that would allow state colleges and universities to offer discounted tuition to illegal immigrants.
Colorado lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates have tried to pass such legislation in recent years without success.

HEADLINE: James R. Dumpson, a Defender of the Poor, Dies at 103

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
James R. Dumpson, who as New York City's commissioner of welfare in the 1960s fiercely defended relief payments as both necessary and moral, died on Monday at a hospice in Manhattan. He was 103 and had served in various posts under five New York City mayors.
The cause was a stroke, his daughter, Jeree Wade, said. 
Mr. Dumpson was described as the first black welfare commissioner in the nation's history and the first social worker to oversee welfare in New York when Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed him in 1959.
Soon afterward, he made known his views about welfare in response to an editorial in The Daily News, which asserted, ''Ladies have babies by assorted gentlemen so as to keep the relief checks growing fatter each year.''
Mr. Dumpson said the only test for public assistance was a citizen's need, not morals. With only a few exceptions -- and he acknowledged there were exceptions -- people on welfare, particularly children, desperately needed the support, he said. He argued that virtually every adult would rather work and that most considered employment an element of personal dignity.
''There's no comfort in living on a subsistence level,'' Mr. Dumpson said. ''There's no comfort in constantly having to establish eligibility. No comfort in the necessary intrusions into your private life to find out if you qualify for assistance.''
He also spoke on the national stage. In 1964, when Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, who would soon be the Republican presidential nominee, suggested that welfare recipients were lazy, Mr. Dumpson said such statements had ''no place in the kind of war on poverty I am advocating.'' He called Mr. Goldwater ''the wealthy cowboy'' without mentioning him by name.
Besides Mr. Wagner, Mr. Dumpson held high posts under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. He was the second black commissioner in New York City government. (The first was Arthur Ford, whom Mr. Wagner appointed commissioner of water supply, gas and electricity in 1954.) And he was the first black dean of a nonblack school of social work, at Fordham University. Mr. Dinkins, who appointed Mr. Dumpson to two cabinet positions, said Mr. Dumpson had influenced the city's antipoverty policies for more than a half century. ''We don't realize what history is being made until later,'' Mr. Dinkins said in an interview on Thursday. ''We look back on it now and say, 'Damn, he was a hell of a cat' -- and indeed he was.''
Worried about welfare costs, Mr. Dumpson strived to combat welfare fraud. In 1975, as administrator of the city's Human Resources Administration in Beame's administration, he set up a computer system to ferret out welfare recipients who were on city and state payrolls or receiving unemployment benefits. He eliminated 2,599 people from the welfare rolls.
But his passion was in helping the poorest of the poor. In an interview with Newsday in 1965, Mr. Dumpson said he was once told by a minister, ''You sound more like a clergyman than I do.''
James Russell Dumpson was born on April 5, 1909, in an area of Philadelphia known as Hell's Half-Acre. His father was a bank messenger, and his mother, who had been a teacher before marriage, pushed her five children to get an education.
To finance his own education, at several colleges, Mr. Dumpson worked summers as a waiter in a hotel in Cape May, N.J. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the New School in Manhattan. Afterward he taught in a segregated school in Oxford, Pa., but left after several years because the school ''provided no intellectual stimulation,'' he told The New York Times in 1965.
After working as a supervisor in Philadelphia's welfare bureau, he moved to New York in 1940 to be a caseworker for the Children's Aid Society. He joined the welfare department in 1956 and two years later was appointed deputy commissioner. He was commissioner from 1959 to 1965.
In 1967 he was named dean of Fordham University's graduate school of social service. There, as an administrator of a Roman Catholic school and as a Catholic himself, he drew notice for speaking out in favor of having government help the poor obtain contraceptives. Fordham later named an endowed chair after him.
Mr. Dumpson helped lead Mayor Lindsay's antipoverty efforts, was chairman of advisory committees on juvenile justice and foster care under Mayor Koch, and was administrator of health services and head of city hospitals in the Dinkins administration.
He was president of the Council on Social Work Education, a national group, and traveled repeatedly to Asia on behalf of the United Nations to help set up social work programs.
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Dumpson, who had homes in Manhattan and Hawaii, is survived by his wife, Goldie; his brother, the Rev. Roland Dumpson; and his sister, Doris D. Grundy.
Known as the Little Dynamo for his energy, the diminutive Mr. Dumpson said he found hope in the darkest of corners. ''You've always got to hold on to the great potential for change that people have,'' he once said. ''And when you see that change -- that's what keeps social workers from being overwhelmed from the misery around us.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows As Exports Climb Sharply

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The United States trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in September as exports rose sharply, suggesting global demand for American goods was holding up despite the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. 
Other data released on Thursday showed a drop in new claims for unemployment benefits last week, although a storm that battered the East Coast distorted the figures.
The trade deficit shrank 5.1 percent to $41.55 billion, the smallest shortfall since December 2010, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected it to widen to $45 billion.
Exports jumped 3.1 percent, the biggest increase in over a year. The gain more than offset a 1.5 percent increase in imports that was centered on purchases of consumer goods.
The report provides the latest positive sign for the American economy, which has appeared to pick up as consumers spend more freely and home construction quickens.
''This was a very encouraging report as the improvement in both export and nonpetroleum import activity suggest improving demand both domestically and globally,'' said Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities.
Chinese demand for American products appeared to help exporters in September. China bought $8.8 billion in American goods and services, up 0.3 percent from a month earlier, although those figures were not seasonally adjusted.
Exports to the European Union, where a debt crisis has pushed several countries into recession, were flat. The government does not seasonally adjust figures for countries and regions as it does for overall imports and exports.
The larger-than-anticipated decline in the trade gap suggests that American economic growth may have been higher in the third quarter than the 2.0 percent annual rate initially reported.
Like the gain in exports, the rise in imports provided a positive signal for domestic demand, even though imports subtract from economic growth. Imports of consumer goods rose by $2.7 billion.
Analysts said a good deal of the increase reflected imports of Apple's iPhone 5. That suggested the increase might be temporary.
A separate report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, although Hurricane Sandy made the data difficult to interpret.
Initial claims for state jobless benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 355,000, the Labor Department said. That was below the median forecast of 370,000 in a Reuters poll of economists.
An analyst from the Labor Department said that the storm, which slammed into the Eastern seaboard on Oct. 29, increased unemployment claims in some states by leaving people out of work, but that it also reduced claims in at least one state because power failures kept it from collecting claim reports.
The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which smooths out volatility, rose 3,250 to 370,500. Economists think readings below 400,000 generally point to rising employment.

HEADLINE: Reform and Open Up

BYLINE: By STEPHEN S. ROACH

 BODY:
Seoul
IN China, there is little debate these days over economic strategy. The Chinese have embraced the imperatives of a major rebalancing of their growth model -- shifting away from the export- and investment-led strategy of the past 33 years and drawing increasing support from their 1.3 billion consumers.
This plan was first identified by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao -- whose successor will be announced at the 18th Communist Party Congress that opened Thursday -- more than five and a half years ago when he famously pondered the pitfalls of a Chinese economy as increasingly ''unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and (ultimately) unsustainable.'' That led to enactment of the pro-consumption 12th Five-Year Plan in March 2011. 
Implementation of the plan has lagged. That task must now fall to China's new senior leaders who are to be anointed at the party congress. China has talked the talk of structural rebalancing for nearly six years. Its new leaders must now walk the walk.
In deciphering the tea leaves from the congress, the key can be found in the script of Deng Xiaoping. At the so-called Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee meeting of the Chinese Communist Party in late 1978, Deng grasped the urgency of China's post-Mao transitional imperatives and forged a dramatic new course with four simple words -- ''reform and opening up.'' In the years to follow, that mantra was translated into action by an unparalleled 30-year development miracle.
A similar challenge awaits the 18th Party Congress and China's so-called Fifth Generation of leaders. The old model of export-led growth has taken China to a daunting transition point, but it is unlikely to carry it into the Promised Land.
The economic crisis and its aftermath draw the major underpinnings of external demand -- both the United States and Europe -- into serious question. Just as Deng found the answer to China's transitional imperatives in a powerful wave of reforms, the same opportunity awaits the next China.
Three major reform initiatives are needed to transform the pro-consumption strategy of the 12th Five-Year Plan into reality. They provide a lens through which the results of the party congress can be judged.
First, China must provide a comprehensive set of regulations aimed at opening up its embryonic services sector. The second largest economy in the world cannot afford to have a services sector that is only 43 percent of its gross domestic product -- well below the percent shares in Asia's other major developing economies such as India, Korea and Taiwan, and far short of the 75 percent shares of advanced economies.
Services-led growth offers China many benefits. It provides the infrastructure for consumer demand -- especially in neglected distribution industries such as wholesale and retail trade, domestic transportation and supply-chain logistics. Services require 35 percent more jobs per unit of Chinese output than manufacturing and construction, allowing China to absorb surplus rural labor while growing more slowly. Services also consume fewer natural resources and energy, offering a more environmentally sustainable development trajectory.
Second, China must address the financial insecurity of its people that has arisen from a porous social-safety net. While considerable progress has been made in setting up national health-care and retirement systems, they suffer from a serious lack of funding, which limits their benefits. As a result, families increase their saving -- a major headwind to consumer-led growth.
As the world's largest surplus saver -- with total saving likely to amount to 50 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 -- China has the wherewithal to provide a significant injection of public funds into its retirement and health care systems. It also needs to reform its residential permit system to align benefit portability with rapid migration from the countryside to cities. And China needs to end ''financial repression'' by deregulating deposit interest rates, providing household savers with more attractive rates of return.
Third, China needs a new round of state-owned enterprise reforms. The first wave of S.O.E. reforms in the late 1990s sparked improved efficiency in the Chinese economy. The downsizing, consolidation and listing of S.O.E. shares in world capital markets are the heart of China's new business ownership model.
But there has been discernible backtracking on this front, especially in the aftermath of the crisis of 2008-09, when state-directed banks funneled a massive fiscal stimulus into investments by state-owned enterprises. This led to a renewed concentration of power in the state-controlled segment of the economy -- at odds with the market-oriented system unleashed in the late 1990s.
Prime Minister Wen has warned of the risks of this reversal, especially those posed by an increasingly concentrated banking system. New enterprise reforms are the only antidote. They must address dividend policy -- which currently skews returns toward capital rather than labor (i.e. consumers). They must push for the public listing of remaining shares in state-owned enterprises. And they need to stress market-based innovation strategies that would level the playing field between state-supported and private sectors.
After two decades of powerful reforms, momentum has slowed in the past 10 years. The legacy of Deng Xiaoping faded in the rush to hyper-growth. Yet without reform and opening up, the Chinese miracle simply wouldn't have occurred. A similar push is vital if China is to move to the next stage in its remarkable development journey. The 18th Party Congress will reveal the full extent of China's commitment to its new strategy.

HEADLINE: Markets Subdued in Advance of News on Euro

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- Financial markets in Europe were subdued Thursday with few expectations of significant action from the European Central Bank later in the day and with concerns growing about a looming crisis over fiscal policies in the United States. 
Despite a new set of gloomy economic forecasts for the European economy Wednesday, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.75 percent when it issues its decision at 1:45 p.m. Frankfurt time.
Likewise, the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England is expected to announce at noon London time that it will keep its benchmark rate at 0.5 percent and that it will not expand its asset-purchasing plan to stimulate the economy.
European shares were slightly higher in early trading. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent to 5,805.51. Germany's DAX added 0.3 percent to 7,254.15. France's CAC-40 rose 0.4 percent to 3,425.59.
There was some good news for the euro zone when lawmakers in Greece agreed on a fresh round of austerity measures aimed at securing the next round of bailout funds from international lenders. The austerity plan was passed by a narrow majority early Thursday, a decision that should help avert a new crisis over Greece.
A pledge by the E.C.B. to intervene in the sovereign debt markets if countries request aid appears for now to have calmed the crisis that has engulfed the euro zone for much of the past three years.
But the debt crisis has left a legacy of stagnant growth in euro zone economies, with low business confidence and rising unemployment. On Wednesday, the European Commission, the executive of the 27-nation bloc, predicted that gross domestic product will have shrunk 0.3 percent for the 27 members of the European Union as a whole this year, and 0.4 percent for the 17 members in the euro zone.
Growth in 2013 will be 0.4 percent across the European Union and 0.1 percent in the euro area, it predicted.
Yet policy makers appear to have concluded that little would be gained by further cuts in rates that might already be too low for countries like Germany.
Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the U.S. elections, attention is shifting to the tax increases and spending cuts that could deliver a big blow to the U.S. economic recovery if they kick in at the start of next year as scheduled. To avoid that ''fiscal cliff,'' President Barack Obama needs a breakthrough in negotiations with Congress.
''This week's E.C.B, meeting is unlikely to produce any substantial decisions and will thus remain in the shadow of the political events on both sides of the Atlantic,'' said Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank in London.
''The E.C.B. is likely to acknowledge the continued economic downturn and the decline in inflation,'' Mr. Schulz added in a note. ''They are likely to leave the door open for more action if necessary, and the wording of the statement may indicate if there are heated discussions about further stimulus in the Governing Council already.''

HEADLINE: When Votes Count More Than Checks

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Among the losers in the United States this week are the super-rich, who spent unprecedented millions to evict President Barack Obama from the White House. The investing class turned sharply and vociferously against the president many of them had supported in 2008. On Tuesday night, the plutocrats lost their shirts.
''Boy, they threw away a lot of money,'' Theda Skocpol, a Harvard professor, told me. ''It was very interesting to hear on Tuesday night about all the corporate jets packed in Logan Airport'' for Mitt Romney's party in Boston. 
One of the important questions in the United States today -- and, eventually, in all democracies where income inequality has risen sharply, which is to say in pretty much all democracies -- is what impact the political ineffectiveness of the super-rich at the ballot box will have on how the country is actually governed.
According to Dr. Skocpol, the answer will be determined partly by how we collectively choose to explain the president's second-term victory.
''There will be an attempt to downplay the role economic populism played,'' Dr. Skocpol said. ''I would expect a lot of the Wall Street Democratic crowd to place the emphasis on social issues and immigration. There will be an effort to define it that way.''
To put it another way, one emerging explanation of Mr. Obama's victory will be that it was about demographics trumping economic policy. Whether that argument becomes the dominant narrative matters, because it will shape what sort of a governing mandate Mr. Obama is deemed to have won.
''He clearly got a mandate for using the government to build an opportunity for the middle class,'' Dr. Skocpol said. ''He has a mandate for higher taxes on the wealthy. He has a mandate for Obamacare going forward. I think voters understand that these differences were clear.''
David Nasaw, a historian who has written biographies of Andrew Carnegie and Joseph P. Kennedy -- two influential plutocrats from earlier eras in U.S. history -- agrees.
''The media, with all due respect, is still frighteningly condescending to black and Latino voters,'' Dr. Nasaw said. ''The black and Latino voters did not vote for Obama simply because he had a black skin. They voted for him because they thought his policies made more sense.''
''This is no longer a nation where white middle class suburbanites control the destiny of the country,'' Dr. Nasaw continued. ''Black voters, Latino voters, young voters aren't going away, and they are going to vote their self-interest. Their self-interest is with a larger government and with a government that recognizes that there has been, over the past couple of decades, a power grab by the wealthy, by corporate interests, by financial interests.''
What makes that mandate particularly powerful is the president's relationship with the 1 percent during the 2012 election campaign. Much of Wall Street fell in love with Mr. Obama in 2008. The support of some of America's most admired and forward-thinking financiers had particular impact during the Democratic primaries, when Mr. Obama, then a relatively obscure Illinois senator, needed all the backing he could get against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
When it comes to policy, Mr. Obama wasn't a particularly bad leader for the most affluent Americans, particularly those in the financial sector -- incomes at the very highest levels have recovered much more swiftly from the financial crisis than those of the middle class, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program was essential for Wall Street.
But Mr. Obama was a severe disappointment when it came to the softer side of serving his wealthy supporters. The handwritten letters, White House photos and private policy discussions that are the accustomed quid pro quo for major donors did not happen. The result was a business community that nursed something much more painful than a mere substantive disagreement with the president -- its leaders felt personally disrespected.
That drove many of the president's political supporters to despair -- would it be so hard, they wondered, for him to write a few thank-you notes? But he didn't, and he won anyway.
''The president really chafed at the idea that he needed to kiss the ring of Wall Street,'' said Jacob Hacker, a Yale political science professor and leading thinker about the role of money in U.S. politics. ''He rightly resisted the calls to do that, and I think the result will embolden the president a bit.''
Dr. Hacker believes that money continues to play a huge role in politics, particularly through lobbying around specific issues, and in races that have less national visibility, like many congressional contests. But over all, he sees in the results this week a vindication of the power of mass democracy.
''It means that your votes matter,'' Dr. Hacker said. ''If you can mobilize your voters, that is a pretty strong antidote to the role of money in politics.''
The good news for Wall Street, for the 1 percent, and for the United States as a whole, is that pretty much everyone expects the president to be magnanimous in victory.
''Obama is not going to turn into some Bolshevik,'' Dr. Skocpol said. ''He is going to try to work with the business community, as he always has. He is not going to be insulting them now; he's going to be inviting them to dinner.''

HEADLINE: Let's Not Make A Deal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
To say the obvious: Democrats won an amazing victory. Not only did they hold the White House despite a still-troubled economy, in a year when their Senate majority was supposed to be doomed, they actually added seats.
Nor was that all: They scored major gains in the states. Most notably, California -- long a poster child for the political dysfunction that comes when nothing can get done without a legislative supermajority -- not only voted for much-needed tax increases, but elected, you guessed it, a Democratic supermajority. 
But one goal eluded the victors. Even though preliminary estimates suggest that Democrats received somewhat more votes than Republicans in Congressional elections, the G.O.P. retains solid control of the House thanks to extreme gerrymandering by courts and Republican-controlled state governments. And Representative John Boehner, the speaker of the House, wasted no time in declaring that his party remains as intransigent as ever, utterly opposed to any rise in tax rates even as it whines about the size of the deficit.
So President Obama has to make a decision, almost immediately, about how to deal with continuing Republican obstruction. How far should he go in accommodating the G.O.P.'s demands?
My answer is, not far at all. Mr. Obama should hang tough, declaring himself willing, if necessary, to hold his ground even at the cost of letting his opponents inflict damage on a still-shaky economy. And this is definitely no time to negotiate a ''grand bargain'' on the budget that snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.
In saying this, I don't mean to minimize the very real economic dangers posed by the so-called fiscal cliff that is looming at the end of this year if the two parties can't reach a deal. Both the Bush-era tax cuts and the Obama administration's payroll tax cut are set to expire, even as automatic spending cuts in defense and elsewhere kick in thanks to the deal struck after the 2011 confrontation over the debt ceiling. And the looming combination of tax increases and spending cuts looks easily large enough to push America back into recession.
Nobody wants to see that happen. Yet it may happen all the same, and Mr. Obama has to be willing to let it happen if necessary.
Why? Because Republicans are trying, for the third time since he took office, to use economic blackmail to achieve a goal they lack the votes to achieve through the normal legislative process. In particular, they want to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, even though the nation can't afford to make those tax cuts permanent and the public believes that taxes on the rich should go up -- and they're threatening to block any deal on anything else unless they get their way. So they are, in effect, threatening to tank the economy unless their demands are met.
Mr. Obama essentially surrendered in the face of similar tactics at the end of 2010, extending low taxes on the rich for two more years. He made significant concessions again in 2011, when Republicans threatened to create financial chaos by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. And the current potential crisis is the legacy of those past concessions.
Well, this has to stop -- unless we want hostage-taking, the threat of making the nation ungovernable, to become a standard part of our political process.
So what should he do? Just say no, and go over the cliff if necessary.
It's worth pointing out that the fiscal cliff isn't really a cliff. It's not like the debt-ceiling confrontation, where terrible things might well have happened right away if the deadline had been missed. This time, nothing very bad will happen to the economy if agreement isn't reached until a few weeks or even a few months into 2013. So there's time to bargain.
More important, however, is the point that a stalemate would hurt Republican backers, corporate donors in particular, every bit as much as it hurt the rest of the country. As the risk of severe economic damage grew, Republicans would face intense pressure to cut a deal after all.
Meanwhile, the president is in a far stronger position than in previous confrontations. I don't place much stock in talk of ''mandates,'' but Mr. Obama did win re-election with a populist campaign, so he can plausibly claim that Republicans are defying the will of the American people. And he just won his big election and is, therefore, far better placed than before to weather any political blowback from economic troubles -- especially when it would be so obvious that these troubles were being deliberately inflicted by the G.O.P. in a last-ditch attempt to defend the privileges of the 1 percent.
Most of all, standing up to hostage-taking is the right thing to do for the health of America's political system.
So stand your ground, Mr. President, and don't give in to threats. No deal is better than a bad deal.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
'Alex Cross' (PG-13, 1:41) Tyler Perry stars in this grim, maladroit attempt to kick start a new franchise pegged to the James Patterson character played in two earlier movies by Morgan Freeman. This flick was directed, badly, by Rob Cohen. (Manohla Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Argo' (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Big Picture' (No rating, 1:54, in French, Serbian, Montenegrin and English) The adage, ''It's never too late to be who you might have been,'' ascribed to George Eliot, is given a cruel twist in this terrific French thriller. A loose adaptation of Douglas Kennedy's 1997 novel, it might be described as ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' for the age of Google. (Stephen Holden) 
&#x2605; 'Brooklyn Castle' (No rating, 1:41) The director Katie Dellamaggiore's irresistible documentary offers an up-close, personal and political look at the wee chess champs at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg, whose winning streak continues on screen. (Dargis)
'Cloud Atlas' (R, 2:52) David Mitchell's wondrous novel -- a six-stranded tour de force spanning centuries of past and future history and nearly every novelistic genre under the sun -- seems an unlikely candidate for a movie, to put it mildly. And this adaptation, from Tom Tykwer and Lana and Andy Wachowski, does not quite dispel the impression that the book is fundamentally unfilmable. The filmmakers have taken Mr. Mitchell's ideas and techniques seriously, and put together a master's thesis on his themes that is by turns diverting, touching and preposterous. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, Doona Bae and other members of the energetic cast take on multiple roles, changing genders and races to suggest both the mutability and the continuity of identity over time. But for all its ingenuity and ambition, the film has a plodding, explanatory quality, and falls short of rising to the mind-blowing grandeur it so clearly intends. (A. O. Scott)
&#x2605; 'The Details' (R, 1:31) In its uneasy mixture of comedy, surrealism and stern moralism, the movie is a diatribe that does not aim to please a mass audience conditioned to root for naughty boys. And that's all to the good. (Holden)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Flat' (No rating, 1:37) Tirelessly prodding the scab of denial and the bruises of Holocaust memories, Arnon Goldfinger's true-life detective story begins as a family quest but evolves into a gripping study of know-don't-tell reticence and the umbilical tie of a lost homeland. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'Flight' (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since ''Cast Away.'' (Dargis)
'Frankenweenie' (PG, 1:27) This cute and creepy animated update of the Frankenstein story, from the imagination of Tim Burton, pays tribute to monster movies of the past while honoring the commercial family-movie imperatives of the present. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters' (No rating, 1:18) Accompanying the photographer Gregory Crewdson as he creates the dioramas of despair that make up the series ''Beneath the Roses,'' the director Ben Shapiro smoothly communicates Mr. Crewdson's unsettling ability to evoke the ineluctable void between observer and observed. (Catsoulis)
'Here Comes the Boom' (PG, 1:45) This is a pleasant enough comedy if you can buy the premise that Kevin James would make a credible mixed martial arts fighter. Here he's a teacher determined to raise money to save the music program, and he takes up the sport for the purses it offers. Mr. James and Henry Winkler, playing a fellow teacher, pair surprisingly well in the predictable tale. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Holy Motors' (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)
'Hotel Transylvania' (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially ''The Little Mermaid'' with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she's 118) daughter in a hotel that's exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:49) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'Just 45 Minutes From Broadway' (R, 1:48) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can't turn off their performing in life, for better or worse -- though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film's crop of clichs is dispiriting, in result if not intent. (David DeWitt)
&#x2605; 'A Late Quartet' (R, 1:45) The upheavals that threaten the future of the fictional Fugue String Quartet in Yaron Zilberman's magnificently acted film may be wildly exaggerated. But it would be shortsighted to dismiss this deeply felt, musically savvy film set in a refined cultural precinct of Manhattan as sudsy melodrama. (Holden)
'The Loneliest Planet' (No rating, 1:53, in English and Georgian) In Julia Loktev's new feature, an American couple (Gael Garca Bernal and Hani Furstenberg) trek through the Caucasus Mountains in the company of a Georgian guide (Bidzina Gujabidze). Almost nothing happens -- almost being the key word, since a small incident midway through the movie sends out ripples of implication. Ms. Loktev's discipline is as impressive as her eye for landscape, but the film's rigorous withholding of narrative information and its resistance to anything that might smack of ''drama'' feels arch and coy rather than resonant. (Scott)
'Looper' (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson's obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis)
'Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana' (No rating, 2:14, in Hindi) Instead of sending its hero abroad, as so many Indian films do, this appealing Hindi comedy starring Kunal Kapoor brings him back to Punjab from London. The first-time director Sameer Sharma doesn't skimp on flatulence jokes and the like, but ''Luv Shuv'' is mostly about going home and growing up. (Rachel Saltz)
'The Man With the Iron Fists' (R, 1:36) The hip-hop impresario turned would-be auteur RZA directs and stars in this sincere, erratically enjoyable and consistently ridiculous gloss on those martial arts movies known for their flying swordsmen (and women). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Middle of Nowhere' (R, 1:39) Ava DuVernay wrote and directed this plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a young woman (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who, with her husband (Omari Hardwick) serving time, has lost touch with her own self and needs. Her journey is hard, as well as politically freighted, but also more complex than it might initially seem. (Dargis)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'Pitch Perfect' (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it's aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements -- daddy issues, boyfriend issues -- that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'The Rolling Stones: Charlie Is My Darling' (No rating, 1:07) Amazing to see them so young. (Scott)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Sessions' (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate infuse the movie, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)
'Seven Psychopaths' (R, 1:49) A sporadically funny, blood-splattered comedy from the playwright turned movie director Martin McDonagh about a Los Angeles screenwriter (Colin Farrell), his writer's block and his circle of dangerous acquaintances (Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson). (Dargis)
'Sinister'' (R, 1:50) Ethan Hawke tries to class up this movie, directed by Scott Derrickson, about a true-crime writer who moves his family into the house once occupied by the same slaughtered family he's writing about. Bad things happen. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Smashed' (R, 1:25) The degree to which this story of alcoholism and recovery refuses to indulge a voyeuristic taste for the kind of sordid details exploited by reality television amounts to an unspoken declaration of principle. In lieu of self-pity, ''Smashed'' (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul) substitutes tough love. (Holden)
'Taken 2' (PG-13, 1:31) If your teenage daughter were abducted by sex traffickers during a European vacation, you might think twice about making another trip overseas, but not the former C.I.A. operator played by Liam Neeson in ''Taken 2.'' He takes the daughter and his ex-wife to Istanbul for some bonding, and kidnapping once again ensues. So do gunfire and bloodshed in this action-packed but uninvolving sequel to the 2009 hit ''Taken.'' (Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'This Must Be the Place' (R, 1:51) Sean Penn plays a retired rock star who leaves his home in Dublin for an eccentric road trip across America in this peculiar, visually luxuriant and weirdly touching film from the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Wreck-It Ralph' (PG, 1:41) The fusion of video games and 3-D kid-friendly animation sounds like a nightmare, but this Disney feature, about the identity crisis of an arcade-game bad guy, is winning and witty, thanks to its playful appropriation of video-game aesthetics, its energetic voice cast (including John C. Reilly, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman) and a lively, funny script. (Scott)
Film Series
Here and Elsewhere: The Films of Jean Rouch (Friday through Thursday) The great French anthropological filmmaker Jean Rouch is honored with programs both at the French Institute Alliance Franaise on the Upper East Side and Anthology Film Archives in the East Village.

Making Movies in New York: 1912 (Saturday and Sunday) A century ago, New York was the center of filmmaking in America; this weekend series of four programs assembled by the film historian Richard Koszarski suggests the range of styles and genres offered to audiences of the time. ''A Night at the Nickelodeon'' (Saturday at 4 p.m.) recreates a typical program of one-reel films; at 6:30 p.m., ''Classical Cinema'' offers some of the more ambitious literary adaptations meant to attract a middle-class audience, including Lois Weber's 12-minute adaptation of ''Madame Butterfly,'' ''A Japanese Idyll.'' On Sunday, two programs honor filmmakers working in Fort Lee, N.J.: D. W. Griffith at 3 p.m., and Alice Guy Blach at 6 p.m. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12. (Kehr)
'Nothing but a Man' (Friday through Thursday) Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln star in Michael Roemer's groundbreaking 1964 independent feature, about a railroad worker whose ambitions are frustrated by prejudice and his own self-doubt. This film, also starring Yaphet Kotto, Gloria Foster and Julius Harris, is being presented in a new 35-millimeter print from the Library of Congress. (Mr. Roemer will take part in a discussion after Friday's 7:30 p.m. screening.) Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.com; $12.50. (Kehr)
William Lustig Presents: A Tribute to the Warner Archive Collection (Friday through Thursday) An exploitation auteur (''Maniac Cop'') and DVD distributor (Blue Underground) of considerable note, Mr. Lustig has been presenting an annual series of handpicked grind house favorites at Anthology for several years now. This year's program, which runs through Nov. 27, focuses on rare titles newly made available on video through the Warner Archive Collection, presented here, when possible, in 35-millimeter prints from American and European archives. The series begins on Friday at 7 p.m. with Mike Hodges's superb 1971 British gangster film, ''Get Carter'' (repeated on Tuesday at 7 p.m.). Other highlights from the first week include ''Hit Man'' (Friday at 9:30 p.m.), George Armitage's 1972 blaxploitation remake of ''Get Carter'' with Bernie Casey and Pam Grier, and Gordon Flemyng's 1968 heist picture, ''The Split'' (Saturday at 7 p.m.). (And while it's not part of the series, Allan Arkush's 1983 ''Get Crazy,'' a fictionalized evocation of his experience working at the Fillmore East in the 1970s, will be shown on Sunday. That screening, at 2 p.m., is a $55 benefit for the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.) Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $10. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Small Shops Shiver in Gloom of a Shuttered Red Hook Market

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The wind was gusting and icy raindrops had just begun to fall from a bruised sky when Scott Pfaffman, an artist, stuck his head inside the window of Stop 1 deli, ''Do you have a dime bag?'' he joked, before buying a Gatorade.
Stop 1 sits on lower Van Brunt Street in the seaside neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn. The metal gates guarding its front door are electrically powered and the power was still out on Wednesday, so sales were happening through the window, which the proprietor had to hoist himself through to get in and out, like a looter. ''Just ask, we have it,'' read the handwritten sign above the window, ''*Except for hot food, sandwiches, coffee, tea and other hot beverages.''
Few people were on the street, and not just because a northeaster was blowing through. The gaggles of volunteers and disaster tourists that had materialized right after Hurricane Sandy walloped the neighborhood were gone. 
Exhausted home- and business owners who had weathered the storm, fueled by adrenaline, booze and grit, were still coming to terms with the damage: inventory and equipment drowned by the hurricane's salty surge, no insurance to cover the loss. More ominous to some was the absence of the neighborhood's 800-pound gorilla: Fairway Market, the 52,000-square-foot waterfront grocery store at the base of Van Brunt, took on five feet of water and will not reopen for months.
''It is the lifeblood of this neighborhood,'' said Triciann Botta, who, along with her husband, opened the Italian wine shop, Botta di Vino, on Van Brunt two and a half years ago. ''I'm a wine seller. Food goes with wine. When we lost Fairway, we lost a big part of our customer base.''
Fairway's closing reaches beyond the temporary loss of the community grocery store -- as inconvenient as it is, local residents are venturing elsewhere, often by car pool. Fairway was a destination. After it opened, over some protests, in a striking, sprawling, brick-and-wrought-iron Civil War-era building six and a half years ago, it drew people ''like filings to a magnet,'' said Mr. Pfaffman, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1987.
New Yorkers figured out how to thread their way under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and though Red Hook's mazelike streets, finding themselves enchanted by its cobblestones, low-slung, rickety row houses and unassuming, small-town air. More shops sprang up to greet them, most along Van Brunt. Fort Defiance, a cafe and bar, opened a few blocks from Fairway. So did Botta di Vino and Dry Dock, another wine shop, and the gift shop Foxy & Winston, whose owner, Jane Buck, sells blown glass salt and pepper shakers, pink squirrel figurines, and stationery, onesies and tea towels printed with hedgehogs, piglets and owls.
Now Fairway is closed indefinitely and several area restaurants and bars are, too.
''I'm not sure how many months a little business like this can sustain itself without foot traffic,'' said Ms. Buck, whose shop weathered the storm unscathed. ''I specialize in things that no one needs.''
Four blocks south, workers in white disposable coveralls continued with Fairway's cleanup, picking clumps of insulation out of ruined ovens, positioning industrial space heaters to speed drying and sweeping floors. When Howard Glickberg, whose grandfather founded Fairway, first ventured into the store after the storm, he wept. Display cases had tipped and shattered. The majestic $50,000 coffee roaster was rusting. Wooden cash registers were scattered everywhere, as if lobbed by a careless hand. Cheeses, breads, vegetables and canned goods blanketed the puddled floor. Workers threw out everything, filling 70 Dumpsters.
Fairway's Red Hook location has about 350 employees, most of them local, and those not involved in the cleanup are shuttled daily to other Fairway locations to work. Mr. Glickberg knows that other businesses, not to mention local residents, are anxiously awaiting the store's reopening. But he said there was a monthlong wait for much of the replacement equipment, and he is also waiting for structural engineers to try to make the store watertight. He said he hoped to reopen in two months. ''We always knew it was possible,'' said Mr. Glickberg, of the storm surge, ''But this building has been here since the Civil War. There's never been anything like this.''
Not everyone bemoaned Fairway's temporary shuttering, among them Barry O'Meara, a gruff Irishman whose bar, Bait and Tackle, has served as a quasi community center since the storm.
''Nobody's coming to my bar for a drink after coming in from out of town to Fairway because they have ice cream and kids in the car,'' Mr. O'Meara said.
Still, Mr. O'Meara and others acknowledged that Fairway's absence could only compound Hurricane Sandy's ill effects, and harm the delicate and interdependent economic ecosystem of Red Hook. The neighborhood's development, and gentrification, bounded forward after Fairway arrived. Rents went up. More dollars poured in. The treats shop Baked, which opened eight years ago, saw a sudden boom in Thanksgiving sales, with thousands of apple, pumpkin and pecan pies being snapped up by Fairway customers each year.
Small-business owners, many of them local, have always frequented one another's restaurants, shops and bars, even before the extra money started circulating. But after the hurricane, they need to devote money to rebuilding. Winter is also looming, always a slow season. Some feared that ''out of towners,'' as Red Hookians often refer to people who live anywhere else, would associate the neighborhood with flooding and simply not come.
''A lot of business owners are in the same boat we're in,'' said St. John Frizell, the owner of Fort Defiance, ''All these factors at once are really going to be hard.''
Still, the shops are inching forward with repairs -- most of them done by the owners and their friends. Mr. Frizell hopes to reopen Fort Defiance in two weeks. So do owners of the restaurants the Good Fork, which took on two feet of water in their dining room, and Home/Made, whose owners spent the storm and its aftermath sharing their home, quite amicably, with four rescued backyard chickens, despite their seven cats.
Ever true to its pluck and community spirit, local residents have banded together to start Restore Red Hook, with the aim of raising $2 million to help the businesses bounce back.
''It's not about each of us struggling,'' said Monica Byrne, one of Home/Made's owners. ''We need to save us all, collectively.''

HEADLINE: Less Than Visible, But Not to Each Other

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
The bright sun that blasts through ''Starlet,'' a thrillingly, unexpectedly good American movie about love and a moral awakening, bathes everything in a radiant light, even the small houses with thirsty lawns and dusty cars. This isn't nowhere, but it's right next door -- in that part of Southern California known as the San Fernando Valley, more commonly called the Valley. A seemingly endless stretch of subdivisions and McMansions, the Valley lies far below the rarefied heights of Mulholland Drive, that glamorous crest that helps divide the Los Angeles area into distinct swaths, economic realities, lifestyle choices and states of mind. 
It's there that a 21-year-old actress who sometimes goes by Jane and sometimes Tess (Dree Hemingway) lives with her Chihuahua and two conspicuously less intelligent human roommates in an apartment building so anonymous it might as well be a motel. She leads a luxuriously drifty existence, or so it seems, with an open suitcase on her bedroom floor, its contents chaotically half-disgorged, and no apparent job or prospects. If she's worried, she doesn't look it. As she drives around, she seems oblivious to the effect she can have on others, insulated by those natural armaments called beauty and youth. When she smiles, she distills a quality that Henry James evoked in describing Daisy Miller and her ''inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.''
This isn't to suggest that Jane is another Daisy, though they are connected across time by their sex, as well as by their status as outsiders, their innocence and the rigidity of the worlds each navigates. At the risk of forcing the parallel to the breaking point, it's safe to say that Jane, as an emancipated 21st-century woman, has an easier time of it than Daisy did. That said, as a 21st-century character in an American movie, there was a good chance that Jane would still be shackled by the separate-but-equal narrative imperative that turns every woman into a problem only a man can solve. She has issues, but men, happily and perhaps debatably given what her profession turns out to be, don't number among them.
The director, Sean Baker, who also edited the movie, takes his time introducing Jane and the more intimate details of her life, knowing that some of the usual questions would be held in check by the effortlessness with which Ms. Hemingway holds the screen. With her unguarded smile and long, long legs tucked into distractingly short shorts, Jane brings to mind a newborn giraffe or colt, though when she sucks on a straw, there's also a hint of the teenage Melanie Griffith's callow temptress in ''Night Moves,'' Arthur Penn's undersung 1975 masterpiece. ''Starlet'' is informed by the New American Cinema but not slavishly imitative of it, particularly in respect to its seemingly rootless, aimless lead character and the ordinary beauty of her unglamorous world.
The story, from a script by Mr. Baker and Chris Bergoch, pivots on a pile of cash that Jane finds in an old thermos she buys at a yard sale. After a brief shopping spree -- she splurges on a pricey manicure for herself and a sparkly halter for her dog -- she returns to the house where she bought the thermos, driven by an unarticulated sense of unease or maybe guilt. There she discovers Sadie (Besedka Johnson), an octogenarian who, partly locked away by old age and what comes increasingly to feel like unspoken sorrow, seems every bit as isolated as Jane. Whether out of curiosity or an overburdened conscience, Jane begins wedging herself into Sadie's life, trailing her like a sleuth or stalker.
There's an absurdity to this burgeoning relationship, as when Jane follows a startled Sadie to her regular church bingo game, that Mr. Baker by turns exploits and smartly reins in. Working with the cinematographer Radium Cheung, Mr. Baker initially focuses on what separates his characters only to then bring them into harmonious play in the wide-screen frame, which seems to expand as their relationship does. The acuity of his visual style is complemented by his sensitive work with his actresses, whose unforced performances deepen the movie's emotional realism. A model, Ms. Hemingway (her mother is Mariel Hemingway) has appeared in only a few films and is a spectacular find, as is Ms. Johnson, a longtime Angeleno making a true, piercing screen debut.
They are two of a kind, these strangers turned wary acquaintances. Mr. Baker doesn't give much away about either woman, in terms of their histories, but as they inch closer to each other, the continuities between them gain resonance, power. Jane makes a living in front of a camera, though it's a while before you learn how, and it's easy to imagine that Sadie, with her heavy eyeliner and topknot, once wanted her shot at stardom. The patina of tawdry glamour that clings to this movie is, however, something of a diversion and also the point. When Jane first meets Sadie, the old woman is outside her house, obscured by overgrown foliage and the world's indifference. She's as forgotten as the junk she's trying to sell and blissfully, stirringly, unaware that she is about to be discovered.

Previews and Openings
'The Anarchist' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 2) If she had never sung a note in her life, Patti LuPone would have a rock-solid stage rsum, thanks in no small part to her collaborations with David Mamet. Fifteen years after starring in Mr. Mamet's ''Old Neighborhood,'' she returns in this drama as a woman who has been imprisoned for 35 years. Playing her parole adviser is Debra Winger, making her belated Broadway debut. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Eric Grode) 
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' (in previews; opens on Nov. 19) The young composing team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took their first significant New York bow early this summer with ''Dogfight'' at Second Stage. They graduate to Broadway with this holiday show, which has a book by Joseph Robinette based on the writings of the radio humorist Jean Shepherd and the 1983 film. Set in 1940s Indiana, this musical tells the story of bespectacled Ralphie, whose one wish for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB gun. John Rando directs the production, which has proved popular in national tour dates; its Broadway cast includes Dan Lauria, John Bolton and Erin Dilly. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, achristmasstorythemusical.com, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney)
'A Civil War Christmas' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Dec. 4) You won't see boys on crutches or hear ''bah, humbug'' in this Christmas-themed 19th-century play with music. Paula Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, has set her sprawling new piece on Christmas Eve 1864 and filled it with soldiers, slaves, Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Ms. Vogel and her director, Tina Landau, have also found room for period songs and traditional Christmas carols. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Cotton Club Parade' (performances start on Wednesday) When this revue-style salute to Duke Ellington's run at the Cotton Club had its premiere last November, Stephen Holden of The New York Times called it a ''thrilling 90-minute celebration'' and singled out the efforts of the singer Adriane Lenox and the tap dancer Jared Grimes. They're both back for another brief run, and joining them and the Jazz at Lincoln Center All Stars band is the ''Glee'' star Amber Riley. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'Dead Accounts' (in previews; opens on Nov. 29) This new comedy from Theresa Rebeck tests the strength of family ties when a man returns to his small-town home with a suspicious amount of cash and few answers to the questions raised. The play's deluxe team includes two Tony magnets in the director Jack O'Brien and his leading man, Norbert Leo Butz, with a tasty supporting cast of Judy Greer, Josh Hamilton and Jayne Houdyshell. But the big news here is Katie Holmes: she returns to Broadway in her first starring role there, not to mention her first significant professional adventure since the tabloid storm of her divorce from Tom Cruise. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Donka: A Letter to Chekhov' (performances start on Wednesday) It has become a truism that Chekhov productions emphasize the second half of the comedy-tragedy balance to which the playwright often aspired. Perhaps a bit of juggling and clowning will help rectify this imbalance. Daniele Finzi Pasca, whose credits include creating and directing extravaganzas for Cirque du Soleil and the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics, turns his hand to Chekhov's diaries and personal letters. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Elf' (previews start on Friday; opens on Nov. 18) This 2010 musical adaptation of the Will Ferrell holiday movie received some critical coal in its stocking at the time of its premiere, when Charles Isherwood, in his review for The New York Times, called it ''tinseled in synthetic sentiment'' and ''instantly forgettable.'' Undeterred, it returns for another limited holiday run, complete with a new Santa Claus: Wayne Knight, better known as Newman on ''Seinfeld.'' What, they couldn't write a Festivus musical already? Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Grode)
'Emotional Creature' (in previews; opens on Monday) Having delved into the psychological, physiological, political and personal issues affecting women in works like ''The Vagina Monologues'' and ''The Good Body,'' Eve Ensler turns her probing gaze to female childhood and adolescence in this new theater piece, based on her 2010 book. Directed by Jo Bonney, this empowering collection of monologues, stories and songs features six young actors who consider what it means to be a girl in the world today. Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Forever Dusty' (previews start on Sunday; opens on Nov. 18) The jukebox-musical has now made it to Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien -- or, as you may know her, the English pop-soul singer Dusty Springfield. Expect to hear the likes of ''Son of a Preacher Man'' and ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,'' sung by Kirsten Holly Smith, who also wrote this piece with Jonathan Vankin. Randal Myler, who knows his way around jukebox musicals (''Love, Janis,'' ''Hank Williams Lost Highway''), directs. New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, stayforeverdusty.net. (Grode)
'Giant' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The adventurous composer Michael John LaChiusa has drawn inspiration from Greek mythology, classic drama, short stories, poetry and modern American political life. He turns to Edna Ferber's 1952 novel as source material for this new musical, with a book by Sybille Pearson. Spanning two generations, this epic tale of the loves and rivalries of two families on the cattle ranches and oil fields of Texas is directed by Michael Greif, with a cast that includes Kate Baldwin, Brian d'Arcy James, John Dossett, Michele Pawk and Bobby Steggert. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Golden Child' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The Signature Theater kicks off its season of David Henry Hwang plays with the best known of the three works. This look at a polygamous Chinese household was a hit at the Public Theater in 1997 and had a short run on Broadway, earning the play and its lead actress, Julyana Soelistyo, Tony nominations. Ms. Soelistyo returns for this revival and will be joined by someone who made a more recent splash in Mr. Hwang's work, Jennifer Lim (''Chinglish''). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Golden Boy' (in previews; opens on Dec. 6) The last time the director Bartlett Sher dipped into the Clifford Odets canon for Lincoln Center Theater, the result was the soul-stirring 2006 revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' With this 75th-anniversary production of the Odets classic about a talented violinist forced to choose between music and a more lucrative career in prizefighting, Mr. Sher returns to the same stage as that earlier Tony-winning success, and also to the same theater where this play had its 1937 premiere. Alongside Seth Numrich (''War Horse'') in the title role, the large ensemble cast includes Danny Burstein, Ned Eisenberg, Jonathan Hadary, Tony Shalhoub and Yvonne Strahovski. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Golden Age' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 4) Terrence McNally has had success both writing about opera (''The Lisbon Traviata,'' ''Master Class'') and writing opera himself (''Dead Man Walking''). He revisits this theme with his latest play, which is set on the opening night of Vincenzo Bellini's new opera ''I Puritani'' in 1835. Lee Pace stars as Bellini, and is joined by an array of stage regulars: Bebe Neuwirth, Lorenzo Pisoni, Will Rogers and Richard Easton. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Grode)
'The Good Mother' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The New Group opens its season with the premiere of this psychological thriller by Francine Volpe about a struggling single parent forced, through a bizarre incident involving her 4-year-old daughter, to confront the questionable actions of her past. Gretchen Mol plays the title character in Scott Elliott's production, with a cast that also features Mark Blum and Darren Goldstein. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Ivanov' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Chekhov's 1887 drama features a melancholy title character who is often called ''the Russian Hamlet,'' and every recent Ivanov of note -- Kevin Kline, Ralph Fiennes, Kenneth Branagh -- had previously taken a crack at the original Hamlet. Ethan Hawke, who starred in a 2000 film of ''Hamlet,'' follows suit here in Classic Stage Company's latest Chekhov production, once again directed by Austin Pendleton. Mr. Hawke is joined by Joely Richardson and Juliet Rylance. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Grode)
'Mies Julie' (in previews; opens on Monday) St. Ann's Warehouse opens its new season as well as its new location with this Edinburgh Festival Fringe award winner from the University of Cape Town's Baxter Theater Center. Adapted and directed by Yael Farber, the production updates August Strindberg's classic power struggle of class and sex, ''Miss Julie,'' to post-apartheid South Africa, unfolding over a single night in the kitchen of a remote estate, 18 years after the election of Nelson Mandela. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Murder Ballad' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Continuing a vital trend among New York's top-tier nonprofit companies, Manhattan Theater Club inaugurates The Studio at Stage II, a banner devoted to new works from emerging artists. First up in the series is this rock musical by Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash about love, compromise and betrayal as illustrated in a romantic triangle gone wrong.

'My Name Is Asher Lev' (in previews; opens on Nov. 28) Originally seen in May at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, this adaptation by Aaron Posner of the best-selling Chaim Potok novel was described by Anita Gates, writing in The New York Times, as ''an economical, almost painfully potent 90-minute one-act play.'' In this transfer of Gordon Edelstein's production, Ari Brand reprises the title role of a gifted young painter in postwar Brooklyn who defies the wishes of his Hasidic Jewish parents to pursue his dream of becoming an artist.

'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The winner of five Tony Awards including best musical, original score and book for its 1985 Broadway premiere, this show by Rupert Holmes presents the unfinished Charles Dickens novel as a Victorian music-hall lark in which the audience gets the final verdict on who killed the title character. Scott Ellis directs this Roundabout Theater Company revival (part of the 200th anniversary Dickens celebration), with a cast headed by Stephanie J. Block, Will Chase, Gregg Edelman, Jim Norton and the indefatigable Chita Rivera. Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Performers' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) The enthusiastic response for David West Read's 2011 Off Broadway drama, ''The Dream of the Burning Boy,'' directed by Evan Cabnet, promised big things from its creators. Now Mr. Read and Mr. Cabnet make their Broadway debuts in this romantic comedy set in the adult film world. As you'd expect, given the setting, the cast includes plenty of eye candy past (Henry Winkler), present (Cheyenne Jackson, Daniel Breaker) and sort of in between but much closer to present (Alicia Silverstone). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Piano Lesson' (in previews; opens on Nov. 18) Ruben Santiago-Hudson has a strong association with the plays of August Wilson. In addition to appearing in ''Gem of the Ocean'' on Broadway, he won a Tony in 1996 for his role in ''Seven Guitars,'' which he later directed as part of Signature Theater's 2006-7 season dedicated to Wilson's work. Mr. Santiago-Hudson returns to Signature to take on one of the most celebrated entries in that playwright's Century Cycle. Set in 1936 in the wake of the Great Depression, this Pulitzer-winning 1990 drama focuses on siblings at odds over what to do with their family legacy, an antique piano. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Radiance' (in previews; opens on Nov. 16) Set in 1955 and inspired by true events, Cusi Cram's new play follows a celebrated war hero looking to forget as he walks into a seedy bar off Hollywood Boulevard, where he meets a mysterious woman whose face transports him to the past. Suzanne Agins directs this Labyrinth Theater Company production, which features Kelly AuCoin and Ana Reeder alongside the resident players Kohl Sudduth and Aaron Roman Weiner. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Aimee Semple McPherson, the pioneering evangelist from the early 20th century, used to pack a 5,300-seat church three times a day, seven days a week. Suddenly that eight-show-a-week schedule doesn't seem so arduous. Sinclair Lewis, Nathanael West and Evelyn Waugh have all paid literary tribute to her, and now it's Kathie Lee Gifford's turn. She wrote the book and lyrics to this new musical, featuring Carolee Carmello in the title role. The score is by David Pomeranz and David Friedman. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, scandalousonbroadway.com. (Grode)
'The Twenty-Seventh Man' (in previews; opens on Nov. 18) Barry Edelstein directs this world premiere adaptation by Nathan Englander of his short story of the same title, set in a Soviet prison in 1952, where Stalin's secret police have rounded up 26 giants of Yiddish literature. The addition of an unknown and unpublished author to the assembled group leads them to reflect on what it means to write in troubled times. The cast includes Happy Anderson, Byron Jennings, Daniel Oreskes, Ron Rifkin, Noah Robbins and Chip Zien. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' (in previews; opens on Monday) At least three of those names might look familiar to theater buffs. Yes, Christopher Durang has turned his gimlet-eyed focus to Chekhov, plunking the characters and themes in modern-day rural Pennsylvania. Longtime Durangians (Durangos?) like Sigourney Weaver, David Hyde Pierce and Kristine Nielsen are among the cast members; anyone who saw what the director, Nicholas Martin, and Ms. Nielsen worked up for Mr. Durang's ''Betty's Summer Vacation'' will already be practicing their Russian.

'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as South West Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The long title requires little explanation, but Jackie Sibblies Drury's meta-theater piece, described as ''harrowing and humorous,'' follows a troupe of American actors as they struggle to dramatize the first genocide of the 20th century, their explorations ultimately revealing truths that hit closer to home. Eric Ting directs an ensemble cast that includes Quincy Tyler Bernstine (''Ruined''). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Rooney)

'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichs. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichs very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Cyrano de Bergerac' Douglas Hodge (last seen in a dress in ''La Cage aux Folles'') provides an oxygenating blast of freshness in the title role of Edmond Rostand's beloved chestnut, creating a vigorous and original portrait of the swashbuckling, big-beaked poet. True, whenever he's not onstage that old ennui creeps into Jamie Lloyd's production. Fortunately, that's not all that often (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'An Enemy of the People' Boyd Gaines gives a forceful performance as Dr. Stockmann, the champion of truth who takes a principled stand against forces led by his brother, Peter (a sinister Richard Thomas), in Ibsen's meaty but talky drama about corruption in a Norwegian spa town. Doug Hughes's production features fine performances but cannot always overcome the play's sometimes heavy-handed dramaturgy (2:00). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, mtc-nyc.org, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Pern is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moiss Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45).

'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10).

&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder.

Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'A Celebration of Harold Pinter' Julian Sands bravely takes on the voice of Pinter the poet in a modest, affecting production that looks for the private person within the artist. By the evening's end, the show, directed by John Malkovich, has also become a celebration of the actor's craft (1:45).

'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20).

'Dispatches From (A)mended America' Brandt Adams and Godfrey L. Simmons Jr. interviewed 100 Southerners about race following the 2008 election of President Obama. Their efforts yielded a smattering of interesting ideas, but the authors have crowded out these thoughts with their own musings. And so a noble, potentially enlightening exercise becomes a self-indulgent duet with 100 backup singers.

&#x2605; 'The Exonerated' Ten years after its New York premiere, this documentary play about six death-row inmates who were later freed still has the power to shock (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Ken Jawoworski)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15).

&#x2605; 'Figaro' The playwright Charles Morey rescues Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's late-18th century comedy ''The Marriage of Figaro'' from the shadow of its more celebrated operatic incarnation with this witty new adaptation for the Pearl Theater Company, inaugurating the classical troupe's new home on West 42nd Street. Directed with a light touch and an infectious wink by Hal Brooks, the farce takes aim at ruling-class entitlement just as surely today as it did in pre-Revolution France. The energetic ensemble is led by Sean McNall and Jolly Abraham as the crafty servant Figaro and his bride-to-be, and Chris Mixon as the lascivious Count determined to get a piece of pre-wedding action (2:10).

'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15).

&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Home/Sick' The Assembly, a cutting-edge young theater collective, has painstakingly researched the Weather Underground, a violent and polyamorous Vietnam-era guerrilla group. Jess Chayes's intense and thoughtful direction guides us through two decades of the group's history, focusing on its infamous bombings of government buildings and banks (and once, by accident, itself). There's also a lot of sloganeering, pot-smoking, orgying and, inevitably, self-destruction. By the end we have witnessed a sort of sociological big bang, when this tight, angry ball of political energy suddenly bursts and disbands irreparably (1:20). The Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street; (800) 838-3006; brownpapertickets.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'House for Sale' Daniel Fish's tedious staged reading of a rather pedestrian essay by Jonathan Franzen makes cruel demands on both the actors and the audience. Thanks, ''Gatz'' (1:20). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Isherwood)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35).

&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' In Dave Malloy's improbably wonderful electro-pop opera based on ''War & Peace,'' Tolstoy's introspective, emotional, impetuous characters sing about their love and woes. They feel modern and familiar, and it's a pleasure to be crowded together with them in Ars Nova's theater, which has been made into a kind of nightclub, with a bottle of cold vodka on each table. Rachel Chavkin directed (2:30). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Rachel Saltz)

'The Screwtape Letters' Devil is given his due in a humorous and lively stage version of C. S. Lewis's examination of Christianity from the viewpoint of the other side. Although the show is a sermon at heart, Max McLean, who adapted the material with Jeffrey Fiske, gives such an energetic performance as Satan's right-hand man that the satire comes through (1:30). Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, screwtapeonstage.com. (Wilborn Hampton)
'Sowa's Red Gravy' Lonette McKee stars as a 110-year-old ''Christian witch'' in Diane Richards's lusty celebration of passions.

'A Summer Day' In her first New York stage appearance in more than a decade, Karen Allen is perfectly cast as a woman frozen in time in Jon Fosse's quietly brutal play, which turns a romantic clich into an existential life sentence. Sarah Cameron Sunde adapted and directs this minimalist Norwegian work, which exerts an eerie dramatic undertow (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech.

'Wild With Happy' Colman Domingo (''The Scottsboro Boys'') plays a son grieving for his mother in this cartoon-bright, agreeably sentimental comedy (also written by Mr. Domingo) about love, death and Disney World.

'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net.

'The Medium' Gian Carlo Menotti's 1946 one-hour opera is a campy melodrama about a mystic named Madame Flora, who feels icy hands around her throat during one of her fraudulent sances, driving her to booze, madness and murder. Jeffery Roberson, better known as his drag alter ego, Varla Jean Merman, would seem the ideal interpreter to breathe life into the title character and her spooked ordeal. But under the clunky direction of Donna Drake, the performers play it more or less straight, something this trifle struggles to withstand.

HEADLINE: Man Held in Shootings That Terrorized Michigan Town

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
WIXOM, Mich. -- He chose his targets with no discernible pattern, firing at Cadillacs, minivans and pickup trucks, at young drivers and older ones, at men on their way to work, fans heading for the ballpark and women picking up their children from school, his shooting attacks stretching through four counties along the Interstate 96 corridor.
On Tuesday, the biggest topic of discussion in this middle-class suburb northwest of Detroit was not the election results -- the city split its presidential vote -- but the announcement that the police had taken into custody a local man believed to be the Wixom highway gunman. 
Raulie Wayne Casteel, 43, is expected to be arraigned on Friday before an Oakland County District Court judge on charges that include two counts of assault with intent to commit murder. He will participate from his jail cell in Livingston County, where he was arraigned on Wednesday in connection with a shooting there.
The police and prosecutors said they thought Mr. Casteel was responsible for 24 separate attacks, which wounded only one person, a man who was shot in the buttocks as he was driving to a World Series game. Mr. Casteel is likely to face additional state and federal charges, officials said.
The arrest ended three weeks of terror for residents of this city of about 14,000, who had been nervously eyeing every car they passed and taking side streets to avoid the highway and Wixom Road, where several vehicles were hit.
On days when the gunman was most active, the city's schools kept students inside. The annual Halloween party at a community center went on as scheduled, but with a heavy police presence. Frightened mothers called the Police Department saying they were afraid to let their children go out for ice cream cones or play on the street, said the Wixom police chief, Clarence Goodlein, whose department led a multiagency task force formed to investigate the shootings.
The city, unaccustomed to serious crime -- Wixom has had no homicides this year and ''I can't think of the last time we had a gunshot wound,'' Chief Goodlein said -- settled into the realization that it was as vulnerable as anywhere else to random and senseless violence.
''We were so scared,'' said Delynn Harris, a waitress at Backyard Coney Island, a diner about a quarter of a mile from one of the shooting sites. ''We didn't know where he was or what was going to happen next.''
Like other restaurants here, the diner lost business because customers were afraid to venture out, another economic blow for a struggling city where jobs are scarce and foreclosures frequent. The Ford assembly plant on Wixom Road -- the site of the city's last high-profile crime, an attack by a gunman that left one dead and three wounded in November 1996 -- closed down five years ago.
Chief Goodlein said that initially, the nature of the attacks was uncertain, but it gradually became clear that they were dealing with something far more serious than a juvenile prank.
At about 7:05 p.m. on Oct. 16, a man stepped out of his house on Hopkins Drive to put out the trash and felt bullets speeding by his head. About 10 minutes later, an employee at a dance studio on Wixom Road, just around the corner, reported hearing a volley of gunfire. In the next few minutes, four cars driving in the northbound lane were hit in rapid succession.
The next day brought another shooting, in Commerce Township. The day after that Aaron Mason, the owner of a tool company, was driving his Ford Edge north on Wixom Road to visit a customer about 2:15 when he heard a loud bang.
''I thought it was actually a rock hit my windshield or my tire blew out of something; so I pulled over,'' Mr. Mason said. He found a bullet lodged in the driver's seat.
By 6:30 that night, reports were coming in of similar attacks on Interstate 96 and in other counties.
''We started putting it together and counting the number of incidents, and the hair on everybody's neck started to stand up,'' Chief Goodlein said.
Still, the investigative task force, which eventually grew to more than 100 members from local law enforcement agencies, the F.B.I., the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Michigan State Police, had little to go on except bullets and bullet fragments, a shell casing and sketchy descriptions by witnesses of a dark-colored car that whizzed by, its driver firing out the window.
Rewards were offered. Tip lines were set up. Technology helped -- bullets collected after different shootings, forensic analysis indicated, had been fired by the same gun, a 9-millimeter pistol.
But in the end, Chief Goodlein said, it came down to old-fashioned legwork. Investigators came in early and worked late, going through frame after frame of surveillance tapes from businesses along the gunman's routes, sifting through more than 2,800 tips from callers and narrowing down lists of thousands of cars to find the one that mattered.
On Monday night, Mr. Casteel was arrested at a brick two-story house on a quiet cul-de-sac, where he had moved in with relatives some months ago, bringing his wife and young daughter.
''He was very nice, very personable, just very much about his daughter and doing things with her,'' said a neighbor, James Parr.
The police seized several guns at the house and Mr. Casteel's car, a dark gray Chevy Malibu.
A person familiar with the investigation said a tip about the shooter's license plate -- it had a Michigan State alumni frame and a green ''S'' on the left-hand side -- helped lead investigators to Mr. Casteel.
But his motive remains elusive. Mr. Casteel has been silent about the shootings, the police said.
In posts on Twitter, Mr. Casteel railed against President Obama, his health law and political corruption in the courts. In a cover letter on LinkedIn, which said he graduated from Michigan State with a degree in geoscience, he wrote of the ''down economic environment.'' A public defender at the arraignment in Livingston County said that family members had spoken of mental health problems.
In Wixom, people were just happy that it was over.
The shootings, said Deacon Bob Dreyer, who lives with his wife near the site of the first attack, put Wixom on the map.
''But it will drop off the map again now that the guy got caught,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Money for Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Science Is the Key to Growth'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 29): 
As Neal F. Lane makes clear, most Americans have benefited from basic research, from both a health and an economic standpoint. But many people think that federally financed research takes place only in the federal labs and at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
In fact, tax dollars for research are distributed on a peer-reviewed basis to every state and nearly every district in the country, sustaining good jobs and driving our economy. Research has created new industries like biotechnology that have turned economically depressed communities around.
Unfortunately, money for research and development is on the decline, putting our global competitiveness at risk. Congress has come together before for research and can again; it's especially important that the lame-duck session after the election overcome partisan divides and that lawmakers make decisions to keep our country strong by keeping science high on the priority list.
JOHN EDWARD PORTER Alexandria, Va., Oct. 31, 2012

HEADLINE: Citadel

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
A young widower battles demons both actual and figurative in ''Citadel,'' a suburban nightmare with socioeconomic underpinnings. 
After witnessing a brutal attack on his pregnant wife by a band of marauding kids, Tommy (Aneurin Barnard) is left with paralyzing agoraphobia and a baby daughter he can barely relate to. Goggle-eyed and clenched, trapped in an anonymous concrete desert where transport is scarce and utilities unreliable, Tommy finds solace in a warmhearted hospice nurse (Wunmi Mosaku) and therapy to modify his flinching body language. But when the fiendish imps -- all wearing identical hoodies -- return to claim his daughter, Tommy discovers there's more to their viciousness than a lack of parental supervision.
Shot primarily in and around some crumbling tower blocks in Glasgow, ''Citadel'' occasionally veers into ludicrousness, especially with the introduction of an angry priest (James Cosmo) who turns out to have a connection to the murderous minors. But this spare first feature from the Irish filmmaker Ciaran Foy (drawing on his own experiences) has an atavistic pulse, evoking a decaying society where elevators fail and bus drivers cower behind mesh grills. Steeped in the fear of poverty, the film prompts us to wonder what's gestating in those low-income tower blocks: feral monsters or economically deprived delinquents? Its mind is already made up.
''Citadel'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Dark corridors, deadly syringes and deformed juniors.
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles. Directed by Todd Rohal 1 hour 19 minutes

HEADLINE: Europe Increases Scrutiny Of Solar Industry in China

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators ramped up their investigation of the Chinese solar panel industry Thursday by accusing the Chinese government of unfairly subsidizing panel makers.
The latest step in an increasingly acrimonious battle engulfing the global clean-energy industry came a day after the United States made a final decision to impose duties on billions of dollars of solar products from China over the next five years, to shield American producers against lower-priced imports.
It also came after the Chinese government said Monday that it had filed a case with the World Trade Organization accusing some E.U. countries of violating free trade rules with policies that favored the purchase of solar energy equipment produced in Europe. 
The European Commission is already investigating whether Chinese manufacturers sold equipment for less than the cost of making it. That so-called anti-dumping investigation is the biggest case of its kind in terms of value, covering imports from China worth an estimated &#x20ac;21 billion, or $27 billion.
The investigation announced on Thursday covers the same products but it focuses on whether the Chinese authorities have skewed competitiveness with practices like providing silicon and glass at below market prices; by offering low-cost loans or financing; or exempting local companies from regulations.
''The European Commission has found that there is sufficient prima facie evidence to warrant the opening of an investigation,'' it said in a statement.
The dispute has divided the E.U. and the U.S. solar industries.
A number of manufacturers, led by the German company SolarWorld, accuse the Chinese of decimating their businesses by pursuing unfair trade practices. They complained after about a dozen solar panel manufacturers went bankrupt or cut back production on each side of the Atlantic.
But some companies, including many that install and repair solar energy systems, say that punishing the Chinese will make it more difficult to generate jobs and to expand use of the solar power as a way to cut pollution and enhance energy independence.
''Thousands of E.U. jobs would be at stake following a misguided attempt to protect a few manufacturers that present just a small part of the solar value chain,'' said Thorsten Preugschas, the chief executive of a German company called Soventix, which builds and operates solar plants worldwide.
Chinese manufacturers are also struggling because the Chinese industry is saddled with a glut of products, after state-owned banks financed a burst of construction over the past four years that left the country with more than two-thirds of the world's solar manufacturing capacity.
The Union will be reviewing two cases of alleged Chinese dumping and subsidies, and will consider whether to impose duties that would last five years. A decision could be made within 13 months, according to an E.U. official, who briefed journalists on condition of anonymity following the formal announcement. The commission could impose provisional duties in both cases by spring 2013.
Even so, the official said, the anti-subsidy case was not ''purely adversarial'' and Europeans were ''open to finding a solution'' that could avoid sanctions.
The case is a highly sensitive matter for Europe. which wants to avoid a trade war with Beijing to ensure that increasingly wealthy buyers in China purchase European-made goods like Airbus aircraft and luxury items.
On Thursday, the commission emphasized that this was only the fifth investigation against Chinese subsidies undertaken by the Union and that it had imposed measures only in one -- a case involving the paper industry. By comparison, the United States has already imposed 24 anti-subsidy measures against China, the commission said.
But the European case, if it exceeds &#x20ac;20 billion, would be four or five times larger by value than a similar investigation under way in the United States, partly because the Union is the biggest export market for Chinese solar panels. The Chinese solar equipment industry has boomed in large part because of the promotion of the industry in Europe, where many governments have put incentive programs in place to install panels in homes and offices.
The European case is also broader than the U.S. case, applying not only to fully assembled solar panels but also to imports of critical components like solar cells and wafers.
If the Union were to apply punitive tariffs on such a broad range of imports, Chinese companies would have trouble trying to avoid them by manufacturing components outside China or by shipping components to Europe and assembling them into finished panels there.
But the U.S. case is more advanced. The International Trade Commission decided unanimously Wednesday to allow the Commerce Department to impose tariffs of about 24 to 36 percent on most solar panels imported from China.
The European anti-subsidy case began with a complaint by EU ProSun, a group of European solar equipment makers, which asked the commission in September to investigate whether Chinese state banks and the central government offered support that was illegal under World Trade Organization rules.
EU ProSun also accused Chinese regions and localities of granting subsidies to companies by paying interest, electricity costs, transaction costs for land and value-added taxes, and by offering credit guarantees.
The group said Chinese solar companies were experiencing enormous losses but had not gone bankrupt, and that was because of unfair state support.
''Given the speed with which China is taking over the European solar market, we call on the E.U. to accelerate its investigation so that measures can be imposed at the earliest date possible,'' said Milan Nitzschke, president of EU ProSun.

HEADLINE: Priceline to Buy Kayak Software In $1.8 Billion Cash-Stock Deal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
Just months after going public, Kayak Software has been snapped up by a rival.
On Thursday, Priceline.com, a travel company from an earlier Internet age, agreed to buy Kayak, a younger competitor, for $1.8 billion in cash and stock. 
The acquisition, the largest in Priceline's history, could provide a new source of revenue for the company.
Priceline, once a highflying company that survived the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, acts as an online travel agent. It collects fees and commissions on reservations. Kayak, which was started in 2004, allows users to search other sites to compare prices. It makes most of its money from referrals and advertising.
"I see Kayak serving as a global entree into the advertising market for Priceline," said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. He said the deal could help Priceline "with their search rankings and give them some additional expertise in the technology department."
The companies' global ambitions are also symbiotic. Priceline, which also owns the Asian travel site Agoda.com, has been pushing into new markets overseas. International reservations accounted for 78 percent of its total last year.
In the third quarter, Kayak's revenue from outside the United States amounted to $17.3 million, a 40 percent increase from the period a year earlier, the company said when it reported earnings on Thursday. Overall third-quarter revenue rose 29 percent, to $78.6 million.
"We believe we can be helpful with Kayak's plans to build a global online travel brand," Priceline's chief executive, Jeffery H. Boyd, said in a statement.
The deal is yet another corporate evolution for Kayak. In a matter of months, the travel search site has gone from a privately held start-up to a publicly traded company to a unit operating under the umbrella of Priceline.
Following a long path to the public markets that started in 2010, Kayak got a relatively warm reception from investors in its July debut. Just months after the troubled offering of Facebook, shares of Kayak surged on their first day of trading, closing at roughly $33. Since then, the stock has fluctuated.
Priceline will pay roughly $40 a share for Kayak. At that level, the acquisition represents a 29 percent premium over Kayak's closing price of $31.04 a share on Thursday. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.
"We're excited to join the world's premier online travel company," Steve Hafner, Kayak's chief executive, said in a statement.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Faces Tough Choices on Housing in 2nd Term

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A second-term president may be just the person to tackle America's housing problems.
When President Obama first came into office, home prices were crashing, foreclosures were soaring and the previous Bush administration had just initiated the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed entities that agree to repay mortgages if the original borrower defaults.
With the market in shambles in 2009, the Obama administration pursued a tentative housing policy, for the most part avoiding big moves that might have further weakened the housing market or banks. Eventually, there were some bolder initiatives, like the national mortgage settlement with big banks as well as the Treasury Department's aid programs for homeowners. 
But as President Obama's first administration comes to an end, the government is still deeply embedded in the mortgage market. In the third quarter, various government entities backstopped 92 percent of all new residential mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a publication that focuses on the home loan industry.
Mr. Obama's economic team has consistently said it wants the housing market to work without significant government support. But it has taken few actual steps to advance that idea.
"I think Obama is absolutely committed to reducing the government's role," said Thomas Lawler, a former chief economist at Fannie Mae and founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, an industry analysis firm. "But no one's yet found a format to do that."
Housing policy is hard to tackle because so many people have benefited from the status quo. The entire real estate system - the banks, the agents, the home buyers - all depend on a market that provides fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages that can be easily refinanced when interest rates drop. That sort of loan is rare outside of the United States. And any effort to overhaul housing and the mortgage market could eventually reduce the amount of such mortgages in the country, angering many and creating a political firestorm.
In other words, the best person to fundamentally change how housing works may be a president who won't be running for office again.
Most immediately, the housing market has to be strong enough to deal with a government pullback. Some analysts think it's ready. "I think the housing recovery is far enough along that they can start winding down Fannie and Freddie," said Phillip L. Swagel at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
The administration can take smaller steps first. Mr. Lawler, the housing economist, thinks the government could start to reduce the maximum amount that it will guarantee for Fannie and Freddie loans. In some areas, like parts of the Northeast and California, it is as high as $625,000. Before the financial crisis, it was essentially capped at $417,000.
The big question is whether the private sector - banks and investors that buy bonds backed with mortgages - will pick up the slack when the government eases out of the market. If they don't, the supply of mortgages could fall and house prices could weaken.
Banks say their appetite depends on how new rules for mortgages turn out. In setting such regulations, some tough choices have to be made.
The new rules will effectively map the riskiness of various types of mortgages. In determining that, regulators will look at the features of the loans and the borrowers' income. Banks say they are unlikely to hold loans deemed risky, and their lobbyists are pressing for legal protection on the safer ones, called qualified mortgages.
The temptation will be to make the definition of what constitutes a qualified mortgage as broad as possible, to ensure that the banks lend to a wide range of borrowers. But regulators concerned with the health of the banks won't want a system that incentivizes institutions to make potentially risky loans.
One set of qualified mortgage regulations, being written by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could be completed as early as January. Other regulators, like the Federal Reserve, are expected to take longer in finishing their mortgage rules.
Resolving the conflict between mortgage availability and bank strength may depend on the person who replaces Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary. Mr. Geithner is stepping down at the end of Mr. Obama's first term.
The Obama administration faces other daunting decisions.
One is how to deal with the considerable number of troubled mortgages still in the financial system. Banks might be reluctant to make new loans until they have a better idea of the losses on the old loans. "If you don't ever deal with these problems, you may never get to where you want to go," said Mr. Lawler, the housing economist.
To help tackle that issue, the new administration might decide to make its mortgage relief programs more aggressive. It might even aim for more loan modifications, writing down the value of the mortgages to make them easier to pay. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has effectively blocked such write-downs on the vast amount of loans those entities have guaranteed.
A new Obama administration may move to change the agency's stance on write-downs, perhaps by replacing its acting director, Edward DeMarco. If that happened, it would be a sign that the White House had a taste for more radical housing actions. The agency declined to comment.
Then there's what to do with the Federal Housing Administration, another government entity that has backstopped a huge amount of mortgages since the financial crisis. The housing administration was set up to focus on lower-income borrowers, and it backs loans that have very low down payments. Its share of the market has grown since the crisis. The F.H.A. accounted for 13 percent of the market in the third quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.
The new administration has to decide whether it wants the F.H.A. to continue doing as much business. The risk is that a big pullback by the F.H.A. could reduce the availability of mortgages to lower-income borrowers. Banks almost certainly won't want to write loans with minuscule down payments since they are considered riskier.
Ultimately, housing policy comes down to one question: Which borrowers should get the most subsidies?
Right now, the government largess encompasses a wide swath of borrowers. But most analysts believe government support should be focused on lower-income borrowers.
"We will know that the Obama administration is serious about housing finance reform when it comes up with a proposal for affordable housing," said Mr. Swagel, the University of Maryland professor.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An Innovator vs. a Follower

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Last Christmas, Sears had a brisk seller in the Bionic Wrench, an award-winning, patented tool with spiffy lime green accents. This holiday season, though, Sears has a special display for its own wrench, in the red and black colors of its house brand, Craftsman.
One customer who recently spotted the new Craftsman tool, called the Max Axess wrench, thought it was an obvious knockoff, right down to the try-me packaging. ''I saw it and I said, 'This is a Bionic Wrench,' '' recalled Dana Craig, a retiree and tool enthusiast in Massachusetts who alerted the maker of the Bionic Wrench. ''It's a very distinctive tool,'' he added.
The tools have one significant difference, Mr. Craig noted. The Bionic Wrench is made in the United States. The Max Axess wrench is made in China.
The shift at Sears from a tool invented and manufactured in the United States to a very similar one made offshore has already led to a loss of American jobs and a brewing patent battle. 
The story of the Bionic Wrench versus Craftsman, which bills itself as ''America's most trusted tool brand,'' also raises questions about how much entrepreneurs and innovators, who rely on the country's intellectual property laws, can protect themselves. For the little guy, court battles are inevitably time-consuming and costly, no matter the outcome.
Still, the inventor of the Bionic Wrench is determined to fight. He is Dan Brown, an industrial designer in Chicago who came up with the wrench after watching his son try to work on a lawn mower. Mr. Brown says he believes that the Max Axess wrench copies his own and he is planning to file suit against Sears, which declined to answer any questions about the wrenches for this article.
The Bionic Wrench is distinguished by its gripping mechanism, a circle of metal prongs that, inspired by the aperture in a single-lens reflex camera, descend evenly to lock onto almost any nut or bolt.
Since Sears has halted new orders, the Pennsylvania company that makes the Bionic Wrench has had to lay off 31 workers, said Keith Hammer, the project manager at the company, Penn United Technologies. ''And that's not to mention our suppliers,'' he added.
Mr. Brown sees a broader issue than just the fate of his wrench. ''Our situation is an example of why we're not getting jobs out of innovation,'' he said. ''When people get the innovation, they go right offshore. What happened to me is what happened to so many people so many times, and we just don't talk about it.''
Inventors typically spend $10,000 to $50,000 to obtain the type of patent Mr. Brown has on the wrench, said John S. Pratt, a patent expert at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton in Atlanta. Though he said he could not comment on the merits of Mr. Brown's potential suit, patent infringement cases can be especially difficult in the tool field, where many improvements are incremental, Mr. Pratt explained.
A defendant in such a case would most likely argue that either the tool did not warrant a patent in the first place, or that its own product did not violate the patent.
The fact that Sears made some changes to the wrench's design, like making the grooves that allow the metal prongs to slide back and forth visible instead of hidden, will make the case more challenging, he said. ''It's hard for me to imagine that Sears isn't particularly careful about breach of patent, so there's probably another side to the story,'' he said.
After patenting the wrench in 2005, Mr. Brown formed a company, LoggerHead Tools, to bring it to market, making a point of having it made in the United States.
The Bionic Wrench was greeted with enthusiasm at trade shows and in industrial design competitions, and the company survived the downturn in 2008. Mr. Brown resisted overtures from large chain stores that wanted to sell the tool under their proprietary brand, he said, and rejected the lure of cheaper manufacturing in China. ''I was raised a different way,'' he said.
The tool sold fairly well on its own -- LoggerHead has shipped 1.75 million of them -- but Mr. Brown, 56, who teaches industrial design at Northwestern University, says LoggerHead operated on a shoestring and he plowed much of the profit back into the company. ''You cannot have big offices and fancy cars and everybody with an administrative assistant, because we are competing with China,'' he said.
In 2009, LoggerHead hit pay dirt when Sears agreed to do a test sale. The product sold out, Mr. Brown said, and Sears ordered 75,000 Bionic Wrenches the next year. In exchange Mr. Brown agreed not to sell the wrench to Sears's competitors, including Home Depot and Lowe's.
In 2011, sales at Sears increased again, far outpacing LoggerHead's other outlets like the QVC shopping channel and smaller hardware stores. But LoggerHead's profit margin remained small, in part because it produced a television commercial and paid Sears to show it.
The Sears Holdings Company, which owns the Craftsman brand, declined multiple requests to comment on the Bionic Wrench or the Max Axess Wrench. The company would not answer questions about patent infringement or the volume of sales.
But in a string of e-mails provided by Mr. Brown, the buyer at Sears who had the LoggerHead account wrote, making liberal use of exclamation points, that the wrench's holiday sales last year exceeded its target by 23 percent.
In the manufacturing world, lead time can determine price, and from the beginning cost was a particular issue for the Bionic Wrench, because of the competition from China. A 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal was headlined, ''Wrench Wins Awards, but Is It Priced Too High to Be a Hit?''
According to Mr. Brown's account of his dealings with Sears, the chain was pleased with the tool's performance and agreed to place an order for 2012 in plenty of time to keep the cost low. Then his buyer at Sears changed and that agreement seemed to get lost in a new round of haggling. When the order for Father's Day finally came, Mr. Brown said, it was too late to guarantee the lower price. He refused the order.
Sears responded by agreeing to the higher price. But when it came time for the Christmas holiday order, negotiations stalled once more, again pushing LoggerHead past the deadline to get the best price, according to Mr. Brown.
''We were sitting there going, 'Why do they want Father's Day so bad but they won't commit for Christmas?' '' Mr. Brown said. Now he believes that the company had already placed its order for the Craftsman version.
In late September, Mr. Brown said, his suspicions were confirmed. LoggerHead got a ''customer feedback'' e-mail from Mr. Craig, the tool connoisseur, describing the new Max Axess wrenches. ''Sadly, they are made in China,'' Mr. Craig wrote. ''Can you tell me if LoggerHead has authorized these?''
Craftsman has come under fire before, accused of misleading customers into thinking that its tools are made in America and for stealing intellectual property. In one case, Sears spent two decades defending itself against a claim by Peter M. Roberts, who as a young Sears employee had, on his own time, invented a type of socket wrench.
Mr. Roberts told the court that Sears had played down the value of his invention, paid him $10,000 for the rights, and then made tens of millions of dollars. He eventually received settlements of less than $10 million, according to news reports.
In another, more recent case led by Lee Grossman, Mr. Brown's lawyer, a judge awarded $25 million to the maker of a tool called the Rotozip who said he had disclosed trade secrets to Sears in an attempt to get the store to carry a new version of the tool.
Sears, a jury decided, took the trade secrets and had the tool made abroad for Craftsman.
''You have LoggerHead out, Dan Brown out, and dozens of American workers laid off -- all in the name of profits for Sears,'' Mr. Grossman said.
LoggerHead's lawsuit, Mr. Brown said, will most likely include claims that Sears interfered with the company's ability to do business with other stores.
''I'm in favor of free trade,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The person who's out-innovated loses. But it's destructive when someone competes but doesn't out-innovate, they just produce it in a different market without regard to safety codes and human conditions.''
The company that makes the Max Axess wrench and other tools for Craftsman, the Apex Tool Group, is being acquired by Bain Capital, the company founded by Mitt Romney, in a $1.6 billion deal.
Throughout the presidential campaign, Bain was criticized on the grounds that it encouraged outsourcing by companies it buys at the expense of American workers. Apex makes many of its tools overseas. A company spokesman referred all questions to Sears.
Mr. Brown and his lawyer say they believe they have a solid case against Sears, but it could take years to litigate. ''What happens to us in the meantime?'' Mr. Brown asked.
Mr. Brown is also concerned that while he fights in court, Sears can undercut the price of his wrench.
For now at least, Sears still has some of Mr. Brown's wrenches in its inventory. On the Sears Web site, the Craftsman and the LoggerHead wrenches are listed at the same regular price, $24.99 for the 8-inch version, and today both are on sale. But for at least a few days in recent weeks, only the Craftsman version was on sale, for $19.99.

HEADLINE: In Veterans' Aid, Growth Pains

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
GATHERING over a kitchen table and glasses of wine in early 2003, a group of officers' wives at Camp Pendleton, Calif., cobbled together a plan for helping Marines injured during the invasion of Iraq.
First they distributed snacks and toiletries at hospitals, then they bought plane tickets and special equipment for wounded Marines and their families. Volunteers all, the wives assumed that the war would end in 2004, allowing them to go happily out of business.
But the war not only continued, it expanded -- and so did their endeavor. Today their organization, the Semper Fi Fund, has nationwide reach, having issued more than $66 million in emergency grants to over 8,200 service members since 2003. Last year, it raised $15 million, a record, with no letup in sight.
''Service members come back with catastrophic wounds,'' said Wendy Lethin, the fund's senior director of outreach and development and one of its founders. ''We don't know what their needs will be 20 years from now. But we know we want to be there for a lifetime.'' 
The Semper Fi Fund is one of the success stories from a decade of rapid expansion in philanthropy for veterans and military families. Since 2001, more than 7,800 nonprofit groups have registered with the federal government to care for troops, veterans and their families, according to the Urban Institute -- a third of those in just the last three years.
The plethora of private organizations has brought comfort and vital services to thousands, filling gaps left by overwhelmed government agencies. But the rapid growth has come with problems.
Though giving to military and veterans groups has increased -- a survey by the Foundation Center suggests it has more than tripled since 2001 -- many veterans advocates say donations have not kept pace with the growing needs of new veterans. And with war in Afghanistan winding down and increasingly out of the news, many nonprofits worry that donations will decline as well.
''There is too much demand and not enough supply,'' said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq Afghanistan Veterans of America, the largest advocacy group for the new veterans.
In many ways, the explosive growth of those nonprofits is a measure not only of national generosity and entrepreneurial spirit but also a more positive attitude toward veterans, certainly since Vietnam.
But now, the ability of many nonprofits to survive may depend on their willingness to consolidate services and coordinate fund-raising with competing groups.
''I've culled a network of over 25,000 organizations,'' said David Sutherland, a retired Army colonel who is now director of the Dixon Center for Military and Veterans Community Services, a private nonprofit group. ''Getting them to work together so they are not all overlapping and chasing the same dollars is the challenge.''
Pick a veteran need or niche, and there is probably a group serving it, whether it be operating homeless residences, counseling the mentally ill, awarding academic fellowships, finding jobs or running athletic events for the disabled.
Many remain mom-and-pop operations. But a few -- like the Semper Fi Fund, Blue Star Families, the Wounded Warrior Project, Operation Homefront, Homes for Our Troops and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund -- have blossomed into national organizations with multimillion-dollar budgets, following the path of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and the U.S.O. during previous wars.
Unlike its older siblings, this new generation has been less about advocacy and fraternity and more about providing services. Though the Department of Veterans Affairs spends more than $115 billion a year on health care, disability compensation and pensions for the nation's 21 million veterans, its programs have been stretched by a flood of ill, disabled and unemployed veterans, young and old.
Yet many potential donors do not realize that the safety net is often frayed, nonprofit leaders say. ''The feeling among potential donors is that the V.A. has everything covered,'' said James McDonough, a retired Army colonel and senior fellow for veterans affairs at the New York State Health Foundation. ''So why should we fund other initiatives?''
Nancy Berglass, director of Iraq Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund, said the small percentage of Americans with a personal stake in the wars -- 2.3 million troops, less than 1 percent of the population, actually deployed -- has also created obstacles to fund-raising.
''Our nation has not been asked to appreciate or contribute to the volunteer military,'' Ms. Berglass said. ''The lack of engagement from the public is now bearing bad fruit.''
But Ms. Berglass, who is widely viewed as godmother to a bevy of veterans organizations, said money was not necessarily the crucial factor. More cooperation and better research to identify effective programs would make limited resources go much further, she said.
''We need groups to be asking: Can we define a common end, and if so, how can we work together for the most efficient delivery of service?'' she said.
Community-based alliances that tailor services to local needs rather than creating overlapping organizations are the most effective, she said, citing collaborative efforts by New York Community Trust and Lincoln Community Foundation in Nebraska.
The Robert R. McCormick Foundation, which has long supported veterans services nationwide, has even begun concentrating its giving in the Chicago area, working with state government to help veterans navigate a confusing array of programs.
''We realized that to be effective working with veterans, you have to focus locally,'' said Eli Williamson, director of veterans programs for the foundation.
Because of concerns about a decline in giving, some groups have conducted collaborative fund-raising campaigns. Iraq Afghanistan Veterans of America, for instance, recently created the Veterans Support Fund, a venture with Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, also known as TAPS; the National Military Family Association; Operation Homefront; and Operation Mend. (A fifth group will be added in November.)
The fund will try to raise $30 million over the next few years and distribute it evenly among the nonprofits.
''This centralizes things for the Johnny Rich guy who says, 'I don't know where to start,' '' Mr. Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said.
Competition for dollars has also created friction. Bill White has helped raise money for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund and the Fisher House Foundation, which build therapeutic centers and lodging for wounded troops and their families. He complained recently that the U.S.O., for United Service Organizations, had started programs that overlapped with his groups' work, sowing confusion in the donor world.
''Because they've got to raise money, U.S.O. goes out and does what we're doing, putting us in direct competition for the same funding,'' Mr. White said. ''That is to the detriment of veterans.''
Sloan D. Gibson, president of the U.S.O., which was created when six nonprofit groups combined during World War II, said the group had long provided services to the wounded troops and their families, though it remained perhaps better known for entertaining troops and running airport welcome centers.
The group is now building family community centers at military medical centers at Fort Belvoir, Va., and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. -- places where the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund is also building centers for treating traumatic brain injuries. Mr. Gibson said the U.S.O. had consulted with both medical centers to ensure it was not duplicating services.
''It is precisely in our mission footprint,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''If we aren't adapting to meet that kind of mission need, then shame on us.''
The largest single donation made to veterans services in the last decade, and possibly ever, came from the philanthropist David Gelbaum, who over three years starting in 2006 gave nearly a quarter of a billion dollars through the Iraq Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund.
The fund is widely credited with fertilizing scores of nonprofits, helping them grow strong roots not just by providing big grants but also by requiring them to focus missions and demonstrate effectiveness.
''It really did get us engaged in strategic long-term thinking,'' said Bonnie Carroll, the founder and chief executive of TAPS, which assists survivors of troops killed in service. With a grant of $6.5 million over three years, TAPS's staff grew from a handful of workers to 53 people today.
After the deployment fund dried up in 2009, however, one of its grantees shut down. And while some large corporations and foundations have jumped into the void, including Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, many nonprofit leaders complain that some of the biggest-name donors have not.
The newness of the field and vast array of groups occupying it have made some large contributors wary, philanthropic experts say. More than ever, those donors expect the groups to demonstrate impact before they write checks.
''There are millions of little organizations all over the map doing different things,'' said Paul Rosenberg, a partner in the Bridgespan Group, which advises nonprofit groups and donors. ''So for donors, one challenge is deciding where to put money to maximize results.''
Eric Greitens, a former member of the Navy SEALs and chief executive of the Mission Continues, which pays veterans to perform community services while applying for college or permanent jobs, said more corporations and foundations seemed willing to give, but only to groups that
could demonstrate impact.
Goldman Sachs, for instance, gave Mission Continues $6 million over five years because it believed that the group was not simply helping individual veterans but also training future leaders. Several of its fellows went on to create new organizations, including Team Rubicon, Student Veterans of America and Veterans Farm.
''They saw many organizations, but they wanted to make an investment in one that could shape the field,'' Mr. Greitens said.
For that reason, some nonprofit leaders say they encourage people who want to start new groups to think instead about joining existing ones.
''We expect 2013 and 2014 to be tough years in fund-raising,'' said Amy Palmer, chief programs and field operations officer for Operation Homefront, a nonprofit based in San Antonio that aids military families.
''If we were asked to start Operation Homefront today, I wouldn't do it,'' she said. ''There are too many people in this space.''

HEADLINE: Worries About Fiscal Cliff Still Weigh on Investors

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Thursday as investors remained concerned about Washington's ability to find a solution for the fiscal cliff in coming weeks and about the continuing debt crisis in Europe. 
McDonald's shares fell 2 percent to $85.13 after the company reported its first monthly decline in global sales since March 2003. Apple shares sank for a second day. The stock fell 3.6 percent to $537.75 and is down more than 20 percent from its record Sept. 21 intraday high of $705.07.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 121.41 points, or 0.94 percent, to 12,811.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.02 points, or 1.22 percent, to 1,377.51, ending at its lowest level since Aug. 2. The Nasdaq composite index fell 41.70 points, or 1.42 percent, to close at 2,895.58.
Since reaching a 52-week closing high of 1,465.77 on Sept. 14, the S.& P. 500 has dropped 6 percent. On Wednesday, a day after President Obama defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, the S.& P. 500 dropped more than 2 percent for its biggest one-day percentage decline since June 1.
Investors worry that if no deal is reached in Congress over approximately $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases to take effect early next year, the nation's struggling economy could fall into recession.
An agreement to avoid the automatic spending cuts and tax increases of the fiscal cliff was possible, but a more likely situation is for political leaders to find a temporary fix to buy time until the new Congress and Mr. Obama are sworn in, in January.
The prospect of haggling over the budget has deepened the uncertainty for investors, who have sold stocks on the expectation taxes will go up on capital gains and dividends.
''That's really what investors have been reacting to these last two days,'' Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Asset Management in Boston, said. ''It is this worry about the fiscal cliff and the ability of politicians to come to a solution.''
On the data front, the government reported a better-than-expected decline in first-time claims for weekly unemployment benefits.
Qualcomm, a supplier of chips for cellphones, was a bright spot. Shares rose 4.4 percent to $60.67 after it reported quarterly revenue that beat expectations.
As equity values fell, investors turned to the security of fixed-income assets like United States Treasuries, and those prices, including 30-year bonds that were auctioned off, rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year notes rose 7/32, to 100 2/32, and the yield fell to 1.62 percent from 1.64 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Congress Sees Rising Urgency On Fiscal Deal

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Andrews Siddons contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senior lawmakers said Thursday that they were moving quickly to take advantage of the postelection political atmosphere to try to strike an agreement that would avert a fiscal crisis early next year when trillions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts begin to go into force.
Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said he had begun circulating a draft plan to overhaul the tax code and entitlements, had met with 25 senators from both parties and ''been on the phone nonstop since the election.'' 
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who will retire at the end of the year, made it clear that she intended to press for a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff and get serious on the deficit, lame duck or not.
''The message and signals we send in the coming days could bear serious consequences for this country,'' she said. ''It could trigger another downgrade. It could trigger a global financial crisis. This is a very consequential moment.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, extended an olive branch to Republicans, suggesting Thursday that he could accept a tax plan that leaves the top tax rate at 35 percent, provided that loophole closings would hit the rich, not the middle class. He previously had said that he would accept nothing short of a return to the top tax rate of Bill Clinton's presidency, 39.6 percent.
''If you kept them at 35, it's still much harder to do,'' Mr. Schumer said, ''but obviously there is push and pull, and there are going to be compromises.''
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office underscored the stakes in a report Thursday that framed Washington's dilemma. It said that if automatic spending cuts go into force and all the Bush-era tax cuts expire, the nation would slip into recession next year and unemployment would rise to 9.1 percent, from October's rate of 7.9 percent. But simply canceling those deficit-reduction measures would risk a financial crisis that would make matters worse, the report said.
The accelerated activity in Washington showed that members of Congress believed the election had amplified the imperative to strike a deal. Still, signs that the two sides are open to some compromise are no guarantee that they can reach an agreement after warring for two years. Many Republicans will continue to resist any proposal that can be read as increasing taxes, and many Democrats will balk at changes in entitlement programs and spending cuts.
Lawmakers also have a wary eye on the electoral landscape. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a crucial player in budget talks, is up for re-election in 2014 and may resist any deal that could foster opposition back home.
But members of Congress clearly see recent events creating an opening in the postelection session of Congress, when some retiring and defeated lawmakers could have a freer hand on voting for legislation, absent political consequences. Republicans were weakened by losing seats in both the House and the Senate, while Democrats are eager to move to issues like immigration, which animated Latino voters and helped deliver victory on Tuesday. ''The conditions are there to act,'' Mr. Corker said. ''I think the environment is different now.''
Even conservative Republicans are signaling newfound flexibility. Aides said that on a conference call of House Republicans, a number of lawmakers spoke up to say they needed to give their leaders breathing room and avoid brinkmanship.
The budget office report suggested that allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for households earning more than $250,000 a year -- a position strenuously opposed by Congressional Republicans -- would have relatively modest economic impacts, versus many of the other components of the fiscal cliff.
''House Republicans must end their intransigence on tax cuts for the very wealthy and sit down on a bipartisan basis to finish the work of this Congress,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
A separate C.B.O. report released Thursday threw cold water on Republican beliefs that a simplified tax code that lowered income and payroll taxes and closed loopholes to make up for lost revenue would substantially close the deficit by boosting economic growth. Such a plan would raise about $100 billion a year by 2020, far less than Democrats say is necessary, the report said.
The forces arrayed against a budget deal remain powerful, and the gap between the parties -- at least in their public postures -- is wide. Liberals, backed by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, say Social Security should not be part of any deal. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a standard-bearer for the left, said Thursday that virtually all deficit reduction should come from tax increases on the rich, closing loopholes that have allowed profitable corporations to avoid paying any corporate income taxes and cutting military spending.
Mr. Corker said many Senate Republicans were willing to agree to a deal that raises more revenue through an overhaul of the tax code, and that additional revenue must be generated by taxation, not just economic growth. In a speech Thursday in his home state of South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham said that fellow Republicans should hold the line on tax rates, but that they had to accept that a reformed tax code would raise more revenues. Only then, he said, can they expect Democrats to negotiate changes to entitlement spending.
Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has said he will agree only to a deal that lowers the top income tax rate from the current 35 percent, not from the top rate that is scheduled to kick in on Jan. 1, 39.6 percent. He said that additional revenue would be generated by economic growth spurred by a simpler tax code, not by higher taxes.
Spinning revenue from tax cuts like that, Mr. Schumer said, is a ''Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale.''
Conservatives are not giving in.
''We will certainly face many battles in Congress in the coming months that will give us the opportunity to clearly articulate the failures of liberalism and the common sense of conservative alternatives,'' Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday on Facebook. ''We must not shrink from the fight on Capitol Hill.''

HEADLINE: The Drugs of War

BYLINE: HUMA YUSUF


HIGHLIGHT: Drug trafficking in Pakistan is, like terrorism, a devastating fallout of the conflict in Afghanistan. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Last week Canadian officials seized 22 kilograms of heroin worth $8.8 million on a flight that originated in Pakistan. Last month Indian Border Security Force officials found 105 kilograms of heroin concealed among bags of cement on a train from Pakistan, one of the largest-ever seizures of contraband in India.
Drug trafficking, like terrorism, is a devastating fallout for Pakistan of the conflict in Afghanistan.
In 1980, there were only 50,000 drug users in Pakistan; by 2011 there were 8.1 million,according to official statistics, and many health experts and social workers think the number is much higher. One reason for the spike is that Pakistan became a major transit route in the 1980s, when trafficking was officially sanctioned in Afghanistan as a way to fund the anti-Soviet mujahedeen.
Today, drugs worth $30 billion are smuggled out of Afghanistan via Pakistan every year; one-third of all drugs produced in Afghanistan pass through the coastal areas of the western Pakistani province of Baluchistan.
Growing up in the port city of Karachi in the 1980s, I remember noticing the number of "heroinchis" - as addicts are known in Pakistan - multiplying on the city's streets. A park across the street from my school in Saddar, the central business district, gradually became off-limits to us as the presence of discarded needles, drug peddlers and addicts increased.
By the time I was a reporter in the 2000s, few criminals denied earning cash by selling drugs, and gang warfare was raging in Lyari, Karachi's largest slum, as various groups fought for control of smuggling depots, supply routes and profits from drug sales.
The Pakistani authorities concede that drug trafficking is a major problem. In 2010, they launched the ambitious Drug Control Master Plan, which identified ways to control trafficking, rehabilitate addicts and create public awareness about drug abuse. And officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran have held several meetings to discuss ways to stem drug smuggling from Afghanistan. Following last month's bust on the train to India, the Pakistani government has renewed vows to crack down: It is considering recruiting more staff, sealing railcars and installing special scanners to ensure that exported goods are drug-free.
But the extra measures are unlikely to make much difference. The Drug Control Master Plan is poorly implemented. It remains a low priority for provincial police departments and the taxation authorities, who still await approval for the budgets needed to tackle drug smuggling. Another problem is widespread tolerance for - and sometimes complicity in -- trafficking. The heroin kingpin Imam Bheel, for example, allegedly maintains close ties with senior Pakistani politicians. 
Pakistan is suffering economic and political consequences for playing host to drug traffickers. Finger-pointing over smuggling is putting pressure on its relations with Afghanistan (and by extension, the United States), which are already strained because of militant activities along the border. And concern over narcotics smuggling is deterring bilateral trade with India, an essential element to forging stronger ties between these long-term rivals.
And then, of course, Pakistan's citizens are suffering. Approximately 600,000 Pakistanis become drug users every year. While many of them hail from low-income areas, not all are destitute. In my late teens, many of my peers were using drugs; some of them died of overdoses. According to one estimate, one in 10 college students in Pakistan is now an addict. For people like them, Pakistan's role in global drug trafficking isn't just about geopolitics. It's about survival.

HEADLINE: A Microcosm of the New South Africa

BYLINE: JOHN EDWIN MASON


HIGHLIGHT: The South African township of Soweto - famed for its resistance to apartheid - captured the imagination of Per-Anders Pettersson when he covered South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994. Nearly twenty years later, its bustle still appeals. 

 BODY:
Few place names are as burdened with history as Soweto. Nelson Mandela once called it home. The infamous center of resistance to apartheid - South Africa's entrenched system of white supremacy - the township was a symbol of poverty and oppression on the one hand and heroism and sacrifice on the other. Fittingly, it gave its name to a 1976 uprising of young activists that forever changed the country's political landscape.
Today, 18 years after Mr. Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president, the sprawling township's cultural dynamism and growing prosperity have transformed it into a symbol of hope rather than despair. Home to from two million to three million people, it rivals nearby Johannesburg in size and is the perfect spot to document the surprises and contradictions of South Africa's transformation. Poverty has not disappeared, but it no longer defines the area, according to Per-Anders Pettersson, a Swedish photographer who has long documented the township.
"Soweto fascinates me," he said. "It's one of the must-see places in South Africa, a microcosm of the new South Africa."
It was this emerging Soweto that captured Mr.Pettersson's imagination the moment he first encountered it in 1994. Mr. Pettersson, who was based in New York at the time, had gone to South Africa to cover the elections that marked the end of apartheid. Although he was in the country for only a month, the experience affected him deeply. "South Africa just drew me back," he said. "I lost interest in other stories, in other things that were happening."
He relocated there in 2000 and now supports himself through photojournalism and commercial assignments, especially in Africa. His personal work, however, documents how democracy and development are changing South Africa. The country is his passion. "I found something that became my project," he said. "Something that I really loved."
For Mr. Pettersson, Soweto is much more than a subject. Having worked in the township for nearly two decades, he says, many of its residents have become friends. "It's actually my favorite place in South Africa," he said, "and sometimes I would say, the safest and the most fun."
Soweto's energy and creativity are as evident in Mr. Pettersson's photographs as its many quandaries. He describes the photos as taking viewers on "a journey from the old into the new." In almost all of the photos, the frames are packed with motion and color. In some, businessmen sip brandy in a upscale bar (Slide 4), children golf on manicured greens (Slide 9) and beauty pageant contestants strut across a stage (Slide 13). In others, street vendors sell their wares in a desolate urban landscape (Slide 15) and young women participate in a traditional Zulu rite of passage.
While Mr. Pettersson plans to publish a book of his Soweto photographs, he knows he still has a long road ahead of him. "I've shot quite a lot in the last few months, and I'm about 50 percent there," he said. "If I can spend a couple of months full time, that would be really good. I'll get a long way to the end."
Like many photojournalists, Mr. Pettersson has turned to emphas.is, a crowd-funding Web site that connects photographers with donors to raise the money he needs to allow him to settle in Soweto and finish the project. Those who pledge support can get in return anything from prints from the series to workshops with the photographer. Crowd-funding is no panacea, however; Mr. Pettersson is still some distance from his goal. 
But he remains close to his motivation. Soweto has been attracting photographers for more than 50 years. The best of them have taught audiences something new and have shown them things they never expected. 
"In Soweto you can see changing very fast - fancy shopping malls and car dealerships and festivals," he said. "They even have a Fashion Week now."
John Edwin Mason teaches African history and the history of photography at the University of Virginia. A photographer in his own right, he divides his time between Charlottesville, Va., and Cape Town. He is on Twitter - @johnedwinmason - and so is @nytimesphoto.

HEADLINE: The Case Against Big Cat Ownership

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: A coalition of animal welfare groups has proposed a bill that would prohibit private possession of big cats across the United States. 

 BODY:
Titan, Bali and Java, three massive tigers, recently journeyed from a financially struggling Texas shelter to a new home in North Carolina. Driven through the night in the back of a trailer, convivial Titan accepted the change without batting a whisker, while stressed-out Java and Bali protested with booming roars and skittish lunges.
The tigers will never see the jungles of their species' native Asia, but rather will live out the remainder of their lives in their new Appalachian enclosure.
A new documentary film, "Removed," tells the tigers' story. (Its premiere was originally scheduled for Thursday at the third annual New York Wildlife and Conservation Film Festival, but organizers postponed the festival after last week's hurricane.)
Titan, Mali and Java's ordeal - shuttling from facility to facility and living in cramped captivity after being rescued from zoos, private homes and failing shelters - is an all-too-familiar situation in the United States, cat activists say.

The implications are far from trivial. More tigers live in private captivity in Texas than in the wild, where conservationists estimate that around 3,000 of the endangered animals remain. No one knows for sure how many big cats - including tigers, lions, panthers, cheetahs, leopards and others - are kept today in backyards and apartments across the United States, but estimates run as high as 20,000. (The Endangered Species Act does not prohibit domestic trade in captive-bred wildlife.)
"Many of these cases are misguided animal enthusiasts who become enamored by a beautiful baby that quickly becomes wild, and then the situation gets out of control," said Tracy Coppola, a campaigns officer at the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
"The animals are often abandoned, relinquished or just kept in very substandard and dangerous conditions because they're wild animals and people don't know how to deal with them," she said.
The Department of Agriculture assumes responsibility for monitoring big cat possession and for inspecting the animals' facilities, but Ms. Coppola said the department does not have the resources to thoroughly evaluate each situation, meaning that some individual animals are never assessed.
When owners eventually realize that they can no longer care for a big cat - each of which costs upward of $6,000 annually to care for - they often donate it to a sanctuary. But sanctuaries usually lack the resources to care for an influx of animals, and many of these privately financed institutions were hit hard by the recession.
"Sanctuaries are critical and do a lot of public good, but they're not enough to battle this problem," Ms. Coppola said.
To address this need, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, along with a coalition of other animal charities, is pushing for legislation that would bolster regulations on big cat ownership in the United States.
Currently, 28 states fully ban big cat possession, yet seven do not address the issue at all, the fund says. The others fall somewhere in between, making for a confusing patchwork of skimpy-to-stringent rules. "If you or I moved to West Virginia, we could basically have a tiger in our backyard with no regulation whatsoever," Ms. Coppola said.
The proposed legislation, the Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act, aims to change that. The bill would amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to explicitly prevent private big cat ownership across the United States. Private pet owners who already owned big cats could keep them as long as they registered them with the Department of Agriculture, but going forward, only zoos or sanctuaries could adopt new felines. 
Private owners could no longer breed and auction off their animals, either. The Senate bill, sponsored by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, is currently in the Committee on Environment and Public Works, while two California lawmakers, Representative Buck McKeon, a Republican, and Representative Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat, are sponsoring the House version. 
Ms. Coppola and her colleagues lobbied for the legislation not just to protect animals, but to ensure the safety of local communities, too. A major impetus, she said, was the abrupt decision of an exotic animal farm owner in Zanesville, Ohio, to release all of his animals, including 38 large cats, last year. Of the cats, only three leopards survived the ordeal. 
While no locals were apparently harmed by the animals, past cases - like the 2005 death of a 17-year-old who was attacked by a Siberian tiger as she was posing for a photo - demonstrate the threat that big cat ownership poses to public safety.
"I'm afraid there's going to be another Zanesville," Ms. Coppola said. "We're trying to phase out the big cat trade and help the U.S.D.A. before that happens."

HEADLINE: More Unknowns From Washington

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: With investors already worried about the fiscal cliff, there's another wild card that will factor into the debates in Washington: the debt ceiling. | President Obama may be well positioned to push for changes in housing policy. | Kayak Software is being bought by Priceline.com for $1.8 billion in cash and stock. | Groupon is still having difficulty making money. 

 BODY:
MORE UNKNOWNS FROM WASHINGTON | With investors already worried about the possible tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, there's another wild card that will factor into the debates in Washington in the coming months: the debt ceiling. A failure to raise the federal borrowing limit in a timely manner could send "financial markets into a panic," writes Annie Lowrey in The New York Times.
"Congressional leaders have made clear that the debt ceiling will be part of the intense negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff, with many members unwilling to raise the ceiling without a broader deal," Ms. Lowrey says. Congress has some time to negotiate a deal before needing to raise the borrowing limit. But the experience last year showed that such high-stakes negotiations can hurt confidence. "Although bond yields remain low, when contentious political decisions - such as raising the debt ceiling - have come due in the past, uncertainty about the outcome led to unfavorable market reactions," economists at the International Monetary Fund said in a global risk assessment.
Political dynamics are shifting. For the housing market, that might not be a bad thing. "The best person to fundamentally change how housing works may be a president who won't be running for office again," who is willing to risk "angering many and creating a political firestorm," writes DealBook's Peter Eavis. The Obama administration faces a range of questions, like how to reduce the government's role in the market, and how to decide which borrowers get the most subsidies, Mr. Eavis writes. Any overhaul will be fiercely challenged, as "so many people have benefited from the status quo."
The political wrangling may drag on for some time. The country has entered an "era of political brinkmanship," in which lawmakers may "tiptoe back from disaster, with delaying mechanisms, before embarking on yet more brinkmanship," writes Gillian Tett in a column in The Financial Times. Some lawmakers say they are working to strike an agreement in the postelection political atmosphere, reports Jonathan Weisman in The New York Times. And yet, there's "no guarantee that they can reach an agreement after warring for two years."
KAYAK'S $1.8 BILLION DEAL | Kayak Software spent the summer as a public company, and now it is evolving again. The travel company, which had its I.P.O. in July, is being bought by Priceline.com, an older competitor, for $1.8 billion in cash and stock. The price of $40 a share represents a 29 percent premium over Kayak's closing price of $31.04 a share on Thursday. Though the deal surprised some analysts, it could provide Priceline with a new source of revenue and help Kayak expand internationally. "I see Kayak serving as a global entree into the advertising market for Priceline," said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company.
ON THE AGENDA | President Obama is scheduled to make a statement on the economy at 1:05 p.m. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is on CNBC at 4 p.m. Sheila Bair, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is on Bloomberg TV at 5:10 p.m. J.C. Penney, a favorite of the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, reports earnings before the opening bell. Brookfield Asset Management also reports results before the market opens. The November consumer sentiment index from Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan is released at 9:55 a.m.
GROUPON FALLS SHORT | Groupon is still having difficulty making money. The daily deals company reported third-quarter revenue of $568.6 million, compared with $430.2 million in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected revenue of $590 million. Shares fell as low as $3.21 in after-hours trading, after closing at $3.92 (and compared with an I.P.O. price last year of $20 a share). Europe has posed a particular challenge for Groupon, with the debt crisis hurting demand. The company said it had laid off about 80 employees.
 THE REGULATOR-POET | Writing rules for Wall Street doesn't afford much opportunity for artistic license. Unless, that is, you're Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The muse was speaking to Mr. Chilton on Thursday, when he fired up two rounds of verbal fireworks in describing the process of putting the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul into effect. There was an airplane metaphor ("We've been waiting around the gate area, eating Cinnabons and watching cable news since July of 2010.") and a football analogy ("It's taken longer than some of us hoped at the kickoff, but now the goal line is in sight.")
WHAT ARE DEAL LAWYERS WORTH? | A new study suggests that "many of the legal minutiae" involved in mergers and acquisitions "are not worth it," writes Reynolds Holding in Reuters Breakingviews. That conclusion is based on the finding that stock prices of target companies "remain essentially unchanged when contract details are disclosed." DealBook's Deal Professor, Steven M. Davidoff, challenged that argument. "It is quite clear that M&A terms matter. Just ask T-Mobile," he wrote on Twitter. But he added that investors betting on deals perhaps "don't quite appreciate this."

HEADLINE: Regulators Postpone Some Basel Rules

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: United States regulators said on Friday they were postponing a significant part of the financial regulatory overhaul after banks said they would not be ready for the new rules. 

 BODY:
United States regulators said Friday they were postponing a significant part of the financial regulatory overhaul after banks said they would not be ready for the new rules. 
The regulators proposed the rules in June as part of an international effort to harmonize the global financial system. Smaller banks immediately objected to the proposals, saying they would be too costly and might deter them from making loans. 
Some of the rules were supposed to take effect at the beginning of next year, but regulators have decided a delay makes sense. The rules stem from internationally agreed standards adopted by a body called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
 "In light of the volume of comments received and the wide range of views expressed during the comment period, the agencies do not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on January 1, 2013," said a statement from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
United States regulators are in agreement about most parts of the Basel overhaul, according to two people familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not public. The main sticking point appears to be whether to exempt smaller banks from some of the rules. One senior official said the agencies were planning to postpone the rules only briefly. 
Regulators may have initially been caught off guard by the level of opposition to the Basel rules among smaller banks. Last month, an industry group called the Independent Community Bankers of America said that "nearly 15,000 community bankers and their allies" had signed a petition against the rules. In particular, the community banks don't like Basel measures that would make banks hold bigger loss buffers, or capital, against mortgages. 
In recent months, regulators have expressed sympathy for the concerns of smaller banks. In a speech on Friday, a Federal Reserve governor, Elizabeth A. Duke, suggested that smaller banks should have separate rules for mortgages. 
The Basel rules demand more capital for mortgages with features that might make them less likely to get repaid. Community bank mortgages to individuals have some of those features. Even so, Ms. Duke noted that community banks had losses on such mortgages in the financial crisis that were far below those on subprime loans. 
"I am convinced that the best course for policymakers would be to abandon efforts for a 'one size fits all' approach to mortgage lending," she said.
But regulators face a real headache in deciding which banks should be subject to which mortgage rules. Too many exemptions could prompt smaller banks to make too many risky loans. While smaller banks may not have had huge problems with mortgages to individuals, many such firms collapsed under the weight of losses on loans made to borrowers who bought land and business properties. 
In her speech, Ms. Duke appeared to acknowledge the risks. "Crafting regulations to address the real problems that occurred in subprime lending without creating punitive burdens on community banks may prove to be quite difficult," she said.
Notably, the delay announced Friday does not apply to the Basel rules on Wall Street trading operations that regulators finalized in June. 
In addition, most large banks already have enough capital to meet the Basel capital requirements that come into effect on Jan. 1. However, they haven't amassed all the capital that they will need by the end of the Basel phase-in period, which extends till the end of 2018.
Some advocates of stronger regulation said they hoped the delay on Friday wouldn't lead to exemptions for large banks. 
"There are few things more important in financial reform than increasing capital at large banks," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that has pressed for a tough financial system overhaul.

HEADLINE: Price Is Major Factor for Electric Vehicles, Study Says

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Of current electric car owners, 44 percent said the top benefit of their vehicles was lower emissions. 

 BODY:
Money talks. And unless automakers can make a better economic case to consumers who are considering an all-electric vehicle, like the Nissan Leaf, or a plug-in electric, like the Chevrolet Volt, these alternative-fuel vehicles will remain a very small part of the market in the United States.
That is one of the conclusions in the J.D. Power & Associates 2012 Electric Vehicle Ownership Experience Study. The study, the first on this topic by J.D. Power, looks at what consumers experience as they consider these vehicles, shop for them and own them, as well as the expectations and concerns of current and future owners.
For current owners, the early adopters, the decision to buy an alternative-fuel vehicle was more of an emotional one, said Neal Oddes, senior director of the green practice at J.D. Power, a market research firm. Of current owners, 44 percent said the top benefit of their vehicles was lower emissions. Those owners were more willing to pay a premium for their vehicles.
But future buyers are more pragmatists than idealists. Of future buyers, 11 percent said they would consider an electric vehicle for its environmental benefits, but 45 percent said they were interested in saving on fuel.
The people who shopped for an electric vehicle and ultimately decided not to buy one said their primary reason was the price, Mr. Oddes said in a telephone interview.
"The only way to address the price is by improving the technology to reduce the overall cost of the vehicle," Mr. Oddes said. "The manufacturers have a huge task to be able to do that." But once they do, electric vehicles will go mass market.
Electric vehicles account for less than 1 percent of new-vehicle sales in the United States, according to LMC Automotive, J.D. Power's automotive forecasting partner.
The study, conducted in October, was based on online responses from more than 7,600 consumers who either own an electric vehicle, are considering buying one or shopped for one but decided not to buy.
Current owners said recharging their vehicles' batteries increased their monthly electric bills by $18, much less than the estimated $147 they would have paid for gasoline during that same period.
However, the study found that consumers paid on average $10,000 more to buy all-electric models and $16,000 more on average for plug-in hybrids.
Based on the annual fuel savings, it would take an average of 6.5 years for an all-electric vehicle owner to break even and 11 years for a plug-in hybrid owner to break even.
That premium does not take into account the current federal income tax credit of up to $7,500.
All owners in the study got a rebate, Mr. Oddes said, "and if it wasn't for those rebates I think the market would be a lot worse."
The study found that one-third of owners used a standard 120-volt outlet to charge their vehicles at home rather than installing a special 240-volt charging station at an average cost of $1,500. However, of those who did install a charging station, 43 percent got it at no cost.
Among people who are considering an electric vehicle, the study found that driving range and the availability of charging stations were the top concerns.
Following price as a reason for not buying an E.V. is vehicle size. Most consumers who are considering electric vehicles are looking for midsize sedans and, currently at least, most of the vehicles are smaller. Third is a concern over the reliability of alternative-fuel vehicles.

HEADLINE: Movin' Out

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Over the last year, household formation has been picking up. 

 BODY:
Almost exactly a year ago I wrote an article about how tortoise-slow growth in household formation was hurting the economy. Unemployed new high school and college graduates were staying with their parents rather than moving into homes of their own, thereby depriving the economy of all the spending and hiring that goes along with setting up new digs. Under normal circumstances, each time a household is formed it adds about $145,000 to output that year as the spending ripples through the economy, according to an estimate last year from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
Over the last year, though, household formation has been picking up. Here's a look at the change in the number of households in the United States in a given month compared to the same month a year earlier:
As you can see, household growth is still volatile, but it has been trending upward. The pickup is probably related to job growth, which has enabled multigenerational households to spin off into multiple new homes. 
"We're slowly but steadily improving, with more job opportunities in particular for younger households," Mr. Zandi said. "They can only live with their parents for so long. There are powerful centrifugal forces in those households, on both side. As soon as they have a chance to get out, many will take it."
Hiring growth, in particular growth in construction, may also be attracting more immigrants, although we don't have data yet to support this.
Mr. Zandi said that while household formation has picked up, it's still below what the demographics suggest it should be, meaning that the "household gap" -- the difference between how many households exist and how many there should be based on demographics -- is widening. 
"Years' worth of households that have been pent up will be unleashed in the next few years," he predicted. "That's one reason why I'm more optimistic than some other people about G.D.P. growth in the next few years. As we move to the mid-part of the decade, I think those households will get formed and that will power a lot of housing construction and consumption."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $8,442,899

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: The last of the sought-after trio of penthouse sponsor units has sold at One Thirty West 12, the luxury condominium conversion at a former residence for nurses on the St. Vincent's Hospital campus, 

 BODY:
The last of the sought-after trio of penthouse sponsor units at One Thirty West 12, the wildly popular (and sold-out) luxury condominium conversion at a former residence for nurses on the St. Vincent's Hospital campus, sold for $8,442,899, the most expensive sale of the week according to city records.
Similar to its slightly smaller sister unit, No. 11A, a duplex bought by Rosie O'Donnell, No. 11B is on the 11th and 12th floors and was marketed as a penthouse due to its spacious terrace and proximity to the classic floor-through penthouse with wraparound terraces that occupies the building's actual top floor, the 13th. That 3,800-square-foot trophy penthouse is owned by the fashion mogul Andrew Rosen of Theory. 
According to sales listings posted by the building, the buyer of 11B also bought No. 11C, a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath unit with a small terrace, in a separate transaction for $5.75 million, ostensibly for the purpose of combining the units, but that sale has not yet appeared in city records.
The identity of the duplex buyer, a non-boldface-type, was shielded by a limited-liability company, 130 W12 11B. The new owner is definitely not the actress Cameron Diaz, who lost No. 11A to Ms. O'Donnell.
One highlight of 11B, which has five bedrooms and four and a half baths, is the 435-square-foot terrace at the east end of the living room, with its stunning open views of the cityscape. The library, too, faces east; the eat-in kitchen offers northward views of the Empire State Building. The upper floor of the 3,438-square-foot apartment is its private wing, containing four bedrooms and three baths.
The conversion of the prewar brick building at 130 West 12th Street by Rudin Management had attracted a flurry of buyers and a lengthy waiting list.
The 1941 structure was transformed by Cook + Fox Architects, which did the interior and exterior makeover; the lobby and model apartments were designed by Jed Johnson Associates. The combination of subtle, high-end finishes and a prime West Village address was apparently catnip to buyers willing to cope with less-than-loftlike ceiling heights: the ceilings top out just over eight feet.
The team of Alexa Lambert and Sean Turner of Stribling & Associates coordinated the sales of the sponsor units.
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Around Odd-Even License Plate Rules, a History of Impatience

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: New York City drivers have had to contend with gas rationing before though not as a result of a natural disaster. 

 BODY:
The last time New York City had odd-even gasoline purchase rules, they were in effect for 79 days, and the time before that, 65 days.
 This time, the reasons were different. Fuel distribution was disrupted by Hurricane Sandy - among other things, the storm forced tankers bound for the New York area to wait it out and stay beyond the reach of its punishing winds. Also, many service stations had gasoline but no electricity after the storm, so their pumps could not function.
In 1973, the Arab oil embargo choked supplies nationwide. In 1979, a new government took power during the Iranian revolution, and fresh supply worries set off panic buying and long lines at gas stations. There were fistfights at some stations as drivers tried to cut in line. At least one driver was arrested for pulling a gun on a gas station attendant who would not fill his car, with odd-numbered plates, on an even-numbered day.
 "It was hectic," recalled Stanley Gaj, who in 1979 was the manager of a filling station at Queens Boulevard and Albion Avenue in Elmhurst, Queens. "It was chaotic. We opened up at I think 6 or 7 in the morning, and we only stayed open until we ran out. When we ran out, that was it until the next day." (Mr. Gaj, who now lives in Middle Village, Queens, said that he left the station in the mid-1980s and became a bus driver.) 
 The odd-even sales began in mid-June of 1979 after weeks of long lines. They ended on Sept. 6 after officials decided there was finally enough fuel on hand to be certain there would be no more panic buying. Gasoline became widely available again in midsummer after the price passed $1.50 a gallon. It had been less than $1 at the beginning of 1979, before Iran suspended oil exports.
In May of that year, President Jimmy Carter gave governors the power to regulate gasoline sales in their states. That included the power to impose odd-even systems. Three weeks later, Gov. Hugh L. Carey announced an odd-even plan for the city and four suburban counties - Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland. New Jersey and Connecticut soon followed suit.
Mr. Carey had been under pressure from Mayor Edward I. Koch, who called the gas lines and supply problems "intolerable." That mirrored the situation five years earlier, when Mayor Abraham D. Beame called the outlook "desperate" and threatened to start allocating gasoline himself if the state did not. 
The governor at the time, Malcolm Wilson, initially resisted, saying he did not want to force "governmental regulation upon our citizens and upon our businesses until every alternative has been exhausted." 
He relented in February 1974, saying the gasoline emergency was endangering public health and safety.
Mr. Wilson ended the odd-even plan in May after federal energy officials increased the amount of gasoline available in New York. 
The odd-even rules currently in effect brought back memories for New Yorkers old enough to remember the earlier rounds. Robert Sinclair Jr., now a spokesman for AAA New York, remembered a conversation with a cousin in 1979. 
"He was supposed to take this girl out," he said, "but she didn't appreciate how hard it was to get gasoline. He was done with her."

HEADLINE: Britain Examines 4,000 HSBC Accounts in a Tax Haven

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The British tax authorities said Friday that they were investigating HSBC accounts on the British island of Jersey. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The British tax authorities said on Friday that they were looking into a list of HSBC clients with bank accounts in the tax haven of Jersey, a development that adds to the bank's legal woes.
Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Britain's tax authority, is investigating more than 4,000 accounts in Jersey that belong to British clients after receiving details from a whistle-blower. The list includes a drug dealer and a man convicted of possessing more than 300 weapons at his home in the south of England, The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London reported.
"We have received the data and we are studying it," a tax authority spokesman wrote in an e-mailed statement. "Clamping down on those who try to cheat the system through evading taxes and over-claiming benefits is a top priority for us, and we value the information we receive from the public and business community."
Jersey, the largest island in the English Channel, is a British dependency with its own tax system.
HSBC, Britain's largest bank, is already part of an investigation into money laundering. The bank said earlier this month that it set aside an additional $800 million to cover potential fines from the money laundering case, bringing the total to $1.5 billion. The bank, which is negotiating a settlement with the American authorities, added that the actual fine could be even bigger.
In addition, HSBC, like other major British banks, has had to set aside cash to reimburse British customers who were sold inappropriate insurance products.
HSBC said Friday in a statement that the bank was "investigating the reports of an alleged loss of certain client data in Jersey as a matter of urgency." HSBC said it had not yet been informed of any investigation but would fully cooperate with the authorities. "HSBC remains fully committed to adoption of the highest global standards, including the procedures for the acceptance of clients," it said.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has made the crackdown on tax evaders a priority for a government under pressure to increase revenue and reduce the budget deficit. After the financial crisis, banks face greater scrutiny from the authorities worldwide about how they conduct their business.
HSBC's management was forced to apologize publicly for the problems that weighed on its earnings and share price as recently as Monday and has already started to change its compliance and oversight functions.
The money laundering scandal began when the United States Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused HSBC of allowing some of its executives to let illegal behavior go unchecked for nine years, until 2010. In one example, the bank provided financing to Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, even though some of the bank's owners were linked to the financing of terrorism, according to the Senate report.
HSBC clients are also on another list that was in the spotlight this month. Kostas Vaxevanis, editor of the investigative magazine Hot Doc, was acquitted last week on charges of breaching privacy laws when he published a list of more than 2,000 Greeks believed to hold accounts at a Geneva branch of HSBC. The list was given to the Greek authorities two years ago by Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister and now managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to help the government in Athens investigate evasion.

HEADLINE: Science Panel Warns Spy Agencies Are in the Dark on Risks from Warming

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Spy agencies are warned by a science panel over murky forecasts of conflict in a warming world. 

 BODY:
For years, there's been a building chorus of warnings on the looming prospect of "climate conflict" and "global warring" that might be set off as greenhouse-driven warming disrupts longstanding weather patterns in already-turbulent parts of the world (think sub-Saharan Africa) or rising seas dislocate coastal populations (think Bangladesh).
Some studies have found relationships between natural climate cycles and conflict. But a recent University of Colorado study, while finding a link between periods of high temperatures and pulses of regional violence in East Africa, also concludes that other social and political factors still, by far, are the dominant drivers of unrest and violence. (The image at right, using data from that paper, maps the relationship over several decades in East Africa between unusual heat, on the horizontal axis, and conflict rates on the vertical. See the caption for details.) 
And of course there's still substantial uncertainty in climate models at the regional scale in war-prone places (again, a prime example is the set of countries along the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert, where models still clash on which areas will grow drier or wetter; see my Somalia posts.)
One fact is clear, according to a report issued today by a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences at the behest of United States intelligence agencies: The country lacks the capacity to clarify what lies ahead as greenhouse heating continues, so gird for surprises. 
Here are a few conclusions and recommendations from the report, titled "Climate and Social Stress: Implications for Security Analysis": 
Scientific evidence indicates that the global climate is moving outside the bounds of past experience and can be expected to put new stresses on societies around the world, prompting examination of a variety of plausible scenarios through which climate change might pose or alter security risks for the United States.
 Conclusions 
Given the available scientific knowledge of the climate system, it is prudent for security analysts to expect climate surprises in the coming decade, including unexpected and potentially disruptive single events as well as conjunctions of events occurring simultaneously or in sequence, and for them to become progressively more serious and more frequent thereafter, most likely at an accelerating rate. The climate surprises may affect particular regions or globally integrated systems, such as grain markets, that provide for human well-being....
It is prudent to expect that over the course of a decade some climate events-including single events, conjunctions of events occurring simultaneously or in sequence in particular locations, and events affecting globally integrated systems that provide for human well-being-will produce consequences that exceed the capacity of the affected societies or global systems to manage and that have global security implications serious enough to compel international response. It is also prudent to expect that such consequences will become more common further in the future....
The links between climate events and security outcomes are complex, contingent, and not understood nearly well enough to allow for prediction. However, the key linkages, as with societal disruptions, seem prominently to involve (a) exposures to potentially disruptive events directly or through globally integrated systems affecting human well-being and (b) vulnerabilities (i.e., susceptibility to harm and the effectiveness of coping, response, and recovery efforts). In addition, security outcomes depend on the reactions of social and political systems to actual or perceived inadequacies of response.

Recommendations 
The U.S. government should begin immediately to develop a systematic and enduring whole-of-government strategy for monitoring threats connected to climate change. This strategy should be developed along with the development of priorities and support for research....
For the great majority of existing and potential indicators, the required spatial and temporal resolution is finer than what is currently available. High-resolution monitoring will be especially important for highly significant and highly vulnerable locations. The appropriate level of spatial and temporal resolution for indicators varies, however, with the substantive domain. In setting priorities for indicator development and improvement, the intelligence community should take into account the gaps between the existing and the desired resolution and should invest in improved resolution of those indicators judged to be the most needed and the most useful in places of concern...
The intelligence community should establish a system of periodic "stress testing" for countries, regions, and critical global systems regarding their ability to manage potentially disruptive climate events of concern. Stress tests would focus on potentially disruptive conjunctions of climate events and socioeconomic and political conditions.
In many ways, the state of knowledge on the role of climate change in driving societal disasters (wars and unrest) is similar to that of its role in driving meteorological disasters (particularly hurricanes). 
And the prescription remains the same: 
Unabated emissions of greenhouse gases are bound to cause trouble in an era of peak human populations and appetites, so efforts to shift from energy menus dominated by fossil fuels are a very good idea. 
But working aggressively to limit other drivers of risk (poverty, vulnerable agriculture and water systems) is also a prime imperative, as is boosting the capacity to watch for and recognize warning signs (there's more on that here).
1:26 p.m. | Update 
David Victor, a climate policy researcher at the University of California, San Diego, sent these thoughts: 
I am sure that the security and intelligence communities are under-prepared for risks from climate warming as this topic doesn't map well on to how knowledge is organized and assessed in those communities. That said, I think there are two key points in all this. 
First is that it is highly unlikely that climate warming, alone, will have substantial direct effects on hot wars and other national security risks. Looking across the totality of the evidence, what we see is that the climate variables tend to be weaker predictors of security troubles than other factors, like ethnic divisions, failed states, war in neighboring states that spills over, etc. Climate might have an impact on those driving forces (e.g., severe weather affecting crop failures, which in turn affects political stability), but even there the direct role of climate is usually small compared with other factors. The PNAS paper makes a key point: "These precipitation and temperature effects are statistically significant but have modest influence in terms of predictive power in a model with political, economic, and physical geographic predictors. Large variations in the climate-conflict relationships are evident between the nine countries of the study region and across time periods."
My interpretation of this is that if the security and intelligence communities want to get serious about anticipating and responding to climate-related factors they shouldn't create special divisions that deal with climate. Rather, they should integrate climate into existing country- and region-specific assessments. That's because the country and regional variables (probably country variables) swamp the climate. The recommendation of "stress testing" is a good one-assuming that the stress tests are done by the folks who have serious local knowledge of the countries in question. The recommendation that this approach be "whole government" (drawing on the government's excellent climate science skills) is wise, but one thing will become really clear quickly. What the security and intelligence communities want from the science isn't actually possible. At best we are working a) in the realm of probabilities and tendencies (a point you make about impacts in Africa), which is not unlike other analytical challenges that the security and intelligence communities face, albeit one steeped in a lot more uncertainty; and b) in the realm of very coarse resolution, which is a huge problem. Even something like sea level rise requires pretty fine grained analysis if one is to discern possible implications for security. 
Second, I suspect that the slowness with which climate has diffused into the security and intelligence communities is not entirely irrational. This community is constantly facing claims that some new threat is "redefining" security and requires that the old play books be thrown out. And in many respects climate change (and environmental degradation) is just another one of those claims. There's a reality to all this, but also a huge amount of hype. and in the security/intelligence community, where most of what you do is deal with near term threats because the more distant future is so hard to manage, these environmental issues are seen as long on noise and short on signal. I don't do this kind of work on a daily basis, but a few years ago I wrote a review essay on "resource wars" [ The National Interest ] and found that, for the most part, claims that resource competition would transform security and creates hordes of new dangers were bunk. They were more the product of a threat industry-a group of folks whose motivations are to find dangers in the world and use them to advance some cause-than serious analysis. The same is probably true for climate. What we see is a high ratio of whats/possibles/tendencies to actual robust analysis of cause-and-effect relationships.

HEADLINE: Week in Review: On Wall Street, a New Tone With Old Tactics

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: An analysis of President Obama's tough choices on housing. | On Wall Street, its time to mend fences with the president. | Andrew Ross Sorkin said that the election won't solve all puzzles. | A big bets soured, imperiling a small firm. | A deal maker for Morgan Stanley was eased out. | HSBC may face charges in a laundering inquiry. 

 BODY:
WEEK IN VERSE Mitt Romney told Parade that he enjoys The Killers. Now he can listen to them perform "Mr. Brightside."
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
After sharing a group hug on Wednesday morning, financiers have moved on to appraising the ramifications of four more years with a president that they have vilified.
With the balance of power unchanged, major changes in financial regulation are unlikely. 
 New faces won't necessarily mean new tactics. At the Financial Services Roundtable, Steve Bartlett's Dallas twang will be replaced by the Tim Pawlenty's southern Minnesotan drawl. But the strategy of attacking parts of Dodd-Frank, rather that its entirety, is expected to remain.
"A central goal, lobbyists say, is to tame unfinished rules that rein in derivatives trading," Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported. "Wall Street, in particular, is preparing a lobbying frenzy over plans to apply derivatives rules to American banks trading overseas."
Other efforts by banking lobbyists that will play out over President Obama's second term include:

        
Lawsuits by business trade groups against parts of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule.
        
Attempts to influence the selection of more Wall Street-friendly regulators, including the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
It may take several years to reveal the impact of these efforts to roll back financial regulation and even an apparrent victory could have unforeseen consequences. Wall Street, for example, has been able sway Mr. Obama's selection of regulators in the past. His first choice to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was pushed back by Republicans and is now the senator-elect from Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Common Core Practice | Sandy Beaches, Instagram Election Photos and Peter Rabbit

BYLINE: SARAH GROSS, JONATHAN OLSEN and MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: Our three tasks this week involve informational writing about beach replenishment, narrative writing about Election Day photographs and argumentative writing about classic books and the curriculum. 

 BODY:
Though thanks to Hurricane Sandy our New Jersey classroom collaborators are still out of school, their teachers, Sarah Gross and Jonathan Olsen, came up with three new tasks this week for our series anyway - Mr. Olsen working mostly from a Starbucks since his own power has been out for days now. 
If you're just tuning in, each Friday we publish three short writing ideas that address Common Core Standards and that are grounded in New York Times content. On weeks when superstorms have not closed their school, these prompts are classroom-tested by Mr. Olsen and Ms. Gross's ninth-grade humanities students. 
Tell us what you think, and how you use The Times to teach and learn.
 Common Core Practice Tasks | Week of Nov. 5-9, 2012 
 Informational and Argumentative Writing 
Science Times: "Costs of Shoring Up Coastal Communities"
Common Core Standards: R1, R4, RI5, RI10, W2, W4, W9, W10, RH2, RH10
 Sun, sand and surf - the quintessential ingredients of a summer vacation. 
In New Jersey, many towns rely on tourists to improve their economy. To attract tourists, these towns make all reasonable attempts to preserve their coastline and even extend it. Many areas replenish beaches with sand from the ocean floor, but some scientists are now saying that practice should be stopped.
 Your Task: In a paragraph, summarize why many shore-area towns make the decision to replenish their beaches. Be sure to include at least three reasons in your response that use evidence from the article. 
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Develop a topic sentence and make a list of the reasons shore towns replenish their beaches.
        
Choose the three best reasons to focus on in your paragraph.
        
Make a list of what someone arguing against this practice, especially post-Hurricane Sandy, might say.
 Extension Activity 
For Ms. Gross and Mr. Olsen's students, this is a personal issue. The roller coaster pictured above is about 40 minutes from their school and many of their students live in towns that replenish their beaches often. Those towns will be debating this issue for months (and maybe years) to come. What do you think? Write a letter to the editor explaining your thoughts, and use evidence from the article in your response.
 Narrative Writing 
Politics: "Instagramming the Election"
Common Core Standards: RI7, RI10, W3, W4, W6, W10, RH4, RH7, RH10
 On Tuesday, voters re-elected Barack Obama president of the United States. The New York Times asked voters to share images they took during Election Day on Instagram under the hashtag #NYTelection. Americans from across the country responded, posting their photos with short captions. 
 Your Task: Look through the snapshots from Instagram posted on The New York Times site. Find a photo you think is interesting because it tells you something about America, democracy or Election Day. Write a one-paragraph first-person narrative about what is going on in the image from the perspective of the photographer, based on evidence you see in the photograph.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Select a photograph that captures your attention but that also has enough detail to tell a story.
        
Use your imagination to fill in details you are not sure of, such as who the people in the photograph are, where the image was taken and what inspired the photographer to take the picture. Use your senses - what were they seeing, smelling and hearing?
        
Remember that first-person requires the use of any of these pronouns: I, me, myself, my, mine, we, us, ourselves, our and ours. 
 Extension Activity 

        
Find something in your town or school that you think embodies what America is about. In one paragraph, explain why you chose that item. What makes it "American" to you?
        
Post a photo of the object to #art4me, the New Jersey class's art initiative on Twitter and Instagram.
 Argumentative Writing 
Art & Design: "Letters From Flopsy's Real-Life Playmate"
Common Core Standards: RI10, W1, W4, W9, W10, RH8, RH10
 Did you grow up listening to the stories of Peter Rabbit and Tom Kitten? Beatrix Potter, the author, was also a naturalist, artist and letter writer. 
"Beatrix Potter: The Picture Letters" is a new exhibit at the Morgan Library and Museum and includes 115 objects, including 22 illustrated letters that Potter wrote to children during her lifetime. Edward Rothstein, the journalist reviewing the exhibition, writes that he was not a fan of Beatrix Potter's stories originally, but has grown to appreciate the author after viewing the items on display.
 Your Task: Think of a classic book, perhaps assigned in school, that many readers enjoy but you did not. In a paragraph, attempt to convince your school to remove that book from the curriculum. Be sure to give at least three reasons the book should no longer be read in class.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Talk to your classmates about Beatrix Potter. Did you listen to her stories growing up?
        
Make a list of books that are required reading in your English or Language Arts classes. Circle any books that you and your classmates did not enjoy.
        
Make a list of reasons that book should not continue to be part of the curriculum.
        
Consider the arguments that those who want to keep that book would make. How can you counter them?
 Extension Activity 
The Beatrix Potter exhibition includes 22 illustrated letters that Ms. Potter wrote to children. These letters provide a snapshot into her life and have been treasured since her death. Recently, Hurricane Sandy devastated many families in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Some of those families were given the opportunity to evacuate their homes before the storm hit but were only able to bring a few precious items with them. If you were in this situation, what would you save? 
Create a digital exhibition of your life, including items that show the world who you are the way Ms. Potter's letters do. You might take pictures of items, scan documents, or use screenshots. Put these together into an exhibit using a Web site like Animoto or Glogster. Then, write a journal entry about your exhibit. Why did you choose each item?

HEADLINE: In an Era of Fiscal Cliffs, Seeking Ways Obama Can Preserve the Planet, on a Budget

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Some ways President Obama can pursue environmental progress on a budget. 

 BODY:
Twice before on Dot Earth, I've offered and solicited ways in which President Obama could foster environmental progress on a budget:
2008: The President and the Planet, on a Budget
2011: Fostering Progress on a Finite (and Budget Strapped) Planet
Tight budgets are a reality for a long time to come given global financial pressures and negotiations over the "fiscal cliff" in the United States. So Men's Journal has asked me to assemble initiatives -- at various scales -- this administration could undertake in its second term to conserve open space and ecosystems, clean up water and air, limit deforestation or erosion, blunt emissions of greenhouse gases and the like. 
I've proposed the hashtag #ObamaEnv as a way to aggregate ideas on Twitter. Here's the feed:
Below are a few fresh thoughts from me, along with links to earlier Dot Earth ideas and comments that are still germane. What's on your list? 
 Closing the "yield gap." The glaring gap between the yields of basic crops in poor and rich countries offers huge low-cost opportunities to improve people's lives and cut environmental impacts from farming. The U.S. Agency for International Development is already busy in this area, but I'm sure some shifts in priorities could have a big impact.
 Expanding the shift from coal to gas. One of the biggest short-term gains on greenhouse gas emissions has come through the swift shift from coal to natural gas in the country's power plants. Rising gas prices may slow that transition here in the short run, but if Obama moves forward with carbon dioxide restrictions at power plants, that transition should be sustained. (Here's more on that from Daniel Lashof at the Natural Resources Defense Council.) A smart next step would be to work with China to foster a similar shift from coal to gas there, as well. Details are here: "Can China Follow U.S. Shift from Coal to Gas?"
This is from 2010: 
 Two cents for an energy quest. Given pressure to reexamine taxes, it may be time to revisit a modest proposal that I posted in 2010 in "A 2-Cent Solution to Help Fuel an Energy Quest":
In seeking ways to propel America's 21st-century energy quest, President Obama cast a wide net in his Oval Office address. But he can start really close to home, just around the corner from the White House at the New Executive Office Building, in his own Office of Science and Technology Policy.
John P. Holdren, the science adviser to the president, has sometimes been attacked for signing on to catastrophic forecasts of population-driven doom as a young researcher. But I haven't seen anyone undercut his cogent arguments, articulated for many years, laying out the logic for a sustained boost in scientific and engineering enterprise related to energy.
One of his most useful papers on energy innovation was published in the journal Innovations in 2006: "The Energy Innovation Imperative: Addressing Oil Dependence, Climate Change, and Other 21st Century Energy Challenges." That paper was a central source for my 2006 article describing the country's longstanding, and bipartisan, abandonment of energy research and development after the last pulse of the oil crisis of the 1970s.
One of the take-home lines?
"A tripling of the federal government's expenditures on energy technology R.D. & D. could be financed with a increase of about 2 cents per gallon in the federal tax on gasoline."
Here's one reader's idea from 2008:
 Changing what's measured, and how. Mike Roddy:
1. Monitor long term soil productivity, expressed as the land's ability to sustain life as well as agriculture. This would apply to farmland, prairie, and forest. Include measurements of CO2 emissions and public health. Then, implement a national policy that strives toward approximate equilibrium, instead of the current trend of toxic degradation.
2. Calculate the environmental externalities of all power production technologies, including CO2 and pollution. Put a price on them, and see that energy policy reflects these costs.
3. Modern industrial civilization is not "sustainable": this is a meaningless goal, due to the law of entropy. Instead, develop equations that measure durability and environmental degradation for consumer products, including housing and transportation. Then, see that government policies encourage responsible living, instead of the opposite.
Here are two items from my 2008 post that are still relevant:

Defense and development: The Pentagon has recently made fostering stability in turbulent states a top priority, on a par with maintaining the capacity to wage war. What resources and initiatives in the military might be adjusted (without new money) to advance development? 

Defense and energy: The military also has the world's largest budget for basic research and development, to the tune of some $75 billion a year (we spend about $1 billion a year on all energy research, as I pointed out the other day). Military leaders already have energy efficiency as a top priority (much of the activity on a battlefield is focused on protecting fuel supplies). 
Consider this just a start and please weigh in, ideally with links to relevant sources of information.

HEADLINE: China's Economic Growth and American Fears

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: That China's strong economic growth greatly outpaces that of the United States should be no surprise and should cause no worries, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. 
Rummaging around my kitchen counter, where a huge pile of "to be read" material tends to accumulate, I recently came across the Aug. 27 issue of Newsweek. Its cover features President Obama and the headline "Hit the Road, Barack," with the subtitle "Why We Need a New President." The cover page draws attention to a partisan political tract inside the magazine by the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson.
Others have already subjected Professor Ferguson's tract to searing fact-checks. What caught my eye, however, and what invites further comment, is the fear Professor Ferguson seeks to strike in the hearts of Americans over the prospect of rapid economic growth in China, relative to American growth. 
It seems to be a common theme in this country, especially as our economy is only gradually emerging from a period of nationwide deleveraging that is achieved through lower spending and hence lower economic growth, and especially when that lower growth is compared with previous periods in which economic growth was significantly abetted by excessive debt financing all around.
Professor Ferguson opines:
The failures of leadership on economic and fiscal policy over the past four years have had geopolitical consequences. The World Bank expects the U.S. to grow by just 2 percent in 2012. China will grow four times faster than that; India three times faster. By 2017, the International Monetary Fund predicts, the G.D.P. of China will overtake that of the United States.

He supports his position with appeal to a graph, which I have recreated below, based on data put online in April 2012 by the International Monetary Fund. I have added a line for the European Union (the brown line), as distinct from the euro zone (the purple line). The lines express purchasing-power-parity dollars. 
So what do readers make of Professor Ferguson's commentary? What in his graph should strike fear in our hearts? Should we all lapse into deep national mourning and fly our flags at half-staff when the red line in the graph pierces the back line? 
In any case, short of fervently praying that China's economy somehow meets adversity or even collapses, is there, in fact, much that an American president can do about this prospect, other than, perhaps, moving that fateful date a year or two up or down the time line? Should that become a national purpose for America?
I would remind readers - and Professor Ferguson - that the size of the population matters in cross-country comparisons of the sort exhibited in his graph. According to the I.M.F. data, the United States population in 2012 is about 315 million and China's about 1.35 billion, that is, 4.3 times as large. The corresponding figures for 2017 are 330 million and 1.39 billion, or a ratio of 1 to 4.21. Economists would take it into account in cross-national comparisons of G.D.P., and historians should as well.
The next graph adjusts for size of population by restating the first graph on a per-capita basis. An entirely different picture emerges. 
Note in particular China's relatively low per-capita G.D.P., now and in the foreseeable future. Should Americans be worried that after centuries of mass poverty in China, more and more of its citizens will finally escape poverty? 
And what about the differential growth rates that Professor Ferguson cites? China's and India's 2012 economic growth rates are projected by the I.M.F. as multiples of America's rate of economic growth. Are we to be shocked by it?
Economies do not grow at high exponential rates forever. It is more reasonable to assume that they tend to grow along some variant of what mathematicians call a logistic curve, as illustrated in the graph below. 
China, India and other emerging market economies are still on the relatively steep segment of this curve. They have yet to build the extensive infrastructure that the highly developed Western economies already enjoy, including an abundance of world-class educational and health care systems, residential housing for all stocked with modern appliances, automobiles, entertainment venues and so on. 
In meeting that pent-up demand for investment and consumption goods, the emerging economies can draw more or less freely on sophisticated technology developed over time and at great expense by the advanced economies, including the latter's intellectual property, their pool of highly skilled human capital and their academies. America's universities teem with students from the emerging market economies, notably from Asia and especially in science and engineering. 
Small wonder then that the emerging market economies now experience rapid economic growth, not even to dwell upon the huge exports their abundant and still relatively cheap labor makes possible. 
The more mature and highly developed economies now tend to be positioned somewhere on the upper and flatter segment of the economic growth curve. I draw readers' attention to a fascinating paper by Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, "Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts Six Headwinds." The abstract alone is worth a quick read. 
As Professor Gordon asserts, major innovations -- such as the invention and development of the combustion engine, electricity, indoor water and sanitation, chemicals and new materials during the second industrial revolution starting in the 1870s -- can lead to bursts of rapid economic growth. Such innovations can shift up the entire curve shown in the graph above. Rapid growth ensues as economies transit from a lower to a higher growth curve. 
But such innovations do not support rapid economic growth forever. Absent major new bursts of significant innovation, Professor Gordon contends, mature economies are apt to settle down to relatively slower growth along a given growth curve.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Health Care

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
President Obama's re-election all but guarantees the future of his health care law, sending many states scrambling to comply with an important deadline. The next challenge? Making it work, Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear report.

        
In the wake of Mitt Romney's loss, his aides have begun considering what the restless chief executive will do next. Michael Barbaro takes a look at the potential paths, including writing a book or taking a leadership role in the Mormon Church.

        
Acting on the postelection sense of urgency to strike a deal averting the so-called fiscal cliff, lawmakers said Thursday that they were already moving on the issue, which could come to a climax early next year when major tax increases and spending cuts go into effect in the absence of an agreement, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
Iran fired on a military surveillance drone flying over the Persian Gulf last week, igniting a strong protest to the Iranian government and raising questions about the administration's failure to disclose the incident, Thom Shanker and Rick Gladstone report.

        
The government is coming dangerously close to being unable to finance its deficits, with the Treasury Department expecting the United States will hit its"debt ceiling"near the end of the year. In addition to the so-called fiscal cliff, Congress will have to face this issue soon, Annie Lowrey reports.
 Washington Happenings: 

        
Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday. Later, Mr. Obama will speak from the White House about encouraging economic growth and reducing the deficit.

HEADLINE: Boehner Digs In on Opposition to Tax Hikes for Wealthy

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Speaker John A. Boehner claimed his own mandate with the re-election of a House Republican majority but expressed confidence that any deal he can reach with President Obama will get through the conservative House. 

 BODY:
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio dug in Friday on his opposition to raising tax rates on the rich, claiming his own mandate with the re-election of a House Republican majority but expressing confidence that any deal he can reach with President Obama can get through the conservative House.
"When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem getting it passed here in the House," he told reporters. Some House Republicans have already warned him against cutting a deal without seeking their approval first.
Any agreement to avert a fiscal crisis in January when hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts kick in now revolves around the definition of tax increases. Mr. Boehner is holding the line against any increase in tax rates, even for the richest Americans that currently are in the 35 percent tax bracket. But he is leaving open the possibility of a reformed tax code that does raise more revenue than the existing code.
"It's clear that there are a lot of special interest loopholes in the tax code, both corporate and personal," he said. "It's also clear that there are all kinds of deductions, some of which make sense, others don't. And by lowering rates and cleaning up the tax code, we know we're going to get more economic growth."
Democrats say they will not accept a deal that just counts on economic growth to produce more revenues. Taxes on the rich must go up, they say. Otherwise spending cuts and changes to programs like Medicare will be borne completely by the poor and middle class. Because President Obama won re-election on a clear platform that called for higher taxes on the rich, Democrats believe they have a mandate to push their position.
But Mr. Boehner said he has a mandate as well.
"There's a Republican majority here in the House," he said. "The American people re-elected a Republican majority, and I'm proud of the fact that our team in a very difficult year was able to maintain our majority."
That majority is a fractious one. Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana, conceded that some moderate Republicans are ready to give in to Mr. Obama on tax increases for the rich, but he said conservatives are not.
"A majority of Americans thought it was just fine to raise taxes on higher income people, but that's more of an emotional response, more 'I'm in pain, I want someone else to pay,'" he conceded in an interview. But, he added, "how does that solve America's problems? That's counterproductive to go down that road."

HEADLINE: A First Look at Second Term Obama

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: He did not reveal himself as a Kenyan socialist eager to pillage the economy. 

 BODY:
We got our first look today at Second Term Obama and - shock - he did not reveal himself as a Kenyan socialist eager to pillage the economy.
In the East Room of the White House, he was the same centrist Democrat he has always been - only a little tougher sounding.
Mr. Obama said he was open to negotiation, compromise and "new ideas." But then he made it clear that he would not sign a deficit agreement that does not raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
In fact, he challenged the House to pass a bill, right now, extending the Bush tax cuts on incomes under $250,000 a year. "I've got the pen ready to sign the bill right away," he said, pulling one out of his jacket pocket. "I'm ready to do it."

"We can't just cut our way to prosperity," he said. "If we are serious about reducing the deficit we have to combine spending cuts with revenue and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes."
His word choice here is worth noting, and maybe worth worrying about. Mr. Obama said "taxes," not "tax rates," and he used the word "revenue." For Republicans, as House Speaker John Boehner made clear today, "revenue" consists of tax reform that closes loopholes and keeps rates low, especially on the rich, on the theory that the economy will then grow, which means more people will pay more taxes to the government. It's an old, tired and repeatedly disproven concept.
But for now let's assume that's not what Mr. Obama meant. Other statements were less ambiguous: "I'm not going to ask students and seniors and middle class families to pay down the deficit while people like me who make more than $250,000 are not asked to pay a dime more in taxes."
Significantly, the president emphasized that the issue of taxes "was a central question during the campaign." "On Tuesday," he said, "we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach."
Mr. Obama is not espousing an extremist left-wing philosophy: He's offering tax cuts for most people. He said today that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small business would get a break if Congress extends the under-$250,000 tax rate. (In fact he's offering an even better deal than he let on. Under Mr. Obama's plan, even the wealthiest Americans would enjoy a continued break on income up to $250,000. They just wouldn't get an additional break on income above that mark.)
You could argue, I suppose, that Mr. Obama should go into negotiations with a more lefty approach, so he has room to maneuver with the Republicans, who I'm sure will take a distinctly right-wing approach.
But that's not who he is. The Republicans' Scary Obama never existed. That reality has often infuriated his more liberal supporters (and it's often infuriated me), but it got him re-elected. Now let's see if it gets him the deal on taxes and spending that this country needs to keep growing.

HEADLINE: AT&T's Biggest Problems Aren't Emboldened Rivals, Chief Says

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: AT&#038;T's chief executive said that his biggest problem was not renewed competition from the likes of Sprint Nextel. Instead, he is focused on the need to improve the company's network and the uncertainty over the country's fiscal future 

 BODY:
With two potential mergers that could strengthen long-lagging competitors -- AT&T is under pressure to respond.
Earlier this week, the telecom giant set aside $14 billion to overhaul its networks, including an upgrade to the latest cellphone data standard. 
But the company's chief, Randall Stephenson, contends that a newly emboldened Sprint Nextel, which recently struck a major deal with SoftBank, didn't prompt the move. Rather, it was motivated by AT&T's failed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA.
 He faces other worries, too. Mr. Stephenson argued that the uncertainty over the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts and the potential reduction in government spending that could stem from automatic budget cuts set for year-end -- was a bigger threat to his business and his customers.
As for the changing industry landscape, Mr. Stephenson seems less concerned. Even with the SoftBank deal, Sprint, he contends, is largely playing catch up.
When SoftBank announced its plans to buy nearly three-quarters of Sprint earlier this fall, the Japanese company's founder, Masayoshi Son, promoted his history of taking on big incumbents in an industry, and winning. SoftBank entered the Japanese cellphone service market in 2006, and in that time snatched up enormous market share through marketing expertise and exclusive rights to popular devices like the iPhone. Now Mr. Son is hoping to use Sprint as a vehicle to do the same thing in the United States, taking on AT&T and Verizon. 
But Mr. Stephenson said in an interview earlier this week that he did not think much had changed in the American market so far. "It doesn't feel much different to me," he said.
He argued that the $8 billion in cash that SoftBank will pour into Sprint was necessary to help keep the third-place service provider in the game. But with Sprint further behind in building out a Long Term Evolution data network, the company significantly trails its larger competitors.
Mr. Stephenson pointed to his own company's plans as a sign of how expensive it is to keep up in the American cellphone race. The latest $14 billion investment comes on top of billions more that AT&T has already committed to spending on its network.
The plan was born of the collapse of the T-Mobile deal late last year, he said. Buying the smaller rival -- which now plans to merge with another service provider, MetroPCS -- was meant to give AT&T much-needed spectrum to upgrade to LTE. 
With that transaction's death, AT&T was forced to consider how it would acquire more spectrum, as well as how it would spend the enormous amount of cash on its books and deal with nonessential operations like a yellow pages business.
Mr. Stephenson said that he pulled aside one of his top operating executives and tasked him with finding an answer. What emerged was the $14 billion plan, an ambitious effort that includes bolstering AT&T's wired broadband offerings and putting its services into new areas like cars.
Earlier this year, AT&T also sold control of its yellow pages business to Cerberus Capital Management for about $950 million. 
The wired Internet assets nearly ended up on the auction block as well, Mr. Stephenson said. But after having had preliminary conversations with a number of potential buyers, the company opted instead to double-down on those operations. 
AT&T's moves should help expand its reach, including by bringing LTE service to potentially 300 million people. The company may also turn to smaller acquisitions, what Mr. Stephenson called "tuck-in" transactions that fall far short of the expansiveness of the T-Mobile deal.
"Scaled industry consolidations appear to be more difficult," he said. "Tuck-in acquisitions are doable."
(While he claimed to have moved on from the T-Mobile fracas, Mr. Stephenson betrayed some irritation with the government regulators that blocked the deal. "Our antitrust system is dysfunctional," he said, pointing to the dual roles played by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.)
Possible transactions, according to analysts and industry executives, include some sort of partnership with Dish Network, which has an abundance of spectrum, and Leap Wireless.
But of greater concern for now, Mr. Stephenson said, is resolving the potential tax increases that could arrive early next year. Despite his clashes with antitrust regulators, the AT&T chief offered some positive sentiments about a second Obama term.
"Maybe in the short run, this will be better for the fiscal cliff," he said, referring to the package of tax increases and budget cuts set for year-end, given that a newly re-elected president may have more negotiating leverage with Congress. 
Action is imperative, he argued, especially since AT&T's customers had already pulled back spending and investments in May and June because of the uncertainty over the fiscal situation.
"If you give businesses a line of sight," he said, "you will see this economy go."

HEADLINE: The Debt We Owe Katrina

BYLINE: By DANIEL WOLFF. 
Daniel Wolff is the author of ''The Fight for Home: How (Parts of) New Orleans Came Back'' and ''4th of July, Asbury Park: A History of the Promised Land.''

 BODY:
NYACK, N.Y.
NEW YORK, New Jersey and the Northeastern seaboard owe a debt of gratitude to Hurricane Katrina.
The lesson of the Gulf Coast disaster was the failure of government at every level -- federal, state and local -- and across party lines. Towns were unprepared; Louisiana's Democratic governor was slow to mobilize troops; the Republican president oversaw a Federal Emergency Management Agency response that was an almost complete fiasco. Evacuation orders were either not issued or not followed, and many who wanted to get out couldn't, because public trains and buses weren't made available. The legacy of Hurricane Katrina was as simple as the Boy Scout motto: ''Be prepared.'' And, to a large extent, the Northeast's response to Hurricane Sandy seems to have reflected that.
Many local governments issued evacuation notices and, unlike the New Orleans Police Department, managed to enforce them. State officials prepared early and cooperated, both within and across departments. FEMA aid arrived quickly this time, and in large quantities. Death and destruction were minimized by studying the response to Katrina -- and doing the exact opposite. 
But there were other lessons from the Gulf Coast disaster, slower to emerge and longer lasting. Here in the Northeast, there has already been talk of starting over, building better and coming back stronger.
As benign and uplifting as this may sound, in New Orleans ''building better'' was often code for a political agenda. It meant attempting to rezone low-lying areas as ''nonviable'' -- and then turning them over to large-scale developers: a post-flood, backdoor route to old-fashioned urban renewal.
Low-income residents were discouraged from returning to their neighborhoods -- in part because they were often the last to get power, water and other services. Damaged schools were permanently closed, providing opportunities to replace them with privatized alternatives. Hospitals dedicated to the care of low-income patients were never reopened; instead, plans were made to replace them with higher-end, more profitable facilities that would price out the poor. In New Orleans, specifically in the most impoverished areas, flooding and wind damage offered an opportunity to ''solve'' those problems by getting rid of the affected population.
The areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy should be prepared for similar kinds of opportunism. Take the Jersey Shore town of Asbury Park. For over 50 years, the city has had run-down housing, declining schools and increasing crime. Time and again, it has tried to solve those issues by building an economy based on tourism. But focusing on its mile-long beachfront has meant neglecting rampant poverty across the tracks on the town's West Side.
Asbury Park was attempting a recovery before Hurricane Sandy, having sold most of its prime real estate to a single developer, Asbury Partners (part of the larger entity Madison Marquette), who promised to build high-end condominiums and town houses. Progress had been slow. Instead, the areas that had bounced back had done so mainly thanks to private homeowners and entrepreneurs rebuilding historic homes and opening restaurants and other businesses.
Hurricane Sandy brought the oceanfront three blocks inland. It ripped up sections of boardwalk and sent hundreds of people to shelters. Like New Orleans seven years ago, Asbury Park is now at a crossroads. Does it sweeten the sweetheart deal the developers already have, use eminent domain to condemn and raze low-income housing on the West Side, and lay the groundwork for a ''boutique city''? Or is there a way to use Hurricane Sandy's leveling of so many buildings to also level the city's playing field: to bring it back as a multiracial, mixed-income city?
Similar questions will face many of the towns and municipalities in Sandy's wake, including New York City. Much of the five boroughs' low-income public housing is situated in flood zones. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 residents of public housing complexes have been moved out and are now homeless -- living in shelters or elsewhere. Will they come back to the same, better or worse conditions -- or come back at all? Will the destruction of private clubs and residences along the New York and New Jersey shorelines lead to rebuilding that includes more public access -- or less? And will the rebuilding itself, with its potential of billions of dollars in infrastructure repair and redesign, produce big paydays for out-of-state firms (as it did in New Orleans), or create more local jobs that will help lower regional unemployment?
As I hand wrote this essay on a yellow legal pad, all computers down, the house cold and the refrigerator starting to give off an alarming smell, my first concern was the immediate restoration of power.
But if Katrina is any model, we have to think long-term as well -- and make sure we're forging not just a speedy but an equitable recovery.

HEADLINE: Regulators Postpone Part of Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
United States regulators said Friday they were postponing a significant part of the financial regulatory overhaul after banks said they would not be ready for the new rules.
The regulators proposed the rules in June as part of an international effort to harmonize the global financial system. Smaller banks immediately objected to the proposals, saying they would be too costly and might deter them from making loans.
Some of the rules were supposed to take effect at the beginning of next year, but regulators have decided a delay makes sense. The rules stem from internationally agreed standards adopted by a body called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
"In light of the volume of comments received and the wide range of views expressed during the comment period, the agencies do not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on January 1, 2013," said a statement from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
United States regulators are in agreement about most parts of the Basel overhaul, according to two people familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not public. The main sticking point appears to be whether to exempt smaller banks from some of the rules. One senior official said the agencies were planning to postpone the rules only briefly.
Regulators may have initially been caught off guard by the level of opposition to the Basel rules among smaller banks. Last month, an industry group called the Independent Community Bankers of America said that "nearly 15,000 community bankers and their allies" had signed a petition against the rules. "We are very pleased with the delay," said Christopher Cole, senior regulatory counsel at the I.C.B.A. "We're hoping we get an exemption."
In particular, the community banks don't like Basel measures that would make banks hold bigger loss buffers, or capital, against mortgages.
In recent months, regulators have expressed sympathy for the concerns of smaller banks. In a speech on Friday, a Federal Reserve governor, Elizabeth A. Duke, suggested that smaller banks should have separate rules for mortgages.
The Basel rules demand more capital for mortgages with features that might make them less likely to get repaid. Community bank mortgages to individuals have some of those features. For instance, they often make so-called balloon mortgages, which borrowers have to pay off after, say, seven years, or refinance. Ms. Duke noted, however, that community banks in fact had losses on residential mortgages in the financial crisis that were far below those on subprime loans.
"I am convinced that the best course for policymakers would be to abandon efforts for a 'one size fits all' approach to mortgage lending," she said.
But regulators face a real headache in deciding which banks should be subject to which mortgage rules. The Obama administration's long-term aim is to reduce the amount of mortgages that the government guarantees. It wants to go back to a market where private banks and investors hold more mortgages. But banks may want to hold less if they are subject to the Basel rules. There's a danger with making the rules too loose, though. That could prompt smaller banks to make too many risky loans. While smaller banks may not have had huge problems with mortgages to individuals, many such firms collapsed under the weight of losses on loans made to borrowers who bought land and business properties.
In her speech, Ms. Duke appeared to acknowledge the risks. "Crafting regulations to address the real problems that occurred in subprime lending without creating punitive burdens on community banks may prove to be quite difficult," she said.
Notably, the delay announced Friday does not apply to the Basel rules on Wall Street trading operations that regulators finalized in June.
In addition, most large banks already have enough capital to meet the Basel capital requirements that come into effect on Jan. 1. However, they haven't amassed all the capital that they will need by the end of the Basel phase-in period, which extends till the end of 2018.
Some advocates of stronger regulation said they hoped the delay on Friday wouldn't lead to exemptions for large banks.
"There are few things more important in financial reform than increasing capital at large banks," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that has pressed for a tough financial system overhaul.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Squelching A Robocaller

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
11/9/12 | Updated to make clear that calls from "Rachel" may continue from other firms outside of the F.T.C.'s latest action.
So long, Rachel. I certainly won't miss you or your annoying phone calls from "Cardholder Services."
The Federal Trade Commission recently acted to shut down five "robocalling" firms in Arizona and Florida that it says are responsible for millions of illegal telemarketing calls, including the familiar pre-recorded messages from "Rachel." 
"At the F.T.C., Rachel from Cardholder Services is public enemy No. 1," Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said in a statement.
Actually, Rachel is a voice recorded years ago and recycled by various firms, according to an article in June in The New York Times. While the F.T.C.'s action may put a dent in Rachel's productivity, other companies continue to use her message.
"I'd be as delighted as everyone else to see her disappear," said C. Steven Baker, director of the F.T.C.'s Midwest region. "We're working on it."
Federal courts granted the agency's request to temporarily halt the operations of the five firms. The agency asserted that they tricked consumers into paying hundreds of thousands of dollars by making phony claims that they could reduce credit card interest rates in return for a fee -- sometimes as high as $3,000 -- paid up front.
I admit I wasn't aware of what exactly Rachel was pitching, since if I immediately hung up when I heard her greeting. But many other consumers apparently listened, and even pressed a number to hear more from a live person.
After the telemarketer "approved" the consumers for a "program" to get rates as low as 0 percent, according to the F.T.C., the telemarketer informed them that there was an upfront fee, ranging from several hundred dollars to nearly $3,000. To persuade consumers to pay the fee, the F.T.C. said, telemarketers would often say that it would be more than offset by the money the consumer would save through the program.
In some cases, the F.T.C. asserted, consumers' credit cards were charged, even if they didn't agree to pay for the service. In other cases, the F.T.C. contended, the telemarketers did not disclose a fee at all, or claimed there would be no fee.
After consumers paid the fee, the F.T.C. alleged, they typically found -- surprise, surprise! -- that the companies did little or nothing to lower their credit card interest rates. And they often reneged on promises to refund the fees.
The F.T.C. is trying to crack down on robocalling, and is even offering cash prizes for proposals for innovative technology to curtail the practice. (Some robocalls, like those from political candidates or charities seeking donations, are allowed, the F.T.C. says. But if the recording is a sales pitch, and you haven't given written permission to get the calls, it's illegal -- and most likely a scheme.)
The agency also provided tips on what to do if you get unwanted automated telemarketing calls. Hanging up is at the top of the list.
Did you ever hear from Rachel? Did you end up getting charged a fee?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Slower Growth Seen In a Graying World

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AS the world grows older in the coming decades, economic growth will slow.
That forecast was issued Friday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 countries that includes all of the major industrialized nations.
''Aging will be a drag on growth in many countries,'' said the report, titled ''Looking to 2060: Long-Term Global Growth Prospects.'' It also projected that while the aging of the population would be offset to some extent by better education in many countries, global growth in gross domestic product, which averaged 3.5 percent a year from 1995 through 2011, would rise to 3.7 percent through 2030, but then fall to just 2.3 percent over the next three decades.
''The active share of the population has to finance the old population,'' said Asa Johansson, a senior economist in the organization and the principal author of the report, explaining why the rising proportion of older people is expected to reduce growth. 
The accompanying charts show the growth forecasts for the world and for nine major countries, as well as what is known as the old-age dependency ratio, defined as the number of people over the age of 65 for each 100 people ages 15 to 64, which defines the working-age population.
The process is expected to be particularly rapid in China. In 2010, that country had just 11.3 people over 65 for each 100 people in the working-age population, less than half of Britain's 25.1 figure and well below the United States's 19.9. But the United Nations estimates that by 2045, the dependency ratio in China will be 39, almost exactly the same as in Britain and well above the 34.6 figure forecast for the United States.
The O.E.C.D. report said that more rapid aging in China ''partly explains why India and Indonesia will overtake China's growth rate in less than a decade.'' It forecast that China's G.D.P. would grow at a rate of 2.3 percent a year from 2030 to 2060, little more than the 2 percent it forecast for the United States. But it projected growth of 3.3 percent in Indonesia and 4 percent in India.
The United Nations estimates reflect uncertainty about changes in fertility rates over the coming decades, and the charts show three forecasts based on assumptions of high, medium and low rates. The O.E.C.D. growth forecasts assume the medium fertility rates.
If the medium rates are correct, by 2060 Germany and Italy will each have old-age ratios above 55, while Britain and France will have ratios below 45.
Ms. Johansson said she expected that more countries would move to delay retirement age, and noted that some countries were considering indexing that number to life expectancy.
One thing that could render these forecasts wrong would be an increase in immigration. For South Korea, which now seems to be on course to rival Japan as one of the oldest -- and slowest-growing -- countries in the world by late in this century, an obvious source of new workers would be the much younger North Korea, if politics ever made that possible. For many other countries, a source would be less developed nations, something that is politically unpopular in both the United States and Western Europe, and all but anathema in Japan.
Perhaps the politics of that will change someday, as young immigrants are viewed not as competitors for limited employment opportunities but as sources of tax revenue to help support aging populations.

HEADLINE: Report Outlines Climate Change Perils

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Climate change is accelerating, and it will place unparalleled strains on American military and intelligence agencies in coming years by causing ever more disruptive events around the globe, the nation's top scientific research group said in a report issued Friday.
The group, the National Research Council, says in a study commissioned by the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies that clusters of apparently unrelated events exacerbated by a warming climate will create more frequent but unpredictable crises in water supplies, food markets, energy supply chains and public health systems. 
Hurricane Sandy provided a foretaste of what can be expected more often in the near future, the report's lead author, John D. Steinbruner, said in an interview.
''This is the sort of thing we were talking about,'' said Mr. Steinbruner, a longtime authority on national security. ''You can debate the specific contribution of global warming to that storm. But we're saying climate extremes are going to be more frequent, and this was an example of what they could mean. We're also saying it could get a whole lot worse than that.''
Mr. Steinbruner, the director of the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, said that humans are pouring carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases into the atmosphere at a rate never before seen. ''We know there will have to be major climatic adjustments -- there's no uncertainty about that -- but we just don't know the details,'' he said. ''We do know they will be big.''
The study was released 10 days late: its authors had been scheduled to brief intelligence officials on their findings the day Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, but the federal government was shut down because of the storm.
Climate-driven crises could lead to internal instability or international conflict and might force the United States to provide humanitarian assistance or, in some cases, military force to protect vital energy, economic or other interests, the study said.
The Defense Department has already taken major steps to plan for and adapt to climate change and has spent billions of dollars to make ships, aircraft and vehicles more fuel-efficient. Nonetheless, the 206-page study warns in sometimes bureaucratic language, the United States is ill prepared to assess and prepare for the catastrophes that a heated planet will produce.
''It is prudent to expect that over the course of a decade some climate events -- including single events, conjunctions of events occurring simultaneously or in sequence in particular locations, and events affecting globally integrated systems that provide for human well-being -- will produce consequences that exceed the capacity of the affected societies or global system to manage and that have global security implications serious enough to compel international response,'' the report states.
In other words, states will fail, large populations subjected to famine, flood or disease will migrate across international borders, and national and international agencies will not have the resources to cope.
The report cites the simultaneous heat wave in Russia and floods in Pakistan in the summer of 2010 as disparate but linked climate-related events that taxed those societies.
It also cites the Nile River watershed as a place where climate-related conflict over water and farmland could arise as the combined populations of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia approach 300 million. South Korea and Saudi Arabia have purchased fertile land in the Nile watershed to produce crops to feed their people, but local forces could decide to seize the crops for their own use, potentially leading to international conflict, the report says.
The 18-month study is not the first such report from government agencies or research organizations to draw a direct link between climate change and national security concerns.
The National Intelligence Council produced a classified national intelligence estimate on climate change in 2008 and has issued a number of unclassified reports since then. The Pentagon and the White House have also highlighted the role of climate change in humanitarian crises and security threats.
The National Research Council recommends in the new report that all government agencies improve their ability to monitor the global climate and assess the risks to populations and critical resources around the world.
Yet Mr. Steinbruner said that as the need for more and better analysis is growing, government resources devoted to them are shrinking. Republicans in Congress objected to the C.I.A.'s creation of a climate change center and tried to deny money for it. The American weather satellite program is losing capability because of years of underfinancing and mismanagement, imperiling the ability to predict and monitor major storms.

HEADLINE: Cuba's Prospects for an Oil-Fueled Economic Jolt Falter With Departure of Rig

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and DAMIEN CAVE; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Damien Cave from Mexico City.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Cuba's hopes of reviving its economy with an oil boom have produced little more than three dry holes, persuading foreign oil companies to remove the one deepwater rig able to work in Cuban waters so it could be used for more lucrative prospects elsewhere.
The rig, which was built in China to get around the United States trade embargo, is expected to depart in the next few weeks. With no other rigs available for deepwater exploration, that means Cuba must now postpone what had become an abiding dream: a windfall that would save Cuba's economy and lead to a uniquely Cuban utopia where the island's socialist system was paid for by oil sales to its capitalist neighbors. 
''The Cuban oil dream is over and done with, at least for the next five years,'' said Jorge Pion, a former BP and Amoco executive who fled Cuba as a child but continues to brief foreign oil companies on Cuban oil prospects. ''The companies have better prospects by going to Brazil, Angola and the U.S. Gulf.''
The lack of a quick find comes at a difficult time for Cuba. The effects of Hurricane Sandy, which destroyed more than 100,000 homes in eastern Cuba, are weighing down an economy that remains moribund despite two years of efforts by the Cuban government to cut state payrolls and cautiously encourage free enterprise on a small scale.
Cuba had hoped to become energy independent, after relying first on Russia and now on Venezuela for most of its oil. But with its drilling prospects dimming, experts say, Cuban officials may be pushed to accelerate the process of economic opening. At the very least, it may embolden members of the bureaucracy looking for broader or faster changes in the economy.
''This could represent a crucial setback for the Cuban regime,'' said Blake Clayton, an energy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the meantime, the government has mostly tried to put a positive spin on the disappointing drilling results and the decision of the rig operator to lease in other waters. Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, reported last week that while Venezuela's state oil firm had plugged its hole because ''it did not offer possibilities of commercial exploitation,'' the drilling had obtained valuable geological information. The Venezuelan firm was the last of three foreign oil companies to use the rig, after the Spanish company Repsol and the Malaysian company Petronas.
The government said more exploration could be expected.
The potential for Cuba's oil reserves, like nearly everything involving Cuba, has been a matter of dispute. Cuban officials had predicted that oil companies would find 20 billion barrels of oil reserves off its northern coast. The United States Geological Survey has estimated Cuban oil reserves at 5 billion barrels, one quarter of the Cuban estimate.
The best-case scenario for production, according to some oil experts, would be for Cuba to eventually become a medium-size producer like Ecuador. But as the three dry holes showed, far more exploration effort would be needed, and that presents a challenge for a country with limited resources and the hurdle of American sanctions. There are many offshore areas that are competing with Cuba for the attention of oil companies, particularly off the coasts of South America and East and West Africa.
In Cuba's case, the American embargo makes it far more difficult for companies seeking to explore Cuban waters. The Scarabeo 9, the rig set to depart, is the only one available that is capable of drilling in deep waters and complies with the embargo. To get it built, Repsol, the Spanish oil giant, was forced to contract an Italian operator to build a rig in China to drill exploration wells.
Cuban officials have also run into environmental concerns in the United States. The prospect of drilling only 50 miles from the Florida Keys had worried ocean scientists, who warned that if the kind of blowout that occurred on the BP rig in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico was repeated in Cuban waters, it could send oil spewing onto Florida coastlines in as little as three days. If the oil reached the Gulf Stream, the powerful current that passes through the area, oil could flow up the coast to Miami and beyond.
Still, Cuba has been bullish about oil since plans for the rig's arrival were first made several years ago. Cuba produces a small amount of oil and relies on Venezuela to provide around 115,000 barrels a day at highly subsidized rates, in exchange for the services of Cuban doctors and other professionals. Venezuelan production has been sliding steeply in recent years, and Cuban officials have been unnerved by the health problems of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chvez, a crucial ally for the island.
Lee Hunt, a former president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said there were still potential opportunities off the island. The first Repsol well, he said, was not productive, but a subsequent study of the drilling results concluded that there could be promising oil-producing rocks in nearby waters.
The second well drilled by Petronas found only heavy oil that was so thick it could not be economically lifted out of the ground. And the third attempt by the Venezuelan state company found rock that was so hard and thick that it wore down drill bits before reaching oil.
Mr. Hunt said oil consultants continued to train Cuban drilling crews for the Russian company Zarubezhneft, which plans to drill using a Norwegian rig in shallow waters about 200 miles east of Havana. But that area is not considered as promising as the deep waters.
So the next deepwater exploration effort, Mr. Hunt said, may have to come from farther away: oil companies from Vietnam and Angola still have active leases in Cuba for future drilling.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Climbs to a 5-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
An increasingly upbeat view of the economy and the jobs market drove consumer sentiment to its highest level in more than five years in early November, while a jump in wholesale inventories suggested the economy grew more than initially estimated last quarter. 
It was the fourth month that Americans adopted a rosier economic outlook, even as financial markets showed increasing anxiety on fear that the spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect in the new year could push the country back into recession.
Separate data from the government on Friday showed wholesale inventories rose in September by the most in nine months, prompting economists to raise their forecasts for third-quarter growth. Inventories are a key element of the government's measure of economic growth and can highlight underlying strength or weakness.
The index of consumer sentiment from Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan rose to 84.9 in November from 82.6, topping economists' expectations for a reading of 83.
It was the highest level since July 2007. The measure of consumer expectations also hit the highest level in more than five years, rising to 80.8 from 79.0. Most interviews for the survey were done before Tuesday's presidential election.
''It shows that the U.S. economy is on a decent footing heading into the so-called fiscal cliff,'' said Joe Manimbo, a market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. ''There's a lot at stake, and there's a lot of momentum that could be lost if lawmakers don't get their act together.''
The survey director, Richard Curtin, said the re-election of President Obama should not have an impact on overall expectations, but if Washington does not act quickly to avoid the $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases, consumers could face a shock.
But the chances of a comprehensive legislative solution to the tax increases and spending cuts before Jan. 1 are considered slight, and members of Congress have been looking for a temporary fix to buy time.
While a negative conclusion to the discussions poses a risk to confidence and spending, ''uncertainty over the ultimate outcome doesn't appear to have troubled consumers unduly thus far,'' a Barclays economist, Peter A. Newland, wrote.
The Commerce Department reported that total wholesale inventories gained 1.1 percent to $494.2 billion, beating even the highest estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts.
JPMorgan and Barclays raised their estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.2 percent from 2.8 percent after the release of the report.

HEADLINE: Britain Examines 4,000 HSBC Accounts in a Tax Haven

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - The British tax authorities said on Friday that they were looking into a list of HSBC clients with bank accounts in the tax haven of Jersey, a development that adds to the bank's legal woes.
Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Britain's tax authority, is investigating more than 4,000 accounts in Jersey that belong to British clients after receiving details from a whistle-blower. The list includes a drug dealer and a man convicted of possessing more than 300 weapons at his home in the south of England, The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London reported.
"We have received the data and we are studying it," a tax authority spokesman wrote in an e-mailed statement. "Clamping down on those who try to cheat the system through evading taxes and over-claiming benefits is a top priority for us, and we value the information we receive from the public and business community." 
Jersey, the largest island in the English Channel, is a British dependency with its own tax system.
HSBC, Britain's largest bank, is already part of an investigation into money laundering. The bank said earlier this month that it set aside an additional $800 million to cover potential fines from the money laundering case, bringing the total to $1.5 billion. The bank, which is negotiating a settlement with the American authorities, added that the actual fine could be even bigger.
In addition, HSBC, like other major British banks, has had to set aside cash to reimburse British customers who were sold inappropriate insurance products.
HSBC said Friday in a statement that the bank was "investigating the reports of an alleged loss of certain client data in Jersey as a matter of urgency." HSBC said it had not yet been informed of any investigation but would fully cooperate with the authorities. "HSBC remains fully committed to adoption of the highest global standards, including the procedures for the acceptance of clients," it said.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has made the crackdown on tax evaders a priority for a government under pressure to increase revenue and reduce the budget deficit. After the financial crisis, banks face greater scrutiny from the authorities worldwide about how they conduct their business.
HSBC's management was forced to apologize publicly for the problems that weighed on its earnings and share price as recently as Monday and has already started to change its compliance and oversight functions.
The money laundering scandal began when the United States Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused HSBC of allowing some of its executives to let illegal behavior go unchecked for nine years, until 2010. In one example, the bank provided financing to Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, even though some of the bank's owners were linked to the financing of terrorism, according to the Senate report.
HSBC clients are also on another list that was in the spotlight this month. Kostas Vaxevanis, editor of the investigative magazine Hot Doc, was acquitted last week on charges of breaching privacy laws when he published a list of more than 2,000 Greeks believed to hold accounts at a Geneva branch of HSBC. The list was given to the Greek authorities two years ago by Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister and now managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to help the government in Athens investigate evasion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An Italian-Style Obama on the Poltiical Trail

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
VERBANIA, ITALY -- For nearly eight weeks, Matteo Renzi, the 37-year-old mayor of Florence, has flitted about Italy in a white camper, delivering rousing speeches with a bit of American-style campaigning as he competes in a primary vote this month that will decide who will lead Italy's center-left Democratic Party in national elections next year.
His campaign slogan ''Adesso,'' or ''Now,'' seems borrowed from the Obama handbook, his campaign colors are the same as the American flag, and he makes a point of addressing crowds, microphone in hand, in a jacketless, chummy manner that is a vivid contrast to Italy's more declamatory tradition.
But it is not just Mr. Renzi's youthful campaign style that is stirring up his party -- and by extension, Italian politics. It is his message for ''Rottamazione'' -- which translates literally as scrapping, and is most often used when consigning a car to the junk heap. 
That, Mr. Renzi proclaims, is what he would like to do the political class that led Italy into its economic morass, while rejuvenating his own party, which now has its strongest chance in next April's national election since it last won in 2006, given the disarray that has beset the conservative party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Mr. Renzi's message means to reach out especially to disaffected young people and it has tapped a widespread feeling of contempt for a political class perceived more than ever as a corrupt, overprivileged and out of touch with the needs of a nation struggling through severe recession.
But it has also offended the traditions of many in the Italian left, which he is challenging to revamp itself and move toward the models of ''Blair, Clinton and Obama,'' as he put it in a recent interview in his office at Florence city hall. ''I am a Democrat,'' he said proudly.
That may be so. But the prospect that Mr. Renzi could win the primary has raised deep concerns among many in his Democratic Party that he would radically shift its core values firmly to the center. For a party that is the largest remaining heir to Italy's once influential Communist Party, such a move would be tantamount to identity theft -- and, many in the party concede, runs the risk of opening an irreparable rift within its ranks.
But Mr. Renzi argues it is a necessary step to save a party that he sees as having grown rigid and ossified and seen its influence wane in an Italian political landscape that has been reshaped by two decades of domination by Mr. Berlusconi and his conservatives.
''His action is one of renewal not from within the party but despite the party,'' said Diego Bianchi, a center-left political blogger, and one of several to note that Mr. Renzi has remained on the outskirts of the Democratic Party machine rather than take part in internal issues.
''He has personalized the notion of leadership in a very showy way,'' he added. ''He gives off the sensation that he has his own story at heart, and that he has little to do with the history of the left.''
That impulse is shaking up the usual battle lines of Italian politics, and Mr. Renzi has unsettled things even further by appealing to Mr. Berlusconi's disillusioned voters to turn to the left in the next elections. Many in his own Democratic Party view the growing list of endorsements for Mr. Renzi from card-carrying conservatives with growing suspicion.
But supporters say that Mr. Renzi is attempting to open up new, less ideological, horizons at a moment of new fluidity in Italian politics. ''The exit of Berlusconi frees up an river of centrist electors, and I think our party should reflect on this, especially in the north,'' said Antonio Funiciello, a Democratic Party supporter of the Florentine mayor. ''This clutching onto the old certainties of the left, closes us off toward electors that could be open to a new government project.
''It's a high risk move, but with a high return,'' he added.
Not least among those Mr. Renzi and his party are seeking to appeal to are young people, who have seen their job prospects evaporate and have been held hostage to an ubiquitous generational imbalance in Italy, where the reins of power in politics, business and higher education remain firmly in the hands of an influential gerontocracy.
On Monday evening, Mr. Renzi bounded onto the stage of the auditorium of this Piedmont town to strains of ''We are Young,'' by the pop group Fun, whose second line goes ''So let's set the world on fire.''
''This territory is rich but it has been experiencing the crisis firsthand for years now,'' Mr. Renzi told a standing-room audience. ''It is a symbol of what Italy's going through. We want to use the primaries as a referendum on the future. We want to change Italy.''
Many feel that Mr. Renzi faces an uphill battle.
''Renzi is building on the ever stronger voices that Italy needs to renew and make room for young people, but Italy is static and there is a very strong resistance in society toward change and above all to rejuvenation,'' said Ernesto Galli della Loggia, a historian of contemporary Italian history and a columnist for the Milan daily Corriere della Sera.
Like Beppe Grillo, the comedian-turned-political guru whose 5 Star Movement has been channeling Italian discontent with the political class and is rapidly gaining ground in local elections throughout Italy, Mr. Renzi speaks of a rupture with the past. But Mr. Grillo heads an anti-establishment movement, ready to challenge notions of how democracy is exercised. Mr. Renzi, on the other hand, wants to change from within the existing system.
But a primary victory is far from assured for Mr. Renzi, who is married with three children and previously worked for a family firm, Chil srl, that does marketing and market research.
The other contenders in the Democratic Party primary, which will be held on Nov. 25, include party secretary Pier Luigi Bersani, 61, who is thought to be the strongest candidate because he has the backing of the historic wing of the party; the Veneto politician, Laura Puppato, 55; Nichi Vendola, 54, the president of the Puglia region; and Bruno Tabacci, 66, a member of Milan's city municipal administration.
All, save Mr. Tabacci, are candidates with established leftist credentials, and many in his party see Mr. Renzi as having substantial downsides, particularly if he divides it.
In Verbania, Mr. Renzi drew applause attacking the political order, disparaging government waste and promising a new, brighter future, noting that under his guidance, Florence has flourished.
But Claudio Fantoni, a member of Florence's Democratic Party, and other critics say Mr. Renzi has misrepresented his record. Mr. Fantoni, for one, left Mr. Renzi's cabinet in June, believing that the Florentine mayor was overstretching the city's municipal budget and postponing unpopular decisions so as not to dent his image.
Others have also raised questions about Mr. Renzi's fund-raising efforts. According to the campaign's Web site, the campaign has raised &#x20ac;117,000, or $149,000, in donations from citizens, far too little, his critics say, to prop up his flashy crusade.
''The risk is concrete,'' said Mr. Fantoni, referring to Mr. Renzi's potential to divide the party. ''Renzi is an element of rupture who perplexes'' many in the party, he said. ''His attitude has been, 'Let me win and then we'll see.' That is unacceptable.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Reconsider Positions on Immigration

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After a presidential election in which Latino voters rewarded President Obama while punishing Republicans for their positions on immigration, Republican leaders and prominent conservatives moved quickly this week to shift to new ground, saying they could support some kind of legislation to fix illegal immigration.
The prospects for an immigration overhaul next year improved with stunning speed after the vote, with John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, who had long resisted any broad immigration bill, saying on Thursday that ''a comprehensive approach is long overdue.'' Haley Barbour, a Republican elder statesman and former governor of Mississippi, echoed Mr. Boehner, and Sean Hannity, the conservative talk show host -- in a startling turnaround -- joined calls for measures opening pathways to legal status for illegal immigrants. 
One of every 10 voters who cast ballots on Tuesday was a Latino, and they favored President Obama, with 71 percent of their votes, compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney, forcing Republican leaders to wonder if they could ever regain the presidency without increasing their appeal to Hispanic Americans.
Mr. Obama wasted no time, renewing in his acceptance speech early Wednesday his promise to move ''in the coming weeks and months'' on ''fixing our immigration system.''
A host of advocates noted that the coalition of forces supporting a thorough repair of the immigration system, including the offer of legal status for more than 11 million illegal immigrants, is broader and more organized than ever before. It includes Latino organizations, business and agricultural employers, libertarian conservatives, evangelical Christians and law enforcement groups.
''Is the Republican disconnect with the Latino community temporary or permanent?'' asked the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the largest organization of Hispanic evangelicals. ''The Republicans can redeem the narrative with this community by passing comprehensive immigration reform,'' Mr. Rodriguez said Thursday.
Republicans, in soul-searching after their loss, weighed the lessons from Mr. Romney's failed campaign. Looking at polls that showed immigration was not the top subject of concern for Latinos, Mr. Romney avoided the issue when he could and instead based his appeal to them on the economic themes he used with other voters. That was a serious misunderstanding of Latino sensibilities, leaders said.
''How you talked about immigrants sent a signal on what kind of perspective you had on Latinos over all,'' said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, a bipartisan group.
Mr. Romney never recovered after he moved to the right during the primaries, saying he would pressure immigrants to ''self-deport'' and veto the Dream Act, a bill to give legal status to young immigrants here illegally that enjoys near-universal support among Latinos.
Mr. Obama lifted his sinking standing with Hispanics in June when he offered two-year reprieves from deportation and work permits to hundreds of thousands of those young immigrants, an action so popular it made Latinos overlook his having deported more than 1.4 million people during his term.
But many Republicans attacked the reprieves as amnesty by fiat, and Mr. Romney said he would cancel them if he became president.
In exit polls on Tuesday, 77 percent of Hispanic voters said immigrants here illegally should have a chance to apply for legal status, while 18 percent said they should be deported. In the polls, 65 percent of all voters favored legal status for those immigrants, while 28 percent said they should be deported.
Mr. Boehner chose his words carefully on Thursday, in an interview with ABC News. Saying he was ready for a ''comprehensive approach,'' he said he was confident that Congress and Mr. Obama could find ''common ground to take care of this issue once and for all.''
Speaking to reporters in Washington on Friday, Mr. Boehner declined to say whether he was endorsing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
''What I'm talking about is a common-sense step-by-step approach that would secure our borders, allow us to enforce our laws and fix a broken immigration system,'' he said. ''But again,'' he added, ''on an issue this big, the president has to lead.''
Mr. Boehner's use of the word comprehensive caused a stir, because supporters of legal status for immigrants who lack it have long called their proposal ''comprehensive immigration reform.''
Mr. Hannity was more forthright. On his show on Thursday, he said he had ''evolved'' and now believed that ''if people are here, law-abiding, participating for years, their kids are born here, you know, first secure the border, then pathway to citizenship, done.''
Those comments created new openings for Republicans who were already urging a more inclusive approach, including Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and former Gov. Jeb Bush, all of Florida.
In recent years, traditional immigrant and Latino groups worked to organize and expand their base of support, finding middle ground with Republicans in state offices worried about the party slipping with minorities.
The attorney general of Utah, Mark Shurtleff, a conservative Republican, said he was part of an ''education campaign'' to persuade Republican officials that ''they need to reject the run-'em-out, deport-'em, enforcement-only approach that people think is the only voice of the Republican Party.''
The emerging coalition includes technology companies seeking more visas for high-skilled immigrants, growers seeking legal farm workers, evangelical pastors responding to huge growth in their churches from Latino immigrants and young undocumented immigrants whose protests pushed the White House to offer the deportation reprieves.
Last month Grover Norquist, the fiscal hawk who is president of Americans for Tax Reform, said in a speech in Indianapolis that more immigration, including legal status for those here illegally, was vital to economic revival.
However, it was evident almost immediately after Mr. Boehner spoke on Thursday that many Congressional Republicans would be hostile to comprehensive immigration-reform efforts.
''I'm urging the speaker to talk with House Republicans before making pledges on the national news,'' said Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana. ''The first thing we need is for President Obama to finally enforce current immigration law and strengthen our borders. To take up any other agenda is bad policy for the American people and bad politics for Republicans.''

HEADLINE: Shares Edge Up as Budget Concern Clashes With Strong Economic Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced slightly on Friday but failed to avert the worst week for markets since June, as investors turned their attention from the presidential election to the coming negotiations over impending tax increases and spending cuts. 
The market gave up some early gains after President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, in separate public remarks, made it clear that partisan sparring over taxes and budget cuts to address the deficit would probably dominate the next several weeks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished Friday's session up 0.17 percent, but it fell 2.4 percent for the week, its worst performance since early June.
''At this point, there's no election, and there's nothing else that can distract. The junk has filtered out and the politicians will be forced to make a decision on the fiscal cliff,'' said Chris Hobart, chief executive and founder of the Hobart Financial Group, an investment management and financial planning company in Charlotte, N.C.
Early in the day, new economic data showed that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in more than five years, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan surveys, and that wholesale inventories jumped in September, according to a Commerce Department report.
Shares of Walt Disney fell 6 percent to $47.06, dragging on the Dow industrials, after the company reported results late Thursday. The company said future results would be under pressure because of declining home video sales and rising costs.
Groupon's shares sank 29.6 percent, to $2.76, a day after the daily deal company's results fell short of Wall Street's expectations.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 4.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 12,815.39 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.34 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,379.85. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 9.29 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 2,904.87.
For the week, the Dow fell 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq lost 2.2 percent.
Tech stocks managed solid gains in Friday's session. An S.& P. information technology sector index rose 0.6 percent.
Shares of Apple rebounded from their slide into bear market territory this week with a 1.7 percent gain on Friday to close at $547.06.
But the stock of the retailer J. C. Penney slid 4.8 percent to $20.64 and was the S.& P. 500's biggest decliner after the company reported a sharper-than-expected decline in quarterly sales at stores open at least a year.
Investors may be reacting to the prospect of higher tax rates next year by selling both losing and winning stocks for the year to reduce the tax impact from their positions.
International Game Technology, a maker of slot machines, gained 5.2 percent to $13.50 after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.
Lions Gate Entertainment jumped 14.3 percent to $16.68 after reporting better-than-expected earnings of $75.5 million, helped by the studio's blockbuster movie ''The Hunger Games.''
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 100 4/32, from 100 2/32 late Thursday, and the yield slipped to 1.61 percent from 1.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Obama to Insist on Tax Increase for the Wealthy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama said Friday that he would insist that tax increases on affluent Americans be part of any agreement to avoid a year-end fiscal crisis, setting up a possible confrontation with Congressional Republicans who say they will oppose a rise in tax rates for the rich.
In his first remarks from the White House since his re-election, Mr. Obama made it clear that he believed his victory had validated his relentless campaign call for wealthier Americans to pay more and that he expected Republicans to heed that message.
''I just want to point out this was a central question during the election,'' he said in brief remarks in the East Room. ''It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach.'' 
Mr. Obama said he had invited Congressional leaders to the White House next week to begin talks as they return for a lame-duck session of Congress. He said he was willing to make some concessions as long as the final fiscal bargain was properly balanced between new tax revenue and spending cuts.
''I'm not wedded to every detail of my plan,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I'm open to compromise.''
At the same time, he encouraged Congress to quickly pass an extension of the existing lower rates for those making under $250,000 even while the broader negotiations take place.
''While there may be disagreement in Congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over $250,000 a year, nobody -- not Republicans, not Democrats -- want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,'' he said. ''So let's not wait.''
The president's comments came shortly after Speaker John A. Boehner, who had been striking a conciliatory tone since Republican election losses in the Senate and the House, told reporters that Republicans had won a mandate of their own by retaining control of the House and that he supported continuing rates enacted in the Bush-era tax cuts for all income levels.
''Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want,'' said Mr. Boehner, who said he favored generating any new federal revenue to offset the deficit by closing tax loopholes and limiting deductions.
''It's clear that there are a lot of special interest loopholes in the tax code, both corporate and personal,'' he said. ''It's also clear that there are all kinds of deductions, some of which make sense; others don't. And by lowering rates and cleaning up the tax code, we know we're going to get more economic growth.''
The president and Mr. Boehner were careful with their language and left room for compromise despite their fundamental differences about shifting more of the tax burden to high-income Americans. Mr. Boehner would not be very specific on what his goal might be for raising new federal tax dollars.
''I don't want to box myself in,'' he said. ''I don't want to box anybody else in. I think it's important for us to come to an agreement with the president. But this is his opportunity to lead.''
The speaker, who has struggled with his more conservative rank and file in the past, said he was confident that he could pass a deal if one was reached with the White House. ''When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem getting it passed here in the House,'' he said.
House Republican leadership aides found some positive signals in Mr. Obama's combative tone. They noted that he never specified he wants tax rates to rise, only that he wants additional revenues generated by taxes on the rich. That would give both sides the latitude to devise a restructured tax code that eliminates or limits tax deductions and credits for the rich -- or that follows Mitt Romney's proposal to cap deductions at a set limit for rich households, though many analysts say that approach alone cannot raise the revenue Democrats want.
Any agreement to avert a fiscal crisis in January, when hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts kick in, now revolves around the definition of tax increases. Mr. Boehner is holding the line against any increase in tax rates, even for the richest Americans, who currently are in the 35 percent tax bracket. But he is leaving open the possibility of a tax overhaul that raises more revenue than the existing code.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, echoed the view at the White House that Americans want to see taxes on the wealthy go up. In a statement after Mr. Obama spoke, Mr. Hoyer said that ''on Tuesday, the American people made it clear that they support a balanced approach to bring down deficits and set our nation back on a sound fiscal path -- one that does not ask working families and those struggling to get by to bear the burden of deficit reduction, but instead asks the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.''
While Mr. Obama was careful not to demand that tax rates rise, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said just an hour later that the president would veto any legislation extending the expiring tax cuts for families making $250,000 or more.
For all the talk of compromise, neither side offered any suggestion of where it might back down. While both sides agree on the need to avoid triggering the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that occur if there is no deal -- and there is deep concern that failure could harm the economy -- the shape of a final compromise remains unclear. New reports this week by the Congressional Budget Office found that the automatic tax increases and spending cuts would cut the deficit by $503 billion through next September. But the reports said that the austerity could cause the economy to shrink by 0.5 percent next year, and would lead to the loss of millions of jobs.
The Congressional leaders will be heading to the White House on Friday, administration officials said, just before Mr. Obama leaves for Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand, where he will attend economic meetings with world leaders. He is certain to come under pressure there to reach a deal with Republicans since the American economy is doing better than most other global economies, and a slowdown in the United States is widely viewed as potentially catastrophic to the global economy.
''It's time to get back to work,'' the president said at the White House. ''And there is plenty of work to do.''

HEADLINE: A Brief History of Long Lines and Lots of Impatience

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The last time New York City had odd-even gasoline purchase rules, they were in effect for 79 days, and the time before that, 65 days.
This time, the reasons were different. Fuel distribution was disrupted by Hurricane Sandy - among other things, the storm forced tankers bound for the New York area to wait it out and stay beyond the reach of its punishing winds. Also, many service stations had gasoline but no electricity after the storm, so their pumps could not function.
In 1973, the Arab oil embargo choked supplies nationwide. In 1979, a new government took power during the Iranian revolution, and fresh supply worries set off panic buying and long lines at gas stations. There were fistfights at some stations as drivers tried to cut in line. At least one driver was arrested for pulling a gun on a gas station attendant who would not fill his car, with odd-numbered plates, on an even-numbered day. 
"It was hectic," recalled Stanley Gaj, who in 1979 was the manager of a filling station at Queens Boulevard and Albion Avenue in Elmhurst, Queens. "It was chaotic. We opened up at I think 6 or 7 in the morning, and we only stayed open until we ran out. When we ran out, that was it until the next day." (Mr. Gaj, who now lives in Middle Village, Queens, said that he left the station in the mid-1980s and became a bus driver.)
The odd-even sales began in mid-June of 1979 after weeks of long lines. They ended on Sept. 6 after officials decided there was finally enough fuel on hand to be certain there would be no more panic buying. Gasoline became widely available again in midsummer after the price passed $1.50 a gallon. It had been less than $1 at the beginning of 1979, before Iran suspended oil exports.
In May of that year, President Jimmy Carter gave governors the power to regulate gasoline sales in their states. That included the power to impose odd-even systems. Three weeks later, Gov. Hugh L. Carey announced an odd-even plan for the city and four suburban counties - Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland. New Jersey and Connecticut soon followed suit.
Mr. Carey had been under pressure from Mayor Edward I. Koch, who called the gas lines and supply problems "intolerable." That mirrored the situation five years earlier, when Mayor Abraham D. Beame called the outlook "desperate" and threatened to start allocating gasoline himself if the state did not.
The governor at the time, Malcolm Wilson, initially resisted, saying he did not want to force "governmental regulation upon our citizens and upon our businesses until every alternative has been exhausted."
He relented in February 1974, saying the gasoline emergency was endangering public health and safety.
Mr. Wilson ended the odd-even plan in May after federal energy officials increased the amount of gasoline available in New York.
The odd-even rules currently in effect brought back memories for New Yorkers old enough to remember the earlier rounds. Robert Sinclair Jr., now a spokesman for AAA New York, remembered a conversation with a cousin in 1979.
"He was supposed to take this girl out," he said, "but she didn't appreciate how hard it was to get gasoline. He was done with her."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Joseph Sargent, 83, a Founder of a Ski Resort

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Joseph Sargent, a financier who helped found the Killington ski area in Vermont, a once-little-known peak that grew into one of America's largest winter sports resorts, died on Wednesday in West Hartford, Conn. He was 83. 
He had been treated for pancreatic cancer, his son Tom said.
Mr. Sargent, an avid skier, became involved in the Killington enterprise in the mid-1950s, when he attended a meeting where another businessman, Preston Smith, pitched the idea of a ski development in rural Vermont to a group of potential investors. The offer was deemed too risky by most of the others, but Mr. Sargent jumped on the idea.
Mr. Sargent, Mr. Smith and a third partner, Wally Morrison, soon formed the Sherburne Corporation and raised $80,000, a relatively small amount with which to start a resort. Mr. Smith, as chief executive, worked full time on the mountain and Mr. Sargent became chairman, driving up from West Hartford on weekends, sometimes helping to clear stumps and install ski lifts.
Killington opened on Dec. 13, 1958, with two lifts serving fewer than 10 trails. Amenities included a base lodge made from a repurposed Civilian Conservation Corps hut and a ticket booth made from a chicken coop.
By the mid-1970s, Sherburne had acquired other resorts, and in 1996, Mr. Smith and Mr. Sargent sold the company to L.B.O. Enterprises for more than $100 million. Killington now has 140 trails and 22 lifts across seven mountains.
Joseph Denny Sargent was born on Sept. 11, 1929, in Hartford. He started skiing in high school at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and continued at Yale, where he earned degrees in economics and geology.
In addition to his son, Mr. Sargent is survived by his wife, the former Mary Tennant; another son, Robert; two daughters, Suzanne and Diane; and 11 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Some Prefer Giving Time, Not Money, to Schools

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A COUPLE of weeks ago, I wrote about a group that rated charities for their effectiveness but was surprised when one of the group's young founders said he had stopped supporting groups focused on education. He had a perfectly rational-sounding reason: the problems were daunting and he didn't feel his donations would have an impact.
Then, I heard about a recent study of high-net-worth households that found that education was the leading concern among affluent donors, ahead of health care, the economy, poverty and the federal budget deficit.
The report, by Bank of America and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, also found that the largest proportion of gift dollars was going to education (followed by philanthropic funds, family foundations and religious organizations). The study also found that the amount given to education increased more than any other category last year. 
Some portion of this money certainly went to alma maters. But as I talked to the people who conducted the study, I realized that people were giving more than just money to education causes. They were giving their knowledge and experience.
''One of the more strategic issues in philanthropy is looking at root causes and not at symptoms,'' said Claire Costello, philanthropic practice executive at Bank of America's United States Trust division. ''Education is a root cause. One interpretation of the data could be people feel if you rectify our education system, prosperity will flow to all of us.''
Writing a check is simply a matter of figuring out an amount you can afford and sending it off. But actually donating your time, which was not counted by the survey toward the dollars people gave, seemed a far greater level of commitment.
Donating your time does not result in a tax break, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics valued volunteering at $21.79 an hour in 2011.
As I talked to people who were deeply involved in educational philanthropy, I realized that it was actually the time they gave that kept them involved, even if they could have written a large check and been done with it.
Charles R. Bendit, for instance, had built his real estate firm, Taconic Investment Partners, into a successful portfolio of commercial buildings and apartments in the New York region. When he first became interested in giving something back in the 1990s, he said he didn't have a lot of money but did have some business experience.
A friend suggested he consider education and connected him with Pencil, a nonprofit group that brings business people into public schools. ''I figured education makes a lot of sense,'' Mr. Bendit said. ''Educating our students best prepares them to take on the responsibility of becoming our business and political leaders.''
After volunteering at a couple of different schools, Mr. Bendit was paired up with Sana Q. Nasser, the principal of the Harry S. Truman High School in the Bronx. The result has been a partnership of more than a decade that has brought significant improvements in the school, which now has 1,900 students.
Ms. Nasser said she had been a principal for five years when she met Mr. Bendit. At that point, she felt she had stabilized the school, which had been failing when she took over, and was ready to start making improvements. She wanted to start academies within the school that would draw on assets that were not being used, like a television studio and a planetarium.
''I realized very quickly that I needed someone to help me,'' Ms. Nasser said. ''I didn't know exactly how to do it. I didn't have the wherewithal to negotiate all of this.''
But she knew she didn't want an executive to come in for a day and write her school a check.
''I wanted someone who would stay with me for the long haul,'' she said. ''I wanted time, their knowledge and commitment, and a wide network of people. I wanted that business connection. I wanted internships for my kids.''
Mr. Bendit said the two hit it off. But before they tackled her dream of having academies within the school, they began working on her ability to delegate to her assistant principals. Without doing that, he said she couldn't think long term about the school.
She said she trusted Mr. Bendit to teach her skills that she didn't have. ''It was almost a mindshift for me,'' she said. ''I realized he could help me as I tried to rebuild Truman to what it used to be.''
Mr. Bendit said that for him, helping her start various academies within the school with focuses as different as law and cooking, meant using his contacts more than his checkbook. ''It was about leverage,'' he said. ''I didn't know much about television studios or catering, but I knew who to ask.''
Today, Truman is a thriving school. But Mr. Bendit was quick to point out that he was able to make a difference without sacrificing other things in his life. He estimated that he spent no more than 25 hours a year with Ms. Nasser.
''We sometimes don't appreciate the impact we can have by just investing a little bit of our time and some of our resources,'' he said. ''She never said, 'Could you buy me computers or could you buy me a new planetarium?' It was more about, 'What can you do to help me build this?' ''
Mr. Bendit said he gave the school money for a special program, however, and has donated to Pencil and many other educational organizations.
The Bank of America study of high-net-worth households found that 89 percent of those affluent people said they had volunteered their time -- up 10 percentage points from 2009, when the study was last conducted. Ms. Costello, the Bank of America executive, said researchers had also asked people about the level of personal satisfaction they derived from their charitable giving and found that it was linked more to engagement than dollars.
This was no surprise to people who have been involved in educational philanthropy.
Marguerite Griffin, national director of philanthropic service at the wealth management firm Northern Trust, said that people who wanted to be involved in education charities needed to be prepared to wait for results, and that could be frustrating for people who were not volunteering their time and seeing the small steps of progress.
''Many of the best educational funders are also mentors in after-school programs or they volunteer,'' she said. ''They do something that keeps them in touch with the population they're trying to help.''
Donna Fontana, senior vice president at Fidelity Investments, said she was inspired to change her philanthropic focus by the documentary ''Waiting for Superman,'' about city students trying to get a better education in charter schools.
She began teaching an after-school class through a program run by Citizen Schools, which helps students gain life skills and experience. She is in her third semester of teaching ''Invest Like a Millionaire,'' a course Fidelity developed, at a middle school in East Harlem. Ms. Fontana said the class focused on teaching children the basics of saving, spending and budgeting but culminated with students counseling real people (her friends) on their financial situation.
''The children embrace it and rise to the occasion,'' she said. ''We knew we were getting through to them when we had one student talk to a client about compound interest.''
She said she now found herself talking enthusiastically about the children and the program to all of her friends.
Of course, there are those who can have it both ways, giving a lot of time and money each year.
Trisha Perez Kennealy and her husband, Michael J. Kennealy, an entrepreneur and private equity executive, said they took a three-step approach to their educational philanthropy. They work with the public schools in Lexington, Mass., where their three children go, finance scholarships at their alma maters and donate to and serve on the boards of national educational reform groups.
''It's multipronged because we want to make a big change,'' Ms. Perez Kennealy said. ''You only go through third grade once. This is our future.''
But like everyone else I talked to, the Kennealys, who put their annual cash giving in the six figures, are true believers in what a great education can do. ''Everything we have in life we attributed to having a great education,'' Mr. Kennealy said. ''It's gratitude. But it's also the recognition that a great education is not available to everyone else.''

HEADLINE: The Role of the Military in Our Society

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Permanent Militarization of America'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 5):
I applaud Aaron B. O'Connell for his brave and cogent article. The salute of all things military -- and the quick denunciation of any who dare question it -- has become a knee-jerk part of American life. It strikes me as a cynical ploy to ensure that the military-industrial-Congressional-entertainment complex is perpetually well fed, even as spending on the rest of society is cut and the debt balloons.
Dwight D. Eisenhower's warning of the dangers of this imbalance was as prescient as it is unheeded. 
Unlike the case in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, today relatively few Americans have direct contact with the professional troops who fight, even as we enter a second decade of continuous conflict. The cost of our permanent state of war -- in terms of lives, treasure and spiritual health -- is the kind of burden that, in the rearview mirror of history, brings down great nations.
GLENN BAKER Falls Church, Va., Nov. 6, 2012
The writer was a producer for the PBS television shows ''America's Defense Monitor'' and ''Foreign Exchange With Fareed Zakaria.''
To the Editor:
Everyone should heed Aaron B. O'Connell's thoughtful warning about the consequences of our country's ''uncritical support of all things martial.''
Of course we need an effective military for the defense of our country. But it is sad when we reach the point where scrutinizing the cost of that defense is viewed as somehow unpatriotic.
We often hear that our foreign policy should be based on diplomacy, development and defense. Yet as Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary, once observed, there are more people in American military bands than in the United States Foreign Service.
And are the thrills that we and our children get out of the Blue Angels' acrobatics really worth a yearly cost of almost $40 million? The extraordinary attention and resources being devoted to ''all things martial'' should certainly concern us all, especially in these days of financial and economic stress.
WALTER L. CUTLER Washington, Nov. 6, 2012
The writer is a former career diplomat and United States ambassador.
To the Editor:
If Aaron B. O'Connell may understate somewhat the role of economic vested interests, he goes on to most usefully emphasize broader cultural aspects of the normalization of war. Central to such normalization is a heightened rush to designate an ''enemy.''
So long as American foreign policy continues to be tainted by the amorphous concept of a ''war on terror,'' there will never be a dearth of ''enemies,'' or a significant reduction in militarization.
EDWIN M. SCHUR New York, Nov. 5, 2012
The writer is professor emeritus of sociology at New York University.
To the Editor:
Aaron B. O'Connell writes that ''for non-veterans -- including about four-fifths of all members of Congress -- there is only unequivocal, unhesitating adulation'' for the military. This may be an artifact of the times when our soldiers were conscripts, not government employees who voluntarily signed on for military duty.
While military employees deserve high praise for work well done under dangerous circumstances, draftees deserved something more. The government ordered them to pick up a weapon and fight, and those who did so out of pure patriotism perhaps deserved ''unequivocal, unhesitating adulation.''
They got that after World War II, but not after Vietnam; more's the pity.
JEFF COX Kenwood, Calif., Nov. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
How is it that we can talk about the permanent militarization of America when there is no draft and the armed services are more socially isolated than they have been for generations?

HEADLINE: Manila Hospital, No Stranger to Stork, Awaits Reproductive Health Bill's Fate

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
MANILA -- In the main ward at Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital, 171 women and nearly as many newborns share fewer than 100 beds. Dozens more expectant mothers line the street outside, some sleeping on the sidewalk while waiting to get in.
The women, most of whom cannot afford to give birth at a private hospital, move through a type of controlled chaos from the street, to the labor room, to the delivery room, to the maternity ward and back out the door, usually in less than 48 hours. 
''It's a never-ending story, 24 hours a day, every day,'' said Dr. Romeo Bituin, who added that the government-run maternity hospital was legally required to serve as a safety net for the poor. ''We can't reject patients. If we turn them away, where will they go?''
After years of discussion in the Philippine Congress, the House of Representatives finally decided in August to end debate on a reproductive health bill that would subsidize contraception and require sex education in the Philippines, a country with one of the highest birthrates in Asia. If it passes in the House, which returned to session on Monday, the bill will also need to be approved by the Senate.
The bill's proponents, led by President Benigno S. Aquino III, who has made the issue a priority of his two-year-old administration, say the measure will give poor women a chance to have fewer children and rise out of poverty. Opponents, backed principally by the Roman Catholic Church, say the bill is out of step with the moral tenets of the overwhelmingly Catholic Philippines and argue that a high birthrate lessens poverty.
''Our country's positive birthrate and a population composed of mostly young people are the main players that fuel the economy,'' said Jose Palma, the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.
Whether it is a bane or a boon, the birthrate in the Philippines -- 24.98 out of 1,000 people, compared with 13.7 in the United States -- is not a matter of statistics at Fabella. It is a matter of logistics.
The hospital, in a former prison between a public market and the city jail, delivers more babies than any other facility in the Philippines. Last year, 17,639 babies were born there.
The women are allowed into the hospital only when they are ready to give birth. After the birth, they sleep two to a bed in the maternity ward. If they have a healthy delivery without complications, they are sent home after one day.
''We don't have the capacity to let them come in early or stay long after delivery,'' said Dr. Antoinette Pacapac, a spokeswoman for the hospital. ''Our delivery room fills up.''
The hospital averages about 60 deliveries a day in the summer and about 80 deliveries in a 24-hour period during the peak delivery season, September to December.
Fabella, which accepts pregnant women that other facilities reject, charges 3,000 pesos, about $70, for a normal delivery. Women who cannot afford that pay whatever they can. Some babies have been delivered for 100 pesos, about $2.40, while some expectant mothers show up at the hospital without a single peso, hospital officials said.
Most of the women who deliver at Fabella have never had any sexual or reproductive health education -- which is rarely taught here -- and many cannot afford to buy contraception, said Dr. Bituin, who noted that these issues would be addressed by the pending legislation.
''These women will use birth control pills, they will use condoms, but they can't afford them,'' Dr. Bituin said.
''If they received these things for free, they would use them, and fewer of them would end up here,'' he said. ''We are just the last step in the process. We need to advocate reproductive health in the community at the grass roots. The church is already there spreading their message through services every Sunday.''
The hospital does offer family planning information, but budget constraints prevent it from giving patients contraceptives, said Dr. Esmeraldo Ilem, the facility's head of family planning services.
''Family planning in the Philippines is not about population control,'' Dr. Ilem said. ''It is a health intervention. We are focusing on women who are too young, too old, too poor or too sick to have babies but their situation does not allow them to stop.''
That description could be applied to Jelly Galia, a 44-year-old with seven children who was in the main ward after her eighth child died shortly after birth the night before.
Sitting on a bed surrounded by women nursing their newborns, Ms. Galia said she lived with her children in a slum. Her husband is an unemployed taxi driver, and her family has no income.
''I don't want to have any more babies,'' she said, wiping tears from her eyes. ''I would take the pills, but we don't have money to buy those. We'll try 'control,' '' she said, using the local term for abstinence.

HEADLINE: Democrats on Cusp of Winning Supermajority in California Legislature

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- California's Democrats were poised on Friday to gain a two-thirds supermajority in the State Legislature, an achievement that would give them the power to raise taxes unilaterally and could potentially ease the gridlock in a state known for its fiscal chaos.
A supermajority in Sacramento -- last held in 1933 by the Republicans -- would effectively bring one-party rule to the nation's largest state, where Democrats hold all statewide offices and where the Republican Party's declining fortunes have been hastened by a recent nonpartisan redistricting. 
Democrats, as expected, quickly secured a supermajority in the State Senate on Tuesday. But the unexpected possibility of adding a supermajority in the Assembly heightened the Democrats' euphoria after Tuesday's election, in which Gov. Jerry Brown's $6 billion tax initiative, Proposition 30, scored a resounding victory despite fierce opposition from inside and outside the state.
County election officials were still tallying the ballots in two tight Assembly races that Democrats were leading by slim margins and need to secure a supermajority in that chamber. Democratic leaders, however, were already talking about the opportunities and pitfalls of a new era in state government.
''What the people have done is to grant us a tremendous opportunity, but it comes with great responsibility,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the Democratic Senate leader. ''We intend to approach it with strength, with humility and a sense of purpose. Every day when I come to work, I'm going to be aware of the risk of overplaying it.''
For the past decade, California has undergone a series of fiscal crises as the Democratic-controlled Legislature was unable to bring in new revenue through higher taxes, and Republicans adamantly opposed to any new taxes blocked the budgetary process. Mr. Brown's tax initiative is expected to yield $6 billion annually over the next seven years through temporary tax increases, which he said would prevent further cuts in spending, especially in education.
Mr. Steinberg talked of ''reinvesting in California in smart ways.'' But John A. Prez, the Assembly speaker, was more reserved, saying that he did not consider a supermajority a broad electoral mandate.
''Nothing changes,'' Mr. Prez, a Democrat, said in an interview. ''The reality is that voters sent the message to individual districts. This wasn't voters saying: 'How do I cause a two-thirds majority to exist?' ''
Proposition 30's success, he said, was not ''an invitation to go beyond that'' in raising additional taxes, adding that there was no issue that needed to be put on the ballot immediately.
It is not clear to what extent the new revenue will restore deep cuts that have been made in education, health care and other areas. But what is clear, experts said, is that the Democrats will face intense pressure from core supporters like labor unions to increase spending on social programs, possibly through further tax increases.
''Those pressures will be very large, and it's going to be a real test for the party to speak truth to their own constituencies about what's possible,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director at the Edmund G. ''Pat'' Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. ''What could really turn this victory to disaster is if the constituencies within the party begin to fight with each other for scarce resources and say, for example, I was the one who guaranteed the party's victory in the election.''
Mr. Brown repeatedly has emphasized the need for frugality, saying recently that he had eaten a two-day-old tuna sandwich as proof of his personal commitment. He ran for governor in 2010 on a pledge to put any tax increase to the voters. But on Wednesday, he hedged when asked whether he would veto any future tax increase that was approved only by the Legislature.
With Mr. Brown's tax increase now expected to help balance the state budget, Democratic legislators may not have a pressing need to exercise their new power.
''There's kind of an irony in this,'' said Ethan Rarick, director of the Robert T. Matsui Center for Politics and Public Service at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The Democrats now have two-thirds at just the moment that they don't need it, because the voters just raised taxes for them.''
But for Republican lawmakers, whose defining mission in the past decade has been to oppose any tax increase, carving out a new role will be critical. Registered Republicans dipped below 30 percent of the state's electorate for the first time this election.
''We believe we're on the right track,'' Connie Conway, the Assembly minority leader, said of the Republican focus on the budget, jobs and the economy. ''If people aren't hearing this, I need to find out why. Is it my message? Is it the way my message is delivered? Is it the people I have delivering the message? We really want to take some time to figure out what we need to do.''

HEADLINE: Germans Disappointed Obama Will Visit Asia First

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The question on the minds of many in the German capital the morning after Barack Obama secured his second term was not how the re-elected president would save the United States from the ''fiscal cliff,'' or whether he would deliver on his promise to close the detention camp at Guantnamo Bay. It was far more personal: Would he visit Berlin?
The refocusing of U.S. attention on Asia that marked Mr. Obama's first term had already provoked much soul-searching among Germans about the relevance of the trans-Atlantic ties that for decades defined their existence. The shift in America's priorities was further underscored on Thursday, when the White House announced that Mr. Obama's first overseas trip after his re-election would be to an economic summit meeting in Cambodia, with stops in Thailand and Myanmar. 
It is not that Germany has been completely ignored. Mr. Obama traveled to Germany twice during his first term, visiting Baden-Baden in the west and the eastern city of Dresden in 2009. Chancellor Angela Merkel made three trips during Mr. Obama's first four years to Washington, where she was serenaded at a state dinner held in her honor and receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.
But the failure to announce any early state visit to Germany is still perceived in Berlin as a snub, and has helped fuel the urban legend that Mr. Obama has not forgiven Ms. Merkel for refusing to let him speak as a senator before the city's heavily symbolic Brandenburg Gate landmark.
Ms. Merkel's congratulatory telegram to the president, sent Wednesday, made no mention of Berlin, saying only ''it would be a pleasure to welcome you again soon as my guest in Germany.'' But there are strong hopes that the president will return to the capital he electrified in 2008 when he sought with a speech before the Victory Column to burnish his foreign policy credentials for the most powerful job on earth.
''Obama Soon to Berlin'' trumpeted the local B.Z. tabloid on Thursday. Other newspapers speculated about the timing of a possible visit, given that Ms. Merkel faced her own election in 2013, after U.S. ambassador to Germany, Philip D. Murphy, told the German news agency, dpa, that Mr. Obama ''had an extraordinary experience as a senator and I know he wants to come back.''
Germans and Berliners especially, have a unique relationship with the United States, shaped by the formative postwar years when the presence of thousands of American soldiers guaranteed their freedom and safety. The city has provided a dramatic backdrop to U.S. presidents from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan.
''Berlin is not only a place of German history, but of American history,'' said Karsten D. Voigt, who served as his country's coordinator for North American relations and helped arrange Mr. Obama's first visit. ''It is the city where the Americans twice triumphed over evil, first the Nazis and then the Communists.''
Memorials around the city pay tribute to this shared history. From Europe's only Allied Museum near former U.S. barracks that have been transformed into luxury apartments, to a newly laid plaque near the Brandenburg Gate honoring Mr. Reagan's 1987 speech that challenged Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ''tear down this wall.''
More than 20 years after that wall gave way to a push for freedom from the east, the reunified city has emerged as the hip, edgy center of a reunified Europe. Where the romance of Heidelberg, with its hilltop castle, or the cuckoo clocks of the Black Forest drew Americans to Germany in the 1970s and 1980, today Berlin is the magnate, not only for tourists but also for artists, students and tech-savvy entrepreneurs.
An estimated 200,000 people turned out in 2008 to hear Mr. Obama, the man they viewed as embodying the diversity and possibility that is the United States. While they may be critical of his use of unmanned drones in Afghanistan and failure to close the detention center at Guantnamo Bay, polls taken before the U.S. election showed about 90 percent of Germans saying that he would have won their vote.
With the largest economy in Europe, and as the de facto leader of efforts to resolve the three-year-old debt crisis in the euro zone, Germany remains a crucial partner for Washington. For the Germans, the United States remains their second-largest export market, after France. German companies sold about &#x20ac;73.7 billion, or $93.7 billion, in goods to American consumers in 2011.
Yet the two leaders' opposing economic philosophies -- with Mr. Obama pushing Germans to agree to some form of common debt-sharing for Europe and Ms. Merkel insisting on balanced budgets and austerity -- and their reserved personal interaction have repeatedly been interpreted as indicative of a cool relationship.
It is a question that Mr. Murphy, the U.S. ambassador, has had to field time and again on German television and radio: What is the relationship between Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel really like?
''I think they get along very well,'' Mr. Murphy told a German reporter on Wednesday. ''I've said this often, they may look different on the outside, but if you open them up, they've got the same wiring.''
He pointed out the many common views they share on a host of global issues, from preventing a nuclear Iran to exiting Afghanistan to dealing with an emerging China.
Such reassurances, however, appear to have had little success convincing Germans. Images of the president they admire speaking before the chariot-topped columns of the Brandenburg Gate just might.
''We seek in America people who we can identify with,'' Mr. Voigt said. ''And when they do not return the love, we are disappointed.''

POWER
ROCKAWAYS STILL LARGELY BLACKED OUT
The Rockaway Peninsula remained the area worst hit by power failures as residents in homes with no light or heat grew increasingly frustrated with the Long Island Power Authority, which provides electricity there. More than 31,000 customers, nearly the entire peninsula, were without power as of Friday afternoon, the authority reported on its Web site. In the rest of the city, Con Edison reported that it had restored power to all but about 16,000 customers. But even in many areas where the power had been restored, some homes and buildings remained without electricity. The utility said it could not return power to about 35,000 customers in flood-damaged areas like Howard Beach in Queens and Red Hook and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn until electricians certified their homes as safe. 
PUBLIC HOUSING
HOUSING AUTHORITY BUILDINGS SUFFER
More than 21,000 residents in public housing remained without heat or hot water on Friday, according to the New York City Housing Authority, and another 12,800 were without power. Most of the problems were in Brooklyn, where hundreds of apartments in buildings in Coney Island and Red Hook remained without heat or electricity or both.
HOMEOWNER RELIEF
EMERGENCY REPAIR PLAN ANNOUNCED
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a program that, in partnership with FEMA, will send teams of contractors into neighborhoods hit hard by the hurricane to help speed home repairs, without any immediate cost to the homeowners. People can learn about and sign up for the program, called NYC Rapid Repairs, at NYC.gov or by calling 311.
TRANSPORTATION
FERRY FROM THE ROCKAWAYS
Mr. Bloomberg announced a temporary ferry service beginning Monday between the Rockaways and Manhattan. The service is being provided in partnership with SeaStreak. Schedules and departure locations are available at www.seastreak.com and at 311. One-way fares will be $2. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel remained closed by flood damage. Subway service is operating normally on most lines, with some exceptions. Service remains suspended on the N train between 59th Street and Coney Island in Brooklyn, the A train in Far Rockaway, the S Rockaway Park Shuttle, the 1 train between Chambers Street and South Ferry, the R train between Manhattan and Brooklyn and the J train between Chambers and Broad Streets. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials did not estimate when service would be restored.

HEADLINE: Higher Taxes Are to Start With Flip of a Calendar

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Americans' taxes will rise in a few weeks. Though the direction is clear, the exact amount is yet to be determined.
More than a dozen tax cuts are set to expire Dec. 31 and a couple of new taxes are scheduled to start with the new year. Combined, they would affect nearly 90 percent of taxpayers, from the very richest to the very poorest, with the typical household's tax bill rising by about $2,000 in 2013, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Taxes on one-percenters would rise an average of $121,000.
On Tuesday, Congress will reopen discussions about how to deal with the combination of spending cuts and tax increases looming at year-end, and maybe even dip a toe into a broader tax overhaul.
''It would be bad for the economy and it would hit families that are already struggling to make ends meet,'' President Obama said on Friday of the scheduled increases in taxes. ''While there may be disagreement in Congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over $250,000 a year, nobody -- not Republicans, not Democrats -- wants taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year.'' 
While legislators are expected to try to reverse or temper many of the scheduled tax increases, at least a few appear to be a certainty. Accountants and tax lawyers are expecting a flurry of frantic calls in the last few weeks of this year as clients rearrange their affairs to minimize the blow.
''I don't expect to have any respite from now till the end of the year,'' said Robert Willens, the president of his tax and accounting practice in New York. ''Clients are very concerned and kind of confused about what to do, whether they should be taking any affirmative steps or waiting to see what happens.''
INCREASES YOU SHOULD EXPECT At least two categories of tax increases are widely expected to materialize in some form.
A payroll tax cut given in the 2011 and 2012 calendar years -- intended as a temporary stimulus -- is set to expire, and so far both Democrats and Republicans seem ready to let that happen, although there could be some provision made to ease the pain for the lowest earners.
The lapsing payroll tax cut affects everyone who works, or about three-quarters of all tax filers. A household in the middle quintile, roughly between $40,000 and $65,000, can expect its taxes to rise by an average of $672 next year, while a household in the top quintile, being paid more than $108,000, will pay an average of $1,950 more, according to the Tax Policy Center.
With the re-election of President Obama, the taxes imposed by his health care overhaul will also almost certainly remain.
Starting in 2013, high-income Americans will pay an additional tax of 0.9 percent on their earnings above $250,000 if they are married and above $200,000 if filing singly. These households will also pay an additional 3.8 percent on capital gains, dividend and interest income over those same thresholds. The average household in the top income quintile -- the group of Americans most likely to be hit by these new taxes -- will owe an additional $1,141.
TAX CHANGES OBAMA WANTS The fate of the other scheduled tax increases is less clear. Mr. Obama has advocated for some of them, but the Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, have opposed them.
In particular, Mr. Obama wants to let lapse the lower rates begun in the Bush era on income, capital gains and dividends for higher earners, whom he has defined as those earning more than $250,000 for married couples and $200,000 for others.
These tax rates were previously set to expire at the end of 2010, but were extended for two years. Letting them expire at the end of this year would raise an additional $52 billion in 2013.
Allowing the income tax rates for high earners to lapse means that, for married couples, income over $397,000 would be taxed at 39.6 percent instead of the current 35 percent, and that income from $222,300 to $397,000 would be taxed at 36 percent instead of the current 33 percent.
For those in the top income quintile, these provisions would raise their tax liability by an average of $2,282 next year. The top 1 percent of tax filers would owe an additional $45,002.
Allowing the Bush-era capital gains rates to rise would also affect these high-income earners.
This year, investors pay a top marginal tax rate on their long-term capital gains of 15 percent. Under current law, this rate will jump to 20 percent in 2013, not including the additional 3.8 percent increase from the Affordable Care Act on high-income investors described earlier. In addition, a limitation on itemized deductions is also scheduled to kick in at the end of this year that could add another 1.2 percent.
All these changes could effectively raise the capital gains rate to 25 percent on Jan. 1, from 15 percent on Dec. 31. Economists expect to see a lot of investors unloading assets that have done well -- like stocks or even their own businesses -- by the end of this year to take advantage of the lower tax rate.
''There was a good reason for George Lucas to unload Lucasfilm to Disney this year,'' said Len Burman, a professor of public affairs at Syracuse.
After Congress embraced the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which raised the highest capital gains tax rate to 28 percent from 20 percent, capital gains realizations almost doubled as investors scrambled to sell off investments under the lower rate. The reported gains then fell back in 1987.
While he wants to let taxes rise for the wealthy, President Obama would like to extend some provisions passed in the 2009 stimulus bill that primarily benefit lower-income families. These include expansions of the child tax credit, a tax benefit for college students and the earned-income tax credit for larger families and married couples.
Republicans generally want these provisions to expire. Allowing these provisions to lapse most affects households in the lowest quintile, whose taxes would rise an average of $209 next year.
SOME DISAGREEMENTS The estate tax is another sticking point, though both parties do not want the estate tax to rise as sharply as it is scheduled to under current law.
Now, the first $5 million of a person's estate remains untaxed, and anything above that is taxed at 35 percent. At year-end, the effective exemption will fall to $1 million and the top tax rate will rise to 55 percent.
Estate taxes affect very few Americans; only about 0.13 percent of people who die have estates big enough to owe estate tax. If the rates revert to the pre-Bush era level, as planned, that will rise to about 2 percent of estates, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
Mr. Obama has proposed setting the exemption for the estate tax at $3.5 million, indexed to inflation, while Republicans want to eliminate the tax altogether.
''One thing you might see this year is wealthier people gifting significant amounts of their assets, putting them in trusts or giving to their heirs early,'' said Mr. Williams. Still, there are limits on how much people can give away without running into gift taxes, and besides, some wealthy people might be reluctant to divvy up the fortune too soon. ''You might hear some people saying, 'How do I do this without losing control? Can I still keep Junior under my thumb?' '' said Mr. Williams.
There are also a grab bag of previously extended tax provisions that affect households, businesses, charitable giving and many other issues. Neither party seems to want to let these lapse in their entirety, but again, they differ on the details.
INCREASES NOBODY WANTS There are two categories of tax increases that are scheduled to kick in but are widely expected to be tamed because neither party wants them: the end of the Bush-era tax cuts for low- and middle-income families and an expansion of the alternative minimum tax that would capture an additional 26 million taxpayers.
Around 70 percent of tax filers will be affected by the end of the Bush-era tax cuts for those with income under about $200,000 or $250,000 for married couples. Taxes on households in the middle quintile would rise by an average of $888, while taxes on those in the top quintile would rise an average of $3,841.
The alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., sets a minimum tax rate for people earning above a certain income threshold, and was created in a slightly different form in 1969 to make sure wealthy people paid their ''fair'' share of taxes. Taxpayers who earn more than that minimum are supposed to calculate how much they owe under the regular system and how much they owe under the A.M.T., and then pay whichever is larger.
The minimum income that sets off the A.M.T. is not indexed to inflation, however. Over the last decade, Congress has repeatedly passed a temporary ''patch'' so that tens of millions more taxpayers are not captured by it. If Congress does not act before Dec. 31, the A.M.T. will apply to some married couples earning as little as $45,000 and single taxpayers earning as little as $33,750.
At least another patch is considered likely, to keep the A.M.T. from snaring millions of Americans below the median household income. ''Congress doesn't want that to happen, and the president doesn't want that to happen,'' said Mr. Williams. ''The only thing that will stop them from patching it is a total logjam, which we can't totally rule out at this point.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: Tax Raises That May Come: With many tax cuts set to expire on Dec. 31 and some new taxes scheduled to start with the new year, many Americans' tax bills will go up next year. Exactly how much is not yet clear, but here is how some of those changes would affect two types of taxpayers. (Source: Tax Policy Center) (B4)

HEADLINE: The Food Movement Takes a Beating

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Food-labeling and soda-tax measures in California drowned in a sea of cash from deep-pocketed opponents. 

 BODY:
AN election that saw great strides for women, gay men and lesbians and even pot smokers left the nascent food movement scratching its collective head. We're going to see marijuana legalized before we see a simple change in food labeling that's favored by more than 90 percent of Americans? Or a tax on soda, a likely contributor to the obesity problem?
Possibly.
Proposition 37, which would have required packagers to label foods containing genetically modified organisms (G.M.O.'s) as such, was on the ballot in California. As recently as two months ago, the vote for labeling appeared to be a shoo-in. But then the opposition spent nearly a million dollars a day - a total of $46 million, or about five times as much as the measure's backers - not so much chipping away at the lead but demolishing it.
Yes, there were misrepresentations, deceit and outright lies. Yes, there were egregious missteps on the part of California Right to Know, the organization leading the pro-labeling effort. But none of that would have mattered had the money been roughly equivalent.
"This wasn't an election so much as a sale," said Gary Hirshberg, founder of Stonyfield Farm and chairman of Just Label It! a national G.M.O. labeling campaign. He's right, and - as far as I can tell - the only big race in which the loser outspent the winner by a factor of five was in Connecticut, where Representative Chris Murphy managed to overcome a $50 million spending spree by the wrestling magnate Linda McMahon. (It seems that the more voters saw of McMahon, who saturated the airwaves, the less they liked her.)
Money played an equally big role in defeating proposed soda taxes in two small cities, each with about 100,000 people: El Monte, east of Los Angeles, and Richmond, north of Berkeley. Advocates for both were optimistic a month ago, but that was before the anti-tax forces led by beverage companies began throwing money around, spending a combined $3.5 million in both cities. Compare that to the pro-tax forces' total spending: $50,000 in Richmond and about $57,000 in El Monte. In other words, they were outspent by roughly 33 times.
In the three votes, the issue is either transparency - the right to know how the food we eat is produced - or, let's say, wholesomeness: does the food we're eating enhance health or destroy it?
G.M.O. labeling is by far the thornier issue. Labeling is important not so much because G.M.O.'s are "bad" - they have not introduced harmful ingredients into the food chain, and those who argue that they have are taking a position that is difficult to defend - but because once we know what's in food we can better influence how it is produced.
Sensibly or not, many consumers are predisposed against G.M.O.'s; but G.M.O.'s are not exactly evil. A better choice might be a broader discussion about animal welfare. After all, Americans are also predisposed to treat animals fairly, and it could be that a struggle for transparency in livestock production would be more successful: mistreatment of animals is easy to prove, as are the many, many downsides of industrial livestock production. Of course we love our meat, and we don't love our G.M.O.'s. And this is an argument that could go on forever.
The soda issue is simpler. As I've written before, added sugar is the tobacco of the 21st century, and we're just waiting for smoking-gun research that demonstrates that excessive intake of sugar is addictive and leads to obesity, diabetes and more. (Some will argue that this research exists, but ultimately that's a legal question. When a healthy person drinks 10 sodas a day and develops Type 2 diabetes, sues Pepsi and wins, and that victory stands up in a higher court, the research will be validated.) In the meantime, I can't think of a better way of reducing sugar consumption than a tax. It has worked, at least to some extent, for tobacco and it will likely work for soda. (It would also raise money to promote health.)
A month ago, I had high hopes for all three votes, so these losses were disheartening. But there are positives too. The issues were showcased, awareness increased markedly, Big Food had to spend a bunch of money, and four million Californians voted to label foods containing G.M.O.'s. A quarter of those who voted in El Monte and a third of those who voted in Richmond would voluntarily impose new taxes on themselves to protect their children and themselves from sugar-sweetened beverages. I find that downright encouraging.
Just the specter of a soda tax brought millions to a Bay Area city, and much of that money was spent hiring unemployed young people and teaching them the skills of door-to-door canvassing. "It was the best jobs program Richmond ever had," Michael Pollan told me.
Pollan, writing in The Times Magazine last month, suggested that food processors will play Whac-A-Mole as long as their money holds out, spending to defeat local attempts to curb their dominance. "And the game is getting more and more expensive for them," says Pollan. "That's the real soda tax."
Thus Jeff Ritterman, one of the leaders of the Richmond effort, is talking about a "14 in '14" movement, in which he envisions 14 cities voting simultaneously on soda taxes two years from now in an effort to dilute the resources of the anti-tax forces. And, as many supporters (and I) believe, once a soda tax is established in one city, its benefits will become evident and it will spread.
Money, lies and mistakes crushed the forward-thinking votes in California, but these are battles lost in a war that will be won. The notions that we need to know what's in our food and that food should not be harmful have not been defeated. It's a question of finding the right strategy.

HEADLINE: More on Invisible Bond Vigilantes

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Muddled CEOs. 

 BODY:
I argued yesterday that even if the heretofore invisible bond vigilantes materialize one of these days, their attack won't have the effects the deficit hawks imagine. Because America has its own currency and a floating exchange rate, a loss of confidence would lead not to a contractionary rise in interest rates but to an expansionary fall in the dollar. 
Here's a case in point of people getting this wrong: the letter by 15 financial CEOs (pdf) urging a quick resolution of the fiscal cliff.
The letter is actually kind of amazing in a bad way even before we get to that issue: the CEOs apparently can't or won't get their heads around the fact that the fiscal cliff issue is all about doing too much, not too little, to reduce the deficit. Somehow, by the fourth paragraph concerns about a rise in taxes and a fall in spending depressing demand have turned into bond-vigilante fearmongering, with a warning that Moody's might downgrade US bonds and send interest rates up. Guys, that's not what we're talking about here.
But even if we accept the bait-and-switch, from fiscal cliffery to fear of what will happen if we don't have a Grand Bargain now now now; and even if we ignore the likely market reaction to a Moody's downgrade, which would probably be a collective yawn (remember that absolutely nothing happened when S&P weighed in); the logic is still wrong. Even if Moody's succeeded in scaring people, this would mean a weaker dollar rather than soaring rates -- and this would be good, not bad, for the US economy.
It's scary to think that such muddled thinking has dominated "serious" discussion.

HEADLINE: 'The Best Servant by Far'

BYLINE: KEVIN LEVIN


HIGHLIGHT: What happened when a South Carolina slaveowner took his servant with him to war? 

 BODY:
In the spring of 1861 John Christopher Winsmith of Spartanburg, S.C., went to war with all the enthusiasm, determination and clarity of a member of the slaveholding class. Winsmith understood what was at stake, and he urged "the whole South to make common cause against the hordes of abolitionists who are swarming Southwards." 
The framing of the war in such stark terms not only reflected the region's economic and political dependency on slave labor, but a sense of urgency manifested in the violent memory of Nat Turner's 1831 insurrection and, more recently, the failed raid at Harpers Ferry led by John Brown. White Southerners convinced themselves that only outsiders could upset what they believed to be an organic, paternalistic master-slave relationship. 
The Winsmith family, like other slaveholding families, expected their slaves to remain loyal and productive in exchange for a benevolent hand. Christopher, as he was known to his family, not only set out to defend this way of life, but he brought a piece of it with him - in the form of a personal body servant named Spencer. 
During the next 16 months Christopher and Spencer remained side by side, moving from South Carolina to Virginia and back again. Although Spencer's legal status never changed, the challenges associated with being away from home, as well as the exigencies of war, stretched the boundaries of the master-slave relationship to its limit. Their story fits into a broader narrative of the dissolution of slavery on a personal level and, ultimately, the defeat of the Confederacy.
John Christopher Winsmith was born in 1834 to John Winsmith, a member of the state General Assembly, and his wife, Catherine. At age 15, Winsmith attended the Citadel Military Academy in Charleston, but he did not graduate owing to poor conduct: in November 1851 he was brought in front of the college's board of visitors for defrauding "a Negro woman by passing to her a copper coin covered with quicksilver for amount greater than its value." One can only guess at the nature of this transaction, but it may have been sufficiently embarrassing to prevent him from reapplying when given the opportunity. 
Dismissal from the Citadel, however, did not prevent Winsmith from pursuing a law degree at Charleston College, which he completed in 1859. Two years later, he left for war.
Both Winsmith and Spencer departed the family home of Camp Hill with heavy responsibilities, the former having been commissioned a lieutenant in Company G of the Fifth South Carolina Volunteer Infantry. While Winsmith learned the art of command, Spencer acclimated himself to his role as camp servant. Early in the war thousands of slaves followed their masters to war; their presence not only pointed to the social rank of their owners, but also satisfied the need to mobilize as much of the Confederacy's population as possible in the face of a much larger enemy. Indeed, tens of thousands of slaves would be impressed by the Confederate government by the end of the war to work on military projects, often against the protests of their owners, who viewed the policy as a violation of their property rights. 
In addition to ensuring that Winsmith's quarters were kept clean, Spencer washed his master's clothes, prepared his food, brushed his uniforms, polished his swords and buckles, ran errands, foraged and tended his horse. Among all these responsibilities, Winsmith noted, "Spencer has proved himself an excellent cook." 
While it is impossible to ignore Spencer's instrumental value to Winsmith, the two likely found comfort in the shared experience of living away from loved ones. For Spencer, communication with his wife, Peg, and children took place through Winsmith's letters, which regularly included a passing "howdye" or thanks for a recent package toward the end before signing off.
The emotional pain of separation for Spencer was most likely balanced to some degree by the experience of increased privileges. His responsibilities left him with free time to earn extra money, which he did by washing for other men in the company - an arrangement that Winsmith consented to and acknowledged: "He is making more money than any of us." 
Winsmith could have said no, of course, but one thing comes clearly through his letters: Winsmith trusted Spencer, and, in a way, vice versa. Spencer tended to Winsmith during a brief bout with measles, and was even on the receiving end of care when dealing with his own health problems. Spencer performed his duties admirably, and even continued them when Winsmith was assigned to serve on a court-martial trial in May 1861. Winsmith declared Spencer to be "the best servant by far in Camp." 
A reflection of Winsmith's trust can be found in his decision to take Spencer along on picket duty while stationed in Northern Virginia in September 1861. Along with the rest of the patrol, Spencer "could see the Yankees moving about," but he made no attempt to flee. A few days after returning from picket duty, Winsmith told his family that "I do not have any fears of his being deceived by the Yankees."
Winsmith's confidence in Spencer persisted through the first winter of the war and during their journey back to South Carolina in May 1862. By then Winsmith had been transferred to Company H of the First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry and elected as its captain. The unit was first assigned to a Confederate force on James Island, just outside Charleston. Following the battle of Secessionville in June 1862, and as part of the organization of his new regiment, Winsmith spent more time away from camp, first to procure bounties for new enlistees and later to organize conscripts from the area around Columbia. This meant leaving "Spencer in charge of my affairs at camp." 
It was in Columbia where Winsmith learned that Spencer was "missing." Writing to his father, Winsmith promised to provide additional details once he was back in camp, but he urged his father to send another servant as if assuming the unlikelihood of Spencer's return. He learned little upon returning to camp in July:
He went out on Sunday morning the 20th in company with another boy from the Regt, having obtained a permit from Lt. Nesbitt to go for potatoes near River's house, which is not more than  mile from the Stono River, in which there were some Boats. They did not return, and their absence being reported to Maj. Duncan, he sent out several companies to scour the surrounding wood, but nothing could be seen of them, nor of any trace where the Yankees had been. It seems to be a doubtful point whether they went off to the Yankees of their own accord, or were captured. Most of the men in the Co. think Spencer was captured, as he took nothing away with him and went off in his shirt sleeves, and from his conduct nothing had occurred to make them suspect that he meditated on escape. The watch, which he wished to take, was a galvanized one. I hear, that he had bought it in town, and wanted to dispose of it as I had told him he would go home soon. He brought all my things over right when our Regt moved, and I have missed nothing. If he was captured he will very probably make his escape at the first opportunity. 
As that last sentence indicates, Winsmith struggled coming to terms with Spencer's sudden and unexpected disappearance, even going so far as to suggest that his partner had "persuaded him off after they left camp." He would consider any number of explanations but for a desire on his part to be free. Finally Winsmith comforted himself by falling back on the common stereotype that, "negroes are very uncertain and tricky creatures so it is difficult to tell what is the real truth in this case."
The loss of Spencer tugged at Winsmith's emotions, at least at first. "You may know I miss him very much," he admitted to his father, "but I will not let the matter worry me in the least as I know it will do no good." Winsmith's sincere feelings of loss, however, did not overshadow the instrumental role that Spencer had played in his life, and in short order he pressured his father to send along another slave. By the beginning of August, Winsmith had "nothing more to write" about his former servant. 
One of the many tragedies of slavery is its legacy of illiteracy and the lack of a substantial record that gives voice to slaves such as Spencer. In this case, as in so many others, we are forced to rely on brief references from the man who claimed legal title to him to discern what he thought of his own condition. Unfortunately, we know precious little about how Spencer experienced the war. The most we can say is that Winsmith, for all his claims to "know" Spencer, understood very little about him.

David H. Petraeus, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and one of America's most decorated four-star generals, resigned on Friday, admitting that he had shown "extremely poor judgment" after an F.B.I. investigation uncovered evidence that he was carrying on an extramarital affair, Michael D. Shear reports.

        
President Obama believes that he has the people's support on his call for a tax increase on the wealthy and that Tuesday's election serves as proof. Though "open to compromise," he said he would insist that tax increases be part of any agreement to avoid a year-end fiscal crisis, Helene Cooper and Jonathan Weisman report.

        
Christian conservatives are grappling with Election Day results that repudiated their influence in American politics and suggested that the cultural tide - especially on gay issues - has shifted against them, Laurie Goodstein writes. They lost fights against same-sex marriage in all four states where it was on the ballot, and saw anti-abortion-rights Senate candidates defeated and two states vote to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

        
Wisconsin voted against a gay marriage initiative, but the state had no problem electing Representative Tammy Baldwin to be the country's first openly gay senator, Michael M. Grynbaum reports.

        
It did not take much time or cable news analysis for Republicans to begin to weigh the prospects of overhauling immigration policy after Latinos favored President Obama with 71 percent of their votes, Julia Preston reports.

        
The nation's largest state is now the bluest, Norimitsu Onishi reports. Voters in California handed Democrats a supermajority that has not been seen in the State Legislature since 1933.

        
The outcome of several races in Arizona remained a mysteryas more than 500,000 ballots remained uncounted, with voting- and immigrant-rights advocates raising accusations of disenfranchisement, Fernanda Santos reports.
        
George P. Bush, a nephew of former President George W. Bush and a son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, took his first steps toward political office, Manny Fernandez reports.

President Obama evoked the legacy of the nation's last Democratic president in this week's address, saying that combining spending cuts with tax increases on the wealthy was the way "we did it when Bill Clinton was president." He said that his top priority was jobs and growth, "and that's the only way we can afford to invest in education and job training and manufacturing - all the ingredients of a strong middle class and a strong economy." To start doing that, he asked Congress to extend the middle-class tax cuts. "You want cooperation. You want action," he said. "That's what I plan to deliver in my second term, and I expect to find leaders from parties willing to join me."

        
Speaker John A. Boehner renewed calls for averting the so-called fiscal cliff in this week's Republican address, encouraging the Senate to solve the nation's debt through closing some tax loopholes and taking other steps that would not raise taxes on the wealthy. Striking a conciliatory note, he referred to his brief conversation with President Obama this week and said, "If there was a mandate in this election, it was a mandate to work together to do what's in the best interest of our country."
 Happenings in Washington 

        
President Obama and Michelle Obama are scheduled to host a breakfast with veterans at the White House, along with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Dr. Jill Biden. Afterward, Mr. Obama is to visit Arlington National Cemetery to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony and to deliver remarks.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths BERLISS, SUZANNE FRANKEL

 BODY:
BERLISS--Suzanne Frankel, died peacefully on October 31, 2012 at age 94. She is survived by her son, Henry; her grandsons, Jeremy and Jeffrey, and her brother, James. She grew up in Cleveland Heights, OH and, after graduation from Heights High, she attended Goucher College where she graduated in 1940. She married Arthur Berliss, Jr. on August 16, 1940. Sue and Arthur first met when she attended a Yale football game as the date of a mutual friend, Herb Buckman, who remained a lifelong friend of theirs. 
While Arthur served in the US Navy during World War II (much of it overseas), Sue volunteered as a nurse's aide and in other armed services support capacities in New Orleans and other United States cities where Arthur was stationed. Their daughter, Elizabeth, was born October 18, 1943 and their son, Henry, on May 14, 1945. She went back to school and earned a masters degree from Bank Street College in New York City, an institution she continued to actively support and raise substantial funds for. In 1957 Sue began working in the field of early childhood education. Her work assignments ranged from Dalton School to South Bronx day care centers such as Sunshine Day Care Center and Molly Perlbinder Day Care Center. In addition to her support of Bank Street College, Sue was an active board member and fundraiser for Student Advocacy in Elmsford, NY, which gave her great satisfaction. Throughout her life she worked effectively with children and adults of all economic and social backgrounds. She and Arthur traveled extensively, both on their own and with family. In 1975 Sue and all her family mourned the death of her daughter, Elizabeth. Her grandsons, Jeremy and Jeffrey, born in 1976 and 1980 respectively, were always a great source of joy for her and Arthur. Sue always had a great love of classical music, and she played the piano much better than she thought she did. Sue was buried on November 2, 2012 between Arthur and Elizabeth. A memorial service will be scheduled. In lieu of flowers, contributions are suggested to Student Advocacy or Bank Street College, or such other charity that people who knew and loved Sue choose.

HEADLINE: Buyers Fume at Hyundai's M.P.G. Admission

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
Last Friday, following an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hyundai Motor Group admitted it had overstated the fuel economy of 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States over the last two years. But for many Hyundai and Kia owners, the company was merely stating the obvious.
There had been grumbling in online forums, like Edmunds.com and others, that Hyundai was playing games with the E.P.A. testing cycle.
One reads: "Bought 2012 Elantra based on 33 m.p.g. average. After 1,000 miles I do not get 23 m.p.g. Have reported this problem to Hyundai and heard all excuses!"
Another reads: "I've clocked 9,000 km in the past 10 months I've owned this car. I get an average 24 m.p.g. (mostly city driving), which is nowhere near the figures quoted by Hyundai. This is false advertising through and through!" 
Mark Gordon of Whitestone, Queens, 58, a manufacturer's representative who sells bridal gowns, was so disappointed with the fuel economy of the 2012 Elantra he bought last year and with Hyundai's response to his complaints, that he created his own Web site, my2012HyundaiElantragetslousygasmileage.com.
The Elantra is rated at 29 miles per gallon city, 40 highway and 33 m.p.g. combined. Mr. Gordon said he and his wife were lucky to get 22 m.p.g. over all.
When he called Hyundai to complain, "They told me I didn't know how to drive. They were obviously working from a script because I got many e-mails from people all across the country saying they were also getting 22 m.p.g. And they would go to the dealer, and they were told they don't know how to drive."
Because of complaints, he said Hyundai took him for a ride with an engineer. "They told me I drove too fast and that you could not let the r.p.m.'s go over 2,000. He never went into the fast lane, he always drove at 50, but when you are doing this at 2,000 r.p.m.'s, it takes you a half an hour to get up to 50 and it was an extremely unsafe way to drive."
They were able to get it to 35 m.p.g. he said and every time it went over 35 they took a picture of the fuel economy read-out on the dashboard, making him feel like a liar, he said.
A self-described loyal Hyundai owner - he has had six or seven - he contrasts driving the Elantra with driving his 2010 Chevrolet HHR, which he said is rated at 20 m.p.g. city and 30 highway.
"I get 25 m.p.g. over all no matter what I do; and on the highway I get 30 m.p.g.," he said. "I hit the number on the mark. I don't have to watch what the r.p.m.'s are; I don't have to watch whether I'm doing 70 or 30."
Barry Koopersmith said he had trouble achieving stated mileage on the 2011 Elantra GLS that he bought in March 2011. Mr. Koopersmith, 61, an information systems manager who lives in Merrick, N.Y., said in a telephone interview that he had worked at the same company for 18 years and drove to work five miles a day in stop-and-go traffic.
He has been able to achieve only 21 to 22 m.p.g. with the Elantra, he said, but got 24 m.p.g. with his 2007 Nissan Sentra 2.0 S with an identical driving pattern.
He said he noticed the problem immediately after getting the car. Every time he fills up he notes his mileage and how much gas he buys, calculates the miles per gallon and enters the information into a spreadsheet. He also had the car serviced by Hyundai every six months.
When complaining initially, he was told to give it another six months. Then they said give it 10,000 miles. When he took it in for the next service he complained that even though it was rated at 29 to 40 m.p.g. he was getting only 22 m.p.g.
The service technician told him there was nothing wrong with the car.
"He admitted it should be 22, not 29 for city traffic," Mr. Koopersmith said. "He probably won't be quoted on that, but that's what he told me."
When Stacy Bray, 52, a project manager in San Marcos, Tex., complained about the mileage on her 2013 Elantra, she said she was told she "probably had a heavy foot" or was "probably not driving that many freeway miles."
"They just come up with excuses," Mrs. Bray said.
The E.P.A. did not levy fines or sanctions against either Hyundai or Kia. Instead, Hyundai announced that it would restate the fuel economy of the Elantra as 28 m.p.g. city and 38 highway, with a combined average of 32 m.p.g., which is only one or two miles per gallon less than before. That, along with the rest of the settlement, doesn't sit too well with some owners.
"I tried to figure out the difference between what the m.p.g. should be and what I'm actually getting," said Mrs. Bray, who estimates her driving pattern to be 90 percent highway and 10 percent city. "I average around 30 m.p.g. I was expecting to get more like 36. But they are using a figure of two miles to the gallon difference and that's not true. No, it is not two. It's a lot more than two."
She figures she's losing $45 a month because of the difference between what the fuel economy actually is and what was advertised. Meanwhile, Hyundai is saying she might get $45 a year from the settlement.
Mr. Gordon estimates he is likely to get $55 a year under this settlement. "What gets me mad is the E.P.A. found out they fudged on the test and nobody got fined, nobody at Hyundai lost their jobs," Mr. Gordon said. "But they sold 900,000 cars fudging the m.p.g."
Jim Trainor, product public relations senior group manager for Hyundai Motor America, said the company was aware that some owners were unhappy with the compensation being offered but that others were more positive. "I've also seen a lot of people saying, 'Hey good for them for owning up to this and I'm proud to be a Hyundai owner.'"
He cited a J.D. Power & Associates study in which customers were asked to rate how happy they were with their fuel economy. "We were by far No. 1 in pleasing our customers in fuel economy," Mr. Trainor said.
Mr. Gordon says he thinks that Hyundai should be made to buy back the cars and that fines and sanctions should be levied against the automaker.
Mr. Koopersmith estimated he would get $30 a year in the settlement, which he said was not satisfactory.
He would rather have the company admit that the Elantra would get only 22 miles per gallon.
"It's just the principle of the thing," Mr. Koopersmith said. "How can they get away with advertising that and enticing you to get a car and it's not true and then getting away with admitting, 'O.K. I was only off by one.' I don't believe it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Last in Beauty Contests May Be First on Tracks

BYLINE: By PRESTON LERNER

 BODY:
BRASELTON, Ga.
BELTED tightly within the slender carbon-fiber sheath of a black missile known as the DeltaWing, I hurtled over a brow on the Road Atlanta racecourse and knifed down to a 90-degree left-hander at nearly 170 miles an hour.
Despite plenty of racetrack experience, I had my doubts about what would happen next. Critics say that this radical racecar -- a bizarre-looking creation that resembles the Batmobile -- is more likely to fly than to turn. Five days earlier, in fact, it had done just that, flipping into a guardrail after being hit by another car during a prerace test session.
I hammered the brake pedal and clicked the left shift paddle three times to select second gear as my body strained against already taut shoulder harnesses. The carbon-carbon brakes bled off speed at an astonishing rate, and by the time I had to turn left, I was able to glide through the corner with no more drama than easing into a shopping-mall parking space.
This is not to suggest that I'm a hero racecar driver; quite the contrary, to be honest. Instead, my point is that while the DeltaWing looks more like a futuristic mobility pod than a contemporary racecar, it drives like, well, a regular automobile. 
''If I were blindfolded, I wouldn't know the difference between the DeltaWing and a normal car,'' said Gunnar Jeannette, who had driven the hastily repaired machine to a respectable finish here a few days earlier in the 1,000-mile Petit Le Mans sports car race.
Curiously, the inside of the cockpit is just about the only vantage point from which the DeltaWing doesn't seem freakishly different. But its strange appearance from the outside, unlike any other car built for road racing, is an honest indicator of the unique technology it embodies.
The DeltaWing is arguably the most innovative -- and probably the most polarizing -- racecar to appear at least since rear-engine cars replaced traditional roadsters for Indianapolis 500 type events. By virtue of a design that minimizes aerodynamic drag and cuts weight to less than 1,300 pounds, it is able to go roughly as fast as cars that have twice as much horsepower and use twice as much fuel.
''The DeltaWing is all about making history,'' said Dan Gurney, the legendary Southern California driver who has won in many forms of motor sport. ''It's going to have an enormous impact from the standpoint of efficiency, fuel economy, brake wear, tire wear, aerodynamics and power-to-weight ratio.''
The avant-garde shape of the car -- widely panned by both racing fans and participants as being hideous -- and the threat it represents to existing designs has created a legion of detractors. But it has also generated an avid core of supporters who say they believe it holds the key to making motor sports relevant in a world increasingly aware of environmental matters, though that was not the main inspiration for the project.
''I'm not a tree-hugger,'' said Ben Bowlby, the iconoclastic designer of the DeltaWing. ''I'm a racer.
''This is a disruptive technology,'' he continued. ''It may force us to change the way we perceive racecars -- and road cars.''
Bowlby, 45, moved from England to Indianapolis in 2003 to work as the technical director of Chip Ganassi's IndyCar, Nascar and sports car empire.
In 2008, he had an epiphany: the two big front tires on Indy and Formula One cars produced loads of aerodynamic drag that slowed them down. What if he replaced them with two small front tires placed very close together? This would allow him to fashion needle-nose bodywork that minimized drag. Low drag meant that less power would be needed to reach the same speeds.
In 2010, Bowlby's concept was entered in a competition to select a new chassis for the IndyCar series for 2012. The DeltaWing design was rejected because of concerns that the small front tires wouldn't allow the car to turn properly, while the wingless body might be prone to flying uncontrollably.
But officials of the Le Mans endurance race were seduced by Bowlby's mantra: half the power, half the weight, half the fuel and all the speed. So they invited the car to enter a demonstration class showcasing green technology.
With the imprimatur of Le Mans, Bowlby was able to secure backing to build the car. Because the design was so radical, virtually every component had to be custom built. Michelin agreed to create the special tires. (The front tires, a mere four inches wide, look as if they belong on a vintage VW Beetle). Nissan signed on as the lead sponsor and provided a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine, which produces a paltry (by racing standards) 300 horsepower.
In seven months, the DeltaWing went from the drawing board to completion in the shop of Dan Gurney's All American Racers. Three months later, it was racing at Le Mans, where it ran creditably before being knocked into a concrete barrier by another car. It then appeared last month at the Petit Le Mans race, finishing a remarkable 5th over all (running in an exhibition class), silencing cynics who said the car wouldn't perform as advertised.
The DeltaWing is eligible to compete next year in American Le Mans Series sports car races. The A.L.M.S. founder, Don Panoz, who is now the owner of the DeltaWing project, told me at Road Atlanta that he was developing closed-cockpit and road versions of the car.
In some ways, a road car would bring motor sports full circle. Racing began at the turn of the 20th century as a way to demonstrate the capabilities of early automobiles. But it didn't take long for cars to be developed specifically for competition.
In Europe, open-wheel thoroughbreds raced on road courses -- a model that matured into the modern Formula One format -- while in the United States they tended to compete on purpose-built tracks like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Sports cars based on road-going automobiles raced in their own events, most notably the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France.
For much of the 20th century, racing was the crucible in which new automobile technology was perfected before trickling down into the world of everyday road cars. Disc brakes, turbocharging, all-wheel drive and twin-cam engine architecture are just a few of the innovations pioneered by racecars that we now take for granted in our minivans and family sedans.
But by the 1980s and '90s, advances in aerodynamics and electronics had made racecars so fast -- and so potentially dangerous -- that the rules became ever more constraining in an effort to slow the cars. As a result, although hundreds of millions of dollars are spent annually developing cars in Formula One, the technical apogee of the sport, racing no longer generates technology that translates into more sophisticated road cars.
''Formula One is wretched excess,'' said Ricardo Divila, a former designer of Formula One cars and Le Mans prototypes who serves as an engineering consultant to Nissan. ''Formula One has been gelded. You can't do anything interesting anymore but make minute, incremental improvements.''
My brief stint behind the wheel convinced me that the DeltaWing was a textbook example of a better mousetrap. Still, its future remains unclear. Change is an unnerving proposition, and the conservative voices that dominate motor sports haven't embraced a vision that would require a fundamental rethinking of racecar design.
''There's no question that the DeltaWing is stretching the boundaries,'' said Darren Cox, Nissan's director of global motor sports. ''But why should racecars look the way they do today? We're not saying that the DeltaWing is the only answer. We're saying that it raises questions.''

HEADLINE: Political Racism In the Age of Obama

BYLINE: By STEVEN HAHN. 
A professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ''A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration.''

 BODY:
Philadelphia
THE white students at Ole Miss who greeted President Obama's decisive re-election with racial slurs and nasty disruptions on Tuesday night show that the long shadows of race still hang eerily over us. Four years ago, when Mr. Obama became our first African-American president by putting together an impressive coalition of white, black and Latino voters, it might have appeared otherwise. Some observers even insisted that we had entered a ''post-racial'' era.
But while that cross-racial and ethnic coalition figured significantly in Mr. Obama's re-election last week, it has frayed over time -- and may in fact have been weaker than we imagined to begin with. For close to the surface lies a political racism that harks back 150 years to the time of Reconstruction, when African-Americans won citizenship rights. Black men also won the right to vote and contested for power where they had previously been enslaved. 
How is this so? The ''birther'' challenge, which galvanized so many Republican voters, expresses a deep unease with black claims to political inclusion and leadership that can be traced as far back as the 1860s. Then, white Southerners (and a fair share of white Northerners) questioned the legitimacy of black suffrage, viciously lampooned the behavior of new black officeholders and mobilized to murder and drive off local black leaders.
Much of the paramilitary work was done by the White League, the Ku Klux Klan and other vigilantes, who destroyed interracial Reconstruction governments and helped pave the road to the ferocious repression, disenfranchisement and segregation of the Jim Crow era.
D. W. Griffith's 1915 film, ''The Birth of a Nation,'' which played to enthusiastic audiences, including President Woodrow Wilson, gave these sensibilities wide cultural sanction, with its depiction of Reconstruction's democratic impulses as a violation of white decency and its celebration of the Klan for saving the South and reuniting the nation.
By the early 20th century the message was clear: black people did not belong in American political society and had no business wielding power over white people. This attitude has died hard. It is not, in fact, dead. Despite the achievements of the civil rights movement, African-Americans have seldom been elected to office from white-majority districts; only three, including Mr. Obama, have been elected to the United States Senate since Reconstruction, and they have been from either Illinois or Massachusetts.
The truth is that in the post-Civil War South few whites ever voted for black officeseekers, and the legacy of their refusal remains with us in a variety of forms. The depiction of Mr. Obama as a Kenyan, an Indonesian, an African tribal chief, a foreign Muslim -- in other words, as a man fundamentally ineligible to be our president -- is perhaps the most searing. Tellingly, it is a charge never brought against any of his predecessors.
But the coordinated efforts across the country to intimidate and suppress the votes of racial and ethnic minorities are far more consequential. Hostile officials regularly deploy the language of ''fraud'' and ''corruption'' to justify their efforts much as their counterparts at the end of the 19th century did to fully disenfranchise black voters.
Although our present-day tactics are state-issued IDs, state-mandated harassment of immigrants and voter-roll purges, these are not a far cry from the poll taxes, literacy tests, residency requirements and discretionary power of local registrars that composed the political racism of a century ago. That's not even counting the hours-long lines many minority voters confronted.
THE repercussions of political racism are ever present, sometimes in subtle rather than explicit guises. The campaigns of both parties showed an obsessive concern with the fate of the ''middle class,'' an artificially homogenized category mostly coded white, while resolutely refusing to address the deepening morass of poverty, marginality and limited opportunity that disproportionately engulfs African-American and Latino communities.
At the same time, the embrace of ''small business'' and the retreat from public-sector institutions as a formula for solving our economic and social crises -- evident in the policies of both parties -- threaten to further erode the prospects and living standards of racial and ethnic minorities, who are overwhelmingly wage earners and most likely to find decent pay and stability as teachers, police officers, firefighters and government employees.
Over the past three decades, the Democrats have surrendered so much intellectual ground to Republican anti-statism that they have little with which to fight back effectively. The result is that Mr. Obama, like many other Democrats, has avoided the initiatives that could really cement his coalition -- public works projects, industrial and urban policy, support for homeowners, comprehensive immigration reform, tougher financial regulation, stronger protection for labor unions and national service -- and yet is still branded a ''socialist'' and coddler of minorities. Small wonder that the election returns indicate a decline in overall popular turnout since 2008 and a drop in Mr. Obama's share of the white vote, especially the vote of white men.
But the returns also suggest intriguing possibilities for which the past may offer us meaningful lessons. There seems little doubt that Mr. Obama's bailout of the auto industry helped attract support from white working-class voters and other so-called Reagan Democrats across the Midwest and Middle Atlantic, turning the electoral tide in his favor precisely where the corrosions of race could have been very damaging.
The Republicans, on the other hand, failed to make inroads among minority voters, including Asian-Americans, and are facing a formidable generational wall. Young whites helped drive the forces of conservatism and white supremacy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but now most seem ill at ease with the policies that the Republican Party brandishes: social conservatism, anti-feminism, opposition to same-sex marriage and hostility to racial minorities. The anti-Obama riot at Ole Miss, integrated 50 years ago by James H. Meredith, was followed by a larger, interracial ''We Are One Mississippi'' candlelight march of protest. Mr. Obama and the Democrats have an opportunity to bridge the racial and cultural divides that have been widening and to begin to reconfigure the country's political landscape. Although this has always been a difficult task and one fraught with peril, history -- from Reconstruction to Populism to the New Deal to the struggle for civil rights -- teaches us that it can happen: when different groups meet one another on more level planes, slowly get to know and trust one another, and define objectives that are mutually beneficial and achievable, they learn to think of themselves as part of something larger -- and they actually become something larger.
Hard work on the ground -- in neighborhoods, schools, religious institutions and workplaces -- is foundational. But Mr. Obama, the biracial community organizer, might consider starting his second term by articulating a vision of a multicultural, multiracial and more equitable America with the same insight and power that he once brought to an address on the singular problem of race. If he does that, with words and then with deeds, he can strike a telling blow against the political racism that haunts our country.

HEADLINE: And Plug-In Makes Four: Prius's Expanding Family

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif.
THE Toyota Prius may not be a sex magnet, but it provokes strong reactions often bordering on love or hate. These emotional responses helped Toyota establish its original hybrid car as a niche vehicle with a devoted following. But there is now an entire line of Priuses designed to be less polarizing and more attuned to the needs of middle-of-the-road Americans. In other words, as it has gone mainstream, the Prius has been Camryfied.
Since last summer, the familiar compact liftback version has been joined by the Prius V wagon, the Prius C subcompact and now the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. It is not so easy to spot the new Priuses from blocks away -- useful for avoidance maneuvers that can keep you from getting stuck behind the cars' famously slow drivers. The characteristic swoop of the aerodynamic roofline is subdued on the Prius V and nearly absent on the Prius C.
What hasn't disappeared is the hybrid powertrain technology that continues to be the core of every Prius. At this point, the technology seems less miraculous and more like a no-brainer: you save fuel by using an electric motor to assist the gasoline engine, which shuts off entirely at low speeds or when the car is at a standstill. 
This technology gives all Priuses their telltale driving characteristics: an engine that shuts off at stoplights and performs adequately if unremarkably around town, but groans at high r.p.m. as it struggles to accelerate. Partly because of the cars' continuously variable transmission, there is a momentary lag after you step on the accelerator before the wheels gain momentum.
Most hybrids cannot be plugged in. With the addition of the Plug-in Hybrid to the Prius lineup, Toyota can now also appeal to its die-hard green customers who want to drive on grid-supplied energy. The Prius Plug-In joins the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma in this category, with the Ford C-Max Energi and a plug-in version of the Honda Accord to soon follow.
With all Priuses, efficiency is the priority, not plush accommodations or a sporty character. The interior has the feel of a high-tech gizmo, though one more akin to an older PC than to the latest Mac.
The real-world fuel economy is stellar with all four of the latest Priuses: from 40 to 70 miles per gallon depending on the model and how you drive.
Prius fans might talk in highfalutin terms about global warming and the like, but the secret to the success of the most familiar Prius -- now called the Liftback -- is its high level of overall competence with 50 m.p.g. efficiency. The car is functional, offering more legroom and cargo space than even in the popular midsize Toyota Camry.
So why bother with the other models? It comes down to how you use your car. For instance, the Prius V provides more space for family use, like weekend trips.
A few weeks ago, I traveled with my family of four to Big Sur from Berkeley for the weekend, a trip I'd be reluctant to take in the Liftback. There was plenty of room for our gear in the expanded cargo area, and our teenagers had room to stretch out in the back seat. Most important, they barely fought during the 300-mile trip. Sign me up.
Compared with the Liftback, the V is five inches longer over all, and its cargo volume is nearly 13 cubic feet larger. Nearly every measurement -- hip, shoulder and head -- increased by at least a couple of inches.
What's the trade off for the extra room? A dip in combined fuel economy from 51 city, 48 highway m.p.g. to 44 city, 40 highway. Both the Liftback and the V wagon have a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine and a 60-kilowatt electric motor, for total horsepower of 134. In the V, the same hybrid system needs to pull 216 more pounds, so performance can be dull.
On the road to Big Sur, we moved at a leisurely pace in Eco mode, with minimal use of the air-conditioning, and easily managed 45 m.p.g. On the trip back, which was more uphill, the engine labored and the car barely reached its federal 40 m.p.g. highway estimate.
The extra space and flexibility comes at a price: the base-level Liftback is $24,795 and the Prius V starts at $27,335.
If the V is about highway travel, the downsized Prius C is all about the city, commuting and cuteness. The C shaves 19 inches off the Liftback and it's easy to park.
But adult passengers will suffer in the back seat, and the cheap ping of the closing doors -- a characteristic of all the Prius models -- felt even cheaper on the C. Buttons, dials and interfaces were plain. It's what you would expect for an entry-level car, this one offered at $19,745.
Actually, I had the most fun in the Prius C , despite giving up 35 horsepower. (The C has a 1.5-liter engine, compared with 1.8 liters for the others.) My test car was the only one of the four Priuses I drove that had a sunroof. Something about the C's diminutive size, and its slightly less geeky Prius profile, beckoned me to dart through traffic.
Indeed, I employed a heavy right foot in an effort to prove the E.P.A. wrong with its estimate of 53 m.p.g. in the city and 46 on the highway. But I managed only to pull down my real-world combined average to a still-impressive 43 m.p.g. If I had used the C as most Prius drivers are likely to, 50 m.p.g. would be a breeze.
Again, it comes down to why you need a car in the first place. The Prius C would best fit my transportation needs: to get efficiently from Point A to Point B, run errands mostly around town and make an occasional one-hour trip.
The latest of the four Priuses -- the Plug-In Hybrid -- requires the most thought about whether it matches your driving pattern. Starting at $32,760, it's the most expensive -- about $7,000 more than the Liftback and nearly $13,000 more than the Prius C. (With all options, the Prius Plug-In Hybrid tops $40,000.) The Plug-In qualifies for a $2,500 federal tax credit and, in California, a $1,500 state rebate. For some Californians there is another benefit: the Plug-In, unlike other hybrids including Priuses, qualifies a solo driver for the coveted car-pool lanes of crowded freeways.
The outward appearance of the Plug-In Hybrid is identical to the Liftback. The extra money essentially pays for a 4.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion pack -- the others have less advanced nickel-metal-hydride batteries -- that can be recharged with electricity from the power grid. Unlike the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid -- whose wheels are powered solely by electricity, with rare exceptions -- the pluggable Prius blends gas and electricity at various points of the drive cycle. For example, the gas engine usually comes on when the car starts up, to warm the squeaky-clean exhaust system.
Still, for the most part, the gas engine remains dormant for the first dozen miles or so. Thus the ride is very quiet, on par (during those miles) with many purely electric vehicles.
But since you're paying more for those batteries, a Prius shopper needs to evaluate whether the expense is worth it. Ideally, your daily drive would match the 11-mile range of the battery pack and you would then park next to an electric outlet. You need not worry about special charging equipment. Given the size of the battery relative to a pure electric car, charging is easy and takes only three hours with a standard 110-volt outlet. (A 220-volt supply speeds up a full charge to 1.5 hours.)
Here's the right pattern: charge up overnight; drive 11 miles; park and charge at work; drive 11 miles home; and charge again while you have dinner, watch TV or sleep. If you follow this pattern, your gasoline m.p.g. could stay in triple digits.
In my first five days with the Plug-In -- all short trips of 10 to 15 miles, punctuated by a couple of hours on my 220-volt charger at home -- I maintained an average of 74 m.p.g. But a single 80-mile jaunt reduced my week's score to 55 m.p.g. -- not a lot higher than I'd have experienced in the much cheaper Prius C if I'd driven it with a light foot.
For a green-minded driver, choosing among the four Prii -- all stylistically similar, all quite efficient -- is a pleasant exercise.
A dozen years ago, Toyota took an early lead on hybrids and it has never looked back. While competitors try to leap forward with new whiz-bang technology, Toyota is moving on to the next phase: adapting the technology for the mass market. The strategy is working. Toyota expects to sell about one million Priuses worldwide this year, and in September, Prius became the best-selling line of cars in California. Depending on where gas prices go, the rest of the country could follow.

HEADLINE: Dodd-Frank's Flaws

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''One Safety Net That Needs to Shrink'' (Fair Game, Nov. 4), Gretchen Morgenson said that neither major presidential candidate was much engaged in an important economic issue: the possibility that taxpayers might someday have to bail out big institutions again. She also said that many Americans navely believed that the Dodd-Frank law protected them from the perils that might be thrown their way in the event of another financial collapse. 
First, Mitt Romney did say during the campaign that Dodd-Frank was flawed and that he would repeal it if elected. Second, and sadly, huge numbers of Americans would say that they ''don't know who Dodd Frank is.'' They are more interested in the fate of Big Bird.

HEADLINE: The Food Movement Takes a Beating

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
AN election that saw great strides for women, gay men and lesbians and even pot smokers left the nascent food movement scratching its collective head. We're going to see marijuana legalized before we see a simple change in food labeling that's favored by more than 90 percent of Americans? Or a tax on soda, a likely contributor to the obesity problem?
Possibly. 
Proposition 37, which would have required packagers to label foods containing genetically modified organisms (G.M.O.'s) as such, was on the ballot in California. As recently as two months ago, the vote for labeling appeared to be a shoo-in. But then the opposition spent nearly a million dollars a day - a total of $46 million, or about five times as much as the measure's backers - not so much chipping away at the lead but demolishing it.
Yes, there were misrepresentations, deceit and outright lies. Yes, there were egregious missteps on the part of California Right to Know, the organization leading the pro-labeling effort. But none of that would have mattered had the money been roughly equivalent.
"This wasn't an election so much as a sale," said Gary Hirshberg, founder of Stonyfield Farm and chairman of Just Label It! a national G.M.O. labeling campaign. He's right, and - as far as I can tell - the only big race in which the loser outspent the winner by a factor of five was in Connecticut, where Representative Chris Murphy managed to overcome a $50 million spending spree by the wrestling magnate Linda McMahon. (It seems that the more voters saw of McMahon, who saturated the airwaves, the less they liked her.)
Money played an equally big role in defeating proposed soda taxes in two small cities, each with about 100,000 people: El Monte, east of Los Angeles, and Richmond, north of Berkeley. Advocates for both were optimistic a month ago, but that was before the anti-tax forces led by beverage companies began throwing money around, spending a combined $3.5 million in both cities. Compare that to the pro-tax forces' total spending: $50,000 in Richmond and about $57,000 in El Monte. In other words, they were outspent by roughly 33 times.
In the three votes, the issue is either transparency - the right to know how the food we eat is produced - or, let's say, wholesomeness: does the food we're eating enhance health or destroy it?
G.M.O. labeling is by far the thornier issue. Labeling is important not so much because G.M.O.'s are "bad" - they have not introduced harmful ingredients into the food chain, and those who argue that they have are taking a position that is difficult to defend - but because once we know what's in food we can better influence how it is produced.
Sensibly or not, many consumers are predisposed against G.M.O.'s; but G.M.O.'s are not exactly evil. A better choice might be a broader discussion about animal welfare. After all, Americans are also predisposed to treat animals fairly, and it could be that a struggle for transparency in livestock production would be more successful: mistreatment of animals is easy to prove, as are the many, many downsides of industrial livestock production. Of course we love our meat, and we don't love our G.M.O.'s. And this is an argument that could go on forever.
The soda issue is simpler. As I've written before, added sugar is the tobacco of the 21st century, and we're just waiting for smoking-gun research that demonstrates that excessive intake of sugar is addictive and leads to obesity, diabetes and more. (Some will argue that this research exists, but ultimately that's a legal question. When a healthy person drinks 10 sodas a day and develops Type 2 diabetes, sues Pepsi and wins, and that victory stands up in a higher court, the research will be validated.) In the meantime, I can't think of a better way of reducing sugar consumption than a tax. It has worked, at least to some extent, for tobacco and it will likely work for soda. (It would also raise money to promote health.)
A month ago, I had high hopes for all three votes, so these losses were disheartening. But there are positives too. The issues were showcased, awareness increased markedly, Big Food had to spend a bunch of money, and four million Californians voted to label foods containing G.M.O.'s. A quarter of those who voted in El Monte and a third of those who voted in Richmond would voluntarily impose new taxes on themselves to protect their children and themselves from sugar-sweetened beverages. I find that downright encouraging.
Just the specter of a soda tax brought millions to a Bay Area city, and much of that money was spent hiring unemployed young people and teaching them the skills of door-to-door canvassing. "It was the best jobs program Richmond ever had," Michael Pollan told me.
Pollan, writing in The Times Magazine last month, suggested that food processors will play Whac-A-Mole as long as their money holds out, spending to defeat local attempts to curb their dominance. "And the game is getting more and more expensive for them," says Pollan. "That's the real soda tax."
Thus Jeff Ritterman, one of the leaders of the Richmond effort, is talking about a "14 in '14" movement, in which he envisions 14 cities voting simultaneously on soda taxes two years from now in an effort to dilute the resources of the anti-tax forces. And, as many supporters (and I) believe, once a soda tax is established in one city, its benefits will become evident and it will spread.
Money, lies and mistakes crushed the forward-thinking votes in California, but these are battles lost in a war that will be won. The notions that we need to know what's in our food and that food should not be harmful have not been defeated. It's a question of finding the right strategy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Boehner Tells House G.O.P. To Fall in Line

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a conference call with House Republicans a day after the party's electoral battering last week, Speaker John A. Boehner dished out some bitter medicine, and for the first time in the 112th Congress, most members took their dose.
Their party lost, badly, Mr. Boehner said, and while Republicans would still control the House and would continue to staunchly oppose tax rate increases as Congress grapples with the impending fiscal battle, they had to avoid the nasty showdowns that marked so much of the last two years.
Members on the call, subdued and dark, murmured words of support -- even a few who had been a thorn in the speaker's side for much of this Congress.
It was a striking contrast to a similar call last year, when Mr. Boehner tried to persuade members to compromise with Democrats on a deal to extend a temporary cut in payroll taxes, only to have them loudly revolt. 
With President Obama re-elected and Democrats cementing control of the Senate, Mr. Boehner will need to capitalize on the chastened faction of the House G.O.P. that wants to cut a deal to avert sudden tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts in January that could send the economy back into recession. After spending two years marooned between the will of his loud and fractious members and the Democratic Senate majority, the speaker is trying to assert control, and many members seem to be offering support.
''To have a voice at the bargaining table, John Boehner has to be strong,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, one of the speaker's lieutenants. ''Most members were just taught a lesson that you're not going to get everything that you want. It was that kind of election.''
Aides say this is an altered political landscape that Mr. Boehner did not expect. As a result, whether the nation can avoid the so-called fiscal cliff will depend not only on whether Mr. Boehner can find common cause with a newly re-elected, invigorated president, but also whether he can deliver his own caucus.
''I just believe John will have more leeway than in the past Congress,'' said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. ''The election will matter.''
The divide between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner appears wide. In their Saturday addresses, the president demanded immediate House passage of a bill approved by the Senate that would extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for households earning under $250,000, while the speaker said raising tax rates on anyone would be unacceptable.
But beneath the posturing, both men were keeping open avenues of negotiation. Mr. Obama was careful to call for more revenue, not higher tax rates, a demand that could be fulfilled by ending or limiting tax deductions and credits, a path Mr. Boehner has accepted.
The question over what to do about the expiring tax cuts would be swept aside if the parties could reach an agreement before then to overhaul the tax code completely -- and render obsolete the current structure of six income tax rates, all of which would rise on Jan. 1.
Even so, some Republicans have issued a stern warning to Mr. Boehner that he cannot expect their votes if he makes a deal with Democrats before seeking their consent.
''What we've seen in the past is the speaker goes, negotiates with the president, and just before we vote, he tells us what the deal is and attempts to persuade us to vote for it,'' said Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana. ''We're just not very happy with deals being baked, then we're asked to stay with the team and support the speaker.''
Given those conflicting demands, Mr. Boehner must decide whether he wants to seal his role as an essential player in a grand plan to restructure the nation's fiscal condition, or continue the status quo of the very gridlock voters appear to detest.
''I don't want to box myself in, and I don't want to box anyone else in,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters on Friday.
Republican lawmakers and Congressional aides say the situation is not as dire as the conflicts of the past two years, which nearly led to a government default on its debt and included a series of impasses that plunged Congress's approval rating to its lowest recorded level. Any deal with the president would probably lose 60 to 80 Republican votes, but the president would bring along enough Democrats to get it passed.
''When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem getting it passed here in the House,'' Mr. Boehner assured reporters, alluding to the deal struck with Mr. Obama to extend payroll tax cuts, which took Democratic support.
On Wednesday's conference call, their ranks slightly reduced by the election, House Republican leaders presented a united front, a departure from the backbiting of earlier showdowns, the leaders' aides admit. After acknowledging that the election had not gone the way any of them had hoped, Mr. Boehner made an ardent plea for unity, saying they could expect a good deal out of the coming negotiations only if they stuck together.
The handful of Republican backbenchers who spoke up agreed, and those included often-rebellious conservatives like Representatives Phil Gingrey of Georgia and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina.
Before Mr. Boehner went in front of the cameras that afternoon with a carefully worded statement on the fiscal talks, aides say he checked in with another figure he will need on his side, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the defeated vice-presidential nominee and the House Budget Committee chairman. He told Mr. Ryan what he was about to say and assured him he would be welcomed back as chairman, even though he needs a waiver to escape rules limiting chairmen's terms.
Mr. Ryan then went hunting and left Mr. Boehner to deliver his message.
But even his vague comments last week about his openness to new revenues to resolve the fiscal impasse -- and about a desire to work on some sort of immigration reform legislation, in a blunt acknowledgment of his party's weakness among Hispanic voters -- got immediate pushback from some members, including Mr. Fleming and Representative Steve King of Iowa.
Some House Republicans have latched on to their own re-elections to claim a dual mandate.
''The message from this election for me seems to be, 'You guys keep going,' '' said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma. ''The Senate was rewarded for inactivity, the House was rewarded for standing up for its principles and the president was rewarded for his. I was elected by my district to represent their values. I really don't approach this and say, Now I've got to cave to what the Senate or president want.''
Mr. Obama has continued to press his point that he campaigned clearly on a call to allow taxes to rise on the rich. Otherwise, he has said, the poor and middle class would bear all the burden of deficit reduction.
Some Republican members appear ready to accede.
''The election was a wake-up call,'' said one veteran Republican in the House. For many members, ''everyone they knew hated Obama. Everyone they knew agreed exactly with them. And then we lost.''
But other Republicans see a different message.
''If you look at my own election as an example, what voters were saying is they like Obama but they don't trust him on taxes, so they want a check and balance on things,'' said Representative Tom Latham, Republican of Iowa, who convincingly beat a Democratic incumbent, Leonard L. Boswell. Mr. Obama carried Iowa.
Others representing staunchly conservative districts see no reason to give in, even if the nation as a whole sided with the president on taxes.
''A majority of Americans thought it was just fine to raise taxes on higher income people, but that's more of an emotional response, more 'I'm in pain, I want someone else to pay,' '' Mr. Fleming said. But, he added, ''How does that solve America's problems? That's counterproductive to go down that road.''

HEADLINE: Party Digs In Amid Calls to Open China's Politics

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As the Communist Party's 18th Congress approached, Li Weidong, a scholar of politics, made plans to observe a historic leadership battle in one of the world's great nations.
Instead of staying in Beijing to monitor China's once-a-decade transfer of power, Mr. Li boarded a plane.
''I'm going to the United States to study the elections,'' Mr. Li said in a telephone interview during a stopover in Paris. After witnessing the American presidential election on Tuesday, Mr. Li went on the radio for another interview. ''I still think China's politics remain prehistoric,'' he said. ''I often joke that the Chinese civilization is the last prehistoric civilization left in the world.''
With China at a critical juncture, there is a rising chorus within the elite expressing doubt that the 91-year-old Communist Party's authoritarian system can deal with the stresses bearing down on the nation and its 1.3 billion people. Policies introduced after 1978 by Deng Xiaoping lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and transformed the country into the world's second-largest economy. But the way party leaders have managed decades of growth has created towering problems that critics say can no longer be avoided. 
Many of those critics have benefited from China's stunning economic gains, and their ranks include billionaires, intellectuals and children of the party's revolutionary founders. But they say the party's agenda, as it stands today, is not visionary enough to set China on the path to stability. What is needed, they say, is a comprehensive strategy to gradually extricate the Communist Party, which has more than 80 million members, from its heavy-handed control of the economy, the courts, the news media, the military, educational institutions, civic life and just the plain day-to-day affairs of citizens.
Only then, the critics argue, can the government start to address the array of issues facing China, including rampant corruption, environmental degradation, and an aging population whose demographics have been skewed because of the one-child policy.
''In order to build a real market economy, we have to have real political reform,'' said Yang Jisheng, a veteran journalist and a leading historian of the Mao era. ''In the next years, we should have a constitutional democracy plus a market economy.''
For now, however, party leaders have given no indication that they intend to curb their role in government in a meaningful way.
''We will never copy a Western political system,'' Hu Jintao, the departing party chief, said in a speech on Thursday opening the weeklong congress.
The party's public agenda, which Mr. Hu described in detail in his 100-minute address, was laid out in a 64-page report that is in part intended to highlight priorities for the new leaders, who will be announced later this month. Much of the document had retrograde language that emphasized ideology stretching back to Mao and had little in the way of bold or creative thinking, said Qian Gang, the director of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong.
Most telling, there was no language signaling that the incoming Politburo Standing Committee, the group that rules China by consensus, would support major changes in the political system, whose perversions many now say are driving the nation toward crisis.
While Chinese who are critical of the current system generally do not expect a wholesale adoption of a Western model, they do favor at least an openness to bolder experimentation.
''To break one-party rule right now is probably not realistic, but we can have factions within the party made public and legalized, so they can campaign against each other,'' said Mr. Yang, who added that there was no other way at the moment to ensure political accountability.
Only in the last few years has the idea of liberalizing the political system gained currency, and urgency, among a broad cross-section of elites. Before that, as the West foundered at the onset of the global financial crisis, many here pointed to the triumph of a ''China model'' or ''Beijing consensus'' -- a mix of authoritarian politics, a command economy and quasi-market policies.
But the way in which China weathered the crisis -- with the injection of $588 billion of stimulus money into the economy and an explosion of lending from state banks -- led to a spate of large infrastructure projects that may never justify their cost. As a result, many economists now say that China's investment-driven, export-oriented economic model is unsustainable and needs to shift toward greater reliance on Chinese consumers.
Constant lip-service is paid to that goal, and on Saturday, Zhang Ping, a senior official, reiterated that stance. But it will not be easy for the new leaders to carry it out. At the root of the current economic model is the political system, in which party officials and state-owned enterprises work closely together, reaping enormous profits from the party's control of the economy. Under Mr. Hu's decade-long tenure, these relationships and the dominance of state enterprises have only strengthened.
''What happens in this kind of economy is that wealth concentrates where power is,'' said Mr. Yang, the journalist.
The 400 or so incoming members of the party's Central Committee, Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee, as well as their friends and families, have close ties to the most powerful of China's 145,000 state-owned enterprises. The growing presence of princelings -- the children of notable Communist officials -- in the party, the government and corporations could mean an even more closely meshed web of nepotism. It is a system that Xi Jinping, anointed to be the next party chief and president and himself a member of the ''red nobility,'' would find hard to unravel, even if he wanted to.
''There are people who run state-owned enterprises who are Xi Jinping's friends, relatives and old classmates,'' said Zhang Lifan, a historian. ''This group is part of his political energy and support base. If Xi Jinping is willing to reform, he must sacrifice the interests of these people for the long-term good.''
The rules have become so unbalanced against private entrepreneurs that even some who have benefited handsomely from China's growth are denouncing the system. One is Sun Dawu, a party member and the millionaire founder of a rural food conglomerate. He was handed a suspended three-year prison sentence in 2003 for trying to raise capital from local residents. Mr. Sun stayed quiet after his trial, but is now openly critical again.
''The finance system is very corrupt,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The country should allow private banks to do financing, especially for peasants and the rural population.''
China's systemic problems are most evident in the countryside. Land seizures by officials looking to sell property to developers are the most common cause of the growing number of protests.
''Land, finances, medical care and education resources are too concentrated,'' Mr. Sun said. ''The majority of the nation's resources are concentrated on welfare for party members and government workers.''
The growth-at-all-costs development model has also led to widespread environmental destruction and a surge of protests against industrial projects from middle-class urban residents. At a news conference on Thursday, the opening day of the party congress, Yi Gang, deputy governor of China's central bank, acknowledged the problem: ''After 30 years of development, there is no big difference from developed countries in what we eat and wear,'' he said. ''Where we lag behind is in the air and the water.''
But the only way to really address endemic problems like these, critics say, is to create a political system, with checks and balances, that is designed to benefit ordinary Chinese rather than officials and their cronies, and is able to meet the demands of a rapidly changing society.
''It is still possible for China to get on the right track while staying stable,'' said Mr. Li, the scholar who observed the American vote. ''It is also possible, however, for the party to miss the opportunity and devolve into chaos.''

HEADLINE: Hillary's Next Move

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Somewhere Over South America
''Maybe I'll get a decorating show,'' said Hillary Clinton.
It was a few weeks before the election. Clinton was flying back from an overnight trip to Peru, talking -- without any great enthusiasm -- about the topic that would begin to obsess the American political world as soon as the presidential ballots had been counted: Will Hillary run in 2016?
It's more than two months until this inauguration. But the speculation is already roaring. On Friday, Politico reported that Public Policy Polling had a new survey showing that if the Iowa caucuses were held today -- there's a terrifying thought -- Clinton would get 58 percent of the vote. Joe Biden limped in with 17 percent.
Every day, people approach Hillary Clinton and tell her she has an obligation to run and give America its first woman president. ''Yes, they do!'' she laughs, with the trademark H.C. chortle. Being asked to run for president is a kind of side career all by itself. 
Clinton gives many variations on the theme of don't-think-so. (''Oh, I've ruled it out, but you know me. Everybody keeps asking me. So I keep ruling it out and being asked.'') Also a thousand different forms of beats-me. (''I have no idea what I'm going to do next.'') What she does not do is offer the kind of Shermanesque if-nominated-I-will-not-run language that would end the conversation.
Instead, she veers off into a discussion of all the things she'll do when she's no longer secretary of state, and there's time. That led to a mention of her favorite television shows, which are all about house buying and home improvement.
Her top pick is ''Love It or List It,'' in which a couple who are unhappy with their current residence gets to look at new houses while a decorator rehabs their old place. The plot arc is always the same, and in a way, it's sort of Clintonesque. The redecorators find termites or a leaky furnace; the house search goes awry. Everybody's upset! But after a lot of hard work and the final commercial, there's a happy ending.
''I find it very calming,'' she said.
Clinton sounded relaxed and cheerful in the way of people who are in a good mood despite a severe lack of sleep. She was sitting in the little room that serves as her private space on the secretary of state's plane. It's a modest accommodation for the nation's Traveler in Chief -- barely big enough for a table and a small sofa/daybed. You'd think somebody who puts in her kind of hours would get a little plusher ride. During her day in Peru she had given several speeches and multiple TV interviews, toured a textile factory, taken part in a conference on women's empowerment and spent an evening with President Ollanta Humala and his wife, Nadine Heredia.
''It was a long dinner, but it really was a good conversation,'' said Clinton earnestly, describing the president, his wife and the other officials she'd talked with, including the Peruvian minister of development and social inclusion, who she termed ''very savvy.'' Clinton is from the personal relationship school of foreign policy. Her approach to day-to-day diplomacy is not unlike the way she found her footing as a candidate for the United States Senate. Remember the listening tours? Lots and lots of listening tours.
''So, last night at dinner we sat down and had drinks -- there were only like 8 or 10 of us -- and we just talked,'' she said, recounting the evening. ''When somebody comes along like him who has good values, really does care about what he's talking about, there's no substitute for just time spent one on one in small groups.''
If Hillary Clinton ran for president again, she would probably be the best-prepared candidate in American history: one who's lived in the White House, served in the United States Senate, a woman who knows virtually every head of state in the world and also has a strong opinion about the merits of the Peruvian minister of development and social inclusion.
Joe Biden might arguably come close. But we're not going to talk about Joe Biden until we figure out what Hillary's going to do.
Would all that background mean she'd be a great president? Who knows? Americans are always trying to figure out what qualities they should look for in a candidate, and we still have no idea. Republicans were sure this was the time for a successful businessman-turned-governor, but then maybe not. Going into the Oval Office, the elder George Bush was much better prepared than Barack Obama, but we re-elected the one with the shorter rsum.
And would people like a President Hillary Clinton as much as they liked the woman who lost the nomination, who won us over with her remarkable ability to bounce back from disaster?
I always wondered how she regards the arc of her own life. Controversial first lady to betrayed first lady to beloved first lady. Clumsy carpetbagging Senate candidate to New York treasure. Failed presidential candidate to international icon. The theme, it seemed to me, was that you play the cards you're dealt.
Clinton stared for a few seconds. ''I choose my cards,'' she said firmly. ''I choose them. I play them to the best of my ability. Move on to the next hand.''
So the question is, what hand does she choose next?
As everyone knows, Clinton's remaining time in the cabinet is limited. She long ago told President Obama that she wanted to leave after his first term was up. ''Obviously, if he wants to get somebody confirmed I'd be sensitive to that. But it's not going to be much longer.''
Then she is going to chill. While there are many topics on which Hillary Clinton speaks with great passion, at this moment there are very few about which she is as intense as her desire to not do anything.
''I am so looking forward to next year,'' she said. ''I just want to sleep and exercise and travel for fun. And relax. It sounds so ordinary, but I haven't done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired. I work out and stuff, but I don't do it enough and I don't do it hard enough because I can't expend that much energy on it.''
Notice that we are less than a minute into her paean to not doing anything, and already she is planning her workouts.
It seems reasonable to assume that right now, Clinton's lack of interest in a presidential race is genuine. Despite her legendary ability to fall asleep at will -- even on that airplane daybed -- she is really, really tired. And at 65, she has no way of knowing how fully her body will rebound when she stops punishing it.
If Clinton follows through on her plan to not decide anything for a year, it would put the 2016 presidential speculation on ice, at least on the Democratic side. And that would be a signal service to the American public, which needs an election break. No way should we be forced to think about who we want to see in the debates 47 months down the line.
Although we will still have to spend a long time listening to uninterrupted discussions about Jeb Bush versus Paul Ryan.
IN Lima, Clinton addressed a conference called ''Power: Women as Drivers of Growth and Social Inclusion'' wearing a black pantsuit and bright shirt. It brought back memories. One of her unheralded contributions to the cause of American women in politics was to wear exactly that same outfit every day during her first campaign for Senate. After a while, nobody talked about her clothes anymore, and I envisioned a glorious future in which women running for office could just toss on their black pantsuit in the morning and head for the door. But when Clinton ran for president, she went for variety. I always thought it was a shame, but she said she'd just gotten bored.
At the conference, she told the audience that she had just read a -- yes! -- home decorating magazine, which included a 20-page feature on textiles from the Andes, a classic example of big business springing from women's crafts. For a long time, Clinton said, when she talked about giving women opportunity, ''I could see some eyes glazing over.'' But now, she continued, people are beginning to see that empowering women leads to economic development. That you don't espouse women's rights because it's a virtuous thing to do but because it leads to economic growth.
If she really does drop out of politics and move on, this will probably be Clinton's future. Championing the cause of women, continuing her mega-listening tours around the globe, having serious conversations about issues of great import and minimal glamour. At State, she's dug deep into the bureaucracy, trying to ensure that American diplomacy will be promoting women's empowerment many secretaries down the line. ''We've created some positions,'' Clinton said, making a list. ''We have embedded it in the quadrennial diplomacy and development review process...''
That's the thing about Hillary Clinton. Most famous woman in the world, but still a sucker for the quadrennial diplomacy and development review process.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Giving All Citizens a Voice

 BODY:
Readers discuss inequalities in political clout in America.
To the Editor:
Today ends a campaign in which candidates sparred over inequalities of income and wealth. But another form of inequality, political inequality, has received much less attention.
One of the basic tenets of democracy is that the preferences and needs of all citizens should receive equal consideration. If political voice -- expressed when citizens vote, contact public officials, protest, support political organizations, donate to campaigns or otherwise take part in political life -- is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized.
Policy makers hear from a limited, and unrepresentative, set of people who are, on average, better educated and more affluent. Campaign contributors are much more affluent. Those who express political voice also have different life experiences. They are, for example, more likely to have health insurance and to live in a house in good repair.
Political activity by organized interests, which spend huge sums outside campaigns on policy influence, reinforces unequal voice. Organizations representing those with deep pockets vastly outnumber advocates for the middle class and the poor. And of the billions of dollars spent annually on lobbying in Washington, 72 percent comes from organizations representing business interests, and no more than 2 percent from organizations representing the vast majority below the very top. 
What, if anything, can be done?
A now-defunct program from the 1970s subsidized resource-poor citizens' groups to take part in hearings in some government agencies. Twenty-four states have some provision for funding elections through the public treasury. More ambitious would be an educational system that delivered as well for the less privileged as it does for those higher on the ladder.
But there are no silver bullets. Inequality of political voice has long been with us and is deeply entrenched in American politics.
KAY LEHMAN SCHLOZMAN SIDNEY VERBA HENRY E. BRADY Boston, Nov. 5, 2012
The writers are political scientists at Boston College, Harvard and Berkeley, respectively, and co-authors of ''The Unheavenly Chorus: Unequal Political Voice and the Broken Promise of American Democracy.''
Readers React
Professors Schlozman, Verba and Brady have it fundamentally wrong when they write, ''If political voice ... is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized.'' The Constitution does not guarantee every citizen an ''equal voice.'' It guarantees to every citizen an equal vote, and the freedom to use whatever resources are available to that citizen -- be it intelligence, education, charisma, fame, shoe leather and elbow grease, control of a newspaper or wealth -- to persuade his or her fellow citizens to vote in favor of or against candidates.
The notion that the state should intervene to ensure that no citizen has more influence than any other citizen is pernicious and, as the Supreme Court noted in 1976 in Buckley v. Valeo, ''wholly foreign'' to our values and history.
DOUGLAS B. LEVENE Shenzhen, China, Nov. 6, 2012
The writer is a professor at Peking University School of Transnational Law.
As the writers note, there will always be some political inequality: There have always been, and there always will be, citizens whose oratorical prowess, social stature and even physical appearance allow them to wield a greater influence on public opinion than their peers.
What is different now from other eras is the widespread realization, in the wake of the unpopular Wall Street bailouts, that decision makers listen to lobbyists more than to their constituents.
On the right, this manifested itself as the Tea Party; on the left, as Occupy Wall Street. These groups are natural allies, but the left-right paradigm divides and weakens them. What is needed to resolve this discontent is to break out of the left-right, two-party system.
PHILIPPE STEPHENSON Montreal, Nov. 6, 2012
The political inequality in the United States that the writers highlight is largely a function of economic inequality. Those individuals and organizations with more money are able to translate that into political influence through campaign donations, lobbying efforts, contributions to think tanks and so on.
America has the highest level of economic inequality among Western democracies, and it is getting worse rather than better thanks to Republican policies like tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Until we begin to encourage a more fair distribution of income and wealth, political inequality will continue to undermine democracy in this country.
DOUGLAS J. AMY Northampton, Mass., Nov. 6, 2012
The writer is a professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College.
I am amazed that the political scientists did not even mention labor unions. Of course, unions today are no longer as powerful as they once were. After several decades of bashing and busting -- and admittedly too much corruption and association with organized crime -- they have lost much of their political clout.
But there is no doubt that unions are one of the main reasons that the middle class grew and thrived after World War II. Whether workers belonged to unions or not, they enjoyed the benefits of higher wages, better working conditions, health insurance and the retirement plans that unions negotiated.
It is time for us to wake up and realize that we can regain political power in this country only by banding together in some way. And it must be a way that forces the rich and powerful to share their wealth and power. Collective bargaining in the private and public sectors is a very good way to accomplish this goal.
JEFF COLLINS Evanston, Ill., Nov. 6, 2012
When one of my students, Andrew Lipkowitz, and I studied the 21 Senate votes since 2009 on issues that pitted financial institutions against consumers, we found that senators who voted for consumers 35 percent or less of the time received financial industry contributions 58 percent higher than senators who voted for consumers at least 65 percent of the time.
Banks don't win all the time -- Congress created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- but they win a lot of the time. Banks got their bailouts, bankers are paid well and the consumer bureau still doesn't have a permanent director.
JEFF SOVERN Jamaica, Queens, Nov. 6, 2012
The writer is a professor of law at St. John's University School of Law and co-coordinator of the Consumer Law and Policy Blog.
The most glaring political inequality in the United States is the natural-born citizen clause, which effectively separates American citizens into two unequal classes, with one having the right to aspire to reach the presidency, the very summit of political and public life, and the other barred from this for life.
If Americans treasure equal rights before the law, repealing the natural-born clause is the first place to start.
JAN MORUP Copenhagen, Nov. 6, 2012
The Writers Respond
Mr. Levene rightly emphasizes liberty as essential to democracy, but we see no contradiction with our assertion ''If political voice ... is unequal, then equal consideration is jeopardized.''
To understand everyone's needs and concerns, policy makers need be exposed to a representative set of voices. The arms race in campaign funding means that they spend more time with people who have deep pockets and less with people who are worried about finding jobs, paying for college or making sure that their health insurance will cover an expensive treatment.
Those with intelligence, education, charisma or fame will always be more effective in politics, but wealth is different. Political issues divide us on the basis of wealth, but not brains or charisma. As we saw in this campaign, wealth can be deployed anonymously, without the public's knowing its source.
And, as Mr. Amy notes, when economic inequality increases, as it has in America, some people have megaphones costing millions while almost everyone else can only whisper.
Mr. Collins reminds us about the important and diminishing role played by unions in providing political voice for ordinary people. There are nearly a thousand associations active in Washington politics that organize people on the basis of what they do for a living. Other than unions, less than 10 percent bring together people in nonprofessional and nonmanagerial occupations. Not a single one represents unskilled workers who are not union members.
No one would expect full equality of political voice, but we are so far from it as to leave our democracy significantly compromised.

HEADLINE: The Demographic Excuse

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THE Republican Party has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. It just failed to unseat a president presiding over one of the longest stretches of mass unemployment since the Great Depression. In a year when the Senate map offered them numerous opportunities, the Republicans managed to lose two seats instead.
In part, these failures can be attributed to the country's changing demographics. Reliable Republican constituencies -- whites, married couples and churchgoers -- are shrinking as a share of the electorate. Democratic-leaning constituencies -- minorities, recent immigrants, the unmarried and unchurched -- are growing, and voting in larger numbers than in the past. 
But Republicans are also losing because today's economic landscape is very different than in the days of Ronald Reagan's landslides. The problems that middle-class Americans faced in the late 1970s are not the problems of today. Health care now takes a bigger bite than income taxes out of many paychecks. Wage stagnation is a bigger threat to blue-collar workers than inflation. Middle-income parents worry more about the cost of college than the crime rate. Americans are more likely to fret about Washington's coziness with big business than about big government alone.
Both shifts, demographic and economic, must be addressed if Republicans are to find a way back to the majority. But the temptation for the party's elites will be to fasten on the demographic explanation, because playing identity politics seems far less painful than overhauling the Republican economic message.
This explains why many high-profile Republicans responded to last Tuesday's defeat by embracing some form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Fox News's Sean Hannity, a reliable weather vane, publicly converted to the cause of comprehensive immigration reform last week. The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer argued that if the Republican Party embraced amnesty and nominated Marco Rubio, it would win the Hispanic vote outright in 2016, solving its demographic problem in one swoop. Judging from the noises emanating from John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the party's Congressional leadership agrees.
No doubt a more moderate tone on immigration would help Republicans. But the idea of amnesty as a Latino-winning electoral silver bullet is a fantasy.
First, Hispanics are not single-issue voters: they can be alienated by nativism, but they can't just be won by the promise of green cards and open borders. (After Reagan signed an amnesty bill in 1986, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote fell in the next presidential election.) Latino voters are not, as conservative strategists often claim, ''natural'' Republican voters -- notwithstanding their (moderate) social conservatism, they tend to lean leftward on economic issues, and to see government more as an ally than a foe. They can be wooed, gradually, if Republicans address their aspirations and anxieties, but they aren't going to be claimed in one legislative pander.
At the same time, a Republican Party that moves too far leftward on immigration risks alienating its white working-class supporters, an easily disillusioned constituency whose support the party cannot take for granted. These voters already suspect that Republican elites don't have their interests at heart: Mitt Romney lost last week because he underperformed among minority voters, but also because a large number of working-class whites apparently stayed home. If the party's only post-2012 adjustment is to embrace amnesty, they aren't likely to turn out in 2016 either.
What the party really needs, much more than a better identity-politics pitch, is an economic message that would appeal across demographic lines -- reaching both downscale white voters turned off by Romney's Bain Capital background and upwardly mobile Latino voters who don't relate to the current G.O.P. fixation on upper-bracket tax cuts.
As the American Enterprise Institute's Henry Olsen writes, it should be possible for Republicans to oppose an overweening and intrusive state while still recognizing that ''government can give average people a hand up to achieve the American Dream.'' It should be possible for the party to reform and streamline government while also addressing middle-class anxieties about wages, health care, education and more.
The good news is that such an agenda already exists, at least in embryonic form. Thanks to four years of intellectual ferment, Republicans seeking policy renewal have a host of thinkers and ideas to draw from: Luigi Zingales and Jim Pethokoukis on crony capitalism, Ramesh Ponnuru and Robert Stein on tax policy, Frederick Hess on education reform, James Capretta on alternatives to Obamacare, and many more.
The bad news is that unlike a pander on immigration, a new economic agenda probably wouldn't be favorably received by the party's big donors, who tend to be quite happy with the Republican Party's current positioning.
But after spending billions of those donors' dollars with nothing to show for it, perhaps Republicans should seek a different path: one in which they raise a little less money but win a few more votes.

HEADLINE: Investor Doomsday? Well, Not Necessarily

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WITH the election behind us, Wall Street is turning its attention to another suspense thriller: the Washington battle to head off automatic spending cuts and tax increases that could kick the economy into recession next year.
The conventional wisdom is that the fight over this so-called fiscal cliff ''may cause investors to sell, and contribute to more volatility in the coming month or two,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
History shows only that the markets tend to be volatile and unpredictable in the aftermath of close national elections. In election years since 1976, between Election Day and Dec. 31, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost as much as 9.6 percent and gained as much as 7.6 percent. 
Still, despite the real possibility of economic peril -- the Congressional Budget Office predicts that gross domestic product will shrink next year if Congress and the White House can't reach an agreement -- a recession and bear market aren't the only possible outcomes that investors should brace for.
For starters, many economists think that while certain items may be allowed to lapse, like the payroll tax holiday and extended emergency unemployment benefits, they doubt that Congress and the White House would allow the economy to go completely a full fall. In fact, the consensus among forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is that the economy will avoid recession and grow modestly in 2013.
Earlier this year, the budget office predicted that the full possible effects of the situation -- including the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts and automatic spending reductions put in place in last year's contentious debt-ceiling debate -- could shave as much as $800 billion off gross domestic product in 2013.
But Mike Dueker, chief economist for Russell Investments, says he thinks policy makers may ultimately reach a fiscal-tightening agreement that will result in a much smaller drag on G.D.P.
Marie M. Schofield, chief economist at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, agrees that a moderate tightening is likely. ''The question in my mind is if this is going to be a fiscal cliff or a fiscal bunny hill,'' she said. Rather than let everything expire and kick in, she said, Congress could find a way to postpone certain important decisions.
If Congress were to stretch out the crisis over several months, it could mute these problems enough to make them manageable in investors' minds, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
Mr. Paulsen notes that, like the European debt crisis this year, the situation might turn out to be a series of chronic problems that are dealt with sequentially, not as a single financial disaster.
There is some evidence, he says, that the market views the problem in these terms. Despite growing concerns this year, he notes that the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, a closely watched gauge of investor fear, remains below 20, after having approached 50 last summer.
''To me, this is evidence that the financial markets are desensitized to this doomsday thinking,'' he said.
He notes that many elements of the economy are healing in the meantime.
The labor markets, for instance, are slowly but surely improving. Consumer confidence is at a five-year high. And the housing market shows clear signs of a rebound. The latest reading of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, for instance, found that home values in the 20 largest metropolitan markets gained 0.9 percent in August over July.
G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist of Brown Brothers Harriman, says the nascent housing recovery is significant.
''The real engine of economic activity is still personal consumption,'' he said. ''So the housing and labor markets are the canaries in the coal mine for the economy. As long as those parts of the economy are still chirping, we're fine.''
Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, sees another script to consider.
While it's not the most likely outcome, there is a possibility that the debate in Washington will eventually lead to major tax and spending reforms.
Under this bullish alternative, he said, the lame-duck Congress finds a way to postpone spending cuts for at least a couple of quarters. Then, beginning next year, the president and Congress tackle spending, taxes and entitlements not in piecemeal fashion, but through a comprehensive tax reform and deficit reduction plan.
''If that were to happen, in our view, you'd see everyone's 2013 G.D.P. estimates come up,'' he said, adding that it would unleash pent-up demand both in the economy and the markets.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood That Emergency Workers Call Home Is Still Reeling From Storm

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
If any neighborhood could have been expected to cope smoothly with Hurricane Sandy, it should have been Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, which is rich with police officers, firefighters and emergency medics accustomed to dealing with other people's disasters.
Yet, more than a week later, Gerritsen Beach is worse off than all but a few city neighborhoods. Just one block in this seaside enclave of 1,700 homes, nearly a New York City fishing village, has electric power and heat. Shivering residents living in darkened bedrooms and still mourning the loss of treasured possessions are scrambling to feed and clothe themselves and find more tolerable roofs over their heads.
''When its your own, it's more difficult to deal with because your emotions get involved,'' said Doreen Greenwood, chief of the neighborhood's volunteer Fire Department, as she took a break from organizing relief efforts. 
The reason that the enclave is so badly crippled is precisely because Gerritsen Beach, which borders Sheepshead Bay, lives off the water, with residents in the alphabetized rows of winterized bungalows docking cruisers, skiffs and sailboats in the neighborhood's canals. On the night the hurricane hit, the neighborhood experienced a surge of water that Ms. Greenwood described as a ''mini-tsunami.''
''It was at least 10 feet,'' she said. ''I grew up here, and I've never seen anything like this.''
Despite its vulnerable position, the neighborhood was not included among the low-lying coastal patches where evacuation was urged -- Zone A. As a result, many residents who would have sought safety before the storm were forced to abandon their homes in the middle of the flooding and 70-mile-per-hour winds.
A spokesman for the city's Office of Emergency Management, Christopher R. Miller, defended the evacuation designations, saying, ''The city used well-established models'' provided in 2003 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The wave of salt water, mixed with sewage and petroleum from overwhelmed automobiles, flooded almost every basement and many first floors, destroying furniture, appliances and irreplaceable mementos. Some homes have been condemned by city officials as unlivable. Neighborhood detritus -- soggy sofas, kitchen chairs, bedroom lamps, stereo sets -- could be seen piled on sidewalks and in alleys, waiting for garbage trucks to haul them away.
''Everybody's lives have been thrown out on the street,'' said Laura Golding, who has lived in the neighborhood for eight years.
Also destroyed in many homes were basement circuit breakers. Consolidated Edison and National Grid have told residents that power cannot be restored to defective circuit breakers because of the danger of another inferno like the one that consumed much of Breezy Point, Queens, across the Rockaway Inlet. But circuit breakers are harder to find in the region's hardware emporiums than a tank of gasoline in shuttered gas stations. And electricians have to be found to install them and sign the paperwork that will allow Department of Buildings officials to permit a return of power.
State Senator Martin J. Golden showed up in the neighborhood and said afterward that the city needed to call in a major contractor who could coordinate the necessary electrical work because ''the way it's going now, it will take to Christmas.''
Anthony D'Agosta, 55, an unemployed private sanitation worker, lost the contents of his basement recreation room to a rush of water that he said went from ankle-deep ''to four feet in a matter of two minutes and just kept on coming,'' eventually reaching eight feet. Destroyed were a pool table, jukebox and his cherished collection of Dean Martin record albums, autographs, clippings and memorabilia. He blamed the city for not giving him time to relocate his possessions.
''So much for Zone B -- I think they got it wrong,'' he said. ''This is something you see on the news; I never expected to be in it.''
A low-slung building that the ''vollies,'' as the volunteer Fire Department is known, use for training has become the neighborhood's de facto civic center, overflowing with donations of clothes, canned food, toilet paper and thousands of objects given by generous outsiders. Parked outside was a Gorilla Cheese truck that usually caters to the bustling Manhattan lunchtime crowd but is among a number of mobile food vans financed by a City Hall fund to offer residents food -- in this case, free grilled American cheese sandwiches and tater tots.
The neighborhood had the usual complaints about the lack of help from the federal government, but was getting other help. Police cruisers prowled the storm-littered streets and, on every block, a garbage truck seemed to be loading up. There are some advantages to having a neighborhood with so many city workers.
Ms. Golding, wearing a black winter parka against the cold, stepped inside the basement apartment where her widowed mother, Ann Mollo, 84, lives. Lost in the thigh-high deluge were two floral sofas, a breakfront containing her mother's china and porcelain knickknacks, and wedding albums -- hers and her mother's. She repeated a phrase that for her has become almost a mantra.
''Her whole life is out on the street and in the garbage,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Sandy Slapped The Bond Issuers, Too

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IT'S going to take a long time to get over Sandy. For homeowners, towns, hospitals, school districts -- on and on -- the recovery is painfully slow.
Everyone wants the rebuilding effort to go faster. But that takes money -- something that many communities have precious little of. Sandy is likely to weigh on local governments and authorities that are already struggling.
You might think that lightening this burden would be a top priority for Washington. But given our enormous federal deficit, dollars are scarce. Of course, the federal government will send cash to cover emergency costs. But if this turns out to be even more expensive than we thought, local resources will be depleted. 
Compounding the distress, economic activity is also likely to slow after the storm. Measuring the financial impact of an event like Sandy is imprecise. But a 2008 study by Eric Strobl, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn, Germany, provides one benchmark.
His analysis, ''The Economic Growth Impact of Hurricanes: Evidence from U.S. Coastal Counties,'' studied effects of storms going back to 1975. Analyzing 409 coastal counties in 19 Eastern and Southern states, he concluded that counties hit by a hurricane experienced a 0.8 percent decrease in annual economic growth initially.
The year after a storm, Mr. Strobl said, these areas typically rebounded by about 0.2 percent. The net economic impact of these events, therefore, is a decline of 0.6 percent.
That's no small hit, he argued, because the average annual growth rate in these counties is around 1.68 percent.
As economic activity slows, of course, state and local debt issuers that rely on revenue -- think bridge and tunnel authorities and transit systems -- experience lower cash flows. While an analysis by Fitch Ratings of 23 such issuers in Sandy's path concluded that most have enough cash to cover potential shortfalls, Fitch also noted that federal emergency money could not be tapped to cover costs of improvements beyond predisaster status. And insurance policies don't necessarily cover flood damage.
MUNICIPAL finance experts say that larger cities and bigger debt issuers will be less imperiled by Sandy over the long term. But small towns could find it hard to bounce back because their tax rolls may be permanently reduced by the storm.
That's the view of Richard P. Larkin, director of credit analysis at Herbert J. Sims & Company in Iselin, N.J. ''In some of these smaller towns that really got whacked, it may not make sense financially for everyone to rebuild,'' he said. ''When a small town loses a significant portion of its tax base, you wonder what will be left for it to pay its bills. There's nothing on the books that says if a city is destroyed the state will assume the debt.''
Municipalities clearly need all the help they can get right now. And John R. Mousseau, director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors, an asset management firm in Sarasota, Fla., has three ideas for how to deliver much-needed assistance.
First, Mr. Mousseau said, Congress should bring back Build America Bonds, the temporary program created during the credit crisis to raise money for new infrastructure projects.
Almost $200 billion of these bonds were issued from April 2009 to the end of 2010 to build bridges, schools, public hospitals and housing. The federal government paid 35 percent of the interest on the bonds, and public debt issuers saved an estimated $20 billion in borrowing costs, the Treasury Department said.
''Post-Sandy, you're building and rebuilding a lot of stuff,'' Mr. Mousseau said. ''Maybe you don't do it at a 35 percent subsidy, but it's an effective way to lower costs for municipal governments. And the economic multiplier is far larger than that of any transfer payment.''
Mr. Mousseau also urged Congress to lift the restriction barring issuers from being able to refund bonds now that mature in the years to come. This would let issuers shave costs by locking in today's lower interest rates.
By law, issuers can raise money to refund noncallable bonds only once before those bonds mature. During the financial crisis, however, Congress relaxed this law, letting issuers pay off so-called refunding issues a second time.
''If the Port Authority years ago issued 5.5 percent bonds to refund an older 7 percent issue, those bonds may have years till they mature,'' Mr. Mousseau said, referring to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. If Congress changed the law so that the Port Authority could refund that issue again today at 3 percent, it would save a significant amount in debt service costs.
FINALLY, Mr. Mousseau said the storm's effect on public finance issuers underscored the appeal of municipal bond banks that allow small towns or school districts to raise money faster and less expensively than through usual channels.
States organize bond banks as independent authorities that combine numerous local debt issues into a single large deal. Bond banks have their own overseers, and ratings agencies analyze the banks' creditworthiness, grading issues accordingly.
In pooled deals, smaller issuers don't have to pay for their own bond counsels and underwriters, reducing their costs. The offerings can come to market more quickly as well.
Roughly a dozen states have bond banks -- Maine, Vermont and Virginia are three. New Jersey and New York do not have a bond bank; if they did, smaller debt issuers would have an easier time raising money after Sandy, Mr. Mousseau said.
''In these last days of a lame-duck Congress, I hope we'll see them reach across the aisle, not only on the fiscal cliff but also on this problem that needs addressing,'' Mr. Mousseau added. ''People have been wiped out by Sandy, and it should not be business as usual. If things need to be sped up, whether it's issuing bonds or getting utility trucks in place, we've got to do it.''

HEADLINE: Japan Likely to Embrace Free Trade Pact

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In a possible gambit to reverse his governing party's flagging fortunes, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda appears likely to declare Japan's intent to join an ambitious pan-Pacific free trade agreement, then call a snap election in which the party would campaign on that move. 
Major newspapers said on Saturday that support was building in the Noda administration to announce Japan's entry into the proposed American-led regional agreement sometime in the next two months. The reports said that move would be immediately followed by a decision to dissolve Parliament for national elections that would take place a month later.
Japan has long wavered on entry into the pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is opposed by the nation's heavily protected farmers but supported by consumers and industry groups. Because the reports about the government's intentions appeared in most major newspapers, it suggested Mr. Noda's Democratic Party had made a concerted effort to begin signaling a change in strategy.
The state minister for national policy, Seiji Maehara, has also said joining the agreement would become ''a public promise by the Democratic Party that should be a main issue in elections.''
Signing onto the pact is likely to please the United States, which has urged Japan for the last two years to join the group as a way to push the global economy out of its prolonged slump. News reports suggested that the move would also be a way for the government to lash itself even closer to the United States at a time when Japan is increasingly jittery about China's ambitions in the region. The reports described the likely decision to join the pact as a domestic political gamble by the prime minister to prevent his party from a humiliating loss in elections, which must be held before September.
The Democrats have been searching for a way to regain public support after widespread criticism that they mishandled Japan's response to the Fukushima nuclear accident. Mr. Noda's approval ratings have dropped into the teens in recent polls.
When pressed by the opposition on his earlier promises to hold elections ''soon,'' Mr. Noda has said only that he and other party leaders would decide the timing when they were ready.
If he takes a clear stand on the trade pact, Mr. Noda may be aiming to regain support among the Democrats' base of urban white-collar voters and union members. They are expected to welcome the lower prices and increased exports that more open markets are likely to bring.
But such a move would also alienate farmers, one of Japan's most powerful bloc of voters. On Friday, about a half-dozen Democrats said they might defect from the party if Mr. Noda were to back the trade deal.
Joining the pact would also put the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, who currently lead in polls, in an uncomfortable political position. The Liberal Democrats have avoided taking a clear stand on the agreement because they have tried to keep the support of farmers and big business, traditionally the party's two biggest supporters. Mr. Noda may be hoping to hurt the opposition by forcing it to pick one side, news reports said.

HEADLINE: Living in the American Atlantis (Population 14)

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
KASKASKIA, Ill. -- When Manny and Dorothy Brown stand atop the stairs rising to their screen door, they look at the overgrown field across Grand Avenue and still see Kaskaskia's buzzing general store. Fathers are planning turkey shoots; mothers, bake sales. Schwinns clatter past rows of homes while little cowboys and Indians shriek down by the church.
That Kaskaskia is all almost gone now, washed away over the years by two huge Mississippi River floods and then residents' growing suspicion that their quirky and once vibrant town -- the first capital of Illinois -- was vanishing into American history, like wild buffalo or penny postcards. If this country has an Atlantis, it is Kaskaskia, Ill. 
''I'm not coming back if there's another flood,'' said Dorothy Brown, 80, one of only 14 full-time residents left in the three-by-five-block area that makes up Kaskaskia proper. ''I'm too old to clean up that kind of a mess again.''
Fifty other stalwarts still live on the wider expanse of Kaskaskia Island, about 60 miles south of St. Louis and originally not an island at all. French missionaries settled in 1703 on what was then a peninsula in southwestern Illinois territory, with the Mississippi River (and what is now Missouri) on one side and the Kaskaskia River on the other. The outpost preceded St. Louis as the West's primary economic center. It was given a mammoth bronze church bell from King Louis XV -- 11 years before a different one, in Philadelphia, became the Liberty Bell -- and went from French to British to American rule before 1818, when it became the bustling 8,000-resident capital of the new state of Illinois. The capital later moved north to Vandalia and ultimately to Springfield. Floods came and went, but the Mississippi really meant business around the Civil War after upstream steamboats had sheared its shores for firewood, weakening its banks. The river began to creep east across the peninsula's width until, on the night of April 18, 1881, it finally met and slowly overtook the channel on the other side. Kaskaskians moved their church, their cherished bell and a few other buildings brick by brick two miles inland before the original town began slipping slowly under the relocated river.
Suddenly an island cut off from mainland Illinois, the new Kaskaskia has asked residents ever since to put up with some weirdness. No connection was ever built across the new Mississippi, leaving its only access a bridge from Missouri. So getting to this Illinois town requires a 20-minute detour through the neighboring state. Still very much Illinois residents, Kaskaskians eventually lost postal service and now must receive mail at addresses in St. Mary, Mo., causing tax problems galore and more than a few tiffs at the Illinois Department of Motor Vehicles.
''Other people think it's strange, but those of us who have spent our lives here have never had it any other way,'' said Emily Lyons, a lifelong resident and the town's de facto historian.
Losing residents with every passing decade, Kaskaskia had remained large enough to house three schools and about 600 residents when a 1973 flood drowned homes in 13 feet of Mississippi muck. The 200 people who returned and rebuilt were hit with an even more devastating flood in 1993, when 20 feet of water destroyed most homes and the resolve of all but the staunchest loyalists.
Today the church that was moved in the late 19th century is still in use, with bricks on the second floor showing some discoloration where floodwaters rose in 1993. (Mass is on Saturdays because no priest can get there on Sundays.) Louis XV's old bell -- cracked, just like Philadelphia's -- still hangs in a nearby shrine, metaphorically ringing out Kaskaskia's three centuries of history and fortitude.
''People say nothing's down there. But a lot's been here; you just can't see it anymore,'' said Mary Brown, who along with Ms. Lyons has spent countless hours restoring historic buildings on the island. ''We've been handed this baton. Hopefully, the younger ones will have the dedication.''
There are not many younger ones left, alas. With the closest school 20 miles away in Chester, Ill., requiring clunky trips down and through Missouri just to get there, the island has only a few children to inherit their parents' and grandparents' strong ties. Even the mayor is trying to move his family but has not been able to sell his house.
Herbert Klein, a lifelong resident who still farms 330 acres of soybeans on the northern end of the island, where parts of the original town once stood, chuckled and said that floods in 1973 and 1993 did not bode so well for 2013. One family rebuilt a small home on Third Street just this year -- this time, perching it on steel stilts 16 feet above ground level -- but Mr. Klein said that many folks now preferred mobile homes that could be whisked off the island quickly.
''If we have another flood,'' he said of Kaskaskia, ''it's done for.''
Dorothy and Manny Brown, residents since the Depression, figure that floods are more part of their past than their future. Standing on that top step, their eyes below the level of the 1993 flood, they remember what the Mississippi can and probably will someday do. Yet while outsiders look at Kaskaskia and see only water, all they see is home.

HEADLINE: The Building Blocks of Re-election

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY and BILL MARSH. 
Marjorie Connelly is the editor of special polling projects, and Bill Marsh is a graphics editor, at The New York Times.

 BODY:
President Obama secured a second term by preserving much of the diverse mosaic of voters who rallied around him four years ago, overcoming weakened support in his coalition.
Women, Hispanics and Asian-Americans, voters under 45, liberals and moderates, those living in the Northeast and the West, and urban dwellers gave a majority of their votes to Mr. Obama. His opponent, Mitt Romney, lost with a far narrower and less diverse band of support -- mostly men, voters 45 and older, conservatives, Southerners, evangelical Christians and married voters. The gender gap -- the difference between a candidate's votes from men and votes from women -- has been studied for more than 30 years. This election, women were 10 points more likely to support Mr. Obama than men were; four years ago women were 7 points more inclined to vote for him. But in this cycle an even starker imbalance -- the marriage gap -- eclipsed gender. Unmarried women went for Mr. Obama by 23 points over married women, up from 18 points in 2008. 
Men, however, reverted to a familiar pattern this time, after splitting 49 percent for Mr. Obama and 48 percent for Senator John McCain four years ago. They were 8 points more likely to vote for Mr. Romney, and a majority of men over 30 were Romney voters.
By far, the economy was the most important issue to voters throughout this election season, and on Election Day, they split between the two candidates in terms of who could best handle the economy and the deficit.
Voters who say their finances have improved during a president's tenure usually favor the candidate from the incumbent party, while the challenger is preferred by those who describe their financial situation as having deteriorated. That held true this year. Often, those who say their economic condition has remained static divide their support between the two major candidates relatively evenly. This year, though, nearly 3 in 5 backed Mr. Obama.
As usual, few voters crossed party lines. Although the Republican candidate did much better in 2012 with independents than Mr. McCain did four years earlier, it was not enough to overcome the registration advantage Democrats hold over Republicans.
A majority of Protestants, white and Hispanic, supported Mr. Romney. Jewish voters remained firmly in the Democratic column, though Mr. Obama's share was reduced to 69 percent this year from 78 percent in 2008.
Half of all Roman Catholics backed the Democratic candidate, but 59 percent of white Catholics backed Mr. Romney, the highest proportion a Republican candidate has received since exit polling started in 1972. But Hispanic Catholics strongly supported Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Delayed Closings

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
THE extensive power failures that have paralyzed the region in the wake of Hurricane Sandy have understandably delayed closings in mortgage deals that had otherwise been buttoned up. But lenders are adding to the logistical bottleneck by requiring that properties in affected areas be reinspected for damage.
''If you are in a FEMA-declared disaster area or emergency area,'' said Jason Auerbach, a divisional manager for First Choice Loan Services, of Morganville, N.J., ''banks are requiring an inspection of the home to affirm whether there was damage done. They are reinspecting properties to make sure it's still a functional property that can be lived in.'' 
FEMA has declared disaster areas in much of coastal New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. However, even properties outside these areas may still be subject to another inspection because of agreements with the investors who bought closed loans, noted Joshua Weinberg, the senior vice president for compliance of First Choice.
For properties in areas that didn't suffer extensive storm damage, the inspection may constitute no more than a drive-by. The delay in such cases may be no more than a few days.
Both buyer and seller may also be required to sign a form attesting that they agree the property suffered no storm-related damage. Regardless, buyers should do a thorough walk-through well before the day of closing, advises Scott Penner, a real estate lawyer in Milford, Conn.
''What we don't want to have the day of the closing is that they go into the property and see evidence of flood damage,'' Mr. Penner said. ''Then they'll want to negotiate at that time, and it creates all sorts of problems.''
So far, lenders appear to be honoring interest-rate guarantees that have expired because the storm delayed the closing.
''What we've seen is that lenders have extended the rate locks without cost to the borrower,'' Mr. Penner said. ''It's not a requirement, but that's what they've been doing.''
In deals involving storm-damaged properties, negotiations will most likely have to start all over again -- provided the buyer still wants the house.
''Under the contract,'' Mr. Penner said, ''generally the seller is obligated to repair the damage. The question is, can the seller repair it? And is it adequate to the buyer?''
Denise Walsh, a partner in Gigliotti & Walsh Fine Properties, which specializes in beach homes in Fairfield, Conn., was negotiating a deal for a waterfront property when the storm hit.
''Don't you know the buyer got a boat, rowed by the house that he's negotiating and took photos,'' Ms. Walsh said. ''He e-mailed me photos of the property and said: 'Good news! I'm still interested. But what do we do about this?' So now the negotiation is going to take a different turn.''
In cases in which buyer and seller are able to reach a new agreement, an appraiser will be sent out to verify that the house is back in functional condition after repairs are completed.
One factor that buyers may want to consider in deciding whether to go through with a purchase is the prospect of rising premiums.
''Going forward, a lot of insurance companies may re-evaluate their risk exposures,'' noted Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com. ''In Florida, any year in which they have a bad year of hurricanes, there's a mass exodus of insurance companies. This can result in higher premiums.''
As to whether the storm's impact will drive down property values on the coast, Ms. Walsh expects any dip in prices to be short-lived.
''There probably will be some deals,'' she said, ''because there will be some people who don't have the cash to make the repairs, and they will just decide to sell. But I would be shocked if the market didn't go right back to where it was, come the spring.''

HEADLINE: How To Bridge The Hiring Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. GOLDFARB. 
Robert W. Goldfarb is a management consultant and author of ''What's Stopping Me From Getting Ahead?''

 BODY:
MANY newly minted college graduates are filled with anxiety, fearing that they won't find decent jobs despite their knowledge and skills, and that they will never be free of tuition debt. At the same time, executives say they can't find qualified applicants for a wide range of jobs.
So, this fall, I talked to about a dozen C.E.O.'s in a variety of industries, along with more than 135 graduates, to try to get to the bottom of this paradox. 
Instead of finding shared interests linking those who need work and those who need workers, I uncovered a serious divide that limits the success of both.
Every C.E.O. I met described recent graduates as lacking the skills and discipline required in today's workplace. They complained that young employees deemed themselves entitled to promotion before mastering their assigned tasks. All concluded, in effect, ''Let them grow up on someone else's payroll.''
I replied that my interviews with young people showed that many had records of part-time jobs and excellent grades at selective schools that seemed to make them promising candidates. But executives countered that recent graduates had emerged from universities whose weakened requirements didn't prepare them for the complex jobs that companies must now fill.
Recent graduates say they are equipped to add value to any employer who hires them. An economics graduate from the University of North Carolina told me: ''I'm sick of the bashing our generation gets. I had a 3.6 G.P.A. in a demanding major. Everyone in my dorm knew it would be difficult to land a job, so we held study groups where people in different disciplines shared information. We invited alumni to tutor us in skills and office protocol employers value. All I ask is a chance to prove I'm as good as the best of any generation.''
It's true that companies are actively seeking petroleum engineers, systems designers, supply-chain analysts and other graduates armed with ''hard'' skills. But those who majored in English, philosophy, history and other liberal arts subjects are far less likely to be offered an interview, much less a job.
At one time, employers recruited liberal arts graduates whose broad education shaped an inquiring mind and the ability to evaluate conflicting points of view. Their education also brought a freshness of vision that saw alternatives to outdated practices. Graduates entered corporate training programs armed mainly with potential, but soon absorbed business disciplines. Veteran employees seeing that growth didn't laugh when a trainee suggested a different approach to a chronic problem.
Rotating through departments let young people showcase their abilities; the most promising were selected by managers eager to mentor them. Several C.E.O.'s I spoke with, including those most critical of recent graduates, had this type of training. Today, such programs are more likely to recruit those with immediately applicable skills that can be honed on the job. As one hiring manager told me: ''We no longer have the luxury to hire bench strength. If an applicant isn't ready to step into an open job we don't hire them.''
But I've found many broadly educated employees to be quicker than technical staff members to develop the intuition that's crucial on a work floor where gray -- not black or white -- is the dominant color. Many of the best general managers with whom I work as a consultant entered the workplace with broad educations and not with technical degrees. It was their intuition that helped them ascend -- their ability to suspect a flaw even when data appeared correct, to read the mood of customers and employees, and to sense potential in a product others disdained.
EVEN the most technologically innovative companies benefit from having a balance of employees -- most with technical degrees, others with broader educations. Valuable products and services emerge from the clash of ideas between analytical professionals and managers whose greatest strength is their intuitiveness.
Can't someone who can conjugate French verbs, write statistically dense research papers and explicate the poetry of William Blake be trained in computer programming, supply-chain management and other skills valued by hiring managers? An entire generation hopes that C.E.O.'s somewhere believe that giving them an opportunity is the right -- and the smart -- thing to do.

HEADLINE: The Aftermath: A Movement Moves to Relief

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
ON Wednesday night, as a fierce northeaster bore down on the weather-beaten Rockaways, the relief groups with a noticeable presence on the battered Queens peninsula were these: the National Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Police and Sanitation Departments -- and Occupy Sandy, a do-it-yourself outfit recently established by Occupy Wall Street.
This stretch of the coast remained apocalyptic, with buildings burned like Dresden and ragged figures shuffling past the trash heaps. There was still no power, and parking lots were awash with ruined cars. On Wednesday morning, as the winds picked up and FEMA closed its office ''due to weather,'' an enclave of Occupiers was huddled in a storefront amid the devastation, handing out supplies and trying to make sure that those bombarded by last month's storm stayed safe and warm and dry this time.
''Candles?'' asked a dull-eyed woman arriving at the door. 
''I'm sorry, but we're out,'' said Sofia Gallisa, a field coordinator who had been there for a week. Ms. Gallisa escorted the woman in, and someone gave her batteries for her flashlight. As she walked away, word arrived that a firehouse nearby was closing for the night; the firefighters there were hurrying their rigs to higher ground.
''It's crazy,'' Ms. Gallisa later said of the official response. ''For a long time, we were the only people out here doing relief work.''
After its encampment in Zuccotti Park, which changed the public discourse about economic inequality and introduced the nation to the trope of the 1 percent, the Occupy movement has wandered in a desert of more intellectual, less visible projects, like farming, fighting debt and theorizing on banking. While several nouns have been occupied -- from summer camp to health care -- it is only with Hurricane Sandy that the times have conspired to deliver an event that fully calls upon the movement's talents and caters to its strengths.
Maligned for months for its purported ineffectiveness, Occupy Wall Street has managed through its storm-related efforts not only to renew the impromptu passions of Zuccotti, but also to tap into an unfulfilled desire among the residents of the city to assist in the recovery. This altruistic urge was initially unmet by larger, more established charity groups, which seemed slow to deliver aid and turned away potential volunteers in droves during the early days of the disaster.
In the past two weeks, Occupy Sandy has set up distribution sites at a pair of Brooklyn churches where hundreds of New Yorkers muster daily to cook hot meals for the afflicted and to sort through a medieval marketplace of donated blankets, clothes and food. There is an Occupy motor pool of borrowed cars and pickup trucks that ferries volunteers to ravaged areas. An Occupy weatherman sits at his computer and issues regular forecasts. Occupy construction teams and medical committees have been formed.
Managing it all is an ad hoc group of tech-savvy Occupy members who spend their days with laptops on their knees, creating Google documents with action points and flow charts, and posting notes on Facebook that range from the sober (''Adobo Medical Center in Red Hook needs an 8,000 watt generator AS SOON AS POSSIBLE'') to the endearingly hilarious (''We will be treating anyone affected by Sandy, FREE of charge, with ear acupuncture this Monday''). While the local tech team sleeps, a shadow corps in London works off-hours to update the Twitter feed and to maintain the intranet. Some enterprising Occupiers have even set up a wedding registry on Amazon.com, with a wish list of necessities for victims of the storm; so far, items totaling more than $100,000 -- water pumps and Sawzall saw kits -- have been ordered.
''It's a laterally organized rapid-response team,'' said Ethan Gould, a freelance graphic artist and a first-time member of Occupy. Mr. Gould's experience illustrates the effort's grass-roots ethos. He joined up on Nov. 3 and by the following afternoon had already been appointed as a co-coordinator at one of the ''distro'' (distribution) sites.
OCCUPY SANDY was initially the work of a half-dozen veterans of Zuccotti Park who, on the Tuesday following the storm, made their way to public housing projects in the Rockaways and Red Hook, Brooklyn, delivering flashlights and trays of hot lasagna to residents neglected by the government. They arranged for vans to help some people relocate into shelters. When they returned to civilization, they spent the night with their extra bags of stuff at St. Jacobi Evangelical Lutheran Church in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
''They asked if they could crash here,'' said Juan-Carlos Ruiz, a community organizer there who knew the Occupiers from their previous endeavors. ''Those few bags became this enormous organic operation. It's evidence that when official channels fail, other parts of society respond.''
When newcomers arrive at St. Jacobi -- or at its sister site at the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew in nearby Clinton Hill -- they undergo an orientation course during which the volunteering process is explained and people are quickly introduced to the movement's guiding spirit. There is sensitivity training (''We're here to listen and be human'') and door-to-door training for those going into stricken communities.
All participants are asked to write their first names on a piece of masking tape and to place it somewhere prominent on their bodies. The informal atmosphere results in classic Occupy exchanges: ''If you have a car, you should cluster up and go see Alexis in the shearling hat.''
Occupy Wall Street is capable of summoning an army with the posting of a tweet, and many of the volunteers last week were self-identifying veterans of the movement, although many more were not. Given the numbers passing through the churches, both fresh-faced amateurs and the Occupy managerial class -- a label it would reject -- were in evidence.
The St. Luke's kitchen sits in the basement of the church, beside a well-stocked pantry of donations that on Tuesday morning was overflowing with cans of kidney beans, bottles of chocolate syrup, gallon jugs of corn oil and enormous quantities of organic Arborio rice. The peanut-butter-and-jelly team was busy making sandwiches at a table. On the crew that day, there were a Yale University student, a chef on medical leave from an institutional kitchen, a tourist visiting from Luxembourg, a budding fiction writer and an independent radio producer with her 9-year-old son, Zachary.
''We've made everything so far,'' Susie Lindenbaum, an actress, said. ''Rice and beans. Beef chili. Rosemary noodles. A big bread pudding and vegan collard greens.''
Upstairs, contributions arrived around the clock, coming in by telephone or received in person by runners who hauled the goods from cars parked at the curb to a basement sorting space where everything was organized according to handmade signs (''Shoes Here,'' ''Drinks & Water Here''). Volunteer drivers shuttled these supplies to more than 20 ''field sites'' in the hardest-hit locations: Red Hook, the Rockaways and Coney and Staten Islands.
THE Occupiers sometimes say a disconnect exists between the highly functioning distro sites and the more chaotic centers in the field. On election night, for instance, the television network Comedy Central donated 11,000 prepackaged pieces of apple pie, and volunteers who were headed in the morning to Red Hook and beyond were ordered not to leave without an armful. Most of the pies did not make it to their destinations -- not that Ms. Gallisa, the field coordinator working in the Rockaways, would have wanted them. By Wednesday afternoon, with the new storm rolling in, she and her outreach team were scurrying among their various storage sites, trying to secure their own supplies.
Bridging the gap between the churches and the field is Andrew Smith, 27, who early last week was holed up in the St. Luke's organ loft working on a list of crucial chores for the next big project: neighborhood reconstruction. On a giant pad of newsprint, Mr. Smith had jotted down two words: ''Guts Logistics'' -- Occupy Sandy was getting into the renovation business. Under this heading, there were three numbered tasks: ''1) Remove damaged materials. 2) Let buildings air out. 3) Mold remediation.''
''The long-term needs are where the real problems are,'' said Mr. Smith, an experienced Occupier who two months ago helped to plan the protests marking the first anniversary of the Zuccotti occupation. ''Where we're headed now is into cleanup and rebuilding.'' Volunteer brigades were scheduled, he said, to deploy to damaged areas on Saturday and Sunday. A budget for further reconstruction was already being planned.
Indeed, after he finished his to-do list and took the subway south to St. Jacobi, a woman poked her head out from the Staten Island War Room and called to him loudly as he went by, ''Andy, we need more construction workers!'' Acknowledging her request, Mr. Smith went up to the second-story communications room, where a six-person team was working on the protocols for accepting contributions on the phone.
After listening for a moment, Mr. Smith tendered a suggestion and the man in charge -- the name on his masking tape was Peter -- sighed in exasperation. ''Look,'' Peter said, ''the amount of self-organizing here, it's coming a bit too fast. I'm losing track, all right?'' One of his colleagues asked him if he had eaten yet that day; Peter replied that he had not. Mr. Smith reached into his backpack and handed him a sandwich.
Then one of the hot-line operators rushed into the room. It seemed the Red Cross was sending them -- them! -- a tractor-trailer full of fresh wool blankets.
''A tractor-trailer?'' Mr. Smith exclaimed.
Utterly exhausted, he laid his forehead on the shoulder of the Occupier beside him.

HEADLINE: Look Quick, or Pray for a Traffic Jam

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
DON'T stop between 75th and 76th Streets to look up at one of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive's most interesting works of architecture -- you'll get run over. That's because the 1902 Georgian-style East Side House Settlement, once an idyllic waterfront outpost of public charity, is now concrete-bound by six lanes of speeding traffic, completely isolated from the public-benefit nexus it generated.
The migration of Germans, Czechs and other ethnic groups to the Upper East Side in the 1880s brought with it the problems of the working class seen on the Lower East Side. To address them, a group of Episcopalians created the East Side House Settlement in 1891. For a headquarters, they took over an old summer house with a sweeping lawn reaching down to the water. 
The settlement offered a kindergarten, lectures and a gym. It quickly outgrew the wooden house and in 1901 Howells & Stokes were retained to design a rich neo-Georgian librarylike structure of red brick and stone. Clients had only a few short years to enjoy the lawn along the river; soon industrial Exterior Street was cut through, built to keep trucks off inland streets.
In late 1902, just as the building was finished, The New York Times reported that the benefactors had organized a dance at the settlement house: ''Girls of Gentle Breeding Enjoy Unaccustomed Dances With Partners Not in Their Set.''
Plumbers, mechanics and others were paired with society girls, ''to foster the democratic idea.'' The girls, the newspaper reported, were alarmed by a style of dancing unknown to them, in which the man would ''grab her about the waist, lift her off her feet, and after whirling her, place her on her feet.'' The Times allowed that the young men danced well, ''after their own fashion.''
East Side House was organized around clubs for young people and adults: chess, Bible reading, sports and the like. The 1916 Annual Report called the adults ''industrious, hard-working people,'' although requiring instruction in the ''sanitary standards of living.'' On the other hand, in 1902 The New York Tribune described some of its clients as ''the flotsam and jetsam of street boys, mostly confirmed truants at war with the police.''
The report listed classes for immigrants, including ''learning to make shoes in the American way'' and coaching for civil service exams. Staff members also attended court hearings with settlement families, ''when their troubles lead them there.''
In 1912 Mary Trenholm, head worker at East Side House, denounced to The Times the ''subtle poison harming all our femininity'': dances like the Bunny Hug and the Turkey Trot, which she banned at the settlement.
It was one thing for ''the girls who do not have to work'' to engage in these dances, she said, but for those of the lower economic classes, whose honor was not protected by wealth or station, they could easily prove to be a disaster. Miss Trenholm was the daughter of the president of the American Surety Company.
Everett Wheeler, the president of East Side House, felt that another hazard lay with the woman suffrage movement. In a letter to The Times in 1913, he said that if suffragists ''really went honestly to work and earned their own living'' then the ''suffrage dyspeptic'' would disappear.
The East Side House Settlement was a magnet for civic projects. The City of New York created John Jay Park, between 76th and 78th Streets along the East River; the Webster Branch of the Public Library, on York Avenue near 78th; and a public school across the street. Two model housing complexes were built flanking 78th Street, and a public bath was built on 76th.
Even as public health and housing laws improved the lot of the poor and working class, the settlement continued in action. In 1944 The New York Post reported on a folk dance festival for children of French, German, Swedish and other parentage, with the goal of seeing one another as ''mutually American, so that old nicknames and prejudices are forgotten.''
In 1947 the Duke and Duchess of Windsor paid a call. ''Swell,'' said the former Prince of Wales, Emperor of India and King Edward VIII.
Gradually the working-class character of the far East Side diminished, and in 1961 East Side House moved to the Bronx. Its genteel Georgian building, perched on a river-lapped greensward, had been battered and bruised by decades of hard use and imprisoned by the East River Drive, later F. D. R. Drive, which gobbled up Exterior Street in the 1940s.
The Town School took over the structure in 1963, and soon expanded into an old warehouse to the south, facing 75th Street. Then, in the mid-1980s, the Glick Organization bought the warehouse, erecting in its place the tall Promenade apartment building on 75th Street. The Town School was given space on the lower floors.
Now part of the old south-facing Georgian facade survives within a Town School hallway, and part of an old factory is visible in the auditorium. The rest of the 1902 facade faces east, jammed between the Glick project on the south, and the Town School's modern wing on the north.
Millions of cars now speed by its ghostly doorway every year; only if traffic is stopped can drivers pause and puzzle over the large limestone plaque on the second floor, ''East Side House Settlement.''

HEADLINE: Women Fight to Define The Arab Spring

BYLINE: By CAROL GIACOMO

 BODY:
TUNIS
When Mabrouka M'barek is in the Tunisian capital these days, much of her time is spent writing a new constitution as an elected member of the National Constituent Assembly. It is a role the 32-year-old mother of two embraces with idealistic passion and more than a little amazement. Before President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011, she never imagined herself a ''founding mother,'' as she referred to herself in a recent interview, of this country or any other.
Now Mrs. M'barek -- a Tunisian-American whose constituents are Tunisians in the United States, Canada and Europe -- is deep into one of the most important tasks of any new democracy. She is helping to write the document that will underpin the rights and responsibilities shared by the government and its citizens. 
Men overwhelmingly dominate the Arab Spring countries, but women, enabled by advances in literacy and higher education, are increasingly asserting themselves. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria, they have been on the front lines of revolution. These nations will not succeed unless women are fully incorporated into political and economic life.
Women in Arab countries have long lagged behind those in other countries in terms of opportunities and leadership positions in politics and business, and this has hurt the region's overall progress, according to reports by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations Development Program.
Some male leaders are acknowledging the need for change. In Libya last month, Mohamed Sowan boasted that his Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Justice and Development Party had the second-largest number of female members of any party in the Parliament and ''looks forward to them having more participation.'' In Tunisia, Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the intellectual force of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that won the first free election there in 2011, said that in the next election he expects Ennahda's ticket to be half women and ''we might have a larger percentage than in your Congress.'' (In fact, Tunisia has already beaten the United States on that score.)
In Tunisia, the most Western and liberal of the Muslim countries, women won 49 of the 217 Constituent Assembly seats in last year's election. The overwhelming majority of them -- 42 -- were from Ennahda. In Libya, women hold 33 of 200 seats in Parliament.
But numbers are never the whole story. In Libya, women have been excluded from much of the serious decision-making, and the security challenges of a country awash in militias and guns often push their concerns to the back burner, said Alaa Murabit, founder of the Voice of Libyan Women, a nongovernmental activist group. As in much of the Arab world, there are also strong social pressures on women to forgo careers that are ''too successful,'' she said.
The Syrian National Council, the opposition group in exile, failed to name one woman when it chose its decision-making body at a conference in Qatar on Thursday. In Egypt, the streets remain so unsafe for women that vigilante groups have begun forming to mete out unofficial justice against those who harass or assault women. The Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy, who was beaten in Cairo by security forces last year, goes so far as to charge that ''Arab societies hate women.''
The new constitutions are crucial to protecting and expanding women's rights. Not surprisingly, there have been fierce political battles on just these issues. In Egypt, the 100-member assembly drafting a constitution is bickering over a handful of issues, including women's rights, as it races to meet a Dec. 12 deadline. On Tuesday, it eliminated a provision that would have tied some aspects of women's rights, like marriage and inheritance, more firmly to Shariah, or Islamic law. But Egyptian Salafists, ultraconservatives who want to segregate the sexes and ensure that women are veiled, are pushing back. The assembly plans a vote on the constitution this month.
Even in Tunisia, where secularists have a stronger voice and Ennahda has espoused more temperate views than most Islamist parties, women had to take to the streets in protest over efforts by some of the more conservative assembly members to dilute protections for women contained in a 1956 law. The Islamists wanted language in the constitution to say that the roles of men and women are ''complementary.'' The secularists, fearful of ceding any ground, insisted that men and women should have ''the same rights and duties'' and added an assurance that the state will guarantee women's rights. Ennahda leaders say that the final document will unambiguously endorse gender equality and universal rights. But until the constitution is formally adopted, no one can be sure.
Still, the Arab Spring has allowed Muslim girls and women to dream big dreams. ''For young girls to now tell me they want to be the future president, minister of defense, these are things I never imagined,'' Ms. Murabit wrote in an e-mail. But enshrining rights in a constitution and making sure they are carried out are big challenges.
''This is a critical time,'' said Mrs. M'barek. ''There are two steps in a revolution: You break it and then you build something new. That's the hardest.''

HEADLINE: Climate Change: Lessons From Ronald Reagan

BYLINE: By CASS R. SUNSTEIN. 
A professor at Harvard Law School and a former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

 BODY:
THE re-election of President Obama, preceded by the extraordinary damage done by Hurricane Sandy, raises a critical question: In the coming years, might it be possible for the United States to take significant steps to reduce the risks associated with climate change?
A crucial decision during Ronald Reagan's second term suggests that the answer may well be yes. The Reagan administration was generally skeptical about costly environmental rules, but with respect to protection of the ozone layer, Reagan was an environmentalist hero. Under his leadership, the United States became the prime mover behind the Montreal Protocol, which required the phasing out of ozone-depleting chemicals. 
There is a real irony here. Republicans and conservatives had ridiculed scientists who expressed concern about the destruction of the ozone layer. How did Ronald Reagan, of all people, come to favor aggressive regulatory steps and lead the world toward a strong and historic international agreement?
A large part of the answer lies in a tool disliked by many progressives but embraced by Reagan (and Mr. Obama): cost-benefit analysis. Reagan's economists found that the costs of phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals were a lot lower than the costs of not doing so -- largely measured in terms of avoiding cancers that would otherwise occur. Presented with that analysis, Reagan decided that the issue was pretty clear.
Much the same can be said about climate change. Recent reports suggest that the economic cost of Hurricane Sandy could reach $50 billion and that in the current quarter, the hurricane could remove as much as half a percentage point from the nation's economic growth. The cost of that single hurricane may well be more than five times greater than that of a usual full year's worth of the most expensive regulations, which ordinarily cost well under $10 billion annually. True, scientists cannot attribute any particular hurricane to greenhouse gas emissions, but climate change is increasing the risk of costly harm from hurricanes and other natural disasters. Economists of diverse viewpoints concur that if the international community entered into a sensible agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the economic benefits would greatly outweigh the costs.
Skeptics have rightly observed that even aggressive regulatory steps by the United States cannot stop climate change. Greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for decades, and many nations, especially in the developing world, are contributing growing levels of emissions. For this reason, the unilateral actions of any country will not do what must be done to reduce anticipated warming and the resulting harms. Nonetheless, cost-effective reductions from the United States would help, both in themselves and because they should spur technological changes and regulatory initiatives from other nations.
For the United States, some of the best recent steps serve to save money, promote energy security and reduce air pollution. A good model is provided by rules from the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, widely supported by the automobile industry, which will increase the fuel economy of cars to more than 54 miles per gallon by 2025.
The fuel economy rules will eventually save consumers more than $1.7 trillion, cut United States oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by six billion metric tons -- more than the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the United States in 2010. The monetary benefits of these rules exceed the monetary costs by billions of dollars annually.
In a similar vein, recent rules from the Department of Energy are requiring greater energy efficiency from appliances like refrigerators, washing machines and small motors. For these rules as well, the monetary benefits dwarf the costs, and they include large savings to consumers as well as pollution reductions. There is a lot more to achieve in the area of energy efficiency, especially as technologies advance and continue to transform the once-impossible into the eminently doable.
The electricity sector is responsible for more than a third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. In this domain, any regulations must be carefully devised, as they were in the case of fuel economy, to ensure that they do not impose unjustified costs, especially in an economically difficult period. But just as in that case, it should be possible to work with affected companies to identify flexible and cost-conscious approaches, producing reductions while minimizing regulatory burdens.
As in the case of the Montreal Protocol, an effective response to climate change requires many nations to act. China is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter on the planet, and it must become a leader in international negotiations, not an obstacle. But smart initiatives from the United States may well be an indispensable precondition for international efforts.
For those who seek to reduce the risks associated with climate change, it is ironic but true that the best precedent comes from a conservative icon. The big question now is whether today's Republicans will follow Reagan's example.

HAND IN HANDTen Black Men Who Changed America
By Andrea Davis PinkneyIllustrated by Brian Pinkney243 pp. Disney-Jump at the Sun Books. $19.99. (Middle grade; ages 9 to 12)UNSPOKENA Story From the Underground RailroadWritten and illustrated by Henry Cole40 pp. Scholastic Press. $16.99. (Picture book; ages 5 to 9)I HAVE A DREAMDr. Martin Luther King, JrIllustrated by Kadir Nelson40 pp. Schwartz & Wade Books. $18.99. (Picture book; ages 5 to 18)
Before I picked up ''Hand in Hand: Ten Black Men Who Changed America,'' I moderated a panel called ''When Work Disappears,'' comprising an interracial group of lawyers, economists and a journalist turned television producer. And on the whole, the opinions and evidence we shared left the audience, as well as myself, in a ''slough of despond.'' Every aspect painted a bleak picture of African-Americans, including the tragic status of children living in poverty (38 percent); schools ill-equipped to meet students' most basic needs; the disproportionate numbers in prison, most on relatively minor charges; and a rate of unemployment double that of whites. In short: The American dream for African-Americans -- especially young men -- is for now and the foreseeable future an American nightmare. 
With this in mind, I read the preface to ''Hand in Hand,'' which begins, in part,
Gripped iron courage
to withstand:
Degradation
Segregation
Humiliation
Hard frustration.
The author, Andrea Davis Pinkney, who is also a poet, explains that what motivated her to write the book was not least her despair over ''ignorant stereotyping of black males'' and ''the negative impact this has, especially on boys who are developing their self-image.''
''Even in its subtlest forms,'' she says, ''this 'bad press' can stitch a corrosive thread into a kid's psyche and cause him to believe he is inferior or flawed. Once this belief is established, it can be hard to turn around.'' In her brief but uplifting accounts of 10 black men -- Benjamin Banneker, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, A. Philip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Barack Obama -- Pinkney draws lessons aimed at unstitching that ''corrosive thread.'' And she demonstrates in a variety of ways how black men with challenges as great as, if not greater than, those young black men face today beat the odds and used their talents to help others.
Some, like Frederick Douglass, felt the lash of enslavers but refused to be ''broken,'' becoming a powerful force to end slavery. Similarly, Booker T. Washington grew up in a slave cabin, eating leftover slop fed to pigs, and often went to sleep hungry. But when he was nearly 6 years old and made to carry the books of children of the white family his mother worked for, he lingered under the classroom window, taking in what was being taught from those books. ''It was like a breeze on a hot-as-blazes day. Booker couldn't help but let it blow.'' It took a long time, but that breeze eventually carried Washington through school and to the Tuskegee Institute, one of the first colleges for African-Americans in the country.
Pinkney also provides details of Thurgood Marshall's early years when he was a cutup in school; for punishment, he was often sent to the school basement, forced each time to learn a passage of the Constitution. Marshall eventually channeled that energy and accumulated knowledge into the fight for equality. He went on to become the driving force behind the Supreme Court's Brown decision in 1954 that paved the way for thousands of black children, including me, to get an education equal to that of whites. Martin Luther King is one of the few heroes most young people know from the civil rights movement. But Pinkney describes some of the lesser-known factors that helped shape his consciousness, including his being forced to travel 90 miles standing in a bus after giving up his seat to whites.
It was through education that all 10 men not only survived but conquered. For many of them, however, education didn't always come in the traditional ways. Sometimes it was with the help of family, especially black mothers. For example, Banneker was born free, but had no formal schooling. His grandmother taught him to read the only book she owned, the Bible. ''Benjamin learned everything from the begats to the Beatitudes. And by reciting all 150 psalms, Benjamin discovered he could count.'' He went on to ''master the sky's mysteries,'' ultimately creating a widely heralded farmer's almanac ''with everything that was essential to a farmer's success.'' At the other extreme, Pinkney profiles Detroit Red, a young criminal who used and sold drugs, stole from people and experienced the stink and isolation of a prison cell. But with positive mentors in and out of prison who stressed salvation, Detroit Red became Malcolm X, one of the country's most powerful voices for self-worth and black pride.
The rest of the stories in this beautifully written book are equally fascinating, and the entire volume is movingly enhanced by poetry and by the inviting, creative illustrations of Brian Pinkney, the author's husband. Pinkney writes how difficult it was to choose the 10 men for this volume, and I wish she had included at least one of the younger giants of the civil rights movement, many of whom are unknown to today's generation but who were the movement's ''shock troops.'' Still, ''Hand in Hand'' provides a light that could help guide men out of the darkness in which all too many are forced to live.
''Unspoken: A Story From the Underground Railroad,'' by Henry Cole, can be described as ''a wordless Civil War story,'' designed to present youngsters with a moral choice. A slim volume of charcoal drawings, the book follows a white child living with her folks on a farm in what is clearly the Confederate South. Slaves are escaping their captivity via secret routes to the North. One day, as the protagonist is going about her chores, she is startled to hear noises in the corn crib and soon sees an eye peering at her through the stalks. She runs away, frightened. But eventually, confronted with the choice of turning in a runaway slave or helping him, she stealthily smuggles him food.
Cole leaves the narrative to the imagination. What would you do if you had a chance to help a person find freedom? I'm not sure why the only black representation is an eye looking through a hole. But the author, a former teacher, clearly intended ''Unspoken'' to be a challenging book, its somber sepia tone drawings establishing a mood of foreboding. For younger readers, the book presumes adult guidance.
''I Have a Dream'' is one of Martin Luther King's most enduring speeches, made at the historic March on Washington in 1963. It was a march for jobs and freedom for black Americans, and Dr. King's eloquent speech took these causes to another level, as he appealed for justice, unity and brotherhood. In soft earth tones, but sometimes in larger-than-life depictions, the award-winning illustrator Kadir Nelson drives home the message for children of all ages. When Dr. King talks about the ''dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,'' Nelson features on one of the pages two black boys in suits and ties, with similar warm facial expressions, followed on the next page by two appealing black girls in their Sunday school best. Another page shows black and white children in a ring-around-the-rosie scene to illustrate that one day ''little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.'' The book includes a DVD of King's speech and, for younger readers, will require adult context-setting and guidance.
The book ends with a flock of doves at King's finale -- ''Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!'' -- driving home in a creative and accessible way the powerful message, and keeping it alive today. It endures as a refrain we need in our continuing struggle for freedom, justice and equality.

THE OTHER NORMALSBy Ned Vizzini
387 pp. Balzer & Bray. $17.99. (Young adult; ages 13 to 18)
Ned Vizzini has been a professional writer, and a good one, since the 1990s, when he was 15 years old and emerged with a series of vibrant columns for The New York Press about teenage life. Later, one of his novels, ''It's Kind of a Funny Story,'' became a critical and commercial hit, as well as a 2010 movie starring Zach Galifianakis. Vizzini was then, and continues to be now, in full possession of a clever, seductively deadpan voice, as the first few sentences of his new young adult novel, ''The Other Normals,'' bear out: ''This is a story about becoming a man, so naturally it starts with me alone in a room playing with myself. Not that way -- playing Creatures & Caverns, the popular role-playing game. Popular being a relative term. I guess if Creatures & Caverns were really popular, I would have other people to play with.'' 
Here we get the picture with economy. A lonely, dorky kid with a sense of humor is about to tell us a life-changing story. That this tale takes place during the ''last summer before the summers that really count for college'' adds to the urgency. Perry Eckert, the aforementioned affable narrator, clings to his fantasy role-playing game perhaps partly because of the discomfort of being who he is now, and partly out of the fear of what he will soon become. This is a child facing the pressures of an achievement-obsessed world.
It is through his trials in two different realms that Perry will become a man, or at least a more confident teenager. The first is a run-down summer camp where Perry, the only white kid, has been sent by his divorced parents to toughen him up. The second is a world in another universe, somehow linked by Creatures & Caverns to our own, and inhabited by strange centaur-like beings and humanoids of varying hues, including Perry's eventual love interest, a sexy pointy-eared humanoid. Here, too, he is the only white kid.
Vizzini's added conceit is a wormholed update on ''The Corsican Brothers'' by Dumas (pre). In this rendition, we all have a corresponding being somewhere in the multiverse. When something happens to one, it happens to the other, sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad and not always literally. The novel also features a princess being held captive by a monster, and a nerdy African-American buddy who seems distressed by Perry's inability to keep his dorkiness in check around the bunk at their decidedly anti-fantasy-game camp.
Some of this is stock material, but Vizzini knows how to twist expectations. The princess turns out not to be the damsel in distress we reckoned. Perry's best otherworldly friend smokes earth pebbles in a pipe to get high. And the arrival of a single pubic hair triggers a moment of horrific comedy (though the consequences are sadly erased).
Vizzini is smart to avoid getting bogged down in the particulars of his invented diversion, Creatures & Caverns. The game Perry plays obsessively at the beginning of the novel is quickly confiscated at camp and doesn't figure largely in the later narrative, certainly not to the extent the title game does in the 1982 moral panic-button TV movie ''Mazes and Monsters,'' based on a Rona Jaffe novel, in which a young Tom Hanks loses his mind (but perhaps found a movie career?).
Vizzini is gifted and keeps us engaged, but there is occasional strain. At some point the narrative begins to feel rushed, subsumed by the generic action of chases, fights and dimensional transit. Neither the known world of adolescent anxiety, nor the fabulist realm of underground cities and the heroic struggle against a totalitarian caste called the Appointees is regarded with the attention it deserves.
But Vizzini is a genuine talent, and he writes fiction that can be especially meaningful to a savvy, screen-bleary teenage readership. His sentences carry enough charge that an eighth grader might truly discover how a novel is not a movie made extremely cheaply, but an art form that brings its own unique splendors, including the power to explore interiority and consciousness. He does this beautifully in the first part of the book. I hope he continues to linger in the hearts of his characters.

HEADLINE: $5 Watches vs. $5 Coffee

 BODY:
As he leaned against a display case filled with gold-plated and sterling-silver jewelry, Shappy Mehta listed his prices (necklaces: $3 and up; watches start at $1, if you don't need a battery) and detailed the miseries plaguing his business. The store, M.K. Sterling & Watches Inc., takes up half a storefront on 29th Street, just east of Broadway, in the center of Manhattan's low-cost wholesale district. Within a few blocks, there are dozens of other stores that import low-cost products from Asia (cheap watches, hair extensions, perfumes) and sell them to store owners visiting from all over the Northeast and, to a surprising extent, much of the developing world too. Business has been awful lately, but Mehta doesn't blame the lousy global economy; instead, he blames the building across the street. ''Because of the hotel, things got bad,'' he said. ''They want everything high end.'' 
In 2009, the Ace Hotel took over a derelict single-room-occupancy hotel on the southeast corner of 29th and Broadway. In addition to $500 rooms, the Ace also sells a certain kind of lifestyle that's at odds with its neighbors. I saw it up close when I sat in the lobby with Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist and Twitter investor, who explained that places like the Ace have become central nodes in what he referred to as the global-ideas economy. They cater to a new generation of workers, he told me, ''who decamp from home to establish themselves in coffee shops, lobbies and foyers.''
The battle over 29th Street may seem familiar -- new wealth pushes aside older, poorer neighbors -- but what's going on here is not just the latest Manhattan gentrification story. The neighborhood is the front line in a conflict between two enormous economic networks: high-end globalization (intellectual property, yuppies, laptops) versus its low-end counterpart (cheap mass production and a complex supply chain). Amazingly, this is a battle in which the small businesses catering to the world's poor have a real shot.
Kemi Alao, whom I met in a discount emporium on Broadway, exemplifies the old 29th Street's hope. Alao, who owns Lasting Impressions, a boutique in Jos, Nigeria, is a remarkably successful entrepreneur in a poor country. She sells all kinds of off-brand items from fragrances to clothes, but she doesn't trust her local Nigerian wholesalers. ''There are lots of fake things,'' she said of Nigeria's knocked-off discount market. So every three months or so, she or her husband flies to the United States with a wad of cash and empty suitcases. She said she has no choice. Alao recently flew to China, where most of these goods are made, to eliminate her middleman cost. As in Nigeria, however, she didn't trust the salespeople there.
At any moment, the wholesale district is teeming with shopkeepers like Alao from Africa and South America, as well as from poor neighborhoods in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. These entrepreneurs come because it's one of the few places in the world focused on their needs. They want to buy mixed lots of decent-quality items at extremely low prices. They also want to pay cash. According to Mehta, the district thrived in the 1980s and 1990s when foreign shopkeepers placed huge orders for sterling-silver jewelry and cheap watches. ''They filled trailers,'' he said. Now ''they don't even buy the gold,'' he explained, waving his hand in frustration at a display of $3 gold-plated earrings.
The decline started after Sept. 11, 2001, Mehta said, when it became more difficult for entrepreneurs from poor countries to get through U.S. customs with cash-filled pockets and some empty luggage. Today's trickle of business is just enough to pay the rent, and when his lease ends next year, he assumes he'll just close up shop. I asked him why he doesn't just move his store somewhere cheaper -- an outer borough or maybe New Jersey. In order to compete in the global low-end wholesale business, he said, you need to be where the other wholesalers are.
Not everyone, however, is so pessimistic. For years, David Hong sold hair extensions to salons in African-American communities around Wayne, N.J. When he realized how much more money he could make selling to buyers from Africa, he rented a storefront next to Mehta. Less than a week in his new location, he was giddy about a Zambian customer who just bought a couple of dozen weaves.
Hong's shop, like Mehta's, is typical of the wholesaler's aesthetic, where bright fluorescent lights and zero frills signal a place for quick, bargain-priced business. By contrast, the lobby of the Ace is dim, elegantly ornate and packed with people sitting in groups on large leather couches while others hunch over their laptops at communal tables. On a recent visit, I noted that while a few had purchased coffee from the lobby waiters, most didn't seem to be paying customers. When I pointed out these freeloaders to Alex Calderwood, the Ace Hotel's co-founder and co-owner, he said that he rejected advice to charge customers for the Wi-Fi or kick them out after an hour. Calderwood thinks that having a lobby filled with energetic young people meeting, and bumping into one another, is good business. It allows him to charge higher rates for the rooms upstairs, and it's also part of a broader business strategy. Traditional business hotels are usually near existing business hubs, like airports or convention centers. The Ace, however, aims to be that hub. Its typical customers -- ''new media, technology, artists,'' Calderwood said -- conduct business anywhere there's reliable Wi-Fi, comfortable seating and other people doing interesting things. Ace employs a full-time music curator to create playlists that reinforce the overall aesthetic. Calderwood and his managers are also constantly monitoring the lobby's ''energy.'' When a space becomes a dead zone, as one distant communal table had, they try to correct it through redesign.
Despite obvious differences, the Ace and the wholesale district surrounding it are, in many ways, in the same business. Neither makes a product; instead, each profits from providing an in-person gathering place. It's a remarkable fact of an increasingly diffuse, networked economy that the ancient basics of getting together, looking a business partner in the eye and sharing a cup of coffee are still essential and potentially profitable. When I first walked down 29th Street, I assumed that the neighborhood would soon end up like the Meatpacking District or Greenwich Village. And this may yet happen, but I doubt it will be any time soon. New global economic nodes often shift more quickly than the old ones. The trading centers of the Silk Road (Baghdad, Peshawar) or the hubs of the railway age (Chicago, Kansas City) have endured long after camels and coal became obsolete. So long as shopkeepers around the world think of 29th Street as the place to go for low-cost, decent-quality goods, business will remain. For every Shappy Mehta unable to adjust to a change in the market, there will be a David Hong who does.
We hear so much about the high-end global economy, and the knowledge workers who create billion-dollar companies, but many economists believe that a dominant force of the 21st century will be how low-end globalization brings goods and technologies to the world's poor. Because there are far more poor people in the world, there might even be more money in selling to them than in serving the needs of the rich. And that's why the wholesale district has a chance. Years ago it no longer made economic sense to concentrate the meatpacking business in Lower Manhattan. But globalization makes a wholesale district in a crowded urban center more economically viable than ever. There's also a good chance that its customers will stick around longer than any hotel guests.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The wholesale district is taking on the Manhattan gentrification machine.
2. Unlike SoHo or the Village, it has a shot.
3. That's great news for the cheap- watch business.
4. And the world's poor too.

HEADLINE: The Oklahoma City Game

BYLINE: By SAM ANDERSON

 BODY:
N.B.A. scoring champions are, as a rule, weirdos and reprobates and in some cases diagnosable sociopaths. Something about dominating your opponent, publicly, more or less every day of your life, in the most visible aspect of your sport, tends to either warp your spirit or to be possible only to those whose spirits are already warped. Michael Jordan, when he wasn't busy scoring, was busy punching a teammate in the face and gambling away small fortunes. Allen Iverson, in his spare time, recorded an aesthetically and morally terrible rap album and gave an iconic speech denigrating the very notion of practice. Kobe Bryant is and shall forever be Kobe Bryant. Wilt, Shaq, Pistol Pete, Dominique, McGrady, McAdoo, Rick Barry -- it's a near-solid roster of dysfunction: sadists, narcissists, malcontents, knuckleheads, misanthropes, womanizers, addicts and villains. While it's true that plain old N.B.A. superstars do occasionally manage to be model citizens (cf. Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Steve Nash), there is something irredeemable about a scoring champion. 
Kevin Durant, the star of the Oklahoma City Thunder, is the youngest scoring champion in N.B.A. history. At 24, he has led the league in scoring for three consecutive seasons, and all signs point to him keeping that up for the foreseeable future. It follows, then, that Durant should also be a prodigy of a head case. He should have been arrested for reckless driving at around age 9, broken his hand in a strip-club brawl at age 12 and accidentally shot his chauffeur no later than age 15.
Instead, Durant has a reputation roughly on par with Gandhi. He seems to be -- not just for a scoring champion, but for anyone -- almost inhumanly humble. His motto, which he intones constantly, is ''Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.'' His pregame ritual involves kissing his mother, as does his postgame ritual. Once, in college, during probably the greatest freshman season of all time, a reporter asked Durant if he realized that he had just single-handedly outscored the entire opposing team in the second half of a game. Durant answered, with absolute sincerity, ''Who, me?'' When I asked the Thunder coach, Scott Brooks, to tell me about his superstar, he laughed. ''Whatever you say nice, you can print it out and I'll just say I said it,'' he said. ''Because it's true.''
Durant could be forgiven for wanting to brag a little. He is currently the second-best basketball player in the world -- a category in which he trails only LeBron James, who is four years older, and whose Miami Heat beat the Thunder last year in the finals. The budding rivalry between KD and LBJ (off the court they're friends, Olympic teammates and sometimes, controversially, workout partners) is the kind of thing the N.B.A. has been fantasizing about for decades, a yin and yang as tightly balanced as any since Magic and Bird.
LeBron and Durant are, conveniently for storytelling purposes, opposites. LeBron looks like something out of a Marvel comic: a sentient pile of muscles. Durant looks like something from a Pixar movie -- a humanoid praying mantis. He is 6 feet 9 inches tall and almost disturbingly skinny, with disproportionately long arms. Sportswriters, struggling to describe him, have compared him to capellini and a pterodactyl. His body looks almost like an engineering mistake, and early in his career it seemed as if it might actually be one: before the 2007 draft, there was a minor kerfuffle when it was discovered that Durant couldn't bench-press 185 pounds, the standard predraft litmus test, even a single time. (The next pick in the draft, Al Horford, lifted it 20 times.) LeBron entered the league as a teenager and promptly knocked around all of the grown men who tried to guard him. As a 19-year-old rookie, Durant drifted around, shooting jumpers and trying to avoid contact, and still spent much of his time picking himself up off the floor. Although he won Rookie of the Year, he wasn't particularly efficient in doing so, and his team was horrible.
Despite their discrepancy in visible muscle tone, Durant has strengths that LeBron will probably never have. LeBron's jump shot, for instance, is funky-looking, jerky, angular and streaky. Durant's is natural, pure, quick and stunningly accurate -- somehow, his ridiculous arms manage not to get in the way but to amplify his power, so it looks as if he's shooting with zero effort even from 30 feet away.
Durant's real advantage over LeBron, however, is civic. LeBron infamously held a prime-time TV special in the summer of 2010 to announce that he was abandoning Cleveland for the glamour of Miami -- a P.R. debacle known as the Decision. When he arrived in Miami, he took part in a histrionic rally at which he promised, on a stage surrounded by a W.W.E. -style light show and smoke machines, that his new team was so good it was going to dominate the rest of the league without even trying.
It's impossible to imagine that kind of behavior from Durant. In the middle of the overheated summer of 2010, the day before LeBron's Decision, Durant announced quietly, on Twitter, that he had just signed a contract to stay in Oklahoma -- the third-smallest market in the league, a place devoid of beaches and celebrities and night life -- for another five years. You got the feeling he would have committed to the Thunder for the rest of his life if only the Players' Union would have allowed it.
Durant, in other words, seems to have been invented in a laboratory beneath the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce to serve as the international face of Oklahoma -- a state known for its citizens' kindness, levelheadedness, work ethic, community spirit and, above all, humility. (The mayor of Oklahoma City told me that he thinks Oklahomans are humble because of their proximity to Texans, who will never stop bragging about anything.) Led by Durant, the Thunder has become one of the N.B.A.'s best and youngest and most popular teams, an international icon of brotherhood and good will that has helped to usher in golden ages in both Oklahoma City and the N.B.A., an electric blue Trojan horse inside of which Oklahoma has managed to smuggle its ethos to the rest of the world: good folksy folks humbly helping other folksy folks stay humble and helpful.
Oklahoma sits right in the middle of the country: it's not the cultured East or the wild West or the frigid North or the humid South but exactly where all those things meet. The mountains touch the prairies, which touch the plains. This has created, over the millenniums, crazy animals and crazy weather and crazy 25-car pileups of culture. In 1889, the almost unbelievable land run sent tens of thousands of ragtag settlers from all over the country literally racing to claim tracts of practically uninhabitable land. Oklahoma, in other words, is the Hadron supercollider of states: it slams disparate things together, over and over, producing endless crises of cohesion. Even tornadoes, the region's defining devil winds, are a result of a meteorological collision: a convergence of three different weather systems that happens with freakish regularity in Oklahoma and its immediate environs. Meteorologists in Oklahoma are basically rock stars.
Professional athletes, on the other hand, have rarely had much of a presence here. That began to change in 2006, when a consortium of wealthy Oklahomans, led by the financier Clay Bennett, bought the Seattle SuperSonics -- a once-proud franchise that had been stuck for years in the drain-swirl of mediocrity. Most people assumed, cynically, that Bennett was buying the team in order to move it, as quickly as possible, to Oklahoma City, his hometown. He had pledged to make a good-faith effort to keep the team in Seattle -- an effort that came into suspicion shortly after the sale, when the new owner demanded that Seattle come up with nearly $300 million to build a new arena. Seattle refused, at which point the ownership group announced, regretfully, that it was going to have to move the Sonics to a city with a suitable arena -- a city that also happened to be Oklahoma City. The fallout was intense: lawsuits, protests, scandal. Even Oklahomans who love the team admit that they were uncomfortable with the way it was acquired. The sportswriter Bill Simmons, in solidarity with the people of Seattle, referred to the Thunder exclusively in his columns as the Zombie Sonics.
One of the miracles of the modern Thunder -- and there are several -- is how quickly they've made people forget the stain of their origin. The re-branding of the franchise has been quick and efficient: the team is now widely perceived as principled, well run and -- above all -- thoroughly Oklahoman. ESPN recently named it the No. 1 sports franchise in America. This fall, it seemed like a step toward closure when the Seattle City Council approved a plan to build a new basketball arena there. Simmons announced, just a few weeks ago, that he was officially retiring the phrase Zombie Sonics. In almost no time at all, the Oklahoma City Thunder had achieved escape velocity.
Much of the credit for this turnaround goes to Sam Presti, the Thunder's general manager. Presti took over the team the year before they left Seattle. He was 29, the youngest G.M. in league history. His first move was to draft Kevin Durant, which anyone would have done. His second, less obvious decision was to strip the roster of all the veterans and big contracts that would have prevented him from rebuilding from scratch. When the team moved from Seattle to Oklahoma City, Presti found himself in charge of not only the worst team in the league but also one of the worst in the history of professional basketball. The Oklahoma City Thunder won 3 games out of their first 32. This record, 3-29, is now a kind of touchstone in the organization -- almost everyone I talked to invoked it at some point, and many of them even exaggerated it to 3-30.
Most G.M.'s would have panicked, but that isn't Presti's way: he moved patiently, methodically. He overhauled not only the roster of the team but also the culture of the organization. This involved rethinking everything, no matter how small, from meeting times to media policy to the decorations on the practice-facility walls. Everyone soon became familiar with the Presti buzzwords: process, system, patience, sustainability. He made a habit of promoting people within the organization so that, from top to bottom, the Thunder became very young and tightly knit. He stressed community outreach to an unusual degree. He devoted extra resources to the development of the young Thunder players and, on the marketing side, refused to call attention to any single player apart from his teammates, even Durant, who was quickly becoming an international superstar. Meanwhile, Presti used high draft picks to surround Durant with other promising young players -- Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, James Harden -- all of whom overachieved, relative to the rest of their draft classes, to an almost amazing degree.
The Presti rebuild, a meticulously rational plan, now looks a lot like a fairy tale. The Thunder has improved, year by year, exactly on schedule: they made the playoffs in their second season, the Western Conference finals in their third and the Finals last year. If the Thunder doesn't win the title this year, it will seem almost unfair -- a violation of the basic laws of narrative. Among basketball fans, Presti has become a mythic braniac legend, the managerial equivalent of Kevin Durant: young, focused, dominant and improbably humble.
I met Presti two weeks before the start of training camp at the Oklahoma City National Memorial, a site that commemorates, powerfully, the city's defining tragedy: the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Presti shook my hand in the lobby, quickly and firmly, and then proceeded to say nothing for many minutes. The museum's director was giving us a tour, and Presti seemed relieved to cede the floor completely to her. He wore a polo shirt, casual pants, fashionable glasses and hip sneakers. He was very slim -- no excess -- and was fidgeting a lot, bouncing rhythmically at the knees.
We were at the memorial because, as Presti told me later, ''This place is part of our existence.'' Presti sits on the memorial's board, and he makes sure that every player who joins the Thunder visits the site before he ever plays a game. The idea is to teach them the character of the citizenry they've just joined, to help them recognize, as Tom Brokaw put it on the night of the bombing, Oklahomans' ''essential sense of goodness, community and compassion.''
After our tour, Presti and I talked for a while outside. He struck me as one of the most cautious people I've ever met, constantly stopping and rephrasing, weighing and reweighing his words, openly worried that I was going to misinterpret the team's relationship to the memorial as a P.R. grab, or that I was going to focus my article on him at the expense of others. He ascribed most of the Thunder's success to either luck or his colleagues. The most revealing thing Presti said to me that day had to do with the grounds of the memorial, which were impressively tidy. Despite a suffocatingly hot run of late-summer days, the grass was thick and lush and perfectly mowed, with perfect circles around the perfect trees. Presti pointed out how much work it takes to keep everything looking like that, how much deliberate organization, but also how important it is.
At the Thunder's training center, after a practice in early October, Kevin Durant and I sat on folding chairs at the edge of the gym. He was wearing a black tank top, black shorts and ridiculously colorful shoes. (Loud footwear is one of his few obvious vices.) Practice that day, according to everyone involved, had been ''chippy'' -- Durant's team had lost a couple of early scrimmages to a team full of rookies and backups, and this had sent everyone, especially Durant and Westbrook, into competitive overdrive.
Sitting with Durant a few minutes later, though, I could detect none of that aggressive energy. He was placid, polite, obliging. He said pretty much everything you would expect him to say, in exactly the way you would expect him to say it. He took every opportunity to gush about his teammates, singling out Westbrook and Harden -- the team's two other big scorers -- as ''killers'' and insisting that, despite the media's constant attempts to create controversy among them, there was no tension on the team about sharing the ball. It would be ridiculous, he said, to ''put those guys on a leash just so I can get two or three more shots up a game.'' He praised his teammates' unselfishness and said he had learned to play the same way. He said that, although he'd known almost nothing about Oklahoma City before the team moved there, now he couldn't imagine playing anywhere else.
I told Durant that, all over town, people were giving me spontaneous speeches about what a nice guy he was. His response was, naturally, impeccably nice. ''I'm just being me, man,'' he said. ''I'm just enjoying this all. I can't complain. I mean, I wasn't raised to be a jerk to anybody. You know what I mean? My mama wouldn't like that, so that's just all I know. Just being nice to people and enjoying what I do.''
But how is it possible, I asked, to be as competitive as he must be while also being so nice? Don't those impulses conflict?
He answered with a story.
Growing up, Durant told me, he was a sore loser. That all changed one day when he was 11, after he got destroyed by his father in a game of one on one in the driveway. ''Of course I knew I was gonna lose,'' he said. ''He was so much bigger and stronger than me. He was backing me down, dunking, pushing me. He was screaming, talking trash. I scored like one point.'' Little Kevin was so upset by the loss (and, presumably, by the bullying) that he burst into tears, ran into the house, locked the door and refused to let his father in. The intensity of his own crying surprised him and, after a while, inspired some self-reflection. ''I sat back and thought about it and was like, What am I so mad at?'' Durant told me, and in that moment, he said, he made a decision. ''It's good to be passionate, it's good to hate losing -- but I've got to channel it the right way,'' he said. ''You know what I mean? And after a while I just started to learn to leave it where it's at, get rid of it. Once you're done and you're off the court or out of the venue or whatever, go back to being you.''
Durant's story touched on something I've thought about often while watching him play. If there's been one consistent criticism of him, it's that he's not aggressive enough -- that he fails to use his unearthly skills, as Jordan or Charles Barkley or Kobe would have done, to destroy everybody in his path. There are times, during games, when he seems almost removed from the action, simultaneously there and not there. I always figured that this detachment was just a byproduct of his smoothness: it looks so easy for him, when he strokes four consecutive 3-pointers or tosses in a little half-hook over two defenders, that it's tempting to imagine he's thinking about other things the whole time -- that the real Kevin Durant is watching from a little viewing platform deep inside his own head, reading a magazine and clipping his nails, ready to re-engage fully when things get intense. But now I suspect that that uncanny stillness, that sense of remove, is the outward manifestation of Durant's internal control, a sign of his fluency in moving between worlds: aggressive and relaxed, nasty and nice.
Occasionally you can see Durant moving between those worlds, and the transition is jarring. There are moments, for instance, when he dunks and in his excitement begins to stare down his opponent, showboat-style, and you think, No, no, no, no, Kevin Durant, so much of my worldview depends on you not being the type of person who stares people down after dunks. And then, inevitably, a second or so later, he seems to catch himself and jogs back down the court to give all the credit to his teammates. You can see the impulse and the correction -- the (to get Freudian for a second) ego and the superego.
This turns out to be a useful way to think about the Thunder. In ''Civilization and Its Discontents,'' Freud argues that humans are ruled by two warring impulses: love, which seeks to bind people into larger and larger groups, and aggression, which seeks to tear them apart. For civilization to work, on even the most basic level, each of us has to find an acceptable outlet for that antisocial aggression. Back in the driveway, Durant's father directed his aggression toward him. Freud argues that most of us, however, learn to turn our aggression inward, where it morphs into what he calls the superego -- the policeman of the psyche, watching us constantly to ensure (with its billy club of guilt) that we make choices for the benefit of the group, not just for our own egos. That psychic self-surveillance, Freud says, is one of the big prices we pay for civilization -- a kind of voluntary tax we levy against ourselves for the privilege of living with others.
Kevin Durant oozes superego. Even as we talked on our folding chairs after practice, I sensed a duality. He was simultaneously genuine and polished, open and guarded. This seems to be an inevitable consequence of living the life of a superstar, especially in a place like Oklahoma City. Last summer there was public outrage, in some quarters, when it was discovered that Durant's torso -- the skin under his jersey, which by design is publicly hidden -- is covered with tattoos.
One evening I went to the mall to observe one of Durant's public events. He was at a GameStop, signing copies of a new video game that featured him on its cover. I arrived to find the OKC equivalent of Beatlemania: a line of people, decked out in Thunder gear, stretching out the door and wrapping around the neighboring stores. As I approached the scene, a policeman was dragging a young man who apparently tried to get too close down an escalator. Just then a huge cheer broke out from the crowd. Durant had arrived, through a back entrance, along with a small entourage. I squeezed past the line, stood at the side of the room and watched him throughout the session. He was wearing his signature ''KD'' gear: hat, T-shirt, sweats. He seemed friendly but also not totally present. Between signatures and photos, he would occasionally grab his phone and sneak a text message under the table. He bantered, here and there, with a couple of kids, but mostly he was quiet and dutiful. His smile seemed automatic. I got the sense that Kevin Durant, the actual 24-year-old guy with the secret tattoos, was hardly even there that night: he was just an avatar for his own fame -- this abstract thing that doesn't actually exist but is millions of times bigger than he is. Not that that was his fault, of course. Even if Durant wanted to genuinely connect with people that night, the sheer scale made it impossible. There was too much inflow for a single person's outflow. I got a sense of how insane it must be to live that kind of life, in which things are like that every day, everywhere. Is it even possible to be a good, thoughtful, civic-minded person under that kind of pressure? Suddenly all of those sociopathic scoring champions made sense to me. Radical detachment seemed, in a strange and sad way, almost like the proper response.
Toward the end of our post-practice conversation, Durant leaned over and started unlacing his shoes. I took this as a signal that he was ready to leave. He was tired, no doubt, and had other things to do. I wrapped up our interview and thanked him for his time. He popped immediately out of his seat and walked away. After a few steps, he seemed to catch himself. He turned around, walked back and shook my hand. ''Nice to meet you,'' he said.
The full name of Oklahoma City is the City of Oklahoma City. The police chief of the City of Oklahoma City is named -- I'm not joking -- Bill Citty. (''Citty'' is pronounced exactly like ''city.'') Chief Citty, hearing that I was in town to write about his city, offered to give me a tour. He drove me around in his sedan, neighborhood by neighborhood, casually ignoring traffic laws, occasionally being honked at, for more than three hours. The last hour or so we spent at the Oklahoma State Fair, where he drove me around in a golf cart.
Chief Citty's tour was my introduction to the civic paradox that is modern OKC: a city that, over the last 15 years, has managed to reinvent itself while other cities have melted down, a conservative town that happily submitted to a series of voluntary taxes, a place where the oxymoron ''corporate citizen'' almost begins to make some kind of sense.
Citty grew up in Oklahoma City, so he has seen, firsthand, the major phases of the last 60 years. He was born during the postwar boom, in 1953, when everything was awash in federal money. (It is one of the many paradoxes of Oklahoma that, despite all its rhetoric of rugged individualism and free markets, the economy has been heavily depending on the federal government for decades.) Citty's mother worked for a gas company downtown, in an office in the First National Center, one of the defining masterpieces of the city's skyline -- a 33-story Art Deco tower with elaborate aluminum decorations based on King Tut's tomb. As a teenager in the 1960s, Citty watched as the new malls and highways started sucking all of downtown's energy out into the suburbs, leaving behind the usual inner-city decay. In the 1970s, after some years of hippyish drifting, he decided to cut his hair, shave off his beard and join the City of Oklahoma City Police Department.
It was 1977. Citty was assigned to patrol a downtown neighborhood called the Deep Deuce, an African-American community that had once been home to world-famous jazz clubs but had declined, by then, into a hub for drugs and gambling and prostitution. (Just before Citty joined the force, a serial killer dumped the body of a prostitute in the basement of a nearby church.) From his beat downtown, Citty watched the city's economy boom with oil money. New houses sprouted everywhere. Then, in 1982, he watched it all go bust: banks, farms, oil -- everything. People lost their new homes; thriving businesses closed. ''What happened to us in the early '80s,'' Citty told me, ''is what happened to the U.S. economy in '08.''
Things were still bad in 1993, when the mayor of Oklahoma City, Ron Norick, persuaded his constituents to do something improbable: to voluntarily tax themselves in order to rebuild the city. The program was called Metro Area Projects, or Maps -- a one-cent sales tax that raised more than $350 million. Over the next two decades, Maps and its sequels (the city is currently on Maps 3) would change almost every neighborhood in the city, especially downtown. It built a canal and a minor-league baseball stadium and a new library; it turned an endless stretch of empty warehouses into a vital shopping district; it overhauled the schools; it put water back in the river, which had been so dry that, for decades, the city had to mow it. And of course Maps built a basketball stadium, which would come spectacularly into play many years later.
In 1995, just as Maps was getting rolling, life in the city suddenly came to a stop. On an otherwise ordinary April morning, a 26-year-old terrorist drove a moving truck full of fertilizer and other chemicals into the heart of downtown and parked in front of the nine-story Federal Building. The explosion, at 9:02 a.m., killed 168 people and injured 684. Five blocks west, at Police Headquarters, the tile shook so hard and so many windows broke that Bill Citty assumed the bomb had gone off inside. He figured out its real source only when he saw that the paper raining down everywhere had come from offices inside the Federal Building. He made it there within 20 minutes and stayed for the next month. At that point, Citty was the department's public information officer, which meant he had to wrangle the media, a suddenly gargantuan task. He became, in a sense, the link between Oklahoma City and the rest of the world.
As part of our tour, Citty drove me down to the Deep Deuce, which was now full of bright new brick apartment complexes. He drove me past the State Capitol, the only one in the nation with an oil rig in front of it. He drove me through Automobile Alley, a revitalized hipster pocket. He pointed out the public bike-rental program, Spokies, that opened over the summer. Half of the city seemed to be under construction. Near the basketball arena, an old elevated highway was being torn down: it was now just a lattice of concrete, with on- and offramps that ended in midair. The highway will soon be replaced by a grand boulevard -- the Champs-lyses of OKC -- leading right to the Thunder's home.
This public rebuilding helped bring in private investment, which in turn brought in more revenue for public works, which brought in more private investment -- and these cycles eventually combined to make Oklahoma City a plausible home for N.B.A. basketball. When it arrived, the growth and the basketball amplified each other. ''We'd have a lot of good things happening now even if we didn't get the Thunder,'' Citty told me. ''But we got the Thunder because good things were going on, and now even better things are going on.'' As an example, he drove me past the Devon Energy Center, the city's new skyscraper, a 50-story steel-and-glass tube that dwarfs every other building in sight.
This, then, is part of the city's love affair with the Thunder. It's more than just a basketball team: it's the culmination of 20 years of civic reinvention, and the promise of more to come. Over the last five years, the city and its team have undergone a perfect mind meld, so at this point it's impossible to talk about one without talking about the other. After all of that sacrifice -- the grind of municipal meetings and penny taxes and planning boards, the dust and noise and uncertainty of construction, the horror of 1995 -- the little city in the middle of No Man's Land has finally arrived on the world stage. While it's there, it fully intends to put on a good performance.
A basketball team is a kind of miniature society, and the Thunder's is a strange one. Most great N.B.A. teams are built on a rational distribution of talents: two or three elite players whose skills complement, rather than overlap with, one another's, supported by a small army of role players. The classic example is the 1986 Celtics, in which Larry Bird's all-around game and outside shooting were supplemented perfectly by the under-the-basket play of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. The Thunder, however, were built around three big stars -- Durant, Westbrook and Harden -- who all have essentially the same talent. Each one is an elite perimeter scorer, and each one needs the ball to be effective. Each could easily be the focus of an offense all by himself. (Harden, who was recently traded after a contract dispute, will now put this theory to the test with the Houston Rockets.) As a result, when the Thunder offense is good, it's organized chaos -- an embarrassment of riches. When it's bad, which it is less and less frequently, it's just chaos: stagnation, wild shots, wasted possessions.
Scott Brooks, the Thunder's head coach, told me that he fell in love with basketball in seventh grade, in a small town in Northern California, at a free clinic taught by a local coach. What he loved, immediately, was exactly the problem of this Thunder lineup: the way the game forced you to braid together individual achievement and teamwork, the singular and the collective. Brooks loved that he could go to the gym and work on his game, all by himself, whenever he felt like it, and then, the next day or week, see that work play out in the context of a team. Brooks's mastery of the individual-collective balance allowed him to become a star in high school and college and then -- against all the athletic odds, as a 5-foot-11 nonleaper -- to patch together a 10-year N.B.A career playing with seven different teams, including the 1994 champion Houston Rockets. Although Brooks had been a scorer in college, as a pro he accepted the job of the old-school N.B.A. point guard: to get the ball to his various teams' stars -- Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon -- and then get out of the way.
This made Brooks the opposite of the Thunder's point guard, Russell Westbrook. Westbrook is often referred to as the most explosive athlete in the league -- his physique is so cartoonishly chiseled that one of his teammates recently compared him to a He-Man doll -- and he uses those superpowers to do things Brooks never could have dreamed of: to turn a defensive rebound, in just a few reckless seconds, into a dunk at the other end, or to get his jump shot off over two defenders when everyone in the arena knows it's coming. This skill set makes him unorthodox as a point guard, to say the least. The Thunder's horrific start as a franchise in 2008 -- that legendary 3-29 -- was in part a result of Westbrook's wildness. He led the league in turnovers for his first season. Early on, there were murmurs that Westbrook couldn't play point guard, especially next to a scoring superstar like Durant -- someone who, many thought, would have benefited more from a Scott Brooks type, a teammate who would get him the ball and get out of the way. Even as the Thunder improved, there were rumors that Westbrook and Durant resented each other, that they couldn't coexist, that the ecosystem of the team might be beyond repair.
Throughout the losing and the turnovers and the rumors, however, Brooks not only kept playing Westbrook but also encouraged his recklessness. That confidence paid off. Westbrook is now a superstar in his own right -- if Durant is the second-best player in the world, Westbrook is probably in the Top 10. He's still wild, and he still occasionally makes high-profile mistakes, and TV analysts still love to question his shot selection -- but he has improved in all of those areas enough that his net effect on the team is overwhelmingly positive. It's impossible, at this point, to disentangle the bad from the good. In Game 4 of the Finals, Westbrook kept taking wild, flying, contested midrange jumpers -- one of the least efficient shots in the sport -- and making nearly all of them. He scored 43 points and almost single-handedly kept the Thunder in the game. (They ended up losing, after some LeBron heroics, by 6.)
I asked Brooks if he ever had trouble maintaining a balance between chaos and order, crazy Westbrook and sane Westbrook.
He laughed. ''Trust me, there are times where my hair is almost out,'' he said.
But he defended his point guard. ''Is he a natural John Stockton type? No, but he never will be. Those guys are done. Those guys are over. You're not seeing those guys coming back. Russell is a dynamic offensive player. I would be a foolish coach if I said, 'Russell, I don't want you to go to the basket and draw fouls and score and put pressure on the defense.' We need that.''
He also dismissed the idea of a rift between Westbrook and Durant.
''I'm with them every day. Did they have some competitive moments? Absolutely. But that's how we work here. We challenge each other. It gets chippy. James and Kevin, Serge and Russell, me and Perk, Thabo and Russell -- all of us. If it ever gets on the wrong side of being competitive, I'll step in. But not once have I had to step in, in five years. If Russell and Kevin have problems, then I didn't get along with any of my teammates.''
One symptom of a small sports market is a lack of celebrity fans. Among N.B.A. teams, the Lakers are famous for their fame: they have Jack and Penny and Denzel and a whole human gallery of plastic-surgery glamour; the Knicks have Spike and Woody and Chris Rock and a rotating roster of Broadway stars. The Thunder has Wayne Coyne, the singer of the alternative-rock band the Flaming Lips. Coyne is famous for floating over crowds in a giant bubble at concerts and generally behaving like a psychedelic space cadet around town. He was raised in Oklahoma and, unusually -- even as his creative peers poured out toward the coasts -- he never left. Over the last 15 years, as the Flaming Lips have gained worldwide fame, and as Oklahoma City has begun to rebrand itself as a vital place for young, artsy energy, the city has embraced Coyne, now 51, as a kind of elder statesman. This has turned out to be, for both sides, a rather complicated transaction. Three years ago, the Flaming Lips song ''Do You Realize??'' was named the official rock song of Oklahoma, but only over the strenuous objections of several state politicians. Coyne's latest OKC adventure, much blogged about in the city, is a spectacularly ill-advised art gallery called the Womb -- a drab old warehouse, in the heart of downtown, that he bought and repainted in explosive rainbow colors, complete with cartoonish naked women and a giant abstract vagina on the front door. After Coyne told the local paper that he was going to have a huge New Year's party there, at which teenagers might be able to drop acid with Yoko Ono, the fire marshal showed up and shut the gallery down.
As OKC's reigning celebrity, Coyne sometimes attends Thunder games, where he sits courtside. Although he seems genuinely fond of the team, he's not what you would call a sports aficionado. When I asked him if he followed basketball before the Thunder came to town, he had to think for a few seconds. ''No,'' he said. ''I mean, I liked, like, the Harlem Globetrotters. Or some mythical figure like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar'' -- and he pronounced ''Jabbar'' in the most amazing way, with an exotically soft ''j'' and several extra vowels, as if it were the name of a genie that had come drifting one morning out of his bong.
Coyne admits that at Thunder games, he doesn't always understand what's going on. ''It's not like a Steven Spielberg-scripted event when you're there,'' he told me. ''You're like, Well, did we win? I'm confused. Did they win? And then you look up and you're like, Well, is the game over?''
He said he has been yelled at by other fans for cheering for Kobe Bryant. (''That was wicked! Who is that?'' he shouted the first time he saw Kobe score. The crowd told him that it was Kobe and suggested, forcefully, that he stop cheering for him. ''But that was wicked!'' Coyne responded.)
Coyne and I spoke, late one night, sitting in his Prius, which was parked in front of the Blue Note Lounge, a smoky bar at which the Flaming Lips played their first show 30 years ago. He was wearing a gray suit (he'd just come from a wedding), and his gray hair poured out in a big curly plume from his head. His fingernails were painted gold, and his face was lightly dusted with glitter.
Coyne believes that the Thunder transcend the limits of their confusing sport -- that they channel the energy of the whole community in a way that resonates across the world. Using a variety of accents, he told me stories about people in Germany and Switzerland and Sweden -- places where he never used to hear about his hometown -- all of a sudden talking to him about how much they love the Thunder. ''I think people like the idea that, whether you're a weirdo rock dude or a basketball player, we all have this spirit of the city,'' he said. ''Which I don't think really exists. But I think the Thunder has probably pulled it together more than anything else.''
Thunder crowds are notoriously loud and supportive. Visiting players often say it feels more like a college crowd than an N.B.A. crowd. Fans wear color-coordinated shirts for big games, and even when the team was horrible, they never booed. ''Sometimes I would think to myself, Do these people realize that we're down 20 with 3 minutes to go?'' Scott Brooks told me, remembering the early days. ''We'd be walking through the tunnel and I'd think: O.K., this is the night that I get heckled. This is the night I get popcorn thrown on me. Nothing. Every single game, it was: 'Hang in there coach. Players, we love you guys.' ''
Coyne sees an analogy between basketball games and rock concerts. Playing a song for the thousandth time, he told me, is just as meaningless as putting a ball through a hoop. Under the right circumstances, however, those things take on great collective meaning. ''It's that idea of everybody being focused on the same thing at the same time and being together in the bigger experience,'' he said. ''It's silliness, but all things are like that.''
The Thunder has become a surprisingly integral part of hipster life in OKC. Coyne lives in a residential neighborhood called the Plaza District, the main drag of which has been -- like so much of the city -- radically transformed over the last five years. These days there's a vintage shop, a tattoo parlor where people come to get Thunder tattoos and, in a building that used to be known as a brothel, a new restaurant devoted to gourmet grilled-cheese sandwiches. I went into an artsy shop called DNA Galleries, across from the grilled-cheese-sandwich restaurant, and it turned out to be full of Thunder gear: local artists had designed, often very cleverly, their own T-shirts, beer cozies, stickers and onesies. Most businesses around town let their employees dress in Thunder gear on game days, which has created a big market for Thunder clothes: many Oklahomans have entirely separate game-day wardrobes. The store's owner told me that the Thunder changed her life. Saleswise, she said, basketball season is like eight months of Christmas.
And now it is time to talk about James Harden's beard.
The fate of Harden was the first serious test of the Thunder's utopian culture -- the first stubborn wrinkle in Sam Presti's enlightened basketball collective.
Harden was the first draft pick ever made by the Thunder: they chose him third in 2009. (Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka all joined when the team was still the Seattle SuperSonics.) His beard, at the time, was modest and closely cropped, the kind of thing you could wear to a business meeting without raising any eyebrows. Harden was a 19-year-old shooting guard with an old man's game, full of the kinds of tricks you might see at your local Y.M.C.A.: quick shots, misdirections, shifts in speed, counterintuitive arm motions designed to bait defenders into fouls. He wasn't overwhelmingly athletic, though, and many experts thought the Thunder had selected him too high. During his rookie year, he did little to convince anyone otherwise. As Harden's beard grew, however, so did his mojo. As it started to hang from his face, his tricks started, improbably, to work in the N.B.A. The beard grew thicker and more unruly, and Harden began to exceed everyone's expectations. By last season, he had become one of the most effective scorers the N.B.A. has ever seen.
By the time the Thunder reached the finals, Harden's beard was a full-on Rip Van Winkle, and it had become something of an unofficial team mascot. Photos flew around the Internet: a James Harden cake from an OKC bakery, with a huge mess of black icing extending off its cake chin; an Oklahoma City building with a giant beard hanging from its facade; a James Harden tattoo on some anonymous superfan's arm. The most popular item at the official Thunder retail store, its manager told me, was a Harden-style fake black beard, which fans would wear at home games. Harden's beard was gratuitous, quirky and improbable -- the same set of attributes that made Oklahoma City basketball different than Miami or Los Angeles or New York.
Harden's rise was great for the Thunder -- not many third bananas get that good, that fast -- but it was also a threat. He had always been a complicated figure in Presti's scheme. He was an elite scorer willing to come off the bench -- a citizen willing to pay a serious tax (in minutes, shots and star potential) to be a part of the Thunder society. The group, in turn, offered Harden some harder-to-measure benefits: As a sixth man, he got to play against the other team's bench players, which made him look even better than he was. When he shared the floor with Durant and Westbrook, he benefited from the other team's obsessive attention to them.
But Harden got a little too good. The cost-benefit balance tipped out of whack. He wanted a maximum contract and, by league standards, probably deserved one. The Thunder -- having already committed max contracts to Durant and Westbrook, and having just signed Ibaka to a near-max -- wanted to pay him less. Near the climactic point of the Harden contract crisis, several people in Oklahoma City joked to me that they would be perfectly willing to pass another Maps tax to help pay for him to stay. Then they made it clear that, actually, they weren't joking; the people of Oklahoma City would seriously do this. One city official I spoke with thought a penny tax would be too much -- maybe an eighth, he suggested, with a quarter of that going to improve the city.
Presti's goal is to build a sustainably excellent organization, which means one that transcends its players. No individual, no matter how important or loved, can ever be allowed to trump the group. At 8:28 on the night of Oct. 27, Kevin Durant tweeted the word ''Wow.'' Over the next few hours, that message was retweeted more than 10,000 times. The Thunder had traded James Harden, just three days before the start of the season.
For the Thunder, this trade marked a passage from innocence (youth, ideals, plenitude) to experience (age, cash, loss). The fairy-tale part of their story, in which they're magically immune from the muddiness of N.B.A. success, is over. The team will still be good -- Presti got a reasonable return for Harden, and of course they still have Westbrook and Durant -- but it feels as if they'll never be the same. Unless, of course, all that collective energy is strong enough to somehow conjure, like a phoenix rising from Harden's beard, another great individual.

THE ENCHANTED ISLAND OF CENTENARIANS
The American health care system should take a few hints from the island of Ikaria. Direct medical care at the E.R. and costly prescription research are not making our country healthier. The Ikarian sense of community betters social and mental health. The irregular workweek allows ample rest and time to enjoy food. Universal access to food, in the backyard and at a neighbor's kitchen table, would reduce the stress that many of our unemployed feel. We should encourage vibrant and connected neighborhoods with thriving centers and access to healthful foods. HAYLEY PICKUS, Portland, Ore.
I see the appeal of life on Ikaria. But I wonder if any of the islanders feel like they have a great book inside them. Or want to study painting or science or perhaps build a business. Do any of them yearn to do more than chitchat and gossip? Some people want to experience the great joy of achievement, not just the satisfactions of a stress-free life. BRAD DESCH, New York, posted on nytimes.com 
I enjoyed the article about the Greek island of Ikaria, where people seem freakishly long-lived. . . . But when you think about it, there are an awful lot of smallish communities on the coastal Mediterranean. On average, those communities have a pretty high life expectancy. But you'd also expect there to be some random variance. And you'd expect one small community or another to simply be a statistical outlier. Only 8,000 people live on Ikaria. They might just happen to have unusually longevity-friendly genetics or have lived longer than your average Greek islander through dumb luck. . . . If you have a few hundred islands, then one of them is going to be the island where the people live the longest, and there isn't necessarily going to be any particularly deep reason that's the case.

MULTIDAY MASSAGE-A-THON

THE DEAD DON'T LIE
Activists like Dr. Susan Baker may have saved my life. It was 1968, and I was 16 and driving my first car. I slowly rolled through a stop sign and was hit by a bus doing 40 m.p.h. I have no idea what made me fasten my seat belt that foggy morning. It was just a lap belt as we didn't have shoulder belts. The policeman thought for sure I was dead. I walked away from that accident without any serious injuries. I have always completely stopped at stop signs since. SUSAN LEVINE,Chapel Hill, N.C., posted on nytimes.com
A CONTROVERSIAL 'CURE' FOR M.S.
I've had M.S. for 40 years and underwent the ''controversial'' angioplasty for CCSVI in 2010. Now I no longer need a walker at home and can carry a cup of coffee unassisted. Before, I could not put a container of milk in the fridge. The effects are not a figment of my imagination. And I've never taken M.S. drugs. ARTHUR GOLDBERG, Tyler Hill, Pa.
As a 70-year-old woman who was diagnosed with primary progressive M.S. in 1988, I find the rush to find ''cures'' misses the point. Dependence on medicine debilitates M.S. sufferers the most. I have never used medication for M.S. Instead, I work out twice a week with my trainer and swim laps four days a week. I do not eat meat or poultry, nor do I consume alcohol, caffeine or sugar. I avoid stress and find joy in my work as a photographer. Yes, my M.S. has progressed. But that does not keep me from living a full life. I will never look for a ''cure.'' Life is too short to spend time searching for answers that may never come. PATRICIA LAY-DORSEY, Grosse Pointe, Mich.

HEADLINE: 'I Came to See the End of the World!'

BYLINE: By MARK BINELLI. 
This essay was adapted from ''Detroit City Is the Place to Be,'' to be published by Metropolitan Books.

 BODY:
For decades, a succession of city officials has struggled mightily to rebrand Detroit's battered image. Their ideas have included casino gambling, an '80s festival mall, new ballparks, hosting a Formula One grand prix, hosting a Super Bowl, even commissioning (this was Mayor Coleman Young, in 1984) Berry Gordy (who fled Detroit for Los Angeles by the early 1970s, taking the entire Motown operation with him) to write a city theme modeled after Frank Sinatra's ''Theme from New York, New York.'' Another member of the Rat Pack, Sammy Davis Jr., was conscripted to handle the vocals, but sadly, Gordy's song, ''Hello, Detroit,'' failed to burn up the charts.
But now much of the attention being showered upon Detroit from the trendiest of quarters comes, in no small measure, thanks to the city's blight. Detroit's brand has become authenticity, a key component of which has to do with the way the city looks. Does fixing the very real problems faced by Detroiters, I began to wonder, mean inevitably robbing Detroit of some part of its essential Detroitness? 
This is not exactly a question of gentrification; when your city has 70,000 abandoned buildings, it will not be gentrified anytime soon. Rather, it's one of aesthetics. And in Detroit, you can't talk aesthetics without talking ruin porn, a term that has become increasingly familiar in the city. Detroiters, understandably, can get touchy about the way descriptions and photographs of ruined buildings have become the favorite Midwestern souvenirs of visiting reporters.
Still, for all of the local complaints, outsiders are not alone in their fascination. My friend Phil has staged secret, multicourse gourmet meals, prepared by well-known chefs from local restaurants, in abandoned buildings like the old train station; John and his buddies like to play ice hockey on the frozen floors of decrepit factories. A woman who moved to Detroit from Brooklyn began to take nude photographs of herself in wrecked spaces (thrusting the concept of ruin porn to an even less metaphorical level). And Funky Sour Cream, an arts collective originally from New York, arranged an installation of little cupcake statues in the window of a long-shuttered bakery on Chene Street. A few days later, the bakery burned down. People debated whether or not this was a coincidence.
Meditation on ruin is a long and noble tradition. In Renaissance Italy, antiquarians like Leon Battista Alberti and Poggio Bracciolini began to promote the study and preservation of Roman ruins, which, to that point, had been unsystematically pushed aside as the city expanded. According to Alberti's biographer, Anthony Grafton, they also ''made fun of those who became too depressed'' about the ruins, like poor, oversensitive Cyriac of Ancona, who ''seemed to mourn the fall of Rome with excessive emotion.''
My grandfather, who traced our family origins back to Florence, insisted we were related to Leon Battista Alberti, also a Florentine and a prototypical Renaissance man: playwright, poet, architect, painter, astronomer, lawyer and prizewinning horseman. And thanks to the efforts of proto-preservationists like cousin Alberti, many later generations of painters and poets continued to meditate on the transitory nature of man's greatest achievements in the shadow of once-majestic edifices like the Baths of Caracalla, built in the early third century by a Roman emperor and pretty much destroyed by the sacking Ostrogoths roughly 300 years later.
Perhaps not incidentally, Michigan Central Station, the best-known Detroit ruin -- a towering 18-story Beaux-Arts train station with a lavish waiting room of terrazzo floors and 50-foot ceilings, built in 1913 by the same architectural firms that designed New York's Grand Central -- was modeled after the Baths of Caracalla. After the station closed in 1988, a developer talked about turning the building into a casino; the current owner, Manuel Moroun, had discussed with Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's administration selling the station to the city as part of a plan to turn the place into police headquarters and police museum.
Mostly, though, Moroun has allowed the station to molder. Sitting nearly a mile and a half from the high-rises of downtown, Michigan Central looms like a Gothic castle over its humbler neighbors on Michigan Avenue. It's hard not to think of it as an epic-scale disaster that seems engineered to illustrate man's folly -- as if the Titanic, after sinking, had washed ashore and been beached as a warning.
In the Detroit essay in ''Yoga for People Who Can't Be Bothered to Do It,'' Geoff Dyer visits Michigan Central Station and runs into some tourists photographing the place. In a funny exchange prompted by one tourist's remarking on how bustling the train station must have been at the height of Detroit's production, Dyer disagrees, arguing:
Ruins don't encourage you to dwell on what they were like in their heyday,before they were ruins. The Colosseum in Rome or the amphitheater at Leptis Magna have never been anything but ruins. They're eternal ruins. It's the same here. This building could never have looked more magnificent than it does now, surrounded by its own silence. Ruins don't make you think of the past, they direct you toward the future. The effect is almost prophetic. This is what the future will end up like. This is what the future has always ended up looking like.
It's true. While vacationing in Rome, after I had spent about a year back in Detroit, I certainly didn't find myself mentally restoring the Senate or the various temples or filling out the scene with centurions and charioteers. But the past was nonetheless on my mind, the past of Keats and Shelley, when a consumptive poet could wander among these same ruins without the security guards and throngs of German tourists -- a time when the ruins were still ruins, but desolate, abandoned, free of all caretakers, not so horribly crowded.
But in Detroit, the tours go on, in an unofficial capacity. One afternoon at the ruins of the 3.5-million-square-foot Packard Plant, I ran into a family from Paris. The daughter said she read about the building in Lonely Planet; her father had a camcorder hanging around his neck. Another time, while conducting my own tour for a guest, a group of German college students drove up. When queried as to the appeal of Detroit, one of them gleefully exclaimed, ''I came to see the end of the world!''
One evening, in a warehouse and occasional performance space in Eastern Market, I attended a talk on the ruins of Detroit. The speaker was Jim Griffioen, a 30-something white guy with a scruffy beard, dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt. He writes the thoughtful local blog Sweet Juniper, which centers on his life as a stay-at-home dad in Detroit. Before moving back to Michigan (he grew up in Kalamazoo), he worked as a lawyer in the Bay Area, but he quit his job to write and take care of his children. His wife practices law, and on the blog, he describes his family as ''just two more yuppies raising their kids in the most dangerous city in America.'' Close to 200 guests packed the warehouse.
On Sweet Juniper, Griffioen has posted a number of ruin shots: ''feral'' houses almost completely overgrown with vegetation; a decommissioned public-school book depository in which trees were growing out of the piles of rotting textbooks. But he apparently possessed a special license to publish such images, because he spent much of his talk denouncing lazy out-of-town journalists who use Detroit's ruins as a convenient recession-year symbol for the end of the American dream. (In fact, Griffioen coined the term ''ruin porn,'' in an interview with Vice magazine.)
During the question-and-answer period, a stylishly dressed African-American woman in her 50s stood up to make a contrarian point: that devotees of ruined buildings should be aware of the ways in which the objects of their affection left ''retinal scars'' on the children of Detroit, contributing to a ''significant part of the psychological trauma'' inflicted on them on a daily basis. Glancing around the audience -- there were four other black people -- she went on: ''I don't want to insult anybody. But when you talk about how 'we' need to take this city back, I look at this room, and I'm not sure what 'we' you're talking about.''
After the talk, I introduced myself to the woman, whose name was Marsha Cusic. She grew up in Highland Park, but her father, Joe Von Battle, had been in the music business in Detroit, running a much-loved record shop on Hastings Street. She agreed to take me on a driving tour of the Detroit of her youth.
We met on a Sunday afternoon. Cusic drove us by the rough location of her father's original store, on a long-paved-over stretch of Interstate 75 that runs past Mack Avenue. Later, we passed the intersection of 12th Street and Clairmount, which was the center of the 1967 civic unrest. Cusic's father's second record store was just a few blocks south.
''Everyone likes to point to the riot as the moment everything went wrong in Detroit,'' Cusic told me. ''But you have to understand the idea of a nodal point. It's the same way a teakettle heats up and heats up, and only at the very end does it whistle. It's easy to look at the riot as that nodal point, but really, you're ignoring all of the heat that came before.''
We detoured into Highland Park, onto a handful of attractive residential streets lined with immaculate bungalows. This was where Cusic grew up. When her family moved in, she said, the area was almost entirely white, primarily automobile executives. Eventually we ended up in Corktown, the formerly Irish neighborhood adjacent to the old train station, which has become a tiny pocket of gentrification. Cusic pointed out a chicken coop in an urban farmer's backyard. ''Chickens in Corktown,'' she said. ''Some of these neighborhoods, they're turning back into what people left behind in the South.''
We passed a couple of young white guys with beards standing on a corner, waiting for a light to change. ''Some of the people coming here bring a sort of bacchanal spirit -- like they're out on the frontier and they can do anything,'' Cusic said. ''Detroit isn't some kind of abstract art project,'' she continued. ''It's real for people. These are real memories. Every one of these houses has a story.''
We stopped for lunch at a little French bistro. Cusic told me she had a grown son who moved to Los Angeles for work and a sister in Atlanta. Cusic still hadn't visited her sister and had even been reluctant to go out west to see her son. She doesn't fly, and besides, she joked sardonically, if she left she worried she wouldn't want to come back.

HEADLINE: The Enchanted Island of Centenarians

 BODY:
The American health care system should take a few hints from the island of Ikaria. Direct medical care at the E.R. and costly prescription research are not making our country healthier. The Ikarian sense of community betters social and mental health. The irregular workweek allows ample rest and time to enjoy food. Universal access to food, in the backyard and at a neighbor's kitchen table, would reduce the stress that many of our unemployed feel. We should encourage vibrant and connected neighborhoods with thriving centers and access to healthful foods. HAYLEY PICKUS, Portland, Ore. 
I see the appeal of life on Ikaria. But I wonder if any of the islanders feel like they have a great book inside them. Or want to study painting or science or perhaps build a business. Do any of them yearn to do more than chitchat and gossip? Some people want to experience the great joy of achievement, not just the satisfactions of a stress-free life. BRAD DESCH, New York, posted on nytimes.com
I enjoyed the article about the Greek island of Ikaria, where people seem freakishly long-lived. . . . But when you think about it, there are an awful lot of smallish communities on the coastal Mediterranean. On average, those communities have a pretty high life expectancy. But you'd also expect there to be some random variance. And you'd expect one small community or another to simply be a statistical outlier. Only 8,000 people live on Ikaria. They might just happen to have unusually longevity-friendly genetics or have lived longer than your average Greek islander through dumb luck. . . . If you have a few hundred islands, then one of them is going to be the island where the people live the longest, and there isn't necessarily going to be any particularly deep reason that's the case.

HEADLINE: The Mad Max Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
WAUKESHA, Wis.
FOLKS here don't wish disaster on their fellow Americans. They didn't pray for Hurricane Sandy to come grinding up the East Coast, tearing lives apart and plunging millions into darkness.
But the fact is, disasters are good business in Waukesha. And, lately, there have been a lot of disasters.
This Milwaukee suburb, once known for its curative spring waters and, more recently, for being a Republican stronghold in a state that President Obama won on Election Day, happens to be the home of one of the largest makers of residential generators in the country. So when the lights go out in New York -- or on the storm-savaged Jersey Shore or in tornado-hit Missouri or wherever -- the orders come pouring in like a tidal surge.
It's all part of what you might call the Mad Max Economy, a multibillion-dollar-a-year collection of industries that thrive when things get really, really bad. Weather radios, kerosene heaters, D batteries, candles, industrial fans for drying soggy homes -- all are scarce and coveted in the gloomy aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and her ilk. 
It didn't start with the last few hurricanes, either. Modern Mad Max capitalism has been around a while, decades even, growing out of something like old-fashioned self-reliance, political beliefs and post-Apocalyptic visions. The cold war may have been the start, when schoolchildren dove under desks and ordinary citizens dug bomb shelters out back. But economic fears, as well as worries about climate change and an unreliable electronic grid have all fed it.
Driven of late by freakish storms, this industry is growing fast, well beyond the fringe groups that first embraced it. And by some measures, it's bigger than ever.
Businesses like Generac Power Systems, one of three companies in Wisconsin turning out generators, are just the start.
The market for gasoline cans, for example, was flat for years. No longer. ''Demand for gas cans is phenomenal, to the point where we can't keep up with demand,'' says Phil Monckton, vice president for sales and marketing at Scepter, a manufacturer based in Scarborough, Ontario. ''There was inventory built up, but it is long gone.''
Even now, nearly two weeks after the superstorm made landfall in New Jersey, batteries are a hot commodity in the New York area. Win Sakdinan, a spokesman for Duracell, says that when the company gave away D batteries in the Rockaways, a particularly hard-hit area, people ''held them in their hands like they were gold.''
Sales of Eton emergency radios and flashlights rose 15 percent in the week before Hurricane Sandy -- and 220 percent the week of the storm, says Kiersten Moffatt, a company spokeswoman. ''It's important to note that we not only see lifts in the specific regions affected, we see a lift nationwide,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ''We've seen that mindfulness motivates consumers all over the country to be prepared in the case of a similar event.''
Garo Arabian, director of operations at B-Air, a manufacturer based in Azusa, Calif., says he has sold thousands of industrial fans since the storm. ''Our marketing and graphic designer is from Syria, and he says: 'I don't understand. In Syria, we open the windows.' ''
But Mr. Arabian says contractors and many insurers know that mold spores won't grow if carpeting or drywall can be dried out within 72 hours. ''The industry has grown,'' he says, ''because there is more awareness about this kind of thing.''
Retailers that managed to stay open benefited, too. Steve Rinker, who oversees 11 Lowe's home improvement stores in New York and New Jersey, says his stores were sometimes among the few open in a sea of retail businesses.
Predictably, emergency supplies like flashlights, lanterns, batteries and sump pumps sold out quickly, even when they were replenished. The one sought-after item that surprised him the most? Holiday candles. ''If anyone is looking for holiday candles, they are sold out,'' he says. ''People bought every holiday candle we have during the storm.''
If the hurricane was a windfall for Lowe's, its customers didn't seem to mind. Rather, most appeared exceedingly grateful when Mr. Rinker, working at a store in Paterson, N.J., pointed them toward a space heater, or a gasoline can, that could lessen the misery of another day without power.
While sales of emergency supplies spike during storms, several retailers and manufacturers -- including Generac -- say their baseline of sales has grown in recent years, too, perhaps driven by economic uncertainty and the frequency of wild weather and power failures in an overtaxed electrical grid.
''Anytime you see as much devastation as what happened in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and in Joplin, Mo., it brings it to everybody's minds,'' says Mike Vaughn, president of the National Storm Shelter Association, referring to devastating tornadoes that swept through both cities last year. He added, ''$5,000 isn't much to save your family's life,'' a reference to the approximate cost of a storm shelter.
Mr. Vaughn owns a company, too, which makes concrete storm shelters for protection against tornadoes, and he says business has grown about 30 percent in recent years. Talk to him and it's clear that he isn't a doommonger. Yet the members of his association market their products aggressively, warning about the dangers from tornadoes and hurricanes and telling how their products can save lives.
''Nature is strong,'' says the Web site for Vaughn Concrete Products, Mr. Vaughn's company. ''Our shelters are stronger.''
That sort of disaster marketing is all over the place, in the hope that the memory of a nasty storm will persuade consumers to plan ahead and, of course, spend some money.
It's hard to define the overall market for disaster supplies. For one thing, many products that are useful in emergencies -- flashlights, batteries, duct tape and extension cords, to name a few -- are also handy for everyday chores. And other products, like ''bugout bags,'' packs holding enough gear to survive a disaster for a few days, continue to be marketed to a small, but apparently growing, niche of survivalists.
But there's little question that the market is in the multiple billions of dollars. The size of the generator market in the United States, including residential, commercial and industrial models, is roughly $3 billion. Trying to nail down a figure for survival supplies is a much more dicey exercise, given the fuzzy parameters of the market.
Jonathan Dick, director of sales and marketing for the Ready Store, whose slogan is ''where America goes to get ready,'' estimates that the market for disaster supplies like freeze-dried food, flashlights and radios was $500 million for consumers, but several billion dollars when sales to businesses and government agencies are folded in.
''The industry is very event-driven,'' he says. ''When there is a hurricane like this, or the stock market crashes, we'll see crazy increases in demand.''
Mr. Dick says the core customer for his company, which is based in Draper, Utah, and includes retail and online sales, remains ''conservative, gun-toting Republicans.'' But he says the industry is steadily attracting a broader audience. And major retailers have taken note.
Both Walmart and Costco now sell a year's supply of food, much of it freeze-dried. Costco's offering is 120 gallon-size cans of food for $1,499.99. Sears offers emergency/survival rations for dogs. And the National Geographic Channel has a reality series called ''Doomsday Preppers,'' which ''explores the lives of otherwise ordinary Americans who are preparing for the end of the world as we know it.''
David Lyle, the chief executive of the National Geographic Channel, said the program was a breakout hit in its first season. The second season will begin on Tuesday.
''You start by thinking, 'Wow, these people are odd.' Then there is this creeping realization: Who is crazy now?'' says Mr. Lyle, who notes that other shows like ''The Walking Dead'' and ''Revolution'' deal with similar themes, like living off the grid (albeit with zombies). ''How interesting that some of them believe that the oil supply will run out and that will result in civil unrest. And now with Sandy, you see people having brawls in gas lines.''
IF there were a headquarters for the emergency preparedness market, one candidate would be Wisconsin, the center of residential generator manufacturing. Generac's two biggest competitors, Briggs & Stratton and Kohler, are also in the Badger State.
That may be no coincidence. The German immigrants who flocked to the state were particularly skilled in manufacturing engines, in addition to beer and bratwurst.
The founder of Generac, however, was an Iowa transplant and an engineer, Robert Kern, who found a way to make generators so they were more affordable for home use. The time was 1959, during the cold war, when Waukesha had its own missile silo, on the east side of town.
People scarcely seem to remember all of that -- and the missile silo is now a park. But that period may have been the beginning of a survivalist economy, the early shoots of Mad Max capitalism.
It has grown ever since, through recessions and wars, Y2K and 9/11, tornadoes and hurricanes.
So has Generac, with a 15 percent compound annual growth rate since 2000. In 2012, with a big boost from Sandy, the company expects shipments of residential products, which account for 60 percent of its business, to increase nearly 40 percent.
At the company's plant in Whitewater, Wis., about 30 miles southwest of Waukesha, employees have worked three shifts, six days a week, since Hurricane Sandy increased demand. The plant makes residential generators and power washers. Inside, wires and cranes dangle above a bustling factory floor where workers, many in Green Bay Packers garb, assemble the parts. Air hoses hiss, drills drone and carts beep to alert unhurried visitors and keep them from being run over. At a 200,000-square foot distribution warehouse across a parking lot, oversize boxes of generators are stacked high, awaiting shipment.
''Everything in this building, except for the power washers, is sold and then some,'' says Russ Minick, Generac's executive vice president for residential products. ''The metrics on this storm have been nothing like we have ever seen. Compared to Hurricane Isaac, this is five times bigger.''
At the company's newly rehabilitated headquarters in Waukesha, Aaron P. Jagdfeld, the youthful and enthusiastic chief executive, says major storms typically create an immediate demand for portable generators -- and the demand from Sandy was unprecedented.
But while his company has sold tens of thousands of portable generators in recent weeks, Mr. Jagdfeld gets more excited talking about the longer-term possibilities: the sale of more permanent, and more expensive, ''standby'' generators that can be hooked into a house's natural gas line and that turn on immediately when the power goes off.
He explains that standby generators for homes were once considered appropriate for only the largest estates. But the worries of Y2K -- the idea that computers would stop functioning in the new millennium -- made the company realize that it could sell standby computers to a broader market if it could bring down the price, he says.
He now envisions a day when standby generators, which start around $4,500, fully installed, are as common as central air-conditioning, a goal that is a long way off but one helped immeasurably by Hurricane Sandy. Standby generators are in roughly 2.5 percent of stand-alone single-family homes, he said.
''No one knows about it,'' Mr. Jagdfeld says, but he adds, ''It is the next must-have appliance.''
He later tempers his enthusiasm. ''We don't want to appear we are profit-mongering,'' he says. ''This is a horrible situation. It's really, really tough, the marketing around that.''
For now, at least, with tens of thousands still without power and millions of others harboring grim memories, a chimpanzee could sell generators by the truckload. Like Generac, Briggs & Stratton and Kohler say they, too, are swamped by demand.
''People are really starting to understand the impact of what a power outage means to them, and it is changing their behavior,'' says Melanie Tydrich, a senior manager at Kohler, which sells kitchen and bath appliances and standby generators, among other things. ''It's just not something they want to live through again.''
LAURA GIANGERUSO, the mother of two girls, 4 weeks old and 7 years old, certainly fits that description.
In the wake of the storm, Ms. Giangeruso, who is 42 and lives in Glen Ridge, N.J., spent nine of 10 nights living with relatives because her house had no power. With a newborn, she says, she had little choice but to leave. But she says the solution became obvious during a visit with her sister, who lives nearby.
''It was like a miracle,'' she says. ''The power went out, and then in like 30 seconds, I heard this hum.'' She lifts her hands from her hips upward, along her sides. ''And then the power came on.''
So now she is leading an electrical contractor through her home's cold and dark basement, pointing out the electric box and meter, all so she can get an estimate on a standby generator of her own. A neighbor, Chris Nehrbauer, tags along, partly to be neighborly but partly because he is getting an estimate next.
Jack Lamb, the contractor, who works for Bloomfield Cooling, Heating and Electric, says he has been working nonstop since the storm, providing estimates. When he shows up for an estimate, often four or five neighbors are waiting, he says, adding that he is booked through Jan. 8.
Ms. Giangeruso, who notes that last year, after the ''Snowtober storm'' on Halloween, her house was powerless for six days. ''If we are talking in the neighborhood of $6,000, it is worth every dollar. If I could get it right now, I'd write a check,'' she says. ''The wives in this area don't want jewelry for Christmas. They want generators.''

HEADLINE: China Reaffirms Shift To Domestic Spending

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- A senior Chinese official reaffirmed on Saturday a national goal of shifting China's economy away from its dependence on investment and exports and toward a more sustainable emphasis on consumption spending.
In doing so, the official, Zhang Ping, the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, glossed over recent data that suggested the reverse might be happening.
Mr. Zhang, whose agency oversees economic planning and coordinates the country's economic ministries, said in a news conference held in conjunction with the 18th Party Congress that the Chinese economy was growing again, crediting government policies aimed at moving China away from its reliance on capturing an ever greater share of overseas markets for its exports. He also claimed success in easing the economy's dependence on enormous investment, which has become less efficient and less productive as many industries struggle with overcapacity. 
''Starting from August, the turn toward a slower economy has been effectively curbed,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''From the October economic data, we can see that the trend toward a rebalancing of the Chinese economy is all the more obvious.''
But independent economists question whether any such conclusion is justified. China's General Administration of Customs announced on Saturday morning that the country's trade surplus in October had soared to $32 billion, the highest level in nearly four years. Exports surged 11.6 percent from a year earlier, while imports rose 2.4 percent.
Chinese officials are acutely conscious of the frictions that their trade surpluses create with importer nations like the United States, and have argued for many years that the surpluses are temporary and should not be an issue because they might soon disappear. President Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, vied during the presidential election campaign over who could be tougher in trade and currency disputes with China over the next four years.
Commerce Minister Chen Deming tried again on Saturday to allay foreign concerns about rising Chinese exports, describing the surge as unlikely to last. He said exports would probably not remain strong because of economic troubles in overseas markets and because of what Mr. Chen described as an international rise in protectionism.
''The trade situation will be relatively grim in the next few months,'' he said, ''and there will be many difficulties next year.''
Investment has also surged rapidly this autumn, government statistics released on Friday showed, as state-owned banks have lent heavily to state-owned enterprises.
A series of news conferences on economic policy -- a third was held on Saturday evening on efforts to encourage industrial innovation -- came as the 2,268 delegates to the Party Congress attended closed-door meetings on the third day of the gathering, which is held every five years. The Congress is scheduled to choose a new Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party this coming week, and that committee will approve a list of leaders who are expected to run the country for the next decade.
Mr. Zhang said in his news conference that the economy was becoming less reliant on exports and investment spending. He omitted October in citing data from 2012's first nine months that he described as showing that consumption had been playing a bigger role than investment in economic growth. He also said exports had been a drag on growth.
But investment, which had slumped early this year as the government limited bank lending and restricted real estate sales to pop a housing bubble, has been bouncing back as the restrictions have been eased. Exports were also very weak early this year because of Europe's difficulties, but are strengthening as American demand rebounds.
Wang Tao, a China economist at UBS in Hong Kong, said short-term changes in various sectors of the economy made it hard to draw any reliable conclusions about whether policy makers had been able to shift the foundations of the Chinese economy onto a firmer and more sustainable footing.
But she expressed skepticism that any fundamental shift had taken place so far, saying: ''These are cyclical moves. Rebalancing happens very slowly.''
At the news conference on innovation, corporate executives expressed concern about China's ability to create its own inventions. But Liang Wengen, the president of Sany Heavy Industry, a big construction equipment manufacturer, answered a last question on American investment policies.
Mr. Liang is widely viewed as a well-connected industrialist with the best chance of becoming the first business tycoon to join the Central Committee, possibly this coming week. He bitterly criticized the Obama administration on Saturday evening for its decision not to allow an American company owned by Sany executives to install Sany-made wind turbines in or near restricted airspace next to a United States Navy site where drones are developed.
Mr. Liang promised a long legal battle against the decision, saying: ''We will fight to the end. We hope we will achieve final victory, because we believe in the justice of U.S. law, the courage of the American people and the justice of the world.''

HEADLINE: Romney Is President

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
IT makes sense that Mitt Romney and his advisers are still gobsmacked by the fact that they're not commandeering the West Wing.
(Though, as ''The Daily Show'' correspondent John Oliver jested, the White House might have been one of the smaller houses Romney ever lived in.)
Team Romney has every reason to be shellshocked. Its candidate, after all, resoundingly won the election of the country he was wooing. 
Mitt Romney is the president of white male America.
Maybe the group can retreat to a man cave in a Whiter House, with mahogany paneling, brown leather Chesterfields, a moose head over the fireplace, an elevator for the presidential limo, and one of those men's club signs on the phone that reads: ''Telephone Tips: 'Just Left,' 25 cents; 'On His Way,' 50 cents; 'Not here,' $1; 'Who?' $5.''
In its delusional death spiral, the white male patriarchy was so hard core, so redolent of country clubs and Cadillacs, it made little effort not to alienate women. The election had the largest gender gap in the history of the Gallup poll, with Obama winning the vote of single women by 36 percentage points.
As W.'s former aide Karen Hughes put it in Politico on Friday, ''If another Republican man says anything about rape other than it is a horrific, violent crime, I want to personally cut out his tongue.''
Some Republicans conceded they were ''a 'Mad Men' party in a 'Modern Family' world'' (although ''Mad Men'' seems too louche for a candidate who doesn't drink or smoke and who apparently dated only one woman). They also acknowledged that Romney's strategists ran a 20th-century campaign against David Plouffe's 21st-century one.
But the truth is, Romney was an unpalatable candidate. And shocking as it may seem, his strategists weren't blowing smoke when they said they were going to win; they were just clueless.
Until now, Republicans and Fox News have excelled at conjuring alternate realities. But this time, they made the mistake of believing their fake world actually existed. As Fox's Megyn Kelly said to Karl Rove on election night, when he argued against calling Ohio for Obama: ''Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better?''
Romney and Tea Party loonies dismissed half the country as chattel and moochers who did not belong in their ''traditional'' America. But the more they insulted the president with birther cracks, the more they tried to force chastity belts on women, and the more they made Hispanics, blacks and gays feel like the help, the more these groups burned to prove that, knitted together, they could give the dead-enders of white male domination the boot.
The election about the economy also sounded the death knell for the Republican culture wars.
Romney was still running in an illusory country where husbands told wives how to vote, and the wives who worked had better get home in time to cook dinner. But in the real country, many wives were urging husbands not to vote for a Brylcreemed boss out of a '50s boardroom whose party was helping to revive a 50-year-old debate over contraception.
Just like the Bushes before him, Romney tried to portray himself as more American than his Democratic opponent. But America's gallimaufry wasn't knuckling under to the gentry this time.
If 2008 was about exalting the One, 2012 was about the disenchanted Democratic base deciding: ''We are the Ones we've been waiting for.''
Last time, Obama lifted up the base with his message of hope and change; this time the base lifted up Obama, with the hope he will change. He has not led the Obama army to leverage power, so now the army is leading Obama.
When the first African-American president was elected, his supporters expected dramatic changes. But Obama feared that he was such a huge change for the country to digest, it was better if other things remained status quo. Michelle played Laura Petrie, and the president was dawdling on promises. Having Joe Biden blurt out his support for gay marriage forced Obama's hand.
The president's record-high rate of deporting illegal immigrants infuriated Latinos. Now, on issues from loosening immigration laws to taxing the rich to gay rights to climate change to legalizing pot, the country has leapt ahead, pulling the sometimes listless and ruminating president by the hand, urging him to hurry up.
More women voted than men. Five women were newly elected to the Senate, and the number of women in the House will increase by at least three. New Hampshire will be the first state to send an all-female delegation to Congress. Live Pink or Dye.
Meanwhile, as Bill Maher said, ''all the Republican men who talked about lady parts during the campaign, they all lost.''
The voters anointed a lesbian senator, and three new gay congressmen will make a total of five in January. Plus, three states voted to legalize same-sex marriage. Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, told The Washington Post's Ned Martel that gays, whose donations helped offset the Republican ''super PACs,'' wanted to see an openly gay cabinet secretary and an openly gay ambassador to a G-20 nation.
Bill O'Reilly said Obama's voters wanted ''stuff.'' He was right. They want Barry to stop bogarting the change.

HEADLINE: The Cliff Is a Hard Place to Compromise

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
FRESH off his re-election, President Obama enters the coming budget negotiations with some clear advantages. Voters have just ratified his broad agenda. And the specific mixture of spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect on Jan. 1, unless the two parties can reach a deal, is far more consistent with Mr. Obama's preferred long-term policies than with the Republican version. The status quo favors Democrats.
Yet the president also comes into the talks with a couple of important disadvantages that are easy to miss amid his post-election glow. He and his Congressional allies began their efforts to reduce those disadvantages in recent days, and they will spend much of the next few weeks of negotiating and posturing continuing to do so.
Crucially, nobody yet knows whether Mr. Obama is willing to go over the so-called fiscal cliff and allow the scheduled changes -- the end of all the Bush tax cuts and the temporary tax cuts from Obama stimulus bills, as well as cuts to military and domestic programs -- to take effect. If they were to take effect, the economy could fall into recession next year, economists say. But if Republicans believe that Mr. Obama does not consider failure to be an option, as was the case during the debt-ceiling talks in 2011, they have little incentive to compromise. 
Almost as important, the closest thing to a framework for a big deficit agreement has more for Republicans to like than for Democrats. Mr. Obama was so eager to reach a deal with Congressional Republicans in 2011 that he agreed to the outline of a plan that made many Democrats cringe. It was well to the political right -- with fewer tax increases, fewer military cuts and more cuts to Medicare and Social Security -- of the bipartisan plan released by the Bowles-Simpson commission in 2010.
Mr. Obama was mostly quiet last week, reiterating on Friday that he wanted a ''balanced approach.'' But Congressional Democrats were already sending signals that Mr. Obama should -- and would -- allow the scheduled changes to take effect on Jan. 1 if need be. The Democrats were also making the case that the election's outcome had wiped away the relevance of the 2011 framework.
''It's not like this was some sort of side issue during the campaign,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a top House Democrat, said last week. Mr. Obama promised to raise tax rates on high earners, and Mitt Romney vowed not to. ''The president won that argument,'' Mr. Van Hollen said.
The fight is likely to be one of the most consequential of Mr. Obama's second term (even if it technically takes place in his first term). With the Republicans in control of the House, Mr. Obama will probably not be able to pass any sweeping new legislation -- say, on climate change -- in the next four years, as he did on health care in 2010. He can instead cement the accomplishments of his first term and look for medium-size victories, like an immigration overhaul or increased funding for alternative-energy research.
And, thanks to the fiscal cliff, he will have a chance to shape the federal budget for years to come.
If he can persuade the Republicans to increase taxes on the affluent and leave them low on the middle class and poor, he will take a step toward reducing economic inequality. Those tax increases, combined with more military cuts than Republicans favor, would also leave the federal government with money to spend on education, scientific research, clean energy, roads and mass transit, all of which Mr. Obama calls crucial to the economy of the future.
Perhaps his strongest weapon in the debate is that Americans mostly agree with him on these issues -- in greater numbers, in fact, than they voted for him last week. Polls generally show that strong majorities support higher taxes on the affluent and more spending on a handful of tangible domestic programs, like schools and infrastructure.
''What I hope the White House does is take this case outside the Beltway to the country,'' Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, told me. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, added that he thought the election -- both the outcome and the exit polls -- had two mandates. ''One was for both sides to come together,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''Two was to raise taxes on the wealthy.''
Higher taxes on the affluent cannot solve the long-term deficit, which is foremost a product of rising health costs. But higher taxes can make a significant dent over the next decade. That is in part because upper-end taxes have fallen so much over the past 30 years.
Many budget analysts have called for about $500 billion in annual deficit reduction by 2020. The expiration of the Bush tax cuts on income above $250,000 would cut $110 billion. Other tax changes that many Democrats favor, like restricting some loopholes for high-end taxpayers, could add another $50 billion to $100 billion. Spending cuts and tax increases on the middle class or poor would still be necessary, but many fewer of them than if taxes do not change.
For now, Republicans have signaled some openness to accepting higher taxes. But they and the Democrats remain far apart, on both the overall size and the composition of a tax agreement. (Republicans say they will accept only the closing of loopholes, not the higher rates that would come from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts on upper income.)
Given the administration's repeated failure to win over Republicans in its first term, Obama advisers have been talking for weeks about whether he could stand firm and allow the scheduled changes to take effect on Jan. 1. Doing so might hurt a still-vulnerable economy, by leaving consumers with less money and reducing government spending. The reaction from markets may aggravate the situation.
But going over the so-called cliff also has the potential to be less bad than feared. It would be a slow accumulation of economic changes and not entirely unexpected, which is very different from defaulting on the country's debt payments, as nearly happened during the 2011 debt-ceiling talks. Democrats have begun making this point more loudly, in part to send the message that they are willing to accept the scheduled budget changes if need be.
''For the president to have any leverage, he has to make the Republicans believe he is willing to let the tax cuts expire,'' said James R. Horney of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has close ties to the White House and Congressional Democrats. ''The only way, I suspect, that he can convince them he is willing to let that happen is to actually let it happen.''
Republicans, having absorbed defeat and seen the polls showing that Americans consider their party less willing to compromise than Mr. Obama, may well decide to do so before Jan. 1. House leaders spoke of compromise last week. But betting on an unexpectedly smooth bipartisan deal generally hasn't been the smart move lately.

HEADLINE: A New Senator, Known Nationally and Sometimes Feared

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- When Elizabeth Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington two years ago and sought to become its director, she was fiercely opposed by Republican senators who feared she had a visceral loathing of financial institutions and would be a thorn in their sides.
President Obama was so convinced she could not win Senate confirmation that he did not even bother to nominate her.
Now, Ms. Warren, 63, is returning to Washington as a member of the very club that sought to block her and dilute the power of her consumer bureau. She got there by campaigning against the big banks and lobbyists, the millionaires and billionaires who, she said, rigged the system against the middle class.
The question now is how she will approach her job as the newly elected Democratic senator from Massachusetts. How will she interact with those who spurned her? How can she most effectively fulfill the populist promise of her candidacy while serving in an institution that runs on seniority and prefers deference to defiance? 
So far, she has sent mixed signals. As she thanked her campaign workers in her victory speech on election night, she said, ''You took on the powerful Wall Street banks and special interests, and you let them know you want a senator who'll be out there fighting for the middle class all of the time.''
But shortly thereafter, she spoke of compromise and balance and said she had learned the importance of bipartisanship from her Republican opponent, Senator Scott P. Brown.
On Thursday, at her first formal news conference since the election, the normally feisty and loquacious Harvard law professor was about as low-key as she could get without disappearing. She responded to some questions with just a word or two. She would not say what committee assignments she might seek. Even on the subject of the record number of women in the Senate, a response had to be dragged out of her. (Twenty is better, she said, but not good enough.) Ms. Warren is a quick study, and perhaps she had already learned that campaigning is different from legislating. After the news conference, she told a smaller group of reporters that as a senator she needed to be discreet.
''Listen,'' she said, ''all I can say is I was a lot more discreet as a candidate than I was in real life.'' She then turned to an aide. ''Can I say that?'' she asked. ''Maybe it's indiscreet to talk about discretion.''
Bankers and Wall Street types might be surprised to hear that during the campaign Ms. Warren held herself in check.
''Wall Street C.E.O.'s -- the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs -- still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors and acting like we should thank them,'' Ms. Warren declared in her prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention.
That was the Elizabeth Warren who earned the adoration of millions of people across the country, the one who spoke truth to power and was not worried about sounding indiscreet. And it is what they expect of her now that she has a powerful new platform in Washington.
''Elizabeth Warren is a doer,'' said Neil Barofsky, who, as the special inspector general for oversight of the bank bailouts, worked with Ms. Warren and wrote about her in his book, ''Bailout.'' He added, ''I think she would suffocate if she went down to the Senate and kept her head down and played nice and made compromises.''
Hillary Rodham Clinton is often cited as the model of a national celebrity who came to the Senate, kept her head down, worked hard and built relationships across the aisle.
''Hard edges don't work very well in the Senate,'' Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University and student of the Senate, said of Ms. Warren. ''Her base regards her, quite justifiably, as a great heroine. But I suspect that MoveOn.org will have unrealistic expectations.''
Ms. Warren, speaking last year to New York magazine, rejected the Clinton model.
''If the notion on this is we're going to elect somebody to the United States Senate so they can be the 100th least senior person in there and be polite, and somewhere in their fourth or fifth year do some bipartisan bill that nobody cares about, don't vote for me,'' she said.
Ms. Warren has also written critically of Mrs. Clinton for compromising on a bankruptcy bill that was supported by the financial industry. When she was the first lady, Mrs. Clinton opposed the bill. But as a senator from New York -- when she needed support from Wall Street, a hometown industry -- she voted for it.
''She couldn't afford such a principled position,'' Ms. Warren wrote. ''Campaigns cost money, and that money wasn't coming from families in financial trouble.''
Ms. Warren is not likely to face that particular dilemma. The financial services sector gave Mr. Brown more than $5.5 million to defeat her. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that ''no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren.''
But Ms. Warren raised a stunning $39 million, the most of any Senate candidate this year, proving that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win.
''She doesn't need their money,'' Mr. Barofsky said. ''That gives her freedom and independence.''
Wall Street is bracing for Ms. Warren to stay true to form.
Christopher Whalen, a senior managing director of Tangent Capital Partners, said on Fox News after the election, ''Liz Warren is only one of 100 senators, thank God. She's kind of an angry Calvinist.''
Ms. Warren's adversaries are said to be trying to keep her off the banking committee, where she could push for more regulation, while her admirers want her to be on it.
''Her strategy will depend on what happens,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. ''If she doesn't get on the banking committee, then she'll take a more outspoken approach.'' He said that Democrats as a whole had not followed through on several issues of financial reform, so ''it matters a great deal'' where Ms. Warren is assigned.
''Not putting her on banking would make the Democratic Party look like a creature of Wall Street, which, by the way, it is,'' Professor Johnson said. ''But they don't like to be too explicit about it.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who helped recruit Ms. Warren for the Senate race, sought to deflect criticism that he was doing Wall Street's bidding and trying to keep her off the banking panel, saying in an interview that he would help her get on whatever committee she wanted. He predicted she would learn to navigate the Senate because she knows how to adapt, just as she adapted during her campaign to become a better candidate.
''She has a national voice before coming to the Senate, but she will be very respectful of her colleagues,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''She can be a strong voice and, at the same time, be a team player.''

HEADLINE: Up Front

BYLINE: By THE EDITORS

 BODY:
When Jill Abramson was assigned to her first presidential campaign, in 1976, elections had become media spectacles. The first presidential debates since 1960 were held that year, and the candidates' high and low moments were instantly assessed and picked apart, just as they were in 2012. But much else has changed. Today we inhabit the age of incessant, up-to-the-nanosecond polling, deep-pocketed PAC ads, round-the-clock ''messaging'' from candidates and their handlers, and -- do we need to add? -- blanket newspaper coverage, in print and online. 
As The New York Times's executive editor, Abramson supervises a bewildering array of moving parts. She listed some of them in an e-mail: ''Live-streaming video of big campaign moments like the conventions and debates, live blogging, poll analysis, graphics, photography,'' in addition to the many articles written by The Times's team of campaign reporters.
''Presenting it all in a coherent way has been an interesting challenge,'' Abramson told us. And yet, she added, ''this election does not seem as big a historical watershed as four years ago,'' when the nation, in the midst of an economic crisis, elected its first African-American president.
For Abramson, who studied history at Harvard, the interplay of politics past and present is a longstanding preoccupation, as is clear from her review of Jon Meacham's ''Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power.'' Jefferson and his contemporaries were steeped in history. Does Abramson detect an equivalent sense of the past in today's contenders for the White House?
''President Obama is a history buff and has brought American historians, including Robert Caro, to the White House for salonlike conversations,'' she pointed out. ''He seems very aware of his place in history.'' And his opponent? ''Mitt Romney's election would be a huge moment in the difficult history of Mormons in America as well as another turn in the evolution of the American conservative movement.''

HEADLINE: Squirming Hawks

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: How do they condemn too much deficit reduction? 

 BODY:
The fiscal cliff poses an interesting problem for self-styled deficit hawks. They've been going on and on about how the deficit is a terrible thing; now they're confronted with the possibility of a large reduction in the deficit, and have to find a way to say that this is a bad thing.
And so what you see, in reports like this one from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- is a lot of squirming.
Now, there's a straightforward argument for why the fiscal cliff is bad but long-term deficit reduction is good -- namely, that you really don't want to cut deficits when the economy is depressed and you're in a liquidity trap, so that monetary expansion can't offset fiscal contraction. As Keynes said, the boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity. But the deficit hawks can't make that argument, because they have in fact been arguing for austerity now now now.
So they're left making a mostly incoherent case: it's too abrupt (why?), it's the wrong kind of deficit reduction (???), and then this:
a better approach would be to focus spending cuts on low-priority spending and on changes which can help to encourage growth and generate new revenue through comprehensive tax reform which broadens the base - ideally by enough to also lower tax rates.
Low-priority spending? I think that means spending on poor people and the middle class. And isn't it amazing how people who claim to be horrified, horrified about deficits can't stop talking about cutting tax rates?
Meanwhile, the CRFB features on its home page an op-ed by Jim Jones declaring that 
We are perilously close to trillion-dollar yearly interest payments, 7 percent yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, 10 percent home mortgage rates and 13 percent rates on car loans. For the good of the country, the parties must come together and not let this happen.
How does he know that we are "perilously close" to this outcome? Not from the markets; not from any kind of economic model. My guess is that Peggy Noonan told him.
Anyway, revealing stuff.

HEADLINE: At the Box Office, It's a James Bond Weekend

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: "Skyfall," the newest James Bond film, took in an estimated $87.8 million, making it the biggest weekend for 007 ever. 

 BODY:
 LOS ANGELES -- The 50-year-old James Bond movie franchise -- a survivor of Austin Powers parodies, egregious product placement, Jason Bourne, polyester and Denise Richards in the role of a nuclear physicist -- just delivered its best opening-weekend results ever.
 "Skyfall" took in an estimated $87.8 million over the weekend in North American theaters, easily enough for No. 1 and a new high for Ian Fleming's long-in-the-tooth superspy -- even when adjusting for inflation, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. ("Skyfall" did have the advantage of playing in 3,505 theaters.)
 "Skyfall," which cost Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment about $200 million to make, has taken in an additional $428 million overseas, where Sony has distribution rights. The Imax sneak-peek showings in North America chipped in $2.2 million more.
"Part of it is movie magic -- the team here knocked it out of the park -- and part of it is franchise DNA," said Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution. "From the inception of Bond until now, most men fantasize about being him and most women fantasize about dating him."
The "Skyfall" results are also a stark reminder for Hollywood, ever in search of blockbusters, that nothing beats old-fashioned storytelling and filmmaking. "Skyfall" earned stellar reviews -- on par with Steven Spielberg's Oscar-contending "Lincoln," according to RottenTomatoes.com -- by delivering a coherent plot, bringing back classic characters, embracing 007's historically playful tone and eschewing computerized effects in favor of live-action shoots.
 In many ways, "Skyfall" listened to Bond fans, many of whom were upset with the 2008 "Quantum of Solace. Perhaps feeling pressure from the younger Jason Bourne spy series, "Quantum of Solace" stripped out much of the Bond quirk. Audiences gave "Skyfall" an A score in exit polls.
 Starring Daniel Craig in his third outing as 007 and Javier Bardem as a throwback villain, "Skyfall" was directed by Sam Mendes from a script by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan. 
 "Bond has a resonance that keeps him cool, and Sam Mendes clearly paid particular attention to that," said Greg Foster, chairman and president of Imax Filmed Entertainment.
 That "Skyfall" made it to screens at all is something of a Hollywood miracle. The film was delayed due to lengthy financial troubles at MGM that resulted in bankruptcy. Sony helped save the day, agreeing to co-finance and distribute the thriller for a continued stake in the series. MGM and its producing partner, EON Productions, own roughly 75 percent of "Skyfall," with Sony holding the remaining 25 percent.
 The studios delivered a marketing campaign that included Mr. Craig's much-discussed stunt at the London Olympics, supposedly parachuting into the opening ceremony with Queen Elizabeth II in his arms. For Sony's marketing wizards, "Skyfall" is their 9th No. 1 release of 2012.
Can they make "Skyfall" the biggest Bond of all time in America? It will be difficult: "Thunderball" (1965) holds that rank, taking in $508.2 million in North America, after adjusting for inflation, according to Hollywood.com.
 For the weekend, "Wreck-It Ralph" (Walt Disney Studios) was second, selling an estimated $33.1 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $93.7 million. Two well-reviewed dramas were third and fourth: "Flight" (Paramount Pictures) took in about $15.1 million, for a two-week total of $47.8 million, and "Argo" (Warner Brothers) grossed $6.7 million, lifting its five-week total to an estimated $87.1 million.
 "Taken 2" (Fox) chugged along in fifth place, with about $4 million, for a six-week total of $131.3 million.
 Also notable was "Lincoln," which arrived in only 11 theaters as a buzz-building technique -- perhaps the smallest initial release ever for one of Mr. Spielberg's films -- and took in $900,000.
An earlier version of this post misidentified the company that has overseas distribution rights for "Skyfall." It is Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has global distribution rights, not 20th Century Fox.

HEADLINE: What Party Congress? On 'Singles Day,' China Said to Surpass U.S. Cyber Sales

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Nov. 11 was the fourth day of the week-long 18th Party Congress, but it was also Singles Day, in which a lot more Chinese took part. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - In China on Sunday, as the leaders huddled, the people shopped. A lot.
Nov. 11 may have been the fourth day of the weeklong 18th Party Congress which is choosing, in secret, a party Central Committee and the future leaders of the country's 1.35 billion people. But it was also Singles Day - an unofficial festival that Chinese say is unique in the world, marked by furious shopping, often online, for anything from winter clothes to jewelry to cars, for those either celebrating or bemoaning their single status.
For the government, which is spooked by falling economic growth rates as it negotiates a delicate political transition, the consumption boom - even if just for one day - is a boon.
The origins of what is known in Chinese as "Guanggun jie," or, literally, "Bare Branch Festival" (guanggun also means bachelor), are somewhat mysterious, but reportedly date back to a charmingly low-key, local story: the uneventful lives of four single, male, Chinese university students in the 1990s, as a blogger on the social networking site Renren.com explains in a bilingual entry called "Lu Zhenxing's Diary." (Does anyone else feel a movie script stirring?)
"An old story goes that once there were four single men, leading very boring lives. None of them were married, or had lovers, or did anything exciting. They just sat around all day and played Mahjong," Lu Zhenxing's Diary narrates.
"One day they played Mahjong from 11 in the morning until 11 at night," it runs. The four numerals, added together, perfectly represented their plight: four single men. And the date was 11.11. It was all too good to be true, and "These college students have since graduated, and carried their university tradition into society," Lu Zhenxing's Diary notes, with celebrations among the unmarried beginning in Nanjing, a former capital where one of the country's most famous universities, Nanjing University, is located, in the 1990s. "Singles Day is now a special day for all fashionable youths," the diary notes.
The story can't be proven, but either way, it's a welcome boost for the government, which is pushing for an upsurge in domestic consumption as China's economy has plunged, as my colleague Keith Bradsher writes. 
The Associated Press reported that in the first 13 hours of business on Sunday, merchants on Tmall.com, which is owned by online giant Alibaba, took in a whopping 10 billion renmimbi, or $1.6 billion. 
That would top the $1.25 billion that research firm comScore said online retailers in the United States took last year on Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, and might make Singles Day the biggest e-commerce sales day on record, The A.P. wrote.
"This is very, very big for us," Steve Wang, vice president of Tmall.com and head of Web site operations, said, and Sunday might be the "biggest e-shopping orgy ever," the company said on its Web site. China has 193 million online shoppers, more than the 170 million in the United States - and the number is only growing, The A.P. wrote.
Yet while some single Chinese people were celebrating their status, others felt highly ambiguous about it.
"The main way to celebrate Singles Day is to have dinner with your single friends, but it's important that each person pay their own way to show their independence," the diary noted.
But, "People also hold 'blind date' parties in an attempt to bid goodbye to their single lives," it continued. "Some people will use this date and this meaning to tell their special someone that they are the only 'one' in their heart." And, with that, presumably exit the ranks of those shopping up a storm on that day.

HEADLINE: The Culture War and the Jobs Crisis

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Does the Obama coalition have the capacity to re-engineer capitalism to produce sustained economic growth while working toward social justice? 

 BODY:
Struggling to remain optimistic the day after the election, the anti-abortion activist Charles A. Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, argued that the moral collapse he sees in the re-election of President Obama and in Democratic Senate victories is only a temporary setback.
On the National Review web site, Donovan declared:
We may be on the verge of a new Babylonian captivity for religious conservatives. As we know, the story does not end there.
Actually, Donovan and his fellow right-wingers can expect to be living in a Babylonian captivity for quite some time. The right has lost the culture war.
On Nov. 6, voters in three states (Maine, Maryland and Washington) approved same-sex marriage; two states (Colorado and Washington) passed ballot initiatives allowing the recreational use of marijuana; Wisconsin elected the first openly gay Senator, Tammy Baldwin; and Florida voters rejected a ballot initiative prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions by ten points.
In the next Congress, women and minorities will hold a majority of the Democratic Party's House seats - white men, in other words, for the first time in history, will not make up a majority of a party's delegation to the House. Every member of the House and Senate from New Hampshire will be a woman and the total number of female senators will jump from 15 to 20 in 2013.
To the dismay of the conservative movement, on virtually every burning issue that preoccupies the right, the country has moved steadily leftward. Election Day exit polling found, by a margin of 49 to 46, that a plurality of voters supported same-sex marriage. The same survey found that 59 percent of voters believe abortion should be legal in all (29 percent) or most (30 percent) cases, while only 36 percent believe it should be illegal in most (23 percent) or all (13 percent) cases.
The following chart from Gallup on the "morality" of same-sex "relations" reflects the leftward cultural trend with the percentage ofrespondents saying that homosexual relations are morally acceptable growing from 40 percent in 2001 to 54 percent in 2012:
Similarly, researchers at American National Election Studies have found continuing growth in the level of support for the equality of women:
Republicans and conservatives are clearly struggling to come to terms with the changing character of the nation.
From the hard right, Erick Erickson calls for purgingthe Republican party of moderates in order to achieve ideological purity:
We must lay the groundwork now with fresh ideas embedded with timeless principles sold by voices who understand people forget and must be reminded why America is great and why conservatism helped make it that way. We must continue, as a conservative movement, challenging and ending the political careers of Republicans who carry the banner of conservatism while selling it out.
It is unlikely, however, that bloodletting within the Republican Party will solve its current problems. The roots of the party's dilemma run deeper, with two parallel and mutually reinforcing developments structuring political change
The first is the coalescing of "issue clusters" - particularly on the left.
Throughout much of the period of conservative domination of presidential elections from 1968 to 1988 - and in terms of Congressional power from 1994 to 2006 - the Republican Party had a major election-day edge: there was far more ideological cohesion and less divisive conflict on the right than on the left. Conservatives, from white evangelicals to corporate C.E.O.s, found common ground in their support for an aggressive national defense and in their opposition to what they saw as a coercive, redistributive tax collecting and intrusively regulatory domestic government. 
The left was often split: between environmentalists and pro-development unions; between proponents and opponents of affirmative action; between law-and-order whites and liberal advocates of criminal defendants' rights. As a result, the Democratic Party was vulnerable to Republican wedge issue strategies that produced such famous political commercials as Jesse Helms's "Hands" - a k a. "White Hands" - and Ronald Reagan's "Bear"
More recently, there has been a steady diminution of conflict and a growing consensus on the left culminating in the 2008 and 2012 election victories. Issues now linked - clustered - in the minds of many Democratic voters include not only traditional socio-cultural, moral and racial issues like women's, minority and gay rights, abortion and contraception, non-marital child-bearing, and the obligation of government to provide a safety net, but also to matters pertaining to the overarching role of government in generating greater social justice.
In this view, the achievement of a just society requires a government active in pursuing a progressive distribution of income (through the tax code, for example), and the reduction of armed conflict, as well as the active regulation of matters as diverse as sustainable development, environmental protection and consumer-friendly reform of the finance and banking sectors.
Essentially, the new core of the party - minorities, unmarried men and women, young voters and whites with advanced degrees - is in general agreement on this broader spectrum of issues, forming a coalition of shared ideas.
The aggregation of a broad set of issues in forming a left or right political orientation marks a major change in American politics. Philip Converse, of the University of Michigan, studied data from the 1956 and 1960 elections and found that only a small minority of highly educated and well-informed voters viewed politics through what might be called an ideological lens.
But things have really changed since then.
Alan Abramowitz of Emory University has documented a major shift as voters have made decisions based on a collection of variables that once would have been seen as unrelated. In a study based on 2008 polling, Abramowitz found majorities or solid pluralities of voters formed consistently liberal or conservative views - not centrist positions - on a continuum of issues including gay rights and abortion; off-shore oil drilling; the Iraq war; health care; financial regulation; climate change and mortgage assistance to low-income homeowners.
In effect, Abramowitz writes, the historical dependence of the Democratic Party on moderate-to-conservative whites 
has decreased considerably while the contribution of liberal whites and especially nonwhites has increased. While moderate-to-conservative whites made up a majority of those who voted for Carter, they comprised barely a quarter of those who voted for Obama.
Demographic groups that favor social justice dispute the even-handedness of the marketplace; they often view business and corporations with suspicion; and they believe that the state has an obligation to provide for those struggling in a free market system. These demographic constituencies have grown in numbers, and today form a relatively robust coalition: the Democratic Party.
Single voters are more amenable than are their married counterparts to a government focused on social justice. Unmarried voters are substantially more vulnerable to economic downturns and the loss of a job; they look more favorably on such safety net programs as unemployment benefits, government-sponsored health insurance, and government initiatives to ensure food security. Married couples, on the other hand, are more focused on minimizing their tax burden.
The share of the electorate made up of single voters has been growing steadily. In 1992, 34 percent of voters were unmarried; in 2012, it was 40 percent. In the population as a whole, 72 percent of adults were married in 1972; in 2010, it was just 51 percent.
On a larger scale, the Pew Research Center has produced an analysis that shows that minority voters, who backed Obama by an 8-2 margin, will be an absolute majority of the population in 38 years, growing from 15.1 percent in 1960 to 34 percent in 2011 to 51 percent in 2050. Minority voters hold policy and ideological views very similar to those of unmarried men and women - they are in fact an overlapping population because a much lower percentage of African American (at 31 percent) and Hispanic adults (at 48 percent) are married than whites (at 55 percent). Minority voters are noticeably more supportive of activist government policies than the average white voter.
The contrasting issue priorities of Democrats and Republicans - marital status aside - were evident in the answer to a particular question the 2012 exit polls asked. When voters were prompted to pick the most important issue facing the country - foreign policy, the federal deficit, the economy or health care - only 15 percent chose the deficit, but those who chose the deficit were overwhelmingly Romney voters by a 2-1 margin, 66-32. A slightly higher percentage, 18 percent, chose health care, and these voters supported Obama voters by a 3-1 margin, 75-24.
An illuminating chart that tracks demographic shifts from 2004 to 2008 to 2012, appropriately headlined "Obama Was Not as Strong as in 2008, but Strong Enough," and a similar graphic presentation by the Washington Post, show that demographic shifts have reached a point at which Democrats have a decisive advantage.
Compared to 2008, Obama's major gains this year were limited to Hispanics, who went from 67-31 Democratic in 2008 to 71-27 in 2008; and Asian-Americans, who went from 62-35 Democratic to 73-26. Those gains were adequate to produce victory by off-setting enough of the decline in support for Obama from many other groups, including men, who went from 48-49 to 45-52; whites, down from 43-55 to 39-59; voters with incomes above $100,000, from 49-49 to 44-54; Jewish voters, from 78-21 to 69-30; independents, from 52-44 to 45-50; and young voters below the age of 30, from 66-32 to 60-37.
In a setback to conservatives, the Nov. 6 exit polls gave strong support to liberalized immigration reform, which is likely to become a top priority for the Obama administration, with 65 percent of respondents agreeing that illegal immigrants should be "offered a chance to apply for legal status," while only 28 percent of those surveyed opposed such reform. Since the election, a number of conservative pundits, including Sean Hannity of Fox News and Charles Krauthammer, a Washington Post columnist, have called on the Republican Party to reevaluate its opposition to comprehensive immigration reform.
Voters gave a more modest boost to the administration's call to raise taxes on those making over $250,000, with a 47 percent plurality backing the proposal, another 13 percent supporting raising everyone's taxes, and 35 percent opposed to any tax hike.
On a more sobering note for Democrats, a slight majority (51 percent) of voters agreed with the statement "Government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals" compared to 43 percent saying "Government should do more to solve problems." This despite the fact that, as The New York Times reported in a Feb. 11, 2012 story, "Even Critics of Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It":
The government safety net was created to keep Americans from abject poverty, but the poorest households no longer receive a majority of government benefits. A secondary mission has gradually become primary: maintaining the middle class from childhood through retirement. The share of benefits flowing to the least affluent households, the bottom fifth, has declined from 54 percent in 1979 to 36 percent in 2007.
The story points out that many people
say they want to reduce the role of government in their own lives. They are frustrated that they need help, feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it. They say they want less help for themselves; less help in caring for relatives; less assistance when they reach old age.
In many respects, the growing liberalization of America on social issues has made the culture war an attractive battleground for Democrats - perhaps dangerously attractive. At the moment, in almost every region of the country except the South, the liberal stance is gaining adherents.
Social, cultural and moral issues have become favorable terrain for the Democratic Party, in the way that they once were for the Republicans, but there are economic trends that do not bode so well for core Democratic constituencies, given their disproportionately low income and high-unemployment rates. The issue of mounting salience - unaddressed so far by Democrats and Republicans - is the hollowing out of the job market.
A growing body of evidence demonstrates that jobs that provide mid-range incomes are disappearing, but just as important, the kinds of jobs that have long served as stepping-stones up the ladder of opportunity are disappearing too. One recent contribution to this literature, "Jobless Recoveries and the Disappearance of Routine Occupations" by Henry Siu, an economist at the University of British Columbia, and Nir Jaimovich, an economist at Duke, reports that there is job growth at the top and bottom of the payscale, but declining employment throughout the mid-pay range. The technical term is job polarization:
The fact that polarization is occurring should not surprise anyone who understands the influence of robotics and automation on machinists and machine operators in manufacturing. Indeed, the influence of robotics is increasingly being felt on routine occupations in transportation and warehousing. Of equal importance is the disappearance of routine employment in "white-collar" occupations - think bank tellers being replaced by ATMs, or secretarial work being replaced by personal computers and Siri, Apple's iPhone-integrated "intelligent personal assistant."
In the authors' view, past trends suggest a worsening future:
Thus, all of the per capita employment growth of the past 30 years has either been in 'non-routine' occupations located at the high-end of the wage distribution, such as software engineers and economists, or in low-paying jobs, such as service occupations like restaurant waiters and janitors. For this last set of occupations, this has been especially true in the past decade.
Siu and Jaimovich find that the decline in routine middle-income jobs that lend themselves to mechanization and automation occurs during recessions, and, most importantly, does not reverse itself in periods of subsequent recovery. This chart, in which the pink areas represent economic recessions, demonstrates how, starting during the recession of 1991, recoveries do not lead to revived job markets:
The conclusions reached by Siu and Jaimovich are pessimistic:
Automation and the adoption of computing technology are leading to the decline of middle-wage jobs of many stripes, both blue-collar jobs in production and maintenance occupations and white-collar jobs in office and administrative support. It is affecting both male- and female-dominated professions and it is happening broadly across industries -manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, financial services, and even public administration.
The authors offer scant hope for the future.
The pace of job polarization was greatly accelerated in this last recession, and the pace of automation and progress in robotics and computing technology is not slowing down either. If the past 30 years is any guide, we should expect future recessions to continue to spur job polarization. Jobless recoveries may be the new norm.
Should it continue, lack of economic opportunity is likely to undermine the workings of American democratic capitalism: the willingness of the have-nots and have-lesses to tolerate high levels of inequality in the belief that everyone has a shot at making it into the middle class.
The forces driving the evisceration of middle-income jobs - global production and automation - threaten the newly acquired rights of recently enfranchised populations. The "perennial gale of creative destruction" may be so powerful and inexorable that the political system cannot provide a remedy. Even so, if the Democrats fail to take on the issue, they will leave their party open to challenge as discontent over employment stagnation mounts.
An alternative strategy would be for Democrats to unilaterally declare victory in the culture war - allowing Republicans to waste time on futile rear guard actions - and to shift the political agenda to the jobs crisis. The question is: Does the new and enlarged Democratic coalition have the capacity to re-engineer capitalism to produce sustained economic growth while working toward social justice?
 An earlier version of this column gave the correct figures for the percentage of whites, Hispanics and African-Americans who are married, but by reversing the terms lower and higher and single and married made it sound like the numbers referred to the percentage of singles in those groups. 
Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

HEADLINE: The Second Term Anti-Role Model: Bush

BYLINE: ALBERT R. HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: George W. Bush won re-election too, despite being a weakened president. What lessons should Barack Obama take from his still-unpopular predecessor? 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush continues to pay for his second term.
 The exit polls in last week's U.S. presidential election found that voters, by 53 to 38 percent, thought Mr. Bush was more responsible for the current economic difficulties than President Barack Obama.
 Mr. Bush was a pariah on the campaign trail this year. He didn't appear at the Republican's convention in Tampa, Florida and wasn't even mentioned there in speeches by the nominee, Mitt Romney, the vice presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, or the keynote speaker, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. About the only convention attention Mr. Bush received was from the Democrats, when his predecessor, Bill Clinton, offered mild praise for his support for AIDS funding in Africa.
 In my latest column, I point out the many parallels between the ways Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama won their second terms, and I ask: "Can Obama Avoid Bush's 2nd-Term Errors?" The long-lasting impact of those errors were manifest in this campaign.
 Mr. Romney went out of his way to stress how different he is from George W. Bush, although their policies on tax cuts and deregulation seemed almost identical.
 The former Republican president's problems date back to the first year after his 2004 re-election. Miscalculating, the White House decided to focus on an overhaul of Social Security, without gathering any Democratic support. The proposal went
nowhere and the political damage was considerable.
 He then rushed back to Washington to sign legislation allowing the federal government to prevent a Florida man from removing the feeding tubes of his wife, who was in a persistent vegetative state. Ultimately, that too was thwarted and an autopsy showed she was severely brain damaged.
 Finally, when hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Mr. Bush was AWOL.
 Mr. Bush might take some solace from President Harry Truman, who left office in 1953 even more unpopular than Mr. Bush is. Today, Mr. Truman is considered one of the great presidents. Then again, there's the Republican Herbert Hoover who left office in 1933. More than three decades later, Democrats are still successfully running against his polices.

HEADLINE: Japan Likely To Approve Trade Pact

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In a possible gambit to reverse his governing party's flagging fortunes, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda appears likely to declare Japan's intent to join an ambitious pan-Pacific free trade agreement, then call a snap election in which the party would campaign on that move. 
Major newspapers said on Saturday that support was building in the Noda administration to announce Japan's entry into the proposed American-led regional agreement sometime in the next two months. The reports said that move would be immediately followed by a decision to dissolve Parliament for national elections that would take place a month later.
Japan has long wavered on entry into the pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is opposed by the nation's heavily protected farmers but supported by consumers and industry groups. Because the reports about the government's intentions appeared in most major newspapers, it suggested Mr. Noda's Democratic Party had made a concerted effort to begin signaling a change in strategy.
The state minister for national policy, Seiji Maehara, has also said joining the agreement would become ''a public promise by the Democratic Party that should be a main issue in elections.''
Signing onto the pact is likely to please the United States, which has urged Japan for the last two years to join the group as a way to push the global economy out of its prolonged slump. News reports suggested that the move would also be a way for the government to lash itself even closer to the United States at a time when Japan is increasingly jittery about China's ambitions in the region. The reports described the likely decision to join the pact as a domestic political gamble by the prime minister to prevent his party from a humiliating loss in elections, which must be held before September.
The Democrats have been searching for a way to regain public support after widespread criticism that they mishandled Japan's response to the Fukushima nuclear accident. Mr. Noda's approval ratings have dropped into the teens in recent polls.
When pressed by the opposition on his earlier promises to hold elections ''soon,'' Mr. Noda has said only that he and other party leaders would decide the timing when they were ready.
If he takes a clear stand on the trade pact, Mr. Noda may be aiming to regain support among the Democrats' base of urban white-collar voters and union members. They are expected to welcome the lower prices and increased exports that more open markets are likely to bring.
But such a move would also alienate farmers, one of Japan's most powerful bloc of voters. On Friday, about a half-dozen Democrats said they might defect from the party if Mr. Noda were to back the trade deal.
Joining the pact would also put the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, who currently lead in polls, in an uncomfortable political position. The Liberal Democrats have avoided taking a clear stand on the agreement because they have tried to keep the support of farmers and big business, traditionally the party's two biggest supporters. Mr. Noda may be hoping to hurt the opposition by forcing it to pick one side, news reports said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mr. Hamilton's Growth Strategy

BYLINE: By THOMAS K. McCRAW. 
Thomas K. McCraw was a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School and the author, most recently, of ''The Founders and Finance: How Hamilton, Gallatin, and Other Immigrants Forged a New Economy.'' Mr. McCraw died on Nov. 3.

 BODY:
Boston
THE staggering deficit. The possibility of impending tax hikes and significant budget cuts by the end of the year. Has the United States ever faced such a daunting financial crisis?
Yes -- though not, as many might guess, during the Great Depression. Rather, it was shortly after the nation's birth. It's an experience worth examining, because the way the new country put its house in order under Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton holds several lessons for today.
The Revolutionary War left America immersed in debt. Ratification of the Constitution in 1788 finally gave the federal government the authority to tax, but almost all federal tax revenues came from duties on imported goods. 
And yet Hamilton, who took office in 1789, deliberately avoided prolonged fights over tax policy, which he knew he couldn't win. Indeed, his thinking perfectly describes the political situation today: ''To extinguish a Debt which exists and to avoid contracting more are ideas almost always favored by public feeling and opinion, but to pay Taxes for the one or the other purpose, which are the only way of avoiding the evil, is always more or less unpopular.'' Could there be a better description of today's partisan intransigence toward adding a single tax dollar to federal revenues?
Instead, he essentially bet that the country's prosperity would be strong enough to grow it out of the crisis, provided he could create a climate of predictability and promote the release of pent-up economic energy.
It was a daunting task. The face value of federal and state debts was about $74 million, including $12 million owed to Dutch banks. Federal income for 1790 amounted to just $1.6 million -- a debt-to-income ratio of 46 to 1. (Today that same ratio is about 6.5 to 1.)
Hamilton first paid off the foreign debt by rolling it over through new loans from abroad. Determined to establish the nation's creditworthiness and avoid default, he then consolidated the remaining debts at their par, or face, value, which was higher than their market value -- a move opposed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who said it would reward speculators.
Meanwhile, he temporarily ignored Jefferson and Madison's idea of repaying the principal of the domestic debt. Instead, he persuaded Congress to authorize new bonds to replace existing obligations, while reducing the interest rate to 4 percent from 6 percent. He then announced that all interest would be paid in gold, and that receipts from import duties would be earmarked for these payments -- reasoning that bondholders would rather get 4 percent in gold than 6 percent of nothing.
Hamilton then established the Bank of the United States as a private, profit-making institution. Shares in the bank soon rose, and it would eventually have branches in all major cities -- at a time when only three small banks existed in the entire country, and when Jefferson and other founders opposed the very existence of banks. The bank, together with funding of the debt, vastly increased liquidity in the country, much as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has tried to do today.
Hamilton was not, as some have claimed, a proto-Keynesian, but he thought like a modern macroeconomic planner. Some 150 years before the word macroeconomics was coined, he wrote that ''in the affairs of a Country, to increase the total amount of industry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part of it.''
He was arguing not only in favor of a growth strategy -- a rising tide to lift all boats -- but also against the sectional and class disputes that were dividing the country. He was determined to promote growth by whatever means possible, and to rely on a surge of consumer confidence and business investment to increase federal revenues.
And that is what he did. By 1794, four years after his plan went into effect, the federal debt had increased a bit, but revenues had risen more than threefold. The debt-to-income ratio had shrunk to 15 to 1 from 46 to 1; by 1800, it was 8 to 1.
Hamilton's shot of confidence led to rapid growth. Whereas only 32 for-profit corporations had been chartered from the time of the first colonial settlement in 1607 through 1790, an astounding 287 were chartered from 1791 through 1800. They included insurance companies and firms that maintained turnpikes and bridges -- an infrastructure for current and future growth.
The lesson is not only what Hamilton did, but also what he did not do. In a fiscal dilemma similar to ours but far worse, and with many fewer tools at the government's disposal, he never considered austerity or big tax hikes or cuts as a solution. Only after the country was moving toward sustained prosperity did he increase taxes, including a controversial levy on whiskey.
What does Hamilton's strategy mean to us today? For one thing, it recommends against obsessing over taxes, a ''fiscal cliff'' and a disastrous austerity program. Instead, the answer is to increase the size of the economic pie.
Does tax policy affect growth? Of course. But what's the point in continuing an endless dialogue over it when other tools lie at hand?
In itself, Hamilton's strategy would markedly increase federal income. And that is the real lesson, not only of the 1790s, but also of more recent decades: the 1940s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. In some of these periods, taxes were raised, in others they were cut, and in most they were both raised and cut. But the pie expanded in all of them. Federal revenues expanded along with it, and the national debt never became the problem it was in 1790 -- and is today.

HEADLINE: As Shortfall Looms, Bloomberg Plans Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
With his plan to sell 2,000 new yellow-taxi medallions still in doubt, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed slashing money for libraries and after-school programs and increasing fees on school lunches and parking meters to compensate for more than $600 million in lost medallion revenue. 
Mr. Bloomberg's budget proposal does not reflect additional costs related to Hurricane Sandy, disaster relief or the storm's effect on the local economy. Yet the storm will no doubt loom large when the mayor releases his budget plan in January or February for the 2014 fiscal year.
Instead, the new proposal -- which, in an unusual move, was posted to the city's Web site late Friday night but not announced until Sunday -- represents a contingency plan to cope with a budget shortfall that must be addressed before the end of the fiscal year, on June 30.
''New York has fared better than other cities through fiscal uncertainty because of our responsible budgeting, and these measures will help to maintain critical services, including all hurricane relief, while keeping the city's fiscal house in order,'' said Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg.
Among other proposals, the Bloomberg administration plans to increase school-lunch fees to $2.50 from $1.50, bringing in $4.4 million. The administration plans to establish new parking meter areas in Lower Manhattan, while installing 428 new multi-space parking meters, to gain an extra $2.2 million.
But libraries across the city are slated to lose $8.3 million.
Budget analysts had long warned that the city's $68.5 billion budget rested on several wild cards and assumptions, one of which was the $635 million projected to come from the medallion sales in the current fiscal year. In August, a judge ruled that the plan to sell the medallions violated the state Constitution because the policy was the province of the City Council, not the State Legislature. The administration is appealing the ruling.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Republicans Search for Answers After Their Dismal Election Day

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Many Republicans believe that their party is in need of soul-searching after Tuesday's election. That might go double in Connecticut.
After Tuesday's results, the party finds itself yet again shut out of the state's two Senate seats and five House seats. Democrats control all the statewide offices and both houses of the General Assembly. Republicans have seen two rare races for open Senate seats come and go in the past two elections, with the former wrestling executive Linda E. McMahon losing each time by 12 percentage points.
Figures in both parties agree on the basic problem: the hard-right, Fox News Republican brand has limited appeal in a socially moderate-to-liberal Northern state. 
''To appeal to the national model here in Connecticut was, and is, a disaster, and it showed on election night,'' said Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former governor and senator, who in 1982 became the last Republican from Connecticut to be elected to the Senate but later left the party.
Still, the limitations of the national Republican brand in the Northeast do not tell the whole story.
After all, New Jersey has a Republican governor, Chris Christie, viewed as a leading 2016 presidential contender. In New York, it is still not clear if Republicans will maintain control of the State Senate or if Democrats will gain the slimmest of majorities, and Republicans hold six of New York's 27 House seats.
One indication of the dark mood was the acrid exchange reported by The Hartford Courant in the aftermath of Ms. McMahon's defeat between former Representative Christopher Shays, whom Ms. McMahon trounced in the Republican primary, and Ms. McMahon's campaign manager, Corry Bliss.
Mr. Shays, who had described Ms. McMahon as ''clueless'' and worse in his unsuccessful race, indicated that Ms. McMahon tried to buy the election and that her operatives were more interested in a fat paycheck than being part of a campaign that could win.
''She was seriously rebuked, but in the process she helped bring down the rest of the ticket,'' said Mr. Shays, who had been Connecticut's only Republican in Congress until he was defeated in 2008.
According to The Courant, Mr. Bliss responded that Mr. Shays was ''a classless, bitter sore loser who should do the people of Connecticut a favor and keep his mouth shut.'' He added: ''However, I would like to offer a portion of my salary to be used to pay for the psychiatric care that Congressman Shays desperately needs.''
But the state party's problems go beyond Ms. McMahon. Its dominant figure over the past two decades has been John G. Rowland, who was elected three times as governor but resigned in 2004 and went to prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges. And perhaps its two best-known former congressmen, Mr. Shays and Rob Simmons, were buried under Ms. McMahon's money when they tried to revive their careers in Senate races.
Even moderate Republicans have had a hard time breaking through. Republicans felt their best shot at a House seat was the open one in the Fifth District, considered the most demographically attractive one to Republicans. The seat was vacated by Representative Christopher S. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon on Tuesday. The Republican candidate, Andrew Roraback, was a well-regarded, well-known moderate with 17 years of experience in the Connecticut General Assembly. He ran against Elizabeth Esty, a surprise winner in the Democratic contest who had served just one term in the General Assembly.
Mr. Roraback fell just short but said Friday that it was tough bucking the national tide in a presidential year. He sounded like a man planning for a rematch and said the Republicans had the right economic message, especially as the Connecticut economy continued to sputter -- they just needed to decouple it from the social views of the party nationally.
''We need a bigger tent,'' Mr. Roraback said. ''And we need to do a better job of communicating that the Republican Party will open the doors for greater opportunity for economic security for everyone.''
Similarly, the state Republican chairman, Jerry Labriola, said, ''Republicans in Connecticut are the party of fiscal responsibility, not the party of bombastic social extremism.'' He also said the Democrats won, in part, because people think they are the party that provides ''free stuff.''
A big winner who was not on the ballot was Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Republicans in state legislative races ran in opposition to his fiscal policies but failed to gain a seat in either house.
Still, Mr. Malloy's spokesman, Roy Occhiogrosso, said that though Republicans were down, they certainly were not out, with attention already turning to Mr. Malloy's re-election campaign. More Connecticut voters are registered as independents (41 percent) than as Democrats (36 percent) or Republicans (20 percent).
''There's no gloating, no sense that we've solved the puzzle and now we're in charge forever,'' Mr. Occhiogrosso said. ''It doesn't work that way. We know 2014 is going to be a really tough race.''

DEAR DIARY:
I had read the news stories, but I had no idea how bad the new map application was on the iPhone until I tried to use it.
From a link in an e-mail I wanted to find ''333 Park Avenue South.'' In Manhattan, where I live.
It found that address for me -- in Manchester, England. 
Once I added ''New York, NY'' to the address, it brought up the right place. But it was labeled: Appalachian State University.
That's in the mountains of North Carolina. (It happens to be the alma mater of one of my sisters-in-law.)
It looks like Apple has more work -- and more apologizing -- to do. A lot more.
Peter Archey
Dear Diary:
Presidential elections always get me riled up, and eight years ago I was really energized. I wanted to participate in some way, so I volunteered to work at the polls. (Plus, I was unemployed and it paid $200 for the day.)
I was assigned to work at my own polling center in the West Village. All the voters who came to my table seemed excited to vote. A mother and her adult daughter, who arrived together, were no exception. Each signed the roll book, one under the other. The mother then told me that her husband, whose name was listed just below her own, could be removed from the rolls: he had died just a week earlier.
Stunned, I expressed how sorry I was.
''Oh, don't be'' she instructed. ''He already voted absentee.''
Beth Goldoff
Dear Diary:
While I was walking down Broadway a few days before Hurricane Sandy, a lady walking toward me stopped me and said, ''Look up before you miss the rainbow!''
Confused that a stranger was talking to me, I looked up and saw a beautiful upside-down rainbow. I am thankful to this woman for reminding me to stop and see the rainbows, and wondering how many rainbows go unseen each day.
Emily Rosen-King
Dear Diary:
While countless New Yorkers were suffering injury, losing their homes and, in some cases, their lives, other New Yorkers were completely cut off from this reality. The storm broke all connections to the outside world, and we were left with no news or communication.
Our familiar city transformed into a foreign landscape that was deathly quiet, so dark that it felt haunted but eerily beautiful and surprising.
Just beyond walking distance, visible from our roof, the Midtown lights continued shining, reminding us of how isolated we were.
Elan Bogarin and Troy Herion
Dear Diary:
When I signed in at an exhibitor's booth at State Senator Liz Krueger's annual expo for older residents, the young woman at the desk noticed my year of birth and asked, ''Were you in World War II?''
I answered: ''Yes. During World War II, I was very proud to wear a U.S. Army uniform for more than three years.'' I fully expected the usual response, ''Thank you for your service.''
Instead, I got ''It must have needed a good dry cleaning.''
Sic transit gloria mundi.

HEADLINE: Child's Education, but Parents' Crushing Loans

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
When Michele Fitzgerald and her daughter, Jenni, go out for dinner, Jenni pays. When they get haircuts, Jenni pays. When they buy groceries, Jenni pays.
It has been six years since Ms. Fitzgerald -- broke, unemployed and in default on the $18,000 in loans she took out for Jenni's college education -- became a boomerang mom, moving into her daughter's townhouse apartment in Hingham, Mass.
Jenni pays the rent.
For Jenni, 35, the student loans and the education they bought have worked out: she has a good job in public relations and is paying down the loans in her name. But for her mother, 60, the parental debt has been disastrous. 
''It's not easy,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said. ''Jenni feels the guilt and I feel the burden.''
There are record numbers of student borrowers in financial distress, according to federal data. But millions of parents who have taken out loans to pay for their children's college education make up a less visible generation in debt. For the most part, these parents did well enough through midlife to take on sizable loans, but some have since fallen on tough times because of the recession, health problems, job loss or lives that took a sudden hard turn.
And unlike the angry students who have recently taken to the streets to protest their indebtedness, most of these parents are too ashamed to draw attention to themselves.
''You don't want your children, much less your neighbors and friends, knowing that even though you're living in a nice house, and you've been able to hold onto your job, your retirement money's gone, you can't pay your debts,'' said a woman in Connecticut who took out $57,000 in federal loans. Between tough times at work and a divorce, she is now teetering on default.
In the first three months of this year, the number of borrowers of student loans age 60 and older was 2.2 million, a figure that has tripled since 2005. That makes them the fastest-growing age group for college debt. All told, those borrowers owed $43 billion, up from $8 billion seven years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Almost 10 percent of the borrowers over 60 were at least 90 days delinquent on their payments during the first quarter of 2012, compared with 6 percent in 2005. And more and more of those with unpaid federal student debt are losing a portion of their Social Security benefits to the government -- nearly 119,000 through September, compared with 60,000 for all of 2007 and 23,996 in 2001, according to the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service.
The federal government does not track how many of these older borrowers were taking out loans for their own education rather than for that of their children. But financial analysts say that loans for children are the likely source of almost all the debt. Even adjusted for inflation, so-called Parent PLUS loans -- one piece of the pie for parents of all ages -- have more than doubled to $10.4 billion since 2000. Colleges often encourage parents to get Parent PLUS loans, to make it possible for their children to enroll. But many borrow more than they can afford to pay back -- and discover, too late, that the flexibility of income-based repayment is available only to student borrowers.
Many families with good credit turn to private student loans, with parents co-signing for their children. But those private loans also offer little flexibility in repayment.
The consequences of such debt can be dire because borrowers over 60 have less time -- and fewer opportunities -- than younger borrowers to get their financial lives back on track. Some, like Ms. Fitzgerald, are forced to move in with their children. Others face an unexpectedly pinched retirement. Still others have gone into bankruptcy, after using all their assets to try to pay the student debt, which is difficult to discharge under any circumstances.
The anguish over college debt has put a severe strain on many family relationships. Parents and students alike say parental debt can be the uncomfortable, unmentionable elephant in the room. Many parents feel they have not fulfilled a basic obligation, while others quietly resent that their children's education has landed the family in such difficult territory.
Soon after borrowing the money for Jenni's education, Ms. Fitzgerald divorced and lost her corporate job. She worked part-time jobs and subsisted on food stamps and public assistance.
''I don't really feel guilt, but I do know that this is all because of a loan taken out on my behalf,'' said Jenni, who has a different last name and agreed to be interviewed only if it would not be disclosed. ''I asked my mother to move in with me, because I couldn't stand it that she was living in a place with no heat and a basement that kept flooding.''
The unusual arrangements, and strained family dynamics, can be awkward. Like Jenni, many with student debt problems agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that they not be identified because they did not want to expose their financial troubles.
''It makes you feel like a failure as a parent, to be unable to help your children and to have all your hard work end in a pile of debt,'' said one New Jersey man, who took out a second mortgage of $280,000 to help cover his children's college costs. ''I sent my older kids to private colleges, and I was happy to do it because it's how you help them get started off. But I can't do it for the youngest, and I haven't even been able to start the conversation with him.''
Ms. Fitzgerald said she had little hope of a comfortable old age. She has no health insurance. She knows that the odds of finding a good job in her 60s, with no college degree, are slim -- and she knows that the government will take part of her Social Security, in payment of her debt, which she said had now ballooned to about $40,000 because of penalties for nonpayment. At one point, she said, the Internal Revenue Service seized a $2.43 tax refund.
Jenni has volunteered to take on her mother's debt, but Ms. Fitzgerald has refused, saying it is her legal and moral obligation, and anyway, Jenni has her own loans to pay off -- about $220 a month -- and not much discretionary income. The very suggestion that Jenni might take on her debt annoys her.
''Don't you think she is doing enough for me now by supporting me a hundred percent, financially, by my living with her and her extending her resources?'' Ms. Fitzgerald asked. ''The whole idea was for her to get a college education so she can succeed in life; it is hard enough just to do that without being burdened with her mother's welfare, like I was her child.''
Jenni occasionally jumped in with explanations or clarifications, as she and her mother sat in the living room discussing their situation. When Ms. Fitzgerald talked of being depressed last year, so overwhelmed by the cartons of documents and dunning letters that she threw them all out, Jenni said gently, in an almost maternal tone, ''But you're doing much better now.''
Many young people live with deep guilt that their education has pushed their parents into debt, and perhaps ruined their credit rating. Even those who do not know exactly how much money their parents have, or how much they owe, worry about how their debt will affect their parents' lives.
One 27-year-old man from East Texas, who earned a bachelor's degree in California, is now nearing graduation with another bachelor's degree, in Russian literature, from Columbia University. He said he did not know how much debt he and his mother had accumulated in the course of his educational wanderings, sounding almost paralyzed by the prospect of talking to her about it.
''I should know how much I owe, and it's sad that I don't,'' he said. ''I feel like I'm standing on the train track and I can hear the rumble of the train coming, and I don't know how hard the train will slam into me.''
In one extreme case, student debt, and the constant creditor calls, were mentioned in a suicide note by the stepfather of a young law school graduate. The guilt has been crushing for the graduate.
Teresa Tosh, 56, a mother of five who works for the county government in Tulsa, Okla., had co-signed large graduate and law school loans for one of her sons, Jacob, who has a different last name. In total, he owes more than $200,000 on his federal loans, in addition to more than $100,000 on the private student loans his mother co-signed.
But like many recent law graduates, Jacob had trouble finding a job, and when he finally found one, an hour from home, the salary was nowhere near enough to cover loan payments. Creditor calls to both Jacob and to his mother became more and more frequent.
Jacob talked to the collectors when they called, and tried to work out payments as best he could. But shortly after one call ended, he and his mother said, the phone would ring again: another collection agent, in another part of the country. Ms. Tosh's husband, George, a Vietnam veteran who worked from home, concluded that Jacob was lying about trying to work things out, deceiving Ms. Tosh, ruining her credit and leaving her holding the bag.
The household tension grew intense, and in July 2010, Mr. Tosh shot himself, leaving a note saying that he could no longer stand the incessant calls from Sallie Mae, one of the lenders.
''Jake has destroyed us. You can't tell me that sally mae is getting paid when they keep calling all day, every day,'' he said in a note to his wife. ''I can't even answer the phone in my own home no more. I can't live like this no more.''
Ms. Tosh said she was ''not nave enough to think the Sallie Mae calls were the only reason'' that her husband killed himself. ''But they were adding a lot of stress,'' she said. ''They'd never stop calling.''
A few months after the suicide, Jacob moved to Dallas and got a document-review job. The pay is not enough to meet his loan payments -- or even full interest -- but his creditors agreed to let him make partial-interest-only payments for two years. While his balance continues to grow, that arrangement protected his mother from payment demands for two years.
''It's made my life so much more stressful and guilt-filled because I know that it affects her,'' Jacob said. ''I barely have enough money to pay the bills, but if I miss by a day, they call her.''
Jacob pays about $1,200 a month toward the debt, more than he pays for rent. He and his mother are carefully rebuilding their relationship, after a period of great tension. Ms. Tosh traveled to Dallas for his birthday.
''She's been really good about it,'' Jacob said. ''It's always there, but she doesn't bring it up.''

HEADLINE: The Foreign Policy Agenda

 BODY:
National security didn't play heavily in the presidential election. But President Obama's legacy, and the country's future, will be shaped as much by the foreign policy and defense decisions he makes over the next four years as by those on the domestic side.
One of Mr. Obama's singular contributions has been his vision of a world without nuclear weapons. It is a lofty goal that won't be achieved in his second term, or maybe for years after that. But it offers a framework for reducing America's stockpile and for arguing credibly that other countries should follow suit. 
In 2010, Mr. Obama won Senate ratification of a treaty with Russia that makes modest cuts in deployed long-range nuclear weapons. It is time to pursue further reductions in those deployed systems, and to seek cuts in warheads held in reserve and in short-range nuclear weapons, where Moscow has a big advantage. Nuclear arms are one area in which the ability of Washington and Moscow to work together is essential. If Mr. Obama can draw the other nuclear powers, including China, Pakistan, India and Israel, into the discussions and persuade the Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, so much the better.
The end of the campaign season might reduce the dangerous partisan posturing over Iran's nuclear program. Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency are to resume talks next month, but any diplomatic solution will at some point require direct negotiations between Washington and Tehran. Meanwhile, international sanctions, which have seriously damaged Iran's economy, need to be rigorously enforced and strengthened.
American military commanders are expected to recommend a timetable soon for withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. After a decade of American blood spilled there, President Obama should declare that the schedule will be dictated only by the security of the troops, and the withdrawal should take no more than a year.
Mr. Obama's policies have severely weakened Al Qaeda, but extremism is growing in many regions, like North Africa and Pakistan. Dealing with that challenge will likely become harder, as will the choices Mr. Obama must make. For one thing, he will have to examine whether the expanding use of drones is the right approach.
As for the Arab Spring countries, Mr. Obama has been wise to recognize that Washington cannot dictate their democratic evolutions. But he should be more engaged, offering more assistance to Islamic leaders who need to build their economies quickly while reminding them that American support will be calibrated based on their commitment to human rights and the rule of law.
He should continue to resist calls for American military intervention in Syria, but he should search for ways to keep fortifying the opposition in that civil war, especially since the factions there now seem to be unifying.
Many are pessimistic that anything can be done about an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal as long as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in office and Palestinians are divided between Fatah and Hamas. It would be a mistake for Mr. Obama to cross this challenge off his list. He needs to keep seeking openings to promote the two-state solution.
Mr. Obama is expected to use his second term to deepen engagement with Asia to protect American military interests and ensure American access to economic opportunities in that region. This could be a challenge given the coming change of leadership in Beijing.
It is an inexhaustible list. Mr. Obama put major new or controversial initiatives on hold this year while the campaign was under way. Now he has two years before another election season impedes his ability to get things done. He needs to decide on his priorities and act while he has the political space and capital to do so.

HEADLINE: Remember the M.T.A.

 BODY:
Hurricane Sandy proved once again that when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority stops, New York stalls. This will be worth remembering when, a few months from now, city and state officials are deciding how to help finance the authority in future years. 
The M.T.A. needed more support even before Hurricane Sandy hit, flooding subway tunnels and paralyzing the area's buses and commuter trains. While the agency has done a terrific job getting things up and running again, it will need more money down the line.
The current annual budget is $13.1 billion, of which $2.3 billion is needed to service a $32 billion debt. And the state comptroller's office has predicted that the debt could rise to cover the next five-year capital plan, which calls for an additional $20 billion in spending by 2019. A 2009 rescue package of $1.8 billon has helped to keep the system afloat. It included a surcharge on taxis and regular increases in transit tolls and fares. The package also included a controversial payroll tax. Any new state budget should, at the very least, maintain all of these elements -- meaning no more caving in by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature on the payroll tax that many suburban legislators despise.
Ideally, the package would also include new tolls on the free bridges coming into Manhattan, an idea that unfortunately has gone nowhere in Albany.
Most of the responsibility for keeping the M.T.A. financially sound falls on the governor, the mayor and the City Council. But Congress can help by providing more capital funding to maintain and expand the largest public transit system in the country. After Hurricane Sandy, neither Albany, City Hall, nor Washington should need any further reminder of the M.T.A.'s importance to the economic health of a vital region of the country.

HEADLINE: In Reversal of Earlier Quarters, Data Suggest Japan Is Near Recession

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy shrank at a pace of 0.9 percent in the three months through September, government data showed Monday, as sluggish imports compounded slowing demand and edged the nation's economy toward recession. 
The fall in gross domestic product came to an annualized 3.5 percent contraction. It was a reversal from Japan's robust performance earlier this year, when it outperformed most of its peers in the Group of 7 industrialized nations.
But growth has since stalled, hurt by a slump in exports amid economic woes in Europe and a damaging territorial spat with China, both major trading destinations for Japan. A strong yen has also hurt competitiveness among Japanese exporters.
At home, the pace of reconstruction after last year's destructive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster appears to have slowed, with private consumption declining at the largest rate since early 2011.
Economists expect the Japanese economy to continue to shrink in the next quarter, pitching it into recession before conditions improve.
''Although the Japanese economy will face harsh challenges for the time being, the situation is likely to bottom out by the end of the year,'' economists at the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo said in a note after the economic numbers were released.
''A rebound in economic indicators in the United States and China suggests that Japan's exports will also bottom out by the year's end, so the possibility that the economy will continue to retrench in the new year is low. However, there is a risk that if Japan's relations with China worsen and exacerbate the negative effects on trade, recovery could take longer,'' the economists said.
The numbers put renewed pressure on Japan's central bank to do more to shore up the economy. Last month, the Bank of Japan eased monetary policy for the second month in a row by expanding an asset lending program, after government officials urged the bank to take more drastic steps to keep economic recovery on track.
The bank is set to review monetary policy again next week.
A mature economy with a declining population, Japan, now the world's third-largest economy behind the United States and China, is being eclipsed by its Asian neighbors. In a report published last week on long-term economic trends, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said Japan would continue to grow at a sluggish rate, its share of the global economy falling far behind that of fast-growing China and India.

HEADLINE: 'Skyfall' Gives Bond His Best Opening Weekend

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The 50-year-old James Bond movie franchise -- a survivor of Austin Powers parodies, egregious product placement, Jason Bourne, polyester and Denise Richards in the role of a nuclear physicist -- just delivered its best opening-weekend results ever.
"Skyfall" took in an estimated $87.8 million over the weekend in North American theaters, easily enough for No. 1 and a new high for Ian Fleming's long-in-the-tooth superspy -- even when adjusting for inflation, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. ("Skyfall" did have the advantage of playing in 3,505 theaters.) 
"Skyfall," which cost Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment about $200 million to make, has taken in an additional $428 million overseas, where Sony has distribution rights. The Imax sneak-peek showings in North America chipped in $2.2 million more.
"Part of it is movie magic -- the team here knocked it out of the park -- and part of it is franchise DNA," said Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution. "From the inception of Bond until now, most men fantasize about being him and most women fantasize about dating him."
The "Skyfall" results are also a stark reminder for Hollywood, ever in search of blockbusters, that nothing beats old-fashioned storytelling and filmmaking. "Skyfall" earned stellar reviews -- on par with Steven Spielberg's Oscar-contending "Lincoln," according to RottenTomatoes.com -- by delivering a coherent plot, bringing back classic characters, embracing 007's historically playful tone and eschewing computerized effects in favor of live-action shoots.
In many ways, "Skyfall" listened to Bond fans, many of whom were upset with the 2008 "Quantum of Solace. Perhaps feeling pressure from the younger Jason Bourne spy series, "Quantum of Solace" stripped out much of the Bond quirk. Audiences gave "Skyfall" an A score in exit polls.
Starring Daniel Craig in his third outing as 007 and Javier Bardem as a throwback villain, "Skyfall" was directed by Sam Mendes from a script by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan.
"Bond has a resonance that keeps him cool, and Sam Mendes clearly paid particular attention to that," said Greg Foster, chairman and president of Imax Filmed Entertainment.
That "Skyfall" made it to screens at all is something of a Hollywood miracle. The film was delayed due to lengthy financial troubles at MGM that resulted in bankruptcy. Sony helped save the day, agreeing to co-finance and distribute the thriller for a continued stake in the series. MGM and its producing partner, EON Productions, own roughly 75 percent of "Skyfall," with Sony holding the remaining 25 percent.
The studios delivered a marketing campaign that included Mr. Craig's much-discussed stunt at the London Olympics, supposedly parachuting into the opening ceremony with Queen Elizabeth II in his arms. For Sony's marketing wizards, "Skyfall" is their 9th No. 1 release of 2012.
Can they make "Skyfall" the biggest Bond of all time in America? It will be difficult: "Thunderball" (1965) holds that rank, taking in $508.2 million in North America, after adjusting for inflation, according to Hollywood.com.
For the weekend, "Wreck-It Ralph" (Walt Disney Studios) was second, selling an estimated $33.1 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $93.7 million. Two well-reviewed dramas were third and fourth: "Flight" (Paramount Pictures) took in about $15.1 million, for a two-week total of $47.8 million, and "Argo" (Warner Brothers) grossed $6.7 million, lifting its five-week total to an estimated $87.1 million.
"Taken 2" (Fox) chugged along in fifth place, with about $4 million, for a six-week total of $131.3 million.
Also notable was "Lincoln," which arrived in only 11 theaters as a buzz-building technique -- perhaps the smallest initial release ever for one of Mr. Spielberg's films -- and took in $900,000.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hard-Nosed Approach Wins Votes in the South, but Lacks Broader Appeal

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- In Bibb County, Ala., on Tuesday, a Democrat named Walter Sansing was in a race for county commissioner against a Republican named Charles Beasley, who was on the ballot despite the inconvenience of having died several weeks earlier. Mr. Beasley won.
That is what kind of Election Day it was in the South. Elsewhere Republicans may be wailing and gnashing teeth, but in the mid- and Deep South states, they had yet another cycle of unchecked domination. 
For the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans took over the Arkansas legislature, and won the state's last United States House of Representatives seat held by a Democrat. North Carolina elected a Republican governor and took over at least three Congressional seats. The last Democrat in a statewide office in Alabama was defeated. In most Southern states, the margins of victory for Mitt Romney were even larger than the lopsided margins for John McCain four years ago.
''It was kind of weird on Wednesday for Republicans here,'' said Jason Tolbert, a conservative blogger and a columnist for The Arkansas News Bureau. His conclusion: ''In Arkansas, we're a right-of-center state in a nation that's drifting further and further to the left.''
Despite the local victories, Republicans in the South are aware that many of the post-election analyses have found the party's image problems to be in the approach and the appeals that have led to its near total victory here. Southern Republican politicians continue to cruise smoothly to victory on the votes of white, socially conservative evangelicals. While some leaders have succeeded with a more centrist platform, like Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, a large part of the Southern electorate still rewards politicians who promise to crack down hard on criminals and illegal immigrants, assume a defiant tone when speaking about the federal government and dismiss the idea of gay rights out of hand.
Nationally, this approach has been putting up diminishing returns.
In Maine, Maryland and Washington, referendums on gay marriage passed. In Alabama, voters selected Roy Moore, who said that same-sex marriage would lead to ''the ultimate destruction of our country,'' as chief justice of the State Supreme Court.
Many Southern Republicans said that the lessons of Tuesday could be overlearned, and that the message was not the problem -- it was the messengers, or at least the messaging.
''I don't think for a second Republicans ought to change what we believe and what we stand for,'' said Andy Taggart, a lawyer in Madison, Miss., and a former executive director of the state Republican Party. ''I do think we could do a more effective job of communicating that.''
Nearly everyone admits that the party will have to broaden its demographic appeal. But for state-level politics across much of the region, there is no reason to be in a hurry. The racial and partisan divide is nearly absolute in the Deep South, with a Democratic Party that is almost entirely black and a Republican Party that is almost entirely white. That electoral math favors the Republicans -- for now.
Hispanics are moving in ever greater number to the region, having already put Florida in play and given some long-term optimism to Democrats in Texas, Georgia and even South Carolina. And in any case, politics does not take place in a vacuum. Strict laws aimed at illegal immigrants in Alabama and Georgia -- and more crucially, the often hard-nosed talk that surrounded them -- may remain widely popular in those states, but some say they are hurting the Republican brand nationwide.
''You may consolidate support in a very limited region of the country,'' said Fernand Amandi, managing partner of Bendixen & Amandi International, a public opinion research firm that specializes in the views of Hispanics. ''But the century and the times and the demography are quickly passing the Republicans by.''
Some former Southern governors, like Haley Barbour of Mississippi, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Jeb Bush of Florida, have encouraged a softer stance on immigration, arguing that key planks in the Republican platform could be attractive to Hispanic voters. But as Gov. Rick Perry of Texas learned in the Republican primary, much of the party's faithful want not only tough laws on immigration but tough talk as well.
Any incentive for Southern Republicans to change is minimized by the fact that the current approach is working so well. The success of Democrats and liberal initiatives at the national level provides appetizing political fodder to Southern Republicans. The more national Democrats who back same-sex marriage, the harder it will be for Southern Democrats to win. But national political victories have local policy consequences.
''If the Republicans don't adapt and the Democrats become the dominant party, the government is going to start imposing policies on the Southern states,'' said David A. Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
Changing direction, even simply changing tone, is particularly difficult for a party that identifies itself as one of moral values, not of mere policy ideas. In Tennessee, which has among the highest percentages of evangelical voters in the country, the perception that a candidate shared a voter's values was the key factor in who got that resident's vote, said Ken Blake the director of the Office of Communication Research at Middle Tennessee State University.
''The national party has to change fast, and so what happens as the national party begins backpedaling?'' he asked. ''How are they going to keep that local coalition if nationally they're something else?''
This is exactly what troubles some of the South's staunch social conservatives, who wonder whether the party in the coming years will feel compelled to put politics over principles.
The Rev. Brady Cooper, the pastor of New Vision Baptist Church in Murfreesboro, Tenn., said he had heard acquaintances in the days since the election speculating that social issues cost the Republicans the White House. To a degree, they were probably right, Mr. Cooper said. But he said that he could not abandon his values to win elections, and was increasingly moving away from politics.
''I'm kind of disillusioned more and more with the political process,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''One of their top priorities is being re-elected, and that kind of drives a lot of decisions that they make. And it means obviously going with the trends of the culture as opposed to the truth.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Will Seek $30 Billion in Aid For Storm Relief

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; Reporting was contributed by Charles V. Bagli, Diane Cardwell, Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Christopher Maag.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to ask the federal government for at least $30 billion in disaster aid to help New York City and other affected areas of the state recover from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, according to top administration officials.
In making the case for federal aid, the governor's advisers provided a staggering inventory of need as the city and state continued to rebuild in the storm's deadly wake: $3.5 billion to repair the region's bridges, tunnels and subway and commuter rail lines; $1.65 billion to rebuild homes and apartment buildings; $1 billion to reimburse local governments for overtime costs of police, fire and other emergency personnel; and several billion dollars in federal loans and grants to affected businesses. 
In all, Hurricane Sandy caused more than $50 billion in damage in the New York region, according to Cuomo administration officials, making it the country's costliest storm other than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast region in 2005. That hurricane caused about $145 billion in damages, with the federal government providing about $110 billion in disaster aid, according to Cuomo officials.
In outlining the plan, Cuomo officials provided an assessment of the economic toll of the storm in New York. Businesses throughout the city and state lost $13 billion after being forced to close for days either because of damage to their property or because employees could not get to their jobs with travel restrictions widely in place, according to Cuomo aides.
The governor's move comes as President Obama is scheduled to appear on Thursday in the New York City area, where he is expected to view the recovery efforts and announce a rebuilding program for the region. On Sunday, the Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, toured Staten Island to view the response there.
It is clear that the effects of the storm are still being acutely felt. More than 125,000 customers were still without power on Sunday, including about 110,000 customers served by the Long Island Power Authority. Many gas stations remained closed, but the city's introduction of odd-even gas rationing seemed to have shortened lines.
The storm-related death toll in New York City officially rose to 43, as a man who fell during the storm in his home in Queens succumbed to his injuries on Saturday. And transportation officials made more progress on shuttered lines and crossings. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel will reopen only for bus traffic on Monday, and more service will be restored on the Long Island Rail Road and PATH.
Mr. Cuomo's request could be seen as a challenge to Mr. Obama to make good on his pledge, delivered during a high-profile visit to New Jersey, to provide federal support for the recovery effort. But it also could be seen as a test of the governor's ability to extract billions of dollars of aid from Washington at a difficult time, with White House officials and Congressional leaders searching to find areas of government to cut to avert a Jan. 1 fiscal crisis.
It is far from certain whether Mr. Cuomo will get what he is looking for despite the president's reassurances. The amount the governor is apparently seeking would exceed the roughly $12 billion in FEMA disaster aid currently available in Washington without action from Congress, where there is likely to be strong opposition to more spending.
Mr. Cuomo's plan, which is still being drafted by his aides, rests in part on persuading the federal government to make an emergency appropriation in the coming weeks during a lame-duck session of Congress that begins on Tuesday.
New York will not be alone in seeking disaster relief from Washington. Members of Congress in both major parties from other storm-ravaged states -- including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia -- will almost certainly be seeking federal assistance for their constituents.
Mr. Cuomo intends to use the money from Washington for far-reaching improvements to the critical but decaying infrastructure of the city and the state.
For example, he is looking at a proposal to replace the region's power grid with a so-called smart grid that would improve the ability of utility companies to pinpoint areas with power failures and respond to them. That proposal could cost at least $30 billion over 10 years, according to senior aides to the governor.
In addition, Mr. Cuomo is looking at a plan to have the federal government invest billions of dollars to modernize the fuel supply capacity of the New York City region to avoid the kind of gas shortages that have plagued New Yorkers since the storm barreled through.
The plan would include building new oil and gas pipelines from the New England states to reduce New York's dependence on fuel that arrives through ports in New Jersey, a state that was also hobbled by the storm and was thus unable to continue to fully supply the region with fuel.
Mr. Cuomo is also considering the creation of an emergency petroleum reserve for the state, much like the one the federal government has at its disposal in the event of a national crisis.
Over the weekend, gas lines appeared to ease in New York and New Jersey. On Sunday morning in Manhattan, all the pumps at a BP station at Houston and Crosby Streets were serving taxis. About five cars were waiting in line.
In Brooklyn, there was a line at a Hess station at Fourth Avenue and Union Street. About 60 cars stretched for several blocks down Union. At another Hess station at Fourth Avenue and 30th Street, there were about 30 cars in a line stretching three blocks.
In the Rockaways, a Long Island Power Authority official told a skeptical but orderly crowd of about 300 people on Sunday that the utility was already beginning to restore power along the peninsula east of Breezy Point. But for power to be switched on, each building must receive certification from a licensed electrician that the building is ready for electricity, said the official, Nick Lizanich, vice president for operations.
''As soon as we receive confirmation that your house can be restored, we will restore it within a very short period of time,'' Mr. Lizanich said.
His comment drew an immediate response from a woman in the crowd. ''Your nose is glowing,'' she said.
Tallying the Damage From a Brutal Storm: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will ask the federal government for at least $30 billion in disaster aid for areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, with a significant portion earmarked for New York City. Here are some of the more costly expenses: $3.5 billion To repair bridges, tunnels and subway and commuter rail lines. $1.65 billion To rebuild storm-damaged homes and apartments. $1 billion To reimburse local governments for overtime costs to emergency personel.

HEADLINE: To Slow Warming, Tax Carbon

BYLINE: By DIETER HELM. 
Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford, is the author of ''The Carbon Crunch: How We're Getting Climate Change Wrong -- and How to Fix It.''

 BODY:
Oxford, England
ENVIRONMENT played only a modest role in the recent American presidential election. President Obama lauded his new fuel-efficiency standards and support for renewable energy sources, while Mitt Romney faulted the president for rising gasoline prices and new restrictions on coal mining.
But while environmentalists have lamented America's slow response to climate change, the United States is actually on a much better path than Europe. It is making the transition from coal to gas, it is investing in new energy technologies, and its carbon emissions are falling faster than Europe's. 
This is not to paint too rosy a portrait. Since world leaders met in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and agreed to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of industrialized countries by about 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, virtually nothing has been done to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 1990, carbon emissions were rising at less than 2 parts per million per year. Now they are rising at nearly 3 p.p.m. per year.
How could so little have been achieved, despite all the already considerable economic costs of climate change? Europe, in particular, has put great effort into being a ''world leader'' on climate change and has spent lots of money on wind farms and rooftop solar panels. Sadly, this has had almost no global effect.
The main reason emissions have been going up is the rise of coal -- in China, in particular. Coal is now the source of 30 percent of the world's energy, up from about 25 percent in the mid-1990s. Europe's initiatives have had no effect on China's policies or the global coal burn. Indeed, the initiatives have probably made the situation worse. As the price of energy has increased using current renewables, energy-intensive industries are being driven offshore, only for their products to be imported back into the European Union.
By the standards of the Kyoto accord, Europe looks good. But those standards measure each country's production -- not consumption -- of carbon. This has created counterproductive incentives. If steel plants are closed in Britain and replaced by steel imports from China, Britain counts that as a success. Between 1990 and 2005, Britain's carbon production fell by about 15 percent -- but its carbon consumption rose by 19 percent, when imports were counted. The rest of Europe has been deindustrializing too, and this has also encouraged energy-intensive production to move overseas.
Contrast this with the United States, which declined to ratify the Kyoto agreement because China and other developing countries were not required to do much. America has only the crudest energy policy. And yet its carbon emissions have been falling sharply. Why? Because the United States is switching from coal to gas. At the same time, Europe is moving from gas, which is expensive there, to much more polluting coal -- especially in Germany, which is phasing out its nuclear plants following the Fukushima disaster in Japan.
Europe's ''answer'' to global warming is wind farms and other current renewables. But the numbers won't ever add up. It just isn't possible to reduce carbon emissions much with small-scale disaggregated wind turbines. There isn't enough land for biofuels, even if corn-based ethanol were a good idea (a questionable proposition). Current renewable-energy sources cannot bridge the gap if we are to move away from carbon-intensive energy production. So we will need new technologies while in the meantime slowing the coal juggernaut.
There are three sensible ways to do this: tax carbon consumption (including imports); accelerate the switch from coal to gas; and support and finance new technologies rather than pouring so much money into wind and biofuels.
Putting a price on carbon is fundamental. If consumers and businesses do not bear the cost of their carbon pollution, they won't do much about it. This carbon price should not discriminate between locations: global warming is global. If China does not put a price on carbon, and Europe does, then China will effectively receive a huge export subsidy.
The good news is that many new energy technologies are coming down the track: next-generation solar, geothermal and even nuclear technologies, and methods to harness the energy of gravity via the ocean's tides. There have been major breakthroughs in solar. Work is also under way to develop better energy-storing batteries, smart grids and electric cars. All of those advancements will need public support.
What is missing across Europe, the United States and China is a global agreement on a proper carbon price. More than any other measure, a tax on carbon consumption is what's needed to slow the warming of the planet.

HEADLINE: Hawks And Hypocrites

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Back in 2010, self-styled deficit hawks -- better described as deficit scolds -- took over much of our political discourse. At a time of mass unemployment and record-low borrowing costs, a time when economic theory said we needed more, not less, deficit spending, the scolds convinced most of our political class that deficits rather than jobs should be our top economic priority. And now that the election is over, they're trying to pick up where they left off.
They should be told to go away. 
It's not just the fact that the deficit scolds have been wrong about everything so far. Recent events have also demonstrated clearly what was already apparent to careful observers: the deficit-scold movement was never really about the deficit. Instead, it was about using deficit fears to shred the social safety net. And letting that happen wouldn't just be bad policy; it would be a betrayal of the Americans who just re-elected a health-reformer president and voted in some of the most progressive senators ever.
About the hypocrisy of the hawks: as I said, it has been evident for years. Consider the early-2011 award for ''fiscal responsibility'' that three of the leading deficit-scold organizations gave to none other than Paul Ryan. Then as now, Mr. Ryan's alleged plans to reduce the deficit were obvious flimflam, since he was proposing huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations while refusing to specify how these cuts would be offset. But in the eyes of the deficit scolds, his plan to dismantle Medicare and his savage cuts to Medicaid apparently qualified him as a fiscal icon.
And how did the deficit scolds react when Mitt Romney served up similar flimflam, with Mr. Ryan as his running mate? Well, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is deficit-scold central; Peterson funding lies behind much of the movement. Sure enough, David Walker, the foundation's former C.E.O. and arguably the most visible deficit scold in America, endorsed the Romney/Ryan ticket.
And then there's the matter of the ''fiscal cliff.''
Contrary to the way it's often portrayed, the looming prospect of spending cuts and tax increases isn't a fiscal crisis. It is, instead, a political crisis brought on by the G.O.P.'s attempt to take the economy hostage. And just to be clear, the danger for next year is not that the deficit will be too large but that it will be too small, and hence plunge America back into recession.
Deficit scolds are having a hard time with this issue. How can they warn us not to go over the fiscal cliff without seeming to contradict their own rhetoric about the evils of deficits?
This wouldn't be hard if they had been making a more honest case on the budget: the truth is that deficits are actually a good thing when the economy is deeply depressed, so deficit reduction should wait until the economy is stronger. As John Maynard Keynes said three-quarters of a century ago, ''The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity.'' But since the deficit scolds have in fact been demanding that we make deficits the priority even when the economy is depressed, they can't go there.
So what we get instead, for example in a white paper on the fiscal cliff from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, is a garbled set of complaints: The adjustment is too fast (why?), or it's the wrong kind of deficit reduction, for reasons not made clear. Or maybe they are made clear, after all. For even as it rails against deficits, the white paper argues against raising tax rates and even suggests cutting them.
So the deficit scolds, while posing as the nation's noble fiscal defenders, have in practice shown themselves both hypocritical and incoherent. They don't deserve to have a central role in policy discussion; they really don't even deserve a seat at the table. And they certainly don't deserve to have one of their own appointed as Treasury secretary.
I don't know how seriously to take the buzz about appointing Erskine Bowles to replace Timothy Geithner. But in case there's any reality to it, let's recall his record. Mr. Bowles, like others in the deficit-scold community, has indulged in scare tactics, warning of an imminent fiscal crisis that keeps not coming. Meanwhile, the report he co-wrote was supposed to be focused on deficit reduction -- yet, true to form, it called for lower rather than higher tax rates, and as a ''guiding principle'' no less. Appointing him, or anyone like him, would be both a bad idea and a slap in the face to the people who returned President Obama to office.
Look, we should be having a serious discussion about America's fiscal future. But a serious discussion is exactly what we haven't been having these past couple years -- because the discourse was hijacked by the wrong people, with the wrong agenda. Let's show them the door.

HEADLINE: In Debt Talks, Revived Obama Is Ready to Go Beyond Beltway

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, emboldened by his decisive re-election and lessons learned over four years in office, is looking to the renewal of budget talks with Republicans this week as a second chance to take command of the nation's policy debates and finally fulfill his promise to end gridlock in Washington, associates say.
As he prepares to meet with Congressional leaders at the White House on Friday, aides say, Mr. Obama will not simply hunker down there for weeks of closed-door negotiations as he did in mid-2011, when partisan brinkmanship over raising the nation's debt limit damaged the economy and his political standing. He will travel beyond the Beltway at times to rally public support for a deficit-cutting accord that mixes tax increases on the wealthy with spending cuts.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will meet with corporate executives at the White House as he uses the nation's fiscal problems to start rebuilding relations with business leaders. Though many of them backed Mitt Romney, scores have formed a coalition to push for a budget compromise similar to the one the president seeks. He hopes to enlist them to persuade Republicans in Congress to accept higher taxes on the assurance that he can deliver Democrats' votes for future reductions in fast-growing entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
''Every president learns lessons from their successes and failures, and President Obama is no different,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, his communications director. ''There is no question that lessons were learned in the summer of 2011 that will impact his approach to the presidency for the next four years.''
And with the election campaign over, the campaign for the Obama legacy begins: Mr. Obama will keep his grass-roots organization in place to ''have the president's back,'' as its members like to say, on the budget negotiations and other issues in the second term. Democrats concede that the network has not been a particularly effective legislative lobby to date. But they argue that when it was activated to pass payroll tax cuts and low-interest student loans, the pressure made a difference.
Ultimately, however, success or failure will depend on Mr. Obama, starting with his attempts to steer negotiations during the lame-duck Congress, which starts Tuesday, to a successful two-part conclusion.
First, that means averting the ''fiscal cliff'' created by the coincidental combination of expiring tax cuts and unemployment benefits with across-the-board cuts in military and domestic programs that are set to take effect after Jan. 1. Both parties seek agreement on alternative savings that would be less damaging to the economy than up to $700 billion in immediate tax increases and spending cuts.
Second, for the long term, success means consensus on a framework to overhaul the tax code and benefit programs in 2013 to control the mounting federal debt.
Whether Mr. Obama succeeds will reveal much about what kind of president he intends to be in his second term. Beyond the specifics of any accord, perhaps the bigger question hanging over the negotiations is whether Mr. Obama will go to his second inaugural in January with an achievement that starts to rewrite the unflattering leadership narrative that, fairly or not, came to define his first term for many people.
That story line, stoked by Republicans but shared by some Democrats, holds that Mr. Obama is too passive and deferential to Congress, a legislative naf who does little to nurture personal relationships with potential allies -- in short, not a particularly strong leader. Even as voters re-elected Mr. Obama, those who said in surveys afterward that strong leadership was the most important quality for a president overwhelmingly chose Mr. Romney.
George C. Edwards III, a leading scholar of the presidency at Texas A & M University who is currently teaching at Oxford University, dismissed such criticisms as shallow and generally wrong. Yet Mr. Edwards, whose book on Mr. Obama's presidency is titled ''Overreach,'' said, ''He didn't understand the limits of what he could do.''
''They thought they could continuously create opportunities and they would succeed, and then there would be more success and more success, and we'd build this advancing-tide theory of legislation,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''And that was very nave, very silly. Well, they've learned a lot, I think.''
''Effective leaders,'' he added, ''exploit opportunities rather than create them.''
The budget showdown is an opportunity. But like many, it holds risks as well as potential rewards.
''This election is the second chance to be what he promised in 2008, and that is to break the gridlock in Washington,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Reagan White House chief of staff, who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and later expressed disappointment. ''But it seems like this is a replay of 2009 and 2010, when he had huge majorities in the House and Senate, rather than recognizing that 'we've got to figure out ways to work together and it's not just what I want.' ''
For now, at least, Republican lawmakers say they may be open to raising the tax bill for some earners. ''We can increase revenue without increasing the tax rates on anybody in this country,'' said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and a leader of House conservatives, on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We can lower the rates, broaden the base, close the loopholes.''
The challenge for Mr. Obama is to use his postelection leverage to persuade Republicans -- or to help Speaker John A. Boehner persuade Republicans -- that a tax compromise is in their party's political interest since most Americans favor compromise and higher taxes on the wealthy to reduce annual deficits.
Some of the business leaders the president will meet with on Wednesday are members of the new Fix the Debt coalition, which has raised about $40 million to urge lawmakers and their constituents to support a plan that combines spending cuts with new revenue. That session will follow Mr. Obama's meeting with labor leaders on Tuesday.
His first trip outside Washington to engage the public will come after Thanksgiving, since Mr. Obama is scheduled to leave next weekend on a diplomatic trip to Asia. Travel plans are still sketchy, partly because his December calendar is full of the traditional holiday parties.
Democrats said the White House's strategy of focusing both inside and outside of Washington was smart. ''You want to avoid getting sucked into the Beltway inside-baseball games,'' said Joel Johnson, a former adviser in the Clinton White House and the Senate. ''You can still work toward solutions, but make sure you get out of Washington while you are doing that.''
The president must use his leverage soon, some Democrats added, because it could quickly wane as Republicans look to the 2014 midterm elections, when the opposition typically takes seats from the president's party in Congress.
In particular, Mr. Obama has to convince Republicans that he would veto an extension of the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for incomes of $250,000 and higher, said John Podesta, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who oversaw Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential transition. The top tax rate of 35 percent would increase after Dec. 31 to 39.6 percent, the rate in place during the Clinton administration, raising about $1 trillion over 10 years.
''The Republicans think he caves,'' Mr. Podesta said, ''and he has to disabuse them of that.''
What is unclear is whether Mr. Obama might agree to extend the top income-tax rates if Republicans agree to raise revenue from wealthy taxpayers by limiting their deductions instead, as Mr. Boehner suggested last week. The president did not mention rates on Friday in his first postelection remarks on the budget talks, and people in both parties interpreted that as a sign of his bargaining flexibility.

HEADLINE: Park Avenue's Well-to-Do: How They Stay That Way

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Alex Gibney doesn't do much with his initial premise in ''Park Avenue: Money, Power & the American Dream,'' but he certainly accomplishes one thing: If you were still on the fence about whether to despise the superrich, this film will almost surely make a hater out of you.
''Park Avenue,'' Monday night's installment of PBS's ''Independent Lens,'' begins by noting a particularly glaring example of wealth disparity in New York. A residential building at 740 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side, the film says, is home to the highest concentration of billionaires in the United States, while just a few miles away, Park Avenue in the South Bronx is a high-unemployment, high-poverty zone. 
Mr. Gibney, though, isn't interested in a human-interest comparison of how the residents of these two neighborhoods live, though we are given glimpses of a food handout on the poorer Park Avenue. The focus here is on the richer one and specifically on how the people of 740 Park -- like David H. Koch, a big backer of the Tea Party movement -- ensure that they will stay rich by manipulating the political process with their money.
This is no surprise, of course, but Mr. Gibney's presentation (based on Michael Gross's book ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building'') is particularly damning. He looks at how a tax break benefiting hedge-fund moguls became law and why all efforts to roll it back fail. (Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York, is a chief culprit.) And he explores how the wealth lobby has somehow claimed the populist mantle, selling upper-income tax cuts and deregulation as things that reinforce the American dream. Though if that dream is ''work hard and you will end up rich,'' it has never been less true, especially for people on that poorer Park Avenue.
''What's hard to understand about this relentless push to cut taxes for the rich is that they already have so much more than the rest of us,'' the film's narration says in a characteristically blunt line.
Parts of the film feel as if they were intended for a pre-election audience -- Paul Ryan gets a lot of attention -- and the notion that the superrich can buy the political process has been at least partly undercut by the many races in which super PAC money did not sway last week's results.
A bigger flaw is in Mr. Gibney's effort to show that wealth breeds callousness and misanthropy. Many of the nation's wealthiest people are also its most generous, but he shrugs that off in favor of a flimsy-looking study involving the board game Monopoly. (Some players were given more money than others and quickly exhibited what could be interpreted as a sense of entitlement.)
Still, there is plenty here to turn you into a Wall Street occupier. Those who attribute Mitt Romney's loss to an inability to project empathy for the less well-off get some ammunition from a former doorman at 740, who says the job was not the gravy train of big tips that you might expect.
''The cheapest person over all was David Koch,'' says the doorman, whose identity is shielded.
''You would never get a tip from Mr. Koch,'' he recalls. What about a lucrative holiday gift? ''A $50 check for Christmas,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Business Chiefs Step Gingerly Into a Thorny Budget Fight

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As Democratic and Republican leaders stake out their positions in the coming fiscal showdown in Washington, corporate executives are starting a political campaign of their own.
The chief executives taking part in two separate advertising blitzes that are set to begin on Monday and Tuesday are walking a delicate balance. They plan to press Congress to act quickly, even as they publicly steer clear of the political firefight surrounding the details of any far-reaching deal to cut the federal budget deficit.
Behind the scenes, however, the effort by business leaders could play a crucial role in shaping decisions on tax policy, including whether corporate tax rates go down even as individuals pay more.
By framing the issue as an attempt to balance the federal budget, the plan also offers some political cover to Congressional Republicans wary that voting for a tax increase could make them targets of the party's powerful fiscal conservatives. 
But a question remains over just how far the business groups will go. In the past, corporations have joined the call for fiscal responsibility, only to resist giving up specific perks and programs that benefit their businesses or offering other specific suggestions for deficit reduction.
The Campaign to Fix the Debt, a new group with a $40 million budget whose backers include Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and David M. Cote of Honeywell, will run more than a million dollars' worth of advertisements. The spots take their cue from well-known ads by the likes of Nike and Dunkin' Donuts and feature slogans like ''Just Fix It'' and ''Time to Fix the Debt.''
Mr. Immelt and Mr. Cote also feature prominently in a more traditional campaign by the Business Roundtable, which represents Fortune 500 companies and is one of Washington's most powerful lobbying groups.
The Business Roundtable's effort, set to begin on Tuesday, has a budget of close to half a million dollars, and is focused on news media in the Washington area, including outlets like Politico as well as conservative talk radio shows.
''America's C.E.O.'s have a message for Washington: don't take our country over the fiscal cliff,'' warns a Business Roundtable commercial, referring to the package of tax increases and automatic spending cuts set to go into effect in January if Congress and President Obama cannot agree on deficit reduction plan.
Experts say that combination would equal a half-trillion-dollar blow to the economy that could cause a recession in the first half of 2013 -- a threat the Business Roundtable has made the centerpiece of its campaign. ''If Congress does not act, growth will stall, jobs will be lost and our nation's credit will be harmed,'' the radio ad says.
The debut of the ads in Washington coincides with the return of Congress on Tuesday for a lame-duck session that will take up the fiscal issue.
John Engler, the Business Roundtable's president and a former Republican governor from Michigan, said that whatever solution emerges, ''the tax code changes have to be permanent and the budget cuts have to be real.''
''Even the president has said the corporate tax rate is too high and needs to come down,'' Mr. Engler said. ''We're in the position of saying everything is on the table.''
The new campaign ups the ante in the fight over fiscal policy, which is set to dominate the agenda in Washington through the end of the year, and comes during an increase in lobbying by chief executives on Capitol Hill.
''My sense is that their primary motivation is avoiding recession,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''But I think the key to whether they are serious or just posturing is the question of taxes, and if they're truly willing to support raising more revenues.''
Still, big business has plenty to gain if some elements of what the groups are pushing for were to become law.
The Fix the Debt campaign was created by Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson, who were chairmen of a presidential commission charged with developing a blueprint for fiscal change and deficit reduction in 2010, and the group backs many of their recommendations.
Both the Business Roundtable and the Fix the Debt campaign suggest they could pay for the corporate rate reduction by ''broadening the base,'' closing loopholes and eliminating many deductions. Some critics say they doubt that would bring in enough revenue to pay for reducing taxes on corporations, eventually shifting some of the burden to smaller businesses and individuals.
Advocates for low-income and older Americans have also been harsh critics of the Simpson-Bowles plan, saying it would keep tax rates on businesses and wealthy Americans at levels below the historical average, and underwrite that by sharply cutting Social Security and Medicare.
Fix the Debt is also backed by Peter G. Peterson, a longtime deficit hawk who has advocated cutting Social Security and other elements of the safety net to pay for debt reduction. Other corporate backers include Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, and Gregory Q. Brown, the chief executive of Motorola Solutions.
Maya MacGuineas, the head of the campaign, played down the suggestion that the Fix the Debt campaign had a particular agenda.
''We're not advocating specific solutions,'' she said. The executives backing the campaign, she said, want to ''put in place a debt deal. I see this as people who are focused on what they see as a real threat to their businesses and employees.''
With the start of the ad campaigns, chief executives will soon find themselves in the middle of one of Washington's toughest political battles in years.
Politicians from across the spectrum say they want to avoid the threat posed by the looming tax increases and budget reductions, but the thorniest issue is likely to be making changes in tax policy. Indeed, even as votes from last Tuesday's presidential race were still being tallied in some states, President Obama and Congressional Republicans began signaling their positions.
The president favors extending Bush-era tax cuts for all but the top 2 percent of earners. House Speaker John A. Boehner said last week that the election was not a mandate for a tax increase, and he has insisted that tax cuts be extended for everyone.
Those positions are so far apart, and so deeply entrenched, that most in Washington expect some short-term extension of the Bush-era cuts to be passed, giving Congress and the White House more time to overhaul the tax system and take on the issue of spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Plan to Become an Ex-Smoker for Good

BYLINE: JANE E. BRODY


HIGHLIGHT: There are many resources to quit smoking, including online guides, books and prescription drugs. Millions are living proof that a smoke-free life is achievable. 

 BODY:
Few smokers would claim that it's easy to quit. The addiction to nicotine is strong and repeatedly reinforced by circumstances that prompt smokers to light up.
Yet the millions who have successfully quit are proof that a smoke-free life is achievable, even by those who have been regular, even heavy, smokers for decades.
Today, 19 percent of American adults smoke, down from more than 42 percent half a century ago, when Luther Terry, the United States surgeon general, formed a committee to produce the first official report on the health effects of smoking. Ever-increasing restrictions on where people can smoke have helped to swell the ranks of former smokers.
Now, however, as we approach the American Cancer Society's 37th Great American Smokeout on Thursday, the decline in adult smoking has stalled despite the economic downturn and the soaring price of cigarettes. 
Currently, 45 million Americans are regular smokers who, if they remain smokers, can on average expect to live 10 fewer years. Half will die of a tobacco-related disease, and many others will suffer for years with smoking-caused illness. Smoking adds $96 billion to the annual cost of medical care in this country, Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month. Even as some adult smokers quit, their ranks are being swelled by the 800,000 teenagers who become regular smokers each year and by young adults who, through advertising and giveaways, are now the prime targets of the tobacco industry.
People ages 18 to 25 now have the nation's highest smoking rate: about 34 percent counted in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2010 reported smoking cigarettes in the previous month. I had to hold my breath the other day as dozens of 20-somethings streamed out of art gallery openings and lighted up. Do they not know how easy it is to get hooked on nicotine and how challenging it can be to escape this addiction?
Challenging, yes, but by no means impossible. On the Web you can download a "Guide to Quitting Smoking," with detailed descriptions of all the tools and tips to help you become an ex-smoker once and for all.
Or consult the new book by Dr. Richard Brunswick, a retired family physician in Northampton, Mass., who says he's helped hundreds of people escape the clutches of nicotine and smoking. (The printable parts of the book's provocative title are "Can't Quit? You Can Stop Smoking.")
"There is no magic pill or formula for beating back nicotine addiction," Dr. Brunswick said. "However, with a better understanding of why you smoke and the different tools you can use to control the urge to light up, you can stop being a slave to your cigarettes."
 Addiction and Withdrawal 
Nicotine beats a direct path to the brain, where it provides both relaxation and a small energy boost. But few smokers realize that the stress and lethargy they are trying to relieve are a result of nicotine withdrawal, not some underlying distress. Break the addiction, and the ill feelings are likely to dissipate.
Physical withdrawal from nicotine is short-lived. Four days without it and the worst is over, with remaining symptoms gone within a month, Dr. Brunswick said. But emotional and circumstantial tugs to smoke can last much longer.
Depending on when and why you smoke, cues can include needing a break from work, having to focus on a challenging task, drinking coffee or alcohol, being with other people who smoke or in places you associate with smoking, finishing a meal or sexual activity, and feeling depressed or upset.
To break such links, you must first identify them and then replace them with other activities, like taking a walk, chewing sugar-free gum or taking deep breaths. These can help you control cravings until the urge passes.
If you've failed at quitting before, try to identify what went wrong and do things differently this time, Dr. Brunswick suggests. Most smokers need several attempts before they can become permanent ex-smokers.
Perhaps most important is to be sure you are serious about quitting; if not, wait until you are. Motivation is half the battle. Also, should you slip and have a cigarette after days or weeks of not smoking, don't assume you've failed and give up. Just go right back to not smoking.
 Aids for Quitting 
Many if not most smokers need two kinds of assistance to become lasting ex-smokers: psychological support and medicinal aids. Only about 4 percent to 7 percent of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without help, the cancer society says.
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have free telephone-based support programs that connect would-be quitters to trained counselors. Together, you can plan a stop-smoking method that suits your smoking pattern and helps you avoid common pitfalls.
Online support groups and Nicotine Anonymous can help as well. To find a group, ask a local hospital or call the cancer society at (800) 227-2345. Consider telling relatives and friends about your intention to quit, and plan to spend time in smoke-free settings.
More than a dozen treatments can help you break the physical addiction to tobacco. Most popular is nicotine replacement therapy, sold both with and without a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration has approved five types: nicotine patches of varying strengths, gums, sprays, inhalers and lozenges that can curb withdrawal symptoms and help you gradually reduce your dependence on nicotine.
Two prescription drugs are also effective: an extended-release form of the antidepressant bupropion (Zyban or Wellbutrin), which reduces nicotine cravings, and varenicline (Chantix), which blocks nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing both the pleasurable effects of smoking and the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Combining a nicotine replacement with one of these drugs is often more effective than either approach alone.
Other suggested techniques, like hypnosis and acupuncture, have helped some people quit but lack strong proof of their effectiveness. Tobacco lozenges and pouches and nicotine lollipops and lip balms lack evidence as quitting aids, and no clinical trials have been published showing that electronic cigarettes can help people quit.
The cancer society suggests picking a "quit day"; ridding your home, car and workplace of smoking paraphernalia; choosing a stop-smoking plan, and stocking up on whatever aids you may need.
On the chosen day, keep active; drink lots of water and juices; use a nicotine replacement; change your routine if possible; and avoid alcohol, situations you associate with smoking and people who are smoking.
An earlier version of this column misstated the rate of smoking among young adults. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2010 about 34 percent of people ages 18 to 25 smoked cigarettes, not 40 percent. (That is the share of young adults who use tobacco products of any kind, according to the survey.)
An earlier version of this column stated imprecisely the rate of smoking among young adults. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2010 about 34 percent of people ages 18 to 25 smoked cigarettes in the month before the survey -- not daily. (About 16 percent of them reported smoking daily, according to the survey.)

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Sam Anderson on the Civic Magic of the OKC Thunder

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover article answers questions about his basketball obsession and the fairy tale of the Oklahoma City Thunder. 

 BODY:
 Sam Anderson, critic at large for The Times Magazine, wrote this week's cover story about the fairy-tale rise of the Oklahoma City Thunder. His previous cover stories were about "stupid" digital games and the novelist Haruki Murakami. 
 You are a basketball obsessive. What drew your eye to this particular story? 
The Thunder is a magical team. Everyone wanted to hate them after the debacle over whether the team would stay in Seattle, and many succeeded and even kept it up for a few years. But the team became so likable on so many levels (the personalities, the playing style, the organizational class, James Harden's beard) that a lot of that hate just melted away. That's not to say that many people in Seattle don't hate them still, understandably. But the players are so young, they had all of this potential and then they actually realized it - which is such a rare thing in sports. (I write this as a big fan of the Portland Trail Blazers, which five years ago were on the verge of a Thunderlike feel-good explosion, but then all of their best players' knees exploded simultaneously.)
Over the summer, I wrote a weird riff about LeBron James, which I think reminded my editors that I'm a basketball fan, and since b-ball season was coming up, they suggested that I write about the Thunder. I went to Oklahoma City just to see what was going on: if the fairy tale was pure chance, or if Sam Presti and company were actually geniuses and Kevin Durant was actually a saint, etc.
 The mayor of Oklahoma City owes you. Seriously. Did you ever see cracks in the niceness of the city? 
No, the niceness is genuinely amazing. I came to think of it as a byproduct of the state's crazy history, where you have all of these vastly different people (Spanish explorers, European immigrants, dozens of Indian tribes, most of which are not native to the area) crashing into one another over and over again over the course of many centuries, forced to work out their differences on the fly to avoid deteriorating into all-out war. It makes sense to me that that would produce a culture of unusual civility, i.e. "niceness."
It's funny that you ask about the mayor, because one of the highlights of my trip was the time I spent with him. Mayor Cornett is a local legend - plenty of locals think he'll be president one day. I got back to my hotel one evening to find him sitting on a couch in the lobby, waiting for me, as if it were his own living room. He walked me over to the Thunder's arena, where we sat talking in the stands for an hour or so (he's a season-ticket holder, like a lot of people I talked to), and then ended up in his apartment where he took me up on the roof of the building so I could see the panoramic view of the city skyline. He said he felt like eating some tacos at Fuzzy's, a restaurant we could see from his roof, so we walked over there and ate while watching the University of Oklahoma women's volleyball team on TV. On our way out we ran into the mayor's son, who was wearing an Oklahoma T-shirt. We spent probably two unhurried hours together - an experience I have trouble imagining having with any other mayor of a decent-size city.
So I never saw the niceness crack, on an interpersonal level, but there are a couple of complications. For one thing, OKC's economic resurgence doesn't extend to everyone: there are plenty of poor neighborhoods that haven't benefited directly from all the public and private money that's gone into rebuilding downtown. And they have gang and drug problems and everything you'd expect.
The other thing I'd say is that niceness has a flipside. I was in OKC for about a week, and a handful of times, I got a sense that some of these Oklahoman virtues - politeness, decency, hospitality - could come at a cost: not speaking out, not making waves, toeing the company line, conforming. I expected the Thunder organization (probably navely) to have a folksy, small-market vibe and to welcome outsiders with open arms. In fact, it turned out to be hyperaware of its image and extremely cautious, almost paranoid, about controlling it. Every conversation I had with a Thunder player was listened to by one of the Thunder P.R. guys. They stood a few feet behind me, faux casually looking at their phones, like bad C.I.A. agents. Still, this is the era of ESPN and instant Twitter scandals, so paranoia is probably just a basic survival skill for a sports team.

 I'm curious about why Sam Presti, the Thunder's general manager, chose to take you to the bombing site. Does the 1995 bombing come up often in conversation there? 
The bombing memorial is absolutely an integral part of the city. It came up in conversation all the time. Some people said, very explicitly, that the rise of the Thunder and all of that community positivity had begun to "heal" the city. Others didn't want to go that far, but just about everyone saw the two things as related.
The team, I should say, is extremely careful not to be seen as taking advantage of the tragedy. The players and Coach Brooks and Sam Presti know that probably most of their local fans were affected by the bombing in some way. Thunder players apparently go to the memorial often, with no warning or hoopla, in an effort to understand and because it's such a powerful place.
Presti met me there, I assume, because he really wanted me to understand the community in which this team is embedded. But he was understandably wary that this outside media guy was going to get it wrong, exaggerate the relationship between the team and the tragedy, and make the organization look as if it was somehow taking advantage of that relationship to score P.R. points. Which, for the record, I don't think they do at all.
 Your article has a sort of precapitalist fairy-tale quality. Is money the big bad wolf? 
I think it is a sort of old-timey "golden era of sports" type of story. It kept reminding me of stories of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1940s and '50s - how it was just this perfect fusion of community and team. But then of course the Dodgers got sucked off to the West Coast and Brooklyn went into a downward economic spiral that lasted something like 40 years - and that was all about money. The amazing thing about the Thunder is that the team's origin story is definitely not a precapitalist fairy tale. Ask anyone in Seattle. But now the team has come to seem that way.
And yes, money is beginning to catch up with them. That Harden trade seemed like a transitional moment for the franchise: they couldn't afford to be as lovable as they'd become. But I think Presti always knew that the fairy tale phase was going to end, sooner rather than later. His agenda is to make the organization strong and smart enough that it survives and is loved by the people of OKC even during leaner years.

HEADLINE: The Power of Plastic

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Credit card fees and payments vary so greatly by card type that many merchants cannot be sure of what they are being charged, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Credit card payment networks and card-issuing banks are taking advantage of their market power to extract more and more revenue from small businesses. In last week's post, I provided an overview of recent legal and legislative battles over rising swipe fees. But as an attentive reader points out in an e-mail, I should have called attention to how hard it is for merchants even to figure out what fees they will be charged. 
Michael Latigona of David Michael's Salon in Berlin, N.J., provides a vivid description of the perils of a phenomenon known as "strategic price complexity":
Please, take a credit card out of your wallet and look at it closely. Any card will do. Now let me ask you. Can you tell me whether or not your card is a MC rewards class I, II or III (all of which have different rates)? How about your Visa? What type of Visa is it you are holding? Would it be a Visa CPS Retail card; how about a Visa Rewards 1 card? Or it could be a Visa enhanced business card?
You see, each card carries a different fee for the merchant. But how can a merchant ever know what the card is to ask the customer to use a different or cheaper card that carries less fees for the merchant? You can't. There is nothing on the cards to delineate the literally thousands of types of cards and fees associated with them.
I asked my merchant provider to give me a list to show me the different types of cards and fees associated with them. Well, that was about 20 pages long, and still, even with that knowledge, could never determine what card you are holding, how much I will be charged for such card, let alone ask the consumer to use a cheaper one.
So regardless of the ruling or future settlement, unless it is clearly marked on the card what type of card I am about to swipe, us millions of small businesses have no clue what that charge will be until we receive our monthly statement. It's like you going to the restaurant and eating, but not seeing the bill until it comes in a month. Would you receive a service without knowing how much it will cost you? Well us small businesses have no clue what our charges will be when we swipe that card.
Did you figure out whether you are a class I, II or III Visa yet? Now even if I gave you my 20-page list of types of cards, could you still determine it? No. So us small business will continue to be forced to accept a card, and have absolutely no clue how much we will be charged for that card, and that is something nobody is talking about.
I hope you can research this and do a story on this. After all, don't you think us small businesses should know ahead of time what we have to pay before we swipe that card? Or you could come to my salon and I could do your hair, not give you a price and send you a bill later. But I think you might not be happy without knowing how much that fabulous hair I just gave you would cost before the service and get sticker shock when you come to the register. Not quite fair to the consumer is it? And it's definitely not fair that your credit card doesn't tell me which one out of the thousands out there I am taking, the fees associated with that type of card and then have sticker shock each month when opening a statement because I have no clue what the actual charge will be when I accept the card.
Here's some economic background that Mr. Latigona and other small-business owners might find useful: 
The credit card payment network is an oligopoly. Visa and MasterCard dominate the market, along with the smaller networks Discover and American Express. This market structure is hard to discern, because cards themselves are issued by different banks, with different terms - and they come in many different colors. Among issuers, the top 10 credit-card-issuing banks accounted for more than 90 percent of outstanding credit card debt in 2009.
Both the payment networks and the card issuers operate in a "two-sided" market - selling their services both to consumers and to merchants. Consumers can engage in at least some comparison shopping - considering both terms of service and interest rates charged by different providers. 
Small businesses, however, have long been limited in their ability to steer customers toward credit cards that charge lower fees, partly as a result of payment-network rules and partly because they fear inconveniencing their customers and reducing sales. 
Payment networks and card issuers know how to exploit that fear, and they have a common interest in extracting as much revenue as possible from the merchants who rely on their services. Their market power puts them in a strong position to do so. 
In a report on interchange fees (also known as swipe fees) published in 2009, the Government Accountability Office concluded that these fees had increased significantly since 1991, especially for so-called premium cards offered only to high-spending customers. It delicately pointed out that producers with market power "have the ability to charge high, noncompetitive prices" and went on to note that representatives of card issuers openly acknowledged that their fees were not determined by costs but "were one of several revenue sources." 
The G.A.O. report also noted that the number of fee categories had proliferated over time, to 60 from four for Visa and to 243 from four for MasterCard between 1991 and 2009. 
Here is where the concept of "strategic price complexity" comes in. In his study of retail financial markets, Bruce Carlin of the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, contends that complexity itself can increase market power, because it reduces the power that buyers would otherwise have to compare prices. 
This strategy seems to be working well for credit card issuers. A recent report from the Federal Reserve notes that credit card earnings have almost always been higher than returns on all commercial bank activities. The financial sector in general commands a far higher profit rate than the retail sector. 
The proposed legal settlement that grew out of the antitrust suit I described last week gives small businesses more latitude to encourage customers to use cards with lower fees. But this settlement will not solve the problem because, as Mr. Latigona points out, it is difficult for businesses to determine which cards fit this category. 
Paying with plastic is technically more efficient for everyone than paying with checks or cash. But the fees we are now charged for using plastic far exceed the actual costs. They reflect the market power of a financial oligopoly.

 Bests of the Week 
 Mark Thoma warns that Hurricane Sandy is testing our resolve to preserve capitalism: "If inequality and the economic and political power that come with it continue to grow, the belief that capitalism is unfair could become widespread.

 Mike Myatt explains five things every leader should know to preserve his or her span of control: "Don't focus on the team you inherit, focus on the team you need - if they happen to be one and the same, consider yourself lucky. Are you looking for doers, thinkers or teachers? Do you want to build a team of tactical geniuses, or brilliant strategists, or sage mentors? Compromise has its place, but not where matters of talent are concerned."

HEADLINE: A New Way to Foot Efficiency Upgrades

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A commercial property owner in California will be able to avoid large upfront costs by paying regular installments on a utility bill. In a twist, the payments will continue even if the property changes hands. 

 BODY:
For commercial property owners in California looking to finance energy efficiency upgrades for their buildings, the process should be a bit easier and cheaper come early next year, thanks to a new pilot program approved last week by the state's Public Utilities Commission.
Based on an "on-bill repayment" feature, the program would allow the property owner to avoid large upfront costs and instead pay for upgrades through regular installments on his utility bill. The idea is that the energy cost savings would cover or exceed the loan or the leasing repayment added to the bill each month. The repayment remains on the property's utility bill until it's paid off, even if the property changes ownership, and the utility would have the authority to cut off service for nonpayment.
The concept is not new. About a dozen states offer similar programs. California's new twist is the source of financing and the obligation to repay the loan regardless of a change in ownership.

While programs in other states are financed through loans from the utility (using ratepayer money) or government funds and grants (using taxpayer money), California's approach would be the first to rely solely on private third-party financing, according to Brad Copithorne, a director of financial innovation at the Environmental Defense Fund and a co-author of the proposal that served as the blueprint for the program.
"We've already had a lot of interest from the big Wall Street banks, regional banks, leasing companies and other types of private investors," Mr. Copithorne said in a telephone interview. E.D.F. estimates that the program could generate up to $6 billion in private investment for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in the state over the next 10 years.
What has kept these investors away from the market in the past was the level of risk associated with these loans. If the property owner defaulted or went into foreclosure, the lender was often unable to recover any unpaid loan balance. 
"When the repayment becomes legally part of the electric rate tariff for that property, the risk to the lender goes down because the property owner needs to pay it to keep the lights on," he said. "So it gets much easier to finance these projects."
Besides attracting new types of investors, lower risk also means lower interest rates on the financing, which should bring more property owners into the market, he noted.
Unlike programs in other states, the California program will be available to any commercial property for any type and size of project. E.D.F. expects likely targets to include shopping malls, strip malls, multi-tenant commercial buildings and college and corporate campuses. Projects could range from replacing old heating and cooling systems with more efficient models to adding insulation to installing high-efficiency lighting systems or adding rooftop solar panels.
"Over time, we would like to see the market finance any kind of project or technology that will help lower the utility bill," he said.
California has set an ambitious target to lower its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. A recent Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study concluded that energy efficiency improvements to buildings could produce almost 30 percent of the reductions needed to reach this goal. 
Time will tell if the new on-bill repayment program will deliver on expectations. The Public Utilities Commission has directed the state's investor-owned utilities - Sempra Energy, Southern California Edison, and Pacific Gas and Electric - to have the program operating by March 31 of next year.
Mr. Copithorne said E.D.F was already working with officials in other states including Texas, Ohio and North Carolina. "If we can show that this creates investments and create jobs, doesn't rely on taxpayer or ratepayer money, and it's all free market, I think it appeals in red and blue states," he said.
E.D.F. also plans to pursue legislation next year to extend the program to residential customers.

HEADLINE: Students Press the Case for Oysters as New York's Surge Protector

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Students at a New York City school focused on New York Harbor make the case for oysters as a surge protector. 

 BODY:
I was fortunate one year ago to take the ferry from downtown Manhattan to Governor's Island and spend a few hours at the New York Harbor School, one of the most innovative and effective experiments in public education that I've ever seen.
Students from around the city, most from families below the poverty line, absorb knowledge and thinking skills while studying science, history, boat building and other subjects in a curriculum (and campus) focused on this fabled body of water. They also grow oysters -- lots of oysters -- in an effort to restore living reefs that act as pollution filters and storm barriers. 
In the aftermath of the destructive storm surge driven by Hurricane Sandy, there's been a second surge -- of recommendations on how to cut risks from the next storm. They've come from a Nobel Laureate in economics, an oceanographer, a geographer from the Netherlands (a country with centuries of experience holding back the sea). 
But I hadn't seen something from the generation that will be in harm's way later in this century. So I reached out to the Harbor School to get students' perspectives on their favorite strategy for cutting chances of another flood-driven calamity -- building oyster reefs. 
Here's the resulting "Your Dot" contribution, from Mahmoud Tamer, Beni Nedrick and Ashia Salgado (pictured left to right above): 
Two weeks ago our city was devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Mass flooding, power outages, oil spills and residential damages were caused by strong winds and storm surge. The current hard shorelines of New York City failed us because they are too binary -- meaning that the sea walls only protect us until the water level reaches a certain height where it will then overflow into the city.
This tragedy has made us aware of how to better prepare our city for storms like this. We know that hurricanes are fueled by warm water, so as global temperatures rise New York becomes more susceptible to major storms.
New York City could build high walls all around to keep out the water, turning us into prisoners in our own city and preventing use of our greatest natural resource. Instead of confining New Yorkers we can find suitable solutions through creating a soft shoreline with native organisms that were heavily populated in this area.
As aquaculturists at the New York harbor school we grow oysters for environmental restoration. Oysters are a keystone species which means they have a disproportionate positive effect on their ecosystem. Oyster reefs provide habitat for small marine life and filter water of nitrogen and phosphorous by consuming algae that contain these nutrients.
Oyster reefs act as wave attenuators and benthic stabilizers. We grow our oysters in our hatchery and then move them when they are big enough to our nurseries under our Ecodock on Governors Island and in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Once the oysters are big enough we put them on reefs in the harbor to test if they can sustain life and biodiversity. For thousands of years oysters protected coastal regions from strong waves and storms. If we bring oysters back to New York Harbor we restore the life that was once here and make our city more resilient to rising water levels and warming oceans.
Here's a video report on the oyster project:

HEADLINE: Gaudi's Casa Mila Gets Reprieve

BYLINE: DAN BILEFSKY


HIGHLIGHT: Fears that the architectural jewel in Barcelona might be put up for sale were allayed by the creation of a special foundation. 

 BODY:
BARCELONA - With the economic crisis roiling Europe, fears have been growing among cultural observers that cash-strapped countries like Greece, Spain and Italy could sell cultural treasures to avert financial insolvency. In Spain these concerns were fanned in recent weeks after it emerged that Catalunya Caixa, a struggling savings bank that owns the Antoni Gaudi Barcelona masterpiece Casa Mil, could be forced to put that architectural jewel up for sale. There were even rumors that a Russian billionaire wanted to buy the building. But those fears have been allayed after the bank, which was nationalized as part of a government bailout, announced last week that it would set up a special foundation to administer Casa Mil and to assure that it would not go to auction. Catalan culture officials said the foundation would have a budget of about 35 million euros, a big chunk of that derived from ticket sales to Casa Mil, a popular tourist destination.
With its undulating facade, cavelike balconies and colorful rooftop chimney park, Casa Mil -- also known as La Pedrera (the Stone Quarry) -- is one of the most imaginative houses in the history of architecture. A Unesco World Heritage Site, it is also a potent symbol of Catalonia and Spain. For many Spaniards selling it would be equivalent to France selling the Eiffel Tower or the United States selling the Statue of Liberty.
Crisis-hit countries across Europe have been considering selling off cultural landmarks to stay afloat. Italy recently announced plans to put 800 state-owned properties on the market. Mentioned among the possible buildings for sale is the 17th-century Palazzo Barberini in Rome, which houses the National Gallery of Ancient Art. Debt-choked Greece, meanwhile, has announced plans to sell islands and historic real estate, including the Tatoi Palace, the former Greek royal family's estate at the foot of Mount Parnitha.

HEADLINE: Reform and the Internet, With Chinese Characteristics

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: China's 18th Communist Party congress has two more days to run but preliminary reports predict there will be no significant changes coming out of the meeting. What DealBook readers need to know about China this week. 

 BODY:
China's 18th Communist Party congress has two more days to run but preliminary reportspredict there will be no significant changes coming out of the meeting. 
Some in the Chinese commentariat are not yet so bearish on the prospect, even though Hu Jintao unsurprisingly said "we will never copy a Western political system."
It was never realistic to expect an announcement of major changes. There are signs in official statements of positive economic measures, but it will take months or longer for Xi Jinping to consolidate his rule, especially since he will have tomanage two predecessors - Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin - and avoid directly challenging their legacies. 
 The lineup of the Politburo Standing Committee, expected to shrink to seven men in the 18th congress from nine in the 17th, will be a good but incomplete indicator of the likelihood for future changes. There is much speculation about the identity and political leanings of the new leadership, but other than Mr. Xi and Li Keqiang, we know nothing and have just speculation until the official unveiling Thursday. 
The goal of any changes is to strengthen the rule of the Communist Party and ensure the continuation of what the leadership calls "the Great Chinese Renaissance." That is why many observers,myself included, believe that Mr. Xi will have to push through significant changes to stay in power, as the economic and social pressures in China have reached a dangerous level not seen in many years.
 CHINA's MANAGEMENT OF THE INTERNET over the last few days has not been encouraging for those who want to believe the leadership will push reforms. Beijing blocked access to many Google services and thwarted usageof Virtual Private Networks, or V.P.N.'s, that foreigners and increasing numbers of Chinese use to scale the "Great Firewall." I have lived in Beijing since 2005, and these have been the most draconian few days of Internet restrictions I have experienced. 
Chinese "cybercrats" have tolerated V.P.N.'s as the vast majority of citizens on the Internet do not have one, and foreign firms and financial institutions rely on them. Perhaps fear of publication of another story about the finances of a leader's family during the gathering led to the decision to tighten Internet controls. 
Indiscriminate blocking of major parts of the global Internet is not going to help China in its quest to internationalize the renminbi and make it a reserve currency. Internet controls at the level of the last few days may alsodeter foreign firms from moving their regional headquarters to China. 
 CHINA'S INTERNET IS BOOMING, with nearly 600 million "netizens," and is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. More than a dozen Chinese Internet firms have listed on stock exchanges in the United States. Clearly censorship has not been bad for business.
China's dominant search engine, Baidu, whose shares have soared since Google's 2010 partial pullout, trades on the Nasdaq market ata $36 billion market capitalization.Tencent, listed in Hong Kong, is worth about $62 billion, making it the third- or fourth-largest Internet firm in the world by market cap. Alibabarecorded $3.1 billion in sales during Sunday's "Singles Day" event on its Tmall service, topping the $1.25 billion American online retailers took in last year on Cyber Monday.
None of the Chinese Internet companies have made material expansions into the United States, Europe or Japan, but some are making inroads in the developing world. Tencent has been the most aggressive and WeChat,a mobile messaging app that has 200 million users, is rapidly gaining a global following. 
American investors will have a chance to invest in another Chinese Internet company with the impending Nasdaqinitial public offering of YY.com, a profitable communications platform for game players. Itsinvestors include Steamboat Ventures, a fund affiliated with Disney.
The former United States ambassador to China, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., recently told a Stanford University conferencethat he expected Mr. Xi to relax Internet controls in the next couple of years. In July, Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, said that the Great Firewall will eventually fall. Last week, Bloomberg's editorial section published "Mr. Xi, Tear Down This Firewall!" I even predicted it in an August interview. 
Foreign hopes aside, there is no reason China cannot continue changing its economy while maintaining some Internet controls. Political change and Internet restrictions will have a harder time coexisting. 
In the meantime, the world needs to get used to the fact that China is serious about building "Socialism with Chinese characteristics" and an "Internet with Chinese characteristics."

HEADLINE: Bundled Households

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In 2007, about 1.3 million unemployed adult children were living in their parents' homes. This year, the total has risen to 2.5 million. 

 BODY:
As I wrote on Friday, lots of young Americans are finally moving out of their parents' basements and forming their own households now that the economy is picking up. But the bundled-household phenomenon remains large, and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has just shared some interesting data showing its extent.
Based on demographics and previous trends in household formation, it looks as if the country still has about 1.8 million fewer households today than it would have in a more "normal" economy, and most of that total household deficit is accounted for by the lower numbers of households formed by those in the 15-34 age group. Demographics suggest that there should be about 1.1 million more households headed by younger Americans today than there actually are.
As a result, we're still see an unusually high number of people living with parents, other relatives or friends.
This chart shows the total number of additional adults living with a home's official householder, broken down by the relationship to the householder: nonrelative, child or other relative.
As you can see there are about 17.2 million adult children living in their parents' homes this year, compared with around 15.3 million in 2007, the year the recession began.
Mr. Zandi has also broken out the employment status of those adult children crashing with their folks. And the numbers show that the greatest increases are accounted for by unemployed adult children who have moved in with parents.
In 2007, 1.3 million unemployed adult children were living in their parents' homes. This year, the total is about 2.5 million.

HEADLINE: My Unscientific World Poll of Obama vs. Romney

BYLINE: MORT ROSENBLUM


HIGHLIGHT: One Latin American colleague said Lima saw Romney as "The stereotypical gringo, hard working, prejudiced, short-sighted, with a dangerous imbalance between might and mind." 

 BODY:
 A whole world has to live with whichever presidential candidate comes to occupy the Oval Office. If everyone else got a vote, it seems, Mitt Romney would not have gotten past the White House rose garden.
 A poll for the BBC of 21 countries released before the U.S. presidential election showed that only Pakistanis, outraged at drone missiles, preferred Mr. Romney. The tally was 14 percent to 11 percent. Most respondents wanted neither. Canada went for Barack Obama by two to one. In France, it was 72 percent versus two percent for Mr. Romney.
 Beyond the pollsters, I did my own sampling. Nate Silver would double over with laughter at the methodology. But, as a grizzled old reporter, I queried colleagues I know have a feel for their societies.
 Peru was typical. Gustavo Gorriti of IDL-Reporteros noted Mr. Obama tallied 75 percent among Americans in Lima and he reckons Peruvians would have voted the same way. He messaged:
"Why? Migration policies, empathy, sympathy, intelligence and understanding of the world. Opinion of Romney? The stereotypical gringo, hard working, prejudiced, short-sighted, with a dangerous imbalance between might and mind."
A smart reporter in Hanoi, who asked for anonymity because he is a smart reporter in Hanoi, said most Vietnamese fear Mr. Romney, whose popular local nickname translates to "condor eye." That is, a warmonger. They think Mr. Obama would do better at balancing the global economy. 
Smita Sharma said most pundits on her TV program in New Delhi say "it is easier to deal with a known devil, than an unknown one." But she said, "There are those Indians who still yearn for the Republican-Bush-Nuclear-Deal-High-Moment." And some students wanted Mr. Romney to win because of Paul Ryan, his vice presidential partner, whose fresh young look and radical thinking made him appealing. 
In the poll for the BBC, two-thirds of Australians chose Mr. Obama. Bill Claiborne, a retired Washington Post correspondent of wide experience, told me: "Australia is a small country on a very large continent but it is more egalitarian than the U.S. I'd guess it would give a huge part of its vote to Obama. Oddly, it has a clone of Romney (or worse) heading the (conservative) Liberal Party and a quite liberal Labor Party hanging on to a slender majority in Parliament. There was enormous interest in Obama and celebrations after the election. I didn't hear of any rallies for Romney."
In an upscale suburb of Stockholm, Fredrik Laurin, an investigative reporter, recorded an exchange with his son Malte and a friend, Max, on how Swedes would vote if they could. Both are 10 years old.
Some excerpts:
Max: I think theyd vote for Barack Obama.
Malte: There has been a lot of talk about Mitt Romney, that he cares more about the people who already have a lot of money.
Max: I think hes rather selfish and only thinks about himself.
Malte: Obama cares about all people. He tries to make it good for both rich and poor. His grandmother has been poor herself and was living in one of those cow-dung huts that people live in in Africa. I also heard a lot about that when he was a kid, he wanted to be president. And that all should be equal.
Max: I think many voted for [Mr. Romney].
Malte: But I don't think hes good for the people, he thinks more about the ones that already have what they need For example he says only the rich should have healthcare I think that before Obama came you had to pay for healthcare in America, but when he came that was changed. You shouldn't have to pay when you go to a hospital.
Max: And all people should have the right to go to school. All should have equal rights. 
Both kids said they expect more from a second term.
Malte: Obama has not done all he has promised, for example I don't know that all kids in America can go to school for free. But I think he has done things better. And now that he has won I think he can make sure that everyone can go to school and get health care. If you have a problem with your heart for example you should not have to argue with someone to go to hospital. Then you must be accepted and get an operation. Before he might have thought that he couldn't do it all, but now he can just go for it and make things better. Because then it's over.
 Both kids read daily papers, watch TV news and cruise the Internet. Neither one mentioned Big Bird.

HEADLINE: Emotions Come to Fore in Political Wins and Losses

BYLINE: RICHARD FRIEDMAN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: Ideology alone does not drive political affiliations - social and emotional bonds are a strong factor, too, making for extreme joy or despair after a win or a loss. 

 BODY:
Just one look at the dejection on the faces of Romney supporters or the jubilation of Obama supporters on election night should tell you that politics is first and foremost a very emotional affair.
Ann Romney was crying while her husband delivered his terse concession speech, not because a majority of Americans voted against his economic policy, but because of the personal - and highly public - rejection of Mitt Romney as their next president.
Nor were President Obama's supporters ecstatic because his health care policy would not be overturned. Rather, both camps were in the grip of powerful emotions akin to the passion of spectators rooting for their team at a sporting event.
Oh, yes, Democrats will wax passionately about social justice and income inequality, and Republicans will carry on about the pernicious nature of big government and the virtues of individual achievement.
But political affiliation is not driven by ideas alone. Most people do not choose a political party by carefully analyzing its policies or even its track record for competence. Instead, some social scientists argue that people select their political party in early adulthood the way they choose their friends or social groups: They go for the party that has people who resemble themselves.
Once you've selected your party, you are likely to retrofit your beliefs and philosophy to align with it. In this sense, political parties are like tribes; membership in the tribe shapes your values and powerfully influences your allegiance to the group.
So strong is the social and emotional bond among members of a political tribe that they are likely to remain loyal to their party even when they give it low marks for performance. Yankees fans don't jump ship when their team loses any more than Republicans switch parties when they lose an election.
Research has shown that when a team wins an athletic contest, fans the next day speak about how "we won," and feel generally more optimistic, stronger and self-confident. Conversely, the losing side feels depressed, defeated and angry.
Interestingly, some studies found that testosterone levels rose in a group of male fans whose team went on to win and fell in fans whose team was defeated. Testosterone is well known to elevate both mood and aggression. Thus, winning or losing doesn't just change your mood; it changes your physiology and brain function.
Political defeat unleashes similar painful emotions, and there is some preliminary evidence that it has biological consequences as well. For example, a study in 2009 found that during the 2008 presidential election, a group of McCain voters had an increase in the stress hormone cortisol after the announcement that Barack Obama had won, while those who had voted for Mr. Obama had no significant change in their cortisol levels. Cortisol is secreted by the body in response to acute and chronic stress. The clear implication of the study was that political defeat is a biologically stressful experience.
Not just that, but political contests have an element of thrill and expectation that is a bit like gambling. Intrade, for example, gave real-time market predictions about the probability of winning for each presidential candidate. Everyone who voted essentially bet on a candidate and expected a reward. We are hard-wired to go after various rewards and get a squirt of dopamine in our brain's reward circuit when we get one. This dopamine signal confers, among many things, a sense of pleasure. Conversely, when we don't get the reward we expected, the activity in our reward circuit is suddenly depressed and we don't feel very good.
Thus, Republicans found themselves in a grim situation on election night. As they told reporters, they were confident of victory, so the defeat was all the more stunning. Senior Romney advisers told CBS News: "We went into the evening confident we had a good path to victory. I don't think there was one person who saw this coming."
For some political followers - and figures - the experience of defeat is so unacceptable that they resort to primitive denial. Consider the Republican strategist Karl Rove on election night. The moment Fox News called Ohio for Mr. Obama, Mr. Rove boldly challenged the network's team of voting analysts. Mr. Rove was entitled to his dismay, of course, but not his own facts - and Fox News stood by its call.
What makes political loss particularly painful for followers is the defeat of their leader, whose appeal derives in large part from the ability to make followers feel understood and cared for. In this sense, an effective leader arouses feelings in supporters that resemble the feelings children have for their parents. That's why watching your presidential candidate go down is a bit like seeing your father get fired or beaten up.
But what is the experience of defeat like for the candidate himself? One gets a clue from the work of William Shaffir, a sociologist at McMaster University in Canada, who interviewed defeated politicians who spoke to him on the condition of anonymity. As one defeated official told Dr. Shaffir: "It's a sudden stop. It's just like someone shut off the tap. It just ends. It's over. It's death."
The defeated candidate experiences an abrupt and painful loss of social role - a classic stressor that can trigger depression. When the election is over, the followers go back to work. But the defeated candidate has to reinvent himself and find a new role in life.
So for those of us celebrating this presidential election, we should not forget that though victory is sweet, it can be short-lived. Sooner or later we will be the losers. A little chest-thumping is in order and is even good for tribe morale. But we should try our best not to gloat.

HEADLINE: IHT Special Report: Oil & Money

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: Welcome to the future of oil and gas: The U.S. displacing Saudi Arabia as the number one oil producer in the world. Coal displacing oil as the leading fuel. Drilling in the Mediterranean. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Over two days of special reports, in print and online, the International Herald Tribune is examining how the global energy landscape is shifting in fundamental ways that few would have predicted, and how new opportunities and risks are arising - geopolitical, economic and environmental. 
The special reports coincide with a conference in Londonthat the IHT is convening with Energy Intelligence, an energy consultancy, bringing together the top executives in the oil and gas industry, as well as leaders who deal with energy issues in government, academia and the media. The IHT's energy editor, Stanley Reed, and I will be tweeting from the first day of the conference on Tuesday @iht_rdv and #OM2012 and Stanley will be blogging here on RDV.
The special print section on Tuesday comes as a new report from the International Energy Agency claims that in five years the United States will be the world's largest oil producer and by 2030 will become a net exporter of oil. 
That increased oil production, combined with new American policies to improve energy efficiency, means that the United States will become "all but self-sufficient" in meeting its energy needs in about two decades - a "dramatic reversal of the trend" in most developed countries, the report says.
"The foundations of the global energy systems are shifting," said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the Paris-based organization, which produces the annual World Energy Outlook, in an interview before the release. The agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy issues, had previously predicted that Saudi Arabia would be the leading producer until 2035.
But as David Goldwyn, a former U.S. State Department special envoy for international energy and assistant secretary of energy, writes in the lead article in the special report, "The reduced U.S. dependence on crude imports does not mean an end to history. The issues of price volatility, diversity of supply and helping U.S. friends and allies to be free from monopolistic pricing or coercive supply arrangements will remain as vital 20 years from now as they are today." 
He says the American oil and gas boom will lead to more jobs and more infrastructure and refining capacity in the United States, but will not end dependency on foreign oil, or American interests being linked to affairs in the turbulent nations where that oil comes from.
Mr. Goldwyn says the controversial shale gas boom (a.k.a. fracking) can lead to environmental and economic benefits globally, if done in an economically sound way, but will require changes in American diplomacy and policy. 
Referring to the largest shale deposits in the United States, he writes, "If the technology and project management deployed in the Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford shales can be even partially replicated in Eastern Europe, China and India, the world could see faster greenhouse gas reduction - through substituting gas for coal - at lower cost than any mechanism envisioned by our climate negotiators."
But the special report lays out in stark relief that the more things change on the global energy landscape, the more they stay the same - especially when it comes to coal. 
Dirty, fickle and dangerous, coal may seem an odd contender in a world where promising renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power are attracting attention. Anathema to environmentalists because it creates so much pollution, coal still has the undeniable advantages of being widely available and easy to ship and burn.
The biggest attraction, however, is low cost. By many estimates, including that of Li Junfeng, longtime director general of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, burning coal still costs about one-third as much as using renewable energy like wind or solar.
Coal use is expected to increase 50 percent by 2035, said Milton Catelin, executive director of the London-based World Coal Association, who says that coal represented 30 percent of world energy, "the highest share it has had since 1969."
He predicts within a year or two, coal will surpass oil as the planet's primary fuel. 
And coal is not the only fossil fuel experiencing a revival. 
Shell is betting more than $10 billion by some estimates on just one facility that will reach and process liquified natural gas where it has never been processed on such a scale before: at sea. Shell is building the world's biggest ship, Prelude, as a floating L.N.G. platform off Australia.
And, in Qatar, Shell "is ramping up production of a facility called Pearl. Not a tiny jewel, Pearl is a sprawling $20 billion network of pipes and tanks designed to perform the alchemy of turning Qatar's matchless natural gas resources into even more valuable diesel and jet fuel."
 Still, Iain Pyle of Bernstein Research in London figures that Shell could make $1 billion a year in net profit. Prelude will produce a lot of gas - more than enough to supply the needs of Hong Kong, for instance, Shell says.
Assuming Prelude works, it should provide Shell with a persuasive talking point when it approaches governments.
Marjan van Loon, a Shell vice president for liquefied natural gas, says Shell wants to build a new floating liquefied natural gas project each year "for the foreseeable decades."
Environmentally concerned readers may be asking, "Prelude to what? Earth: desert planet?" 
All of this has a certain Back to the Future element to it. Just a few years ago, many people were talking about a future based on renewable energy as if it were a foregone conclusion. 
Indeed, the International Energy Agency report that predicts the United States' rise to leading oil exporter also includes a warning that unchecked energy consumption will have dire consequences for the planet's climate.
"The report confirms that, given the current policies, we will blow past every safe target for emissions," said Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Now, the energy needs of the industrialized world and the rapidly developing world - as well as the cost associated with building renewable-energy infrastructure amid a global economic crisis and new supplies and technology aimed at fossil fuels lowering the costs of exploiting these forms of energy - have pushed renewables into the background and brought the opportunities of old fuels to the fore.
 We'll be discussing these issues -- the opportunities and the risks -- in the coming days. We hope you'll join the conversation.

HEADLINE: Red Versus Blue in a New Light

BYLINE: ANDREW GELMAN and AVI FELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Exit polls reveal that what makes red America red and blue American blue is political division in the upper half of the income distribution, not the bottom. 

 BODY:
The basic question driving the 2012 campaign was always clear: could Mitt Romney gain enough of the vote among older, upper-income white Americans to overcome President Obama's overwhelming advantage among young, low-income and minority voters? 
As in previous elections, richer voters leaned Republican while lower-income voters came out strong as Democrats. 
But there's much more to this story. The maps we have made show that the election was not just about red and blue states. What's actually going on is that the division between red and blue America is mostly about a split among richer voters.
To picture this, imagine two alternative universes for the 2012 election. In the first, only individuals making less than $50,000 a year can vote; in the second, only those making more than $100,000 a year can. Based on exit polls from Election Day, we have a decent idea of how these scenarios would play out.
In the first universe, Barack Obama wins in a 1984-style landslide, with a near sweep of the Electoral College and around 60 percent of the popular vote.
In the second universe, Mitt Romney wins with a healthy 54 percent of the popular vote. Though he still carries the red states, a landslide remains out of his grasp - wealthy voters in blue states like New York and California still support Obama by comfortable margins. We'll come back to this thought in a moment.
The maps in fig. 2 show the election results for four income groups as measured by exit polls (with blanks for the states that were not polled):
Remarkably, this same pattern has occurred in every presidential contest over the past twenty years. Lower-income voters consistently support the Democratic candidate in nearly every state. Upper-income voters, on the other hand, are more mixed in their political views: wealthy voters in Mississippi are strongly Republican while wealthy voters in Massachusetts are strongly Democratic. Extensive analyses of survey information from these elections show that this relationship holds even when controlling for age, race, sex and education.
In other words, contrary to what you have heard, there's only a strong red America-blue America split toward the top of the income distribution. Toward the bottom, the electoral map is a sea of blue. 
Why does this happen? Our research on opinion poll data from earlier elections finds that lower-income Americans tend to vote based on economic issues, while richer voters consider social issues as well as economics in their voting decisions. This is sometimes called post-materialism: the idea that, as individuals or groups become more comfortable, they can afford to think beyond their immediate needs. 
The so-called culture war between red and blue America is concentrated in the upper half of the income distribution, and voting patterns reflect this.
We can break down the electorate by age similarly. Among young voters, Obama won a sizable 60 percent of the vote, with a solid majority in nearly all states included in the exit polls. In contrast, Romney won a solid 56 percent among senior citizens, with a strong showing in the red states (including two-thirds of elderly Arizonans), but with a sizable majority supporting the president in blue states like New York and Massachusetts.
Similar patterns show up if you break up the state-by-state vote by sex or race.
In all these cases, the red-state, blue-state division is sharper in categories that tend to vote Republican. Put another way: Obama's voting blocs look about the same everywhere in the country, while Romney's vary more from state to state.
This is not a story about the Obama campaign's strategy or Mitt Romney's failures as a presidential candidate - the demographic maps for 2004 and 2008 look very similar. The red-blue electoral map that we're used to poring over is mainly the result of a political and geographic divide among American voters at the older, richer and whiter end of the socioeconomic spectrum.
 Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia and the author of "Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do." Avi Feller is a graduate student in statistics at Harvard and worked from 2010 to 2011 in the Office of Management and Budget in Washington.

HEADLINE: Will Higher Taxes Affect Small Businesses? You Tell Us

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: You're the Boss is looking for businesses who will be affected by the president's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy. 

 BODY:
President Obama may have won a decisive reelection victory, but it is John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, who is making the rounds and claiming a mandate. And everywhere he goes, he's talking about what would happen to small businesses if the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans are allowed to expire. To ABC News's Diane Sawyer, Mr. Boehner said, "Raising taxes on small-business people is the wrong prescription given where our economy is." He told USA Today, "Raising taxes on small businesses will kill jobs in America. It is as simple as that." 
In a statement to reporters the day after the election, Mr. Boehner made what some observers described as a concession: House Republicans would consider new revenue as part of a deal to avert the "fiscal cliff." But he then explained that the new revenue could not come from higher tax rates. "In the New Testament, a parable is told of two men. One built his house on sand; the other built his house on rock," he said. "The foundation of our country's economy - the rock of our economy - has always been small businesses in the private sector. I ran one of those small businesses, and I can tell you: raising small businesses' taxes means they don't grow." 
To support the claim, Mr. Boehner turned to the same controversial Ernst & Young study on which Mitt Romney relied in the first presidential debate in Denver.
Of course, this view is no less controversial now than it was at the time of that debate. Since the debate, we've learned about a September report (pdf) from the nonpartisan, and respected, Congressional Research Service, which surveyed the historical record and found that "the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth" - but "appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution." The Congressional Research Service withdrew the report after Republican senators complained.
Then, last week, a report from the Congressional Budget Office seemed to suggest that raising the tax rates on the wealthiest Americans would have little effect on economic output in the fourth quarter of 2013.* Extending the top tax rates would cost the economy 200,000 jobs, according to the C.B.O., an estimate well below the 700,000 jobs that Ernst & Young predicted would be lost. In fact, the C.B.O. figures show that while raising taxes (on everybody) amounts to about two-thirds of the total deficit reduction in 2013, it has a much smaller effect on gross domestic product, the measurement for output. (The C.B.O. report relies in part on economic modeling, much like the Ernst & Young study, meaning that the C.B.O.'s assumptions about the relationship between taxes and economic output informed the results.)
And Agenda readers who own small businesses have weighed in as well. Jed Horovitz in New Jersey wrote, "Each year, I decide how much money to re-invest in my company and how much to take out. Because I pay taxes on my profit, I always look for productive ways to invest in my company first. Spending pretax money makes sense. If my taxes were lower, I would take more money out and just put it in the bank."
Carol Gillen, who described herself as "the wife and bookkeeper of a small-business owner" in New York, said, "Demand drives hiring, not the personal income tax of the owner."
But The Agenda would like to hear from more business owners. We want to take a close look at how you and your companies would be affected by increasing the top tax rates, including how it might affect hiring and investment plans. It would be an intensive profile - we would want to talk through specifics on revenue, income, taxes and investments. (We have made the same request to the National Federation of Independent Business and the S Corporation Association of America, both of which strongly oppose any income tax increase.)
It's a lot to ask, we know, but it's an important issue. If you own such a company and have employees - making you a job-creator - and you're game, please drop us a line to let us know you're interested.
*More precisely, the C.B.O. report said that extending all of the Bush tax cuts and fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax so that it does not reach deeper into the middle class would add about 1.4 percent to the nation's gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2013. Meanwhile, fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax and extending all of the Bush tax cuts except for wealthier Americans would add about 1.3 percent to G.D.P., so the additional G.D.P. attributed to extending the tax cuts for the top two tax brackets amounts to one-tenth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Leucadia to Acquire Jefferies

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Leucadia National Corporation is buying the Jefferies Group. | President Obama insists on tax increases for the wealthy. | A behind-the-scenes effort by business leaders could play a role in the tax negotiations. | The Greek government approved a 2013 budget, moving a step closer to getting aid from its foreign creditors. 

 BODY:
The Leucadia National Corporation said on Monday that it would buy the Jefferies Group in a deal worth about $3.6 billion. Shareholders of Jefferies will receive 0.81 of a Leucadia share for each of their shares, the announcement said. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.
 A COMING SHOWDOWN OVER TAXES | The debate over taxes is set to become more heated in the coming months. President Obama said on Friday that he would insist on tax increases for the wealthy as part of an agreement to avoid a fiscal crisis at the end of the year, putting him on track for a showdown with Congressional Republicans, The New York Times reports. "On Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach," Mr. Obama said.
A behind-the-scenes effort by business leaders "could play a crucial role in shaping decisions on tax policy," Nelson D. Schwartz and David Kocieniewski write in The New York Times. The chief executives are also involved in two separate advertising blitzes set to begin on Monday and Tuesday, which take their cue from ads by prominent companies like Nike and Dunkin' Donuts and feature slogans like "Just Fix It" and "Time to Fix the Debt."
 On Wednesday, the president is scheduled to meet with corporate executives at the White House to build support for his plan. "Though many of them backed Mitt Romney, scores have formed a coalition to push for a budget compromise similar to the one the president seeks," Jackie Calmes writes in The New York Times. Timothy F. Geithner will be on hand to help negotiate a deal, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said on Friday. Though the Treasury secretary plans to step down eventually, he will stay in his job at least through the president's inauguration in January.
 Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is building bridges. He said on CNBC that he had a "fine relationship" with Elizabeth Warren, who won a Senate seat after being fiercely challenged by Wall Street and its allies in Congress. "I called her up to congratulate her for winning the election," Mr. Dimon said.
The prospect of higher taxes is not sitting well with some supporters of Mitt Romney. Two nights after the election, a hedge fund partner joined other financial types in a bar, according to The New Yorker. "Nobody cares about the difference between thirty-six and thirty-nine per cent, if that extra three per cent goes to the right things," said the unidentified partner, who is said to be a former Lehman Brothers executive. "But we've spent six trillion dollars and don't have one building to show for it that you can hang anyone's name on." 
GREECE APPROVES AUSTERITY BUDGET | The Greek government approved a 2013 budget on Monday, moving a step closer to getting aid from its foreign creditors. But European officials are unlikely to sign off on the next tranche of aid until they receive a report on Greece's progress in meeting its fiscal goals, James Kanter reports in The New York Times.
The Greek government is going after possible tax dodgers in its search for cash. Tax experts are working through a list of about 15,000 Greeks, "lawyers, bankers, doctors, merchants and even farmers who for decades now have made up the cream of Greece's tax-avoiding crop," Landon Thomas Jr. writes in The New York Times. These Greeks have sent a total of about $5 billion abroad in the last three years, government officials say.
ON THE AGENDA | The bond market is closed for Veterans Day. David M. Rubenstein, the Carlyle Group co-founder, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Jack Dorsey, an entrepreneur behind Twitter and Square, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. A new documentary, "Park Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream," directed by Alex Gibney, is scheduled to air on PBS at 10 p.m.
A JUDGE IS REBUKED | One of the most colorful judges in the corporate world was reined in last week. Delaware's highest court issued a rebuke of Leo E. Strine Jr., the chief judge of the Delaware Court of Chancery, "criticizing him for what it said was an improper digression in an opinion," DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. Judge Strine is known for his offbeat and sometimes hilarious musings. "I'm only surprised it took this long" for him to be called out, a corporate litigator from New York told DealBook.

HEADLINE: Bill Kristol: Go Ahead, Raise Taxes

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Even the Weekly Standard editor wonders why the G.O.P. "is gonna fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires." 

 BODY:
When even Bill Kristol, the severely conservative Weekly Standard editor, says Republicans should agree to raise taxes on the richest Americans, you have to wonder if the G.O.P. has thought through its post-election, hold-the-line strategy. "It won't kill the country if Republicans raise taxes a little bit on millionaires," Mr. Kristol said on Fox News on Sunday. "It really won't, I don't think."
Mr. Kristol said he couldn't understand why Congressional Republicans were not taking the challenge President Obama made on Friday to extend the Bush tax cuts for incomes under $250,000. Or, bargain it up to $500,000 or a $1 million. "Really," he said. "The Republican Party is gonna fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic, and half of whom live in Hollywood and are hostile to Republicans."


I'm not buying Mr. Kristol's demographics, or his geography, but he has a point. The Republican Party's intransigence seems ill-conceived and tone deaf.
As Think Progress pointed out over the weekend, the G.O.P.'s version of fiscal "compromise" sounds a lot like the Reagan-era voodoo economics that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan advocated during the campaign. It takes some brass to recycle the losing ticket's plan and call it the reasonable way forward.
Republicans are open to all sorts of bargains, as long as they don't include increasing tax rates. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma was one of several who recited talking points last week on "comprehensive tax reform to raise revenue and lower rates" by "eliminating inefficient loopholes and deductions." That's what Mr. Boehner means when he says he's open to "revenue" as part of a deal on the fiscal cliff.
The tax code could certainly use updating, but there is no possibility that Congress will reform it in the next few weeks. So what the Republicans are really saying is, give us everything we want now (an extension of all the Bush tax cuts), and maybe later we'll throw something in for your side.
It's a trap, and President Obama should not fall for it. He should stand firm on letting the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire on Dec. 31, while keeping in place the cuts on incomes under $250,000. It's what Mr. Obama campaigned and won on, even in Florida after all the ballots from that voting-challenged state were counted.
Last Friday, Mr. Obama excited talking heads in Washington by referring to increases in "revenue" instead of "rates." I hope that is not a sign that he is preparing to cave in on the budget talks, yet again. During the campaign Mr. Obama frequently asked crowds why we would want to back to bad policies that led to the Great Recession. He might want to keep reviewing those videos.

HEADLINE: Obama The Dealmaker

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
During his first term, President Obama faced a wicked problem: How do you govern in a highly polarized, evenly divided country with House Republicans who seem unwilling to compromise? Obama never really solved that one, and he was forced to pass his agenda on partisan lines (during the first two years) or not pass it at all (the final two).
Now re-elected with Republicans still in control of the House, Obama faces the problem again. You might say the success of his second term rests upon him solving it. 
Some on the left are suggesting that he adopt a strategy of confrontation and conquest. The president should use the advantages of victory to crush the spirit of the Republican House majority, they say. Reject the Grand Bargain approach. Instead, take the country over the so-called fiscal cliff. Blame it on the Republicans who are unwilling to even raise taxes on the rich. Wait until they fold, and then you will have your way.
The first thing to say about this strategy is that it is irresponsible. The recovery is fragile. Europe may crater. China is ill. Business is pulling back at the mere anticipation of a fiscal cliff. It's reckless to think you can manufacture an economic crisis for political leverage and then control the cascading results.
Second, it's terrible politics. Obama could probably triumph in a short-term confrontation, pushing through higher tax rates on the rich that wouldn't even produce enough revenue to cover a tenth of the deficit. But he'd sow such bitterness that it would be the last thing he'd pass for the rest of his term. The Republican House majority isn't going to magically disappear.
Finally, it misunderstands the state of the G.O.P. This is not the Republican Party of 2010. Today's Republicans no longer have an incentive to deny Obama victories. He's never running again. Most of today's Republicans understand that they need to decontaminate their brand. They're more open to compromise, more likely to be won over with deal-making than brow-beating.
The liberal left wing, like the Tea Party types, has an incentive to build television ratings by fulminating against their foes. But President Obama and John Boehner have an incentive to create a low-decibel businesslike atmosphere. The opinion-entertainment complex longs for the war track. The practitioners should long for the deal-making track.
Before he gets lost in the mire of negotiations, the president could step back and practically describe the task ahead. Between 1947 and 2007, the U.S. economy grew an average of 3.3 percent a year. But over the next few decades, according to forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office, it's projected to grow only at 2.3 percent per year. The task ahead is to make the sort of structural changes that will get America back on its old growth trajectory.
Then the president could remind everyone that there's lots to do. Some of the things on the to-do list are things Democrats relish doing: investing in infrastructure and basic research; reforming immigration to attract global talent; investing in student loans and community colleges; trimming the annual $1.1 trillion in tax loopholes, many of which go to corporations and the rich.
Other things the Republicans will surely relish doing: simplifying a tax code that has bloated to 74,000 pages; streamlining the Code of Federal Regulation that has metastasized to 165,000 pages; slowing entitlement spending.
But the point is the only way to get things done in a divided polarized country is side by side -- an acceptable Democratic project paired with an acceptable Republican one.
The fiscal-cliff talks are just the first chapter in this long process. In this first episode, the Democrats should get higher revenues from the rich (elections have consequences) and the Republicans should get some entitlement reform. But the main point is to lay the predicate for the bigger deals to come.
This is about horse-trading. It's about conducting meetings in which people don't lecture each other; they deal. It's about isolating those who want an economic culture war. It's about making clear offers and counteroffers.
If you want a great example of how these deals might work, check out a new paper at Third Way called The Bargain. It offers a perfect model of how you might structure a series of big trades to move the country back on the growth path -- on innovation policy, tax policy, spending policy and so on.
The more you put on the table, the more trading is possible, the better the atmosphere and the more you might get done. If you only put one idea on the table at a time, then everybody gets gridlocked and nothing gets done.
The economic crisis interrupted him last time, but President Obama still has a chance to build a great middle-class economy. It'll take a dealmaker, not a warrior.

HEADLINE: Likely Mayoral Hopeful Leaves Democratic Party

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Adolfo Carrin Jr., a former Bronx borough president and Obama administration official, is all but certain to jump into the 2013 mayor's race, not as a Democrat, but rather as an independent seeking the Republican nomination, according to his spokesman and others.
Should Mr. Carrin, a strong fund-raiser, prevail in a Republican primary, he could pose a credible challenge to whoever emerges from what is expected to be a wide-open and bruising primary for the Democratic nomination. And though Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York City by more than six to one, no Democrat has won the mayoralty since David N. Dinkins in 1989. 
An adviser to Mr. Carrin, Davidson Goldin, said Mr. Carrin had recently left the Democratic Party and was unaffiliated. Mr. Goldin also said that Mr. Carrin, who would need the blessing of three of the five Republican county leaders to run on their line in the city, had been talking to individual chairmen regularly, and was to meet all of them Wednesday night. Mr. Carrin is also seeking the backing of the Independence Party.
Mr. Carrin did not return an e-mail seeking comment. But in a statement, Mr. Goldin said, ''Given the yearning for an alternative to the special interests and a leader who can focus on rebuilding and uniting all five boroughs, the coalescing of support around Adolfo Carrin as a candidate for mayor makes complete sense.''
In a possible preview of his platform, Mr. Goldin said Mr. Carrin, a former schoolteacher and urban planner, supported Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on two major fronts: education reform and economic development. But he declined to discuss Mr. Carrin's positions on other contentious issues, like the stop-and-frisk tactics by the police and income inequality.
Mr. Carrin, 51, could be an attractive candidate for national Republicans eager to make inroads with Hispanics, especially after the beating the party took in the elections last week. He also has more than $1.1 million in campaign funds that had been collected when he anticipated running for comptroller in 2009. But he opted not to run.
Mr. Carrin was elected to the City Council in 1997. In 2001, he and three others, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, were imprisoned for protesting bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
Mr. Carrin, a longtime resident of City Island, also comes with some baggage. When he was nominated by the White House in early 2009 to head its Office of Urban Affairs, he was the subject of an investigation in The Daily News for using, in a renovation project on his own home, an architect who was also involved in a major housing development project that required Mr. Carrin's approval.
He was fined $10,000 by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board, and acknowledged that he should have disclosed the transaction.
Mr. Carrin left the White House in 2010 to be the New York and New Jersey director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and oversaw its response to Hurricane Irene.
He left government in January to start his own company.
Political analysts say that Mr. Carrin might have had a difficult time in a Democratic primary dominated by labor and liberals. The expected field includes Bill de Blasio, the public advocate; John C. Liu, the comptroller; Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker; Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president; and William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller.
By contrast, the only presumed contenders for the Republican nomination are two political neophytes who had been Democrats until recently: Tom Allon, a newspaper publisher, and George T. McDonald, the founder and president of the Doe Fund.
Mr. Goldin said Hurricane Sandy influenced his thinking about the need for a new leader. He said that Mr. Carrin would decline any matching funds for which he qualified under the city's generous campaign financing system, and challenged his rivals to do the same.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Forecast to Be No. 1 Oil Producer

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The United States will overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's leading oil producer by about 2017 and will become a net oil exporter by 2030, the International Energy Agency said Monday.
That increased oil production, combined with new American policies to improve energy efficiency, means that the United States will become ''all but self-sufficient'' in meeting its energy needs in about two decades -- a ''dramatic reversal of the trend'' in most developed countries, a new report released by the agency says.
''The foundations of the global energy systems are shifting,'' Fatih Birol, chief economist at the Paris-based organization, which produces the annual World Energy Outlook, said in an interview before the release. The agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy issues, had previously predicted that Saudi Arabia would be the leading producer until 2035. 
The report also predicted that global energy demand would grow between 35 and 46 percent from 2010 to 2035, depending on whether policies that have been proposed are put in place. Most of that growth will come from China, India and the Middle East, where the consuming class is growing rapidly. The consequences are ''potentially far-reaching'' for global energy markets and trade, the report said.
Dr. Birol noted, for example, that Middle Eastern oil once bound for the United States would probably be rerouted to China. American-mined coal, facing declining demand in its home market, is already heading to Europe and China instead.
There are several components of the sudden shift in the world's energy supply, but the prime mover is a resurgence of oil and gas production in the United States, particularly the unlocking of new reserves of oil and gas found in shale rock. The widespread adoption of techniques like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made those reserves much more accessible, and in the case of natural gas, resulted in a vast glut that has sent prices plunging.
The report predicted that the United States would overtake Russia as the leading producer of natural gas in 2015.
The strong statements and specific predictions by the energy agency lend new weight to trends that have become increasingly apparent in the last year.
''This striking conclusion confirms a lot of recent projections,'' said Michael A. Levi, senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Formed in 1974 after the oil crisis by a group of oil-importing nations, including the United States, the International Energy Agency monitors and analyzes global energy trends to ensure a safe and sustainable supply.
Mr. Levi said that the agency's report was generally ''good news'' for the United States because it highlighted the nation's new sources of energy. But he cautioned that being self-sufficient did not mean that the country would be insulated from seesawing energy prices, since those oil prices are set by global markets.
''You may be somewhat less vulnerable to price shocks and the U.S. may be slightly more protected, but it doesn't give you the energy independence some people claim,'' he said.
Also, he noted, the agency's projection of United States self-sufficiency assumed that the country would improve gas mileage in cars and energy efficiency in homes and appliances. ''It's supply and demand together that adds up to this striking conclusion,'' Mr. Levi said.
Dr. Birol said the agency's prediction of increasing American self-sufficiency was 55 percent a reflection of more oil production and 45 percent a reflection of improving energy efficiency in the United States, primarily from the Obama administration's new fuel economy standards for cars. He added that even stronger policies to promote energy efficiency were needed in the United States and many other countries.
The report said that several other factors could also have a large impact on world energy markets over the next few years. These include the recovery of the Iraqi oil industry, which would lead to new supply, and the decision by some countries, notably Germany and Japan, to move away from nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster.
The new energy sources will help the United States economy, Dr. Birol said, providing continued cheap energy relative to the rest of the world. The energy agency estimates that electricity prices will be about 50 percent cheaper in the United States than in Europe, largely because of a rise in the number of power plants fueled by cheap natural gas, which would help American industries and consumers.
But the message is more sobering for the planet, in terms of climate change. Although natural gas is frequently promoted for being relatively low in carbon emissions compared to oil or coal, the new global energy market could make it harder to prevent dangerous levels of warming.
The United States' reduced reliance on coal will just mean that coal moves to other places, the report says. And the use of coal, now the dirtiest fuel, continues to rise elsewhere. China's coal demand will peak around 2020 and then stay steady until 2035, the report predicted, and in 2025, India will overtake the United States as the world's second-largest coal user.
The report warns that no more than one-third of the proved reserves of fossil fuels should be used by 2050 to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, as many scientists recommend.
Such restraint is unlikely without a binding international treaty by 2017 that requires countries to limit the growth of their emissions, Dr. Birol said. He added that pushing ahead with technologies that could capture and store carbon dioxide was also crucial.
''The report confirms that, given the current policies, we will blow past every safe target for emissions,'' Mr. Levi said. ''This should put to rest the idea that the boom in natural gas will save us from that.''

HEADLINE: Europe Delays Fees Meant to Cut Jets' Gases

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission said Monday that it would seek to delay a plan to charge foreign airlines for greenhouse gas emissions for one year, potentially removing one of the most contentious issues clouding trade relations with China, India and the United States.
The system, which requires airlines using an airport in Europe to obtain or buy permits corresponding to the amount of gases they emit, had generated intense opposition among foreign governments. They accused the European Union of violating their sovereignty and unfairly raising the costs paid by airlines from developing countries by imposing its environmental standards on the world. 
Europe had insisted the law was necessary because of a failure to control pollution from air traffic, which represents about 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and is growing much faster than efforts to cut them.
Connie Hedegaard, the E.U. climate commissioner, said she had asked the Union's 27 governments to ''stop the clock'' on the system for one year; the first payments under the program would have been due in April.
But she threatened to re-impose the rule if there was not sufficient progress in establishing a global system to cut the emissions.
''Let me be very clear: If this exercise does not deliver -- and I hope it does -- then needless to say we are back to where we are today,'' she said.
The International Air Transport Association, an industry group, and Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturer, welcomed the decision. But some environmental groups and analysts suggested that Ms. Hedegaard had capitulated too quickly.
Europe ''has moved further than necessary given the little progress made so far at I.C.A.O.,'' said Bill Hemmings, a program manager at Transport & Environment, an environmental organization. He was referring to the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations.
Ms. Hedegaard said her recommendation followed a meeting Friday at theI.C.A.O. at which member states decided to set up a policy group to agree on a global, market-based system for regulating airline emissions.
In reality, Ms. Hedegaard's decision was a long-awaited retreat by the Union in the face of concerted international opposition, including the refusal to participate in the system by China Eastern, Air India and other airlines, and efforts by U.S. lawmakers to prevent American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and others from making payments.
A number of governments had threatened to review bilateral and ''open skies'' agreements on landing rights, market access and other matters and stop considering new routes or capacity.
Airbus had warned that Chinese carriers had halted some aircraft orders to signal their dissatisfaction with the European law.
On Monday, Airbus said it was ''encouraged'' by Ms. Hedegaard's decision and said the talks at I.C.A.O. last week brought ''the aviation industry one step closer to a coordinated, globally acceptable approach to better manage civil aviation emissions.''
The re-election of President Barack Obama last week may have made Ms. Hedegaard's decision easier, because Mr. Obama is expected to help in the push for a global system.
The European emissions law was approved in 2008, and the system went into force on Jan. 1, 2012, requiring foreign airlines to comply with new registration and reporting procedures.
The system requires an airline landing or taking off in Europe to acquire permits corresponding to the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the entire flight -- regardless of where it originated or ended or the nationality of the airline.
Airlines faced fines of &#x20ac;100, or $127, for each excess ton of carbon dioxide emissions that they failed to offset by buying permits. Repeated breaches could have led to a ban from European airports.
The initial payments due on April 30, 2013, were expected to be modest. But airlines were furious because they could face big bills as the number of permits they needed to purchase was expected to rise in the coming years.
Airlines ''will look to sell these allowances back, quite possibly at a loss,'' said Andreas Arvanitakis, a director at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon. ''So much for early-mover advantage. It looks like it's the early worm that gets eaten by the bird.''
To halt the law, Ms. Hedegaard still must prepare additional legislation to modify the current rules. E.U. officials said they had already met with governments and with members of the European Parliament to ensure easy passage.
The decision means there will no longer be charges borne by airlines serving major international routes like Frankfurt-Beijing or London-New York next year. But the system would still apply within the Union for flights between airports within the bloc -- and some European carriers called on Monday for Ms. Hedegaard to exempt them, too.
The system ''will damage traffic, tourism, European competitiveness and jobs at a time when no other economic bloc is including aviation'' in their emissions control systems, said Stephen McNamara, a spokesman for Ryanair, a low-cost airline.
Charging airlines serving European routes for pollution while exempting the rest of the world ''is clearly an unsatisfactory situation in anything but the shortest term,'' said the Association of European Airlines, which includes British Airways, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.
The association warned that the I.C.A.O. was ''notoriously slow-moving,'' and it said countries including the United States, Russia, China and India -- which have said the I.C.A.O., rather than Europe, should deal with the issue of aviation emissions -- now ''have the chance to show that they mean it.''
Ms. Hedegaard said that would give the negotiators at the organization the chance to reach a global agreement by next September or October. But she warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean the European system would be applied in full again after 2013.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Designers Dip Into Klimt's Well

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
LONDON -- It is 150 years since the birth of Gustav Klimt, the creator of the gilded plaques, the russet richness and the jeweled mosaics that have entranced the world of decorative arts.
His legacy lies not only in the artist's paintings from his native Vienna, nor in the exceptional decoration of the modernist Stoclet Villa in Brussels, but also in fashion. Designers have been fascinated by the glint of Klimt's gilt, from John Galliano's couture embellishments for Dior in 2008 to Sarah Burton's metallic plaques in her new Alexander McQueen collections for 2013.
The book ''Gustav Klimt: The Complete Paintings,'' by Tobias G. Natter, published by Taschen, must surely be on every designer's holiday gift list. For each unfolding page -- with its strokeable surface of intense paint work and its meld of Byzantine imagery and Venetian mosaics -- brings to life the exotic eroticism of an exceptional artist. 
From its tactile cover of a close-up of the 1909 Tree of Life Stoclet Frieze, focusing on the bejeweled head of the ''dancing girl,'' through internal pages that unfold as triplets, the entire visual world of Klimt is displayed. Mr. Natter, director of the Leopold Museum in Vienna and a former curator of the Neue Galerie in New York, has written and edited the definitive masterwork on the Viennese artist.
But why, at a time of economic troubles, when excess is being forcibly rejected, should Klimt's ''Golden Phase'' of hyper-ornamentation be a touchstone in the fashion world?
Gilding -- as embroidery, mosaic pattern and surface sheen -- is such a theme of winter dressing that, even if not quite up to Klimt's gold leaf, it seems almost a defiance of a grim reality.
Perhaps it is the combination of geometry and intricacy, creating intense decoration on a flat plane, that chimes with the digital graphics in high fashion.
A sharply tailored man's suit with jacquard panels of gleaming metallic is Ms. Burton's way of bringing reality to the ritzy.
A similar mix of the streamlined and the decorative is built into the new McQueen men's wear store on Savile Row here. David Collins, the architect working with the designer, has produced hanging panels and a fireplace molded out of white plaster in organic shapes, inset with McQueen codes like skulls and horns.
''I have always loved the whole Klimt world, the overt embellishment, geometric and organic as well, with heads and bodies appearing out of flat surfaces,'' said Ms. Burton, whose inspirations on her London studio ''mood board'' include the noble ''Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer'' and the erotic body flow of ''The Kiss.'' The work was used as inspiration for both the men's wear and the women's early spring collection.
The designer said that a Klimt exhibition at the Tate Liverpool museum in 2008 first inspired her.
''And I am a big fan of Egon Schiele, Klimt's protg,'' Ms. Burton added, saying that she was never a minimalist but has been able to find in the Vienna Secession artist the concept of being able to abstract embellishment and use it as surface details.
Other designers, from Ferragamo through Dries Van Noten, have taken up the idea of gilded decoration on a black winter palette.
Dolce & Gabbana's autumn collection had intense golden embroideries, either on thick fabrics or delicate lace.
''The actual inspirations for the show were the gilded interiors of the Baroque churches in Palermo,'' says Stefano Gabbana. ''However, we do love Klimt. (Domenico is obsessed with him!) So maybe in a way he had something to do with the collection as well.''
The lace in the Dolce & Gabbana collection, used for clothing or delicate boots and shoes, has a story of its own. Its origins are from the same period as Klimt but in France, where British-made lace looms were installed in the northern town of Caudry at the end of the Victorian era.
Today, the name of Sophie Hallette lace is synonymous with haute couture creations -- like the wedding dress created for the Duchess of Cambridge by Ms. Burton for McQueen. The black and gold Dolce & Gabbana ''lace'' is, in fact, made of re-embroidered bobbinet tulle on traditional looms dating to late 18th-century technology. The extreme transparency of the woven and knitted tulle gives it the appropriate name: ''illusion.''
The message seems to be that intense decoration is not taboo in fashion. But it needs an artistic foundation to make it seem appropriate to a world that may be tough, but still relishes the soft touch of handwork.

HEADLINE: Chinese Oil Executive Learning From Experience

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- Holding court in a suite at the swank Dorchester Hotel here, Fu Chengyu, the chairman of Sinopec, the giant state oil and petrochemical company in China, enjoys talking about his business. Aides try to hurry him along, but he gives detailed, enthusiastic answers to questions.
During his career, Mr. Fu has helped lead the Chinese energy industry's efforts to modernize and internationalize. In recent years, China, which is a major importer of oil and natural gas, has been trying to lock up energy supplies overseas to feed its economy. 
Sometimes this drive led to bitter disappointments, most notably when political opposition in the United States forced him to give up his proposed acquisition of Unocal, a midsize U.S. oil company, in 2005. Still, Mr. Fu himself receives high marks from people who have met him.
''Fu Chengyu has long been the most entrepreneurial and strategic thinker of the Chinese N.O.C. leaders,'' David L. Goldwyn, a former state department international energy envoy, said, using the term for national oil companies. ''He has long sought to access both capital and technology through partnership, and unique among his peers, he sees partnership as a two-way street, and a long-term, rather than transitional, effort.''
Mr. Fu is in London to speak Tuesday at the Oil and Money Conference convened by the International Herald Tribune and Energy Intelligence Group, a provider of independent analysis and data to the global energy industry.
Mr. Fu appears to be a man who does not mince words and who learns from mistakes.
Mr. Fu says that the Unocal failure led him to rethink his foreign investment strategy. He says he now goes for partnerships in the United States, like one that the company has with Devon Energy, of Houston, for shale gas and oil rather than outright acquisitions.
''The investor must make the local people and government feel good,'' he said in English. ''Like it or not, good or bad. That is the way you have to take it.''
He said that Chinese oil companies still had ground to cover to make themselves better understood by investors, potential host countries and partners.
''I think Chinese companies have more work to do from this side, to become more transparent and more open,'' he said. ''I think we have become better but still there is a long way to go.''
The Unocal debacle, which occurred when Mr. Fu was running Cnooc, the government company charged with making international deals, looked like a career killer. But Mr. Fu survived and last year took over at Sinopec, another of the giant state companies that dominate the Chinese industry.
He said diplomatically that Sinopec, a much larger company, is ''more traditional in terms of management'' than Cnooc, whose mandate is to develop offshore oil and gas. One suspects that Mr. Fu is using diplomatic language for bureaucratic.
He said that the upside of Sinopec's needing a lot of work meant ''there is a great deal of potential to add value to the company.''
He said he was pleased that the company had outperformed the market recently.
Mr. Fu, who studied petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California, is intrigued by the shale gas and oil revolutions changing the U.S. energy picture.
China, too, has plenty of potential for a shale gas boom, he said. He brushed off the notion that Chinese companies lacked the necessary technology to develop shale gas. Sinopec, for instance has already drilled many shale gas wells.
The companies can always acquire technology from service companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton, ''as long as you have money,'' he said.
He conceded that the Chinese industry would require time to catch up with the United States. The next five years will be '' a studying phase,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With China and India Ravenous for Energy, Coal's Future Seems Assured

BYLINE: By PETER GALUSZKA

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- Last summer, nearly half of India's sweltering population suddenly found the electricity shut off. Air-conditioners whirred to a stop. Refrigerators ceased cooling. The culprits were outmoded power generation stations and a creaky electricity transmission grid.
But another problem stood out. India relies on coal for 55 percent of its electric power and struggles to keep enough on hand.
Coal remains a critical component of the world's energy supply despite its bad image. In China, demand for coal in 2010 resulted in a traffic jam 75 miles long caused by more than 10,000 trucks carrying supplies from Inner Mongolia. India is increasing coal imports.
So is Europe, as it takes advantage of lower coal prices in the United States. Higher-priced natural gas on the Continent is creating demand for more coal imports from the United States, where coal is taking a drubbing from less expensive natural gas. 
Coal may seem an odd contender in a world where promising renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power are attracting attention. Anathema to environmentalists because it creates so much pollution, coal still has the undeniable advantages of being widely available and easy to ship and burn.
The biggest attraction, however, is low cost. By many estimates, including that of Li Junfeng, longtime director general of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, burning coal still costs about one-third as much as using renewable energy like wind or solar.
Coal is not subject to the vagaries of windless or sunless days, and can easily meet base-load demands of electricity consumers without interruption. So can nuclear power, but the nuclear industry is still reeling from the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan. Countries like Germany have turned away from nuclear reactors.
Global demand for coal is expected to grow to 8.9 billion tons by 2016 from 7.9 billion tons this year, with the bulk of new demand -- about 700 million tons -- coming from China, according to a Peabody Energy study. China is expected to add 240 gigawatts, the equivalent of adding about 160 new coal-fired plants to the 620 operating now, within four years. During that period, India will add an additional 70 gigawatts through more than 46 plants.
''If you poke your head outside of the U.S., coal-fired plants are being built left and right,'' said William L. Burns, an energy analyst with Johnson Rice in New Orleans. ''Coal is still the cheapest fuel source.''
Besides strong demand for thermal coal, which is burned in power plants, use of metallurgical coal or coking coal, used in blast furnaces, is also expected to more than double in China, to about 1.7 billion metric tons by 2016, as the country's steel mills churn out more steel for automobiles, skyscrapers and export goods, the Peabody study says.
Coking coal will be increasingly in demand in other steel centers like Brazil and India, pushing coal companies to scrounge for new reserves in places like Botswana, Mongolia and Mozambique.
In all, coal use is expected to increase 50 percent by 2035, said Milton Catelin, chief executive of the World Coal Association in London.
''Last year, coal represented 30 percent of world energy, and that's the highest share it has had since 1969,'' he said.
Within a year or two, coal will surpass oil as the planet's primary fuel, Mr. Catelin predicted.
For now, coal seems to be sidestepping a serious potential impediment to its use: international accords restricting greenhouse gas emissions. So far, such agreements to prevent climate change have been ineffective.
China plans to put carbon emission reducing equipment on new plants. But China and other big coal producers still have a long way to go in matters like mine safety. On average, about 2,500 Chinese coal miners die in accidents every year.
On Aug. 29, for instance, a blast at the Xiaojiawan mine in Sichuan Province killed more than 40 miners. Officials blamed lax safety and overcrowding in the shafts.
Industry officials insist that safety will improve as large Chinese coal companies like the Shenhua Group buy out smaller mines, and new technologies develop that can detect dangerous methane gas and automatically shut down mines.
Nowhere are the controversies surrounding coal more pronounced than in the United States. Coal became an important issue in the presidential campaign, with the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, accusing President Barack Obama of being anti-coal.
The American coal industry says Mr. Obama is waging a ''war on coal'' in response to his proposed regulation of air pollution and surface mining in mountain areas.
There has been a downturn in United States coal production this year, but that has been more the result of market economics than politics. A flood of natural gas from new sources is displacing high-cost coal in some areas.
Industry analysts expect the lull to be short-lived. They are looking for new sources of coal, notably coking coal. Shenhua Energy of China and Peabody Energy, plus a mix of Japanese, Russian and South Korean companies, are the lead bidders to develop the Tavan Tolgoi deposit in Mongolia.
Big export plans are under way in Colombia and South Africa. The Abhijeet Group of India has a new $7 billion contract for steam coal from Kentucky and West Virginia.
Expansion plans face challenges. In Mongolia, the deposits are in remote areas requiring new roads and rail lines in extreme climate conditions. While South Africa has one of the world's largest export facilities, it is prone to labor unrest.
Australia is the world's largest coal exporter, but new regulations could increase its prices, said Jimmy Brock, chief operating officer for Consol Energy, which is based in Pittsburgh.
Australian regulators worry that the Great Barrier Reef might be damaged as ships pass by. Its ports are also subject to damage from storms and floods, affecting the shipping of coking coal and prices worldwide. In 2011, for example, ports in Queensland were closed because of Cyclone Yasi.
American coal companies badly want to export coal from the country's most productive mines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana, but there is no way to send the coal out.
''We have no export capacity in the West,'' said Philip J. Cavatoni, chief strategy officer of Alpha Natural Resources, based in Virginia.
Plans to ship coal 1,500 miles by rail to five planned new ports in the Pacific Northwest and Canada face intense environmental opposition.
''The trains are noisy and will let off a lot of coal dust,'' said Eric de Place, senior researcher with the Sightline Institute, a public policy research group headquartered in Seattle.
Still, in the longer term coal's future depends on China and India, and its prospects look bright -- mainly because it is cheaper than its competitors.

HEADLINE: Making an Energy Boom Work for U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID L. GOLDWYN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The rapid rise in output of natural gas and, more recently, oil in the United States is transforming the country's energy and economic landscape.
These production booms are revolutionary, but not in the way that many people think. Experts, for instance, argue that an increase in North American energy self-sufficiency will lead to equally drastic changes in geopolitics.
Suddenly having a great wealth of domestically produced gas and, increasingly, oil, the argument follows, will allow the United States to look inward and take less interest in international affairs, including those of the politically challenging countries that produce oil and natural gas in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere.
This is unlikely to happen. Despite more production from shale deposits like the Bakken in North Dakota, oil's share of total U.S. energy demand is expected to decrease only to 32 percent from 37 percent by 2035. Natural gas will increase its share to 26 percent from 25 percent and renewables will grow to 11 percent from 7 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The most strategic factor in American consumption will remain the price of oil and the effect of disruptions on the U.S. and the global economy, not the source or quantity of U.S. imports.
The boom will have many economic benefits. The U.S. balance of trade will improve and producing states will enjoy job growth and revenues. The United States will also grow as a refining center, producing the clean diesel-based fuels of the present and future for both consumption at home and export to Europe and the Western Hemisphere.
The United States will also see a spurt of infrastructure building as the country builds the pipelines and rail lines to move energy from West to East and from North to South. U.S. oil supplies will now be physically more secure, with weatherproof pipelines from Canada and the northern states.
In another big change, the United States will have much greater ability to make up for any import disruption through the country's strategic reserves of oil.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which stores oil in salt caverns, currently has 80 days of import cover. But if U.S. imports fell to 6 million barrels a day from 8.7 million barrels a day now, the S.P.R. would have 116 days of cover.
The reduced U.S. dependence on crude imports does not mean an end to history. The issues of price volatility, diversity of supply and helping U.S. friends and allies to be free from monopolistic pricing or coercive supply arrangements will remain as vital 20 years from now as they are today.
Reduced oil imports would not provide immunity from supply disruptions. Indeed, as has been seen since the advent of the Arab Spring political upheaval, the effects of useful increases in U.S. production can be overwhelmed by disruptions in producing countries.
Prices are set globally. In 2011 the Libyan uprising caused a swift disruption in supply. The lack of much excess capacity to make up for more outages led to prices that further restrained already weak economic growth in the United States and Europe.
Saudi Arabia ramped up production, and the International Energy Agency, based in Paris, and the United States agreed on an emergency release of strategic reserves.
This year, Iran's oil exports have declined by almost one million barrels a day, the result of surprisingly effective financial sanctions and the effects of an impending European Union embargo.
But unprecedented -- and essential -- political cohesion to counter the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program came at a price. Reduced Iranian exports and other outages pushed Brent crude prices to around $120 a barrel and U.S. gasoline prices close to $4 a gallon.
To help countries, mostly in Asia, that had been large customers for Iranian oil, Saudi Arabia both increased production and reportedly provided discounts on oil sales. Iraq and Libya revived their production. Washington hinted at another release of S.P.R. crude to discourage speculation in the markets.
The fact that U.S. production rose 3.1 percent in 2011 from a year earlier, with an expected increase this year of 10.7 percent, was immaterial to managing these disruptions.
As long as spare capacity, the world's buffer against outages, is thin and supply disruptions can harm economies or allow countries to use oil as a weapon, oil will remain strategic.
Throughout history, the United States has focused high-level diplomatic attention to ensure that there are diverse sources of fuel -- even far from our shores.
Washington has had special envoys for Caspian Basin diplomacy for 14 years without importing a drop of oil or a whiff of gas from the region, because the autonomy of those countries and a Europe with freedom of choice of suppliers are strategic foreign policy interests.
Likewise, the stability of Nigeria and its neighbors matters for reasons that go well beyond protecting U.S. investments there, or the 800,000 barrels a day of Nigerian oil imported to the United States. Nigeria's stability and prosperity affect the whole of West Africa and so is vital for the United States.
There are many examples of U.S. foreign policy interests being intertwined with oil. The evolution of Iraq's oil industry and the completion of the pipelines and terminals needed to export it are essential to the country's economic recovery and territorial integrity.
Overhauls of Mexico's long-troubled oil industry, now supported by two of its three major political parties, could be critical to its prosperity as a trade partner and its ability to foster growth and reduce the possibility of an insurgency on the U.S. borders
Most forecasters, as well as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, agree that the world will be using more oil in 2035 than it does today. So we will still live in a world where the price of oil matters. Oil will remain the dominant source of transportation fuel, remaining strategic for the global economy.
Next time won't be different. The boom and bust cycle of oil prices will not be abolished. Spare capacity -- the amount of additional oil that could be produced if needed -- will probably continue to be a small fraction of total supply. The more modest global buffer stocks are, the greater the market's anxiety over potential disruptions.
While China and India are considering increasing their own strategic reserves, the overall built-in cushion of supply around the world will probably remain thin. A single outage -- from a country like Iran, Nigeria or Venezuela, or a nation that fails to meet hoped-for production targets, perhaps Brazil or Iraq -- would push oil back onto the front page.
This means the United States will still care deeply about keeping sea lanes open for all forms of trade and about diversity of global energy supply. Washington will also want to encourage access to new exploration areas to ensure investment can produce the supply to meet growing demand.
The United States will still care about the fate of Arab societies, the stability of West Africa and the stable evolution of new producers in East Africa, the evolution of Venezuela and the need for multiple oil and gas pipelines to Europe to produce competitive prices there.
The oil boom will, or at least should, lead to changes in U.S. policy. The approach to strategic reserves and to the engagement of current and future producers should change.
With declining imports, the U.S. government will be in a position to respond more forcefully to supply disruptions by providing the global market with real barrels of oil. It will be able to respond more effectively if policy evolves to allow easier exports of S.P.R. oil through a market-savvy decision-making process.
It should assist others who want to develop their own resources -- as the United States has through the shale gas and tight oil booms -- by helping their governments put in place the fiscal, environmental and safety regimes necessary to facilitate the growth of robust domestic markets.
More production will help keep prices moderate and diversify supply.
Investors may not welcome moderate oil prices. But from a foreign policy perspective, increasing competition and reducing government take from oil is still the best way to constrain the worst tendencies of petro states.
U.S. self-sufficiency in natural gas has been a domestic bonanza. The country's balance of trade has improved, gas is now competitive in price with coal, and despite the absence of a carbon price or cap, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in the first quarter of 2012 fell to levels not seen since 1992, in large part due to the decline in coal-fired electricity generation as utilities substituted gas for coal.
Less costly gas is also reviving the U.S. petrochemicals industry at the expense of its European and other competitors.
If the United States becomes confident that the new supply is real and starts allowing exports of liquefied natural gas, it could help break the oil/gas price linkage that keeps gas prices high in Asia, which would help those countries thrive.
Asian L.N.G. prices remain stubbornly higher than European or U.S. prices, based on the premium governments in the region place on security of supply and the dominance of state-owned utilities as buyers.
U.S. L.N.G. exports could help provide competitively priced supplies that could be a major source of economic relief to the struggling Japanese and Indian economies, and help sustain the growth of China, Korea and Taiwan.
Such U.S. exports to the Western Hemisphere could help reduce Caribbean dependence on subsidized and high-carbon fuel oil supplies.
And L.N.G. sales to Europe could further erode that oil price linkage and give relief to a struggling euro zone.
If the technology and project management deployed in the Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford shales can be even partially replicated in Eastern Europe, China and India, the world could see faster greenhouse gas reduction -- through substituting gas for coal -- at lower cost than any mechanism envisioned by our climate negotiators.
The big winners could be the new potential exporters -- the United States, Canada and even Poland. Countries now heavily dependent on Russian gas -- Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Ukraine -- might also benefit.
The big losers could be the current exporters at high prices -- Russia and Qatar -- as well as those who want to join that club -- Iran and Venezuela. Lower prices, lower emissions, greater diversification, more competitive pricing. It's a diplomatic royal flush.
Here again, the path to this potentially happy potential outcome lies in more engagement, not less, on investment climate, intellectual property protection and environmental best practices.
Within United States the debate must focus on whether the U.S. government will trust the market that brought these riches to also be the best mechanism to work out how to supply the domestic market and exports at the same time.
The U.S. and North American oil and gas booms are phenomenal economic windfalls. But security always trumps economics in U.S. foreign policy. The country's commitment to global security and its vulnerability to global oil prices will keep Washington engaged for the foreseeable future.
David L. Goldwyn, a former U.S. State Department special envoy for international energy and assistant secretary of energy, is president of Goldwyn Global Strategies.

HEADLINE: Japanese Firms Try a New Hiring Strategies

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA

 BODY:
TOKYO -- There are plenty of major Japanese companies that can offer decent pay, benefits and job security. But when it comes to attracting top young international talent, Japanese employers are aware that the tide is against them. This is especially true in the high-tech world where Japan is no longer considered to be on the cutting edge of cool.
''The appeal of working for a Japanese company is diminishing,'' said Ryuichi Yoshinaga, president of Pasona Tech , an employment agency that specializes in information technology personnel and conducts job fairs in Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian, China, for Japanese recruiters.
The new reality -- in which China's economy is now larger than Japan's -- has changed perspectives, he said. ''Leading Japanese technology firms are struggling'' to recruit young workers there, Mr. Yoshinaga said. 
''It used to be that Japanese companies were next to Western firms in popularity,'' he added. As for young Chinese graduates, ''many of them believe they might have a good career perspective by staying put in China.''
Politics has also gotten in the way of cross-border hiring. As tensions grew over disputed islands in the East China Sea, Japanese employers had to cut back on recruiting activities this year, especially in Beijing.
''Chinese universities are asking us not to hold recruiting events on campus for safety reasons,'' said a spokeswoman at a Japanese company who asked to remain anonymous because of the political sensitivity of the issue. In northeastern cities like Dalian, which traditionally has friendlier attitudes toward Japan, hiring can be done, but only discreetly. ''Over all, recruitment activities by Japanese firms might have fallen by more than half this year in China,'' she said.
Some Japanese recruiters say that the risks in China have prompted them to do more recruiting in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
Foreign job seekers face several hurdles in Japan. They might be expected to master the Japanese language and go through the arduous process of learning the Japanese way of professional life. A globe-trotting, job-hopping young American, Chinese or European new graduate might not want to invest the time and energy. Plus, traditional employers may not give new recruits much responsibility. The mentality in Japan is that new workers can learn the ropes over time, and young hires are often not given jobs that match their specializations.
But securing high-caliber talent from abroad is crucial for Japanese companies, especially since their home market is shrinking. They need to reach overseas, human resources managers at Japanese corporations say.
Relatively young I.T. firms are now rethinking the conventional Japanese way of recruiting and training, trying new tactics instead: They are actively seeking employees overseas, using more English in the workplace, giving young workers more responsibility, and even acquiring top talent through takeovers and mergers with foreign companies.
Rakuten , which operates Japan's largest Internet shopping mall, has been expanding its geographic reach overseas by buying online retail companies like Buy.com from the United States, Tradoria from Germany and PriceMinister from France. It has also decided to embrace English as its official language to foster better communication among its global units and increase organizational visibility for non-Japanese workers.
''If you don't have full-scale policy regarding language, non-Japanese workers might feel excluded,'' said Masayoshi Higuchi, vice department manager of global human resources at Rakuten. Mr. Higuchi said that in the last two years, when their new language policy was announced and instituted in a phased manner, there was an increase in the number of international employees.
This year, 70 out of 100 new hires in the engineering department were non-Japanese. In 2010, about 4 percent of the staff members at the parent company were foreign; that doubled to 8 percent in 2012.
''The language policy has had a significant impact'' on our ability to conduct recruitment, he said.
Avinash Varma, 23, a graduate of the University of Mumbai, is one such promising employee who joined Rakuten in 2011.
He felt that Rakuten would be a good place to develop his career as a software engineer because, ''I can obtain domain knowledge specifically of Internet shopping,'' he said.
In India, the software engineering field is focused on outsourcing, he said. Although he had no prior knowledge of the Japanese language, he had no qualms about working for Rakuten, because the majority of staff in his department were international, including his American department manager.
Filling the managerial ranks with members of the international staff was also a significant move for Rakuten, ''since that enables younger staff to visualize their career path,'' said Mr. Higuchi of the global resources department.
In the past year, Mr. Varma has been involved in introducing Rakuten's new online shopping malls in mainland China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. ''As a software engineer, it has been a great experience,'' he said.
Kazuaki Mihara, human resources manager at DeNA , a leading provider of mobile-based social networking games, is aware of the problems that have confounded Japanese human resources managers looking to recruit from overseas.
''It is a question of how you go about doing it,'' he said. ''We are proactive in communicating what our company is all about. We are at the cutting edge of mobile gaming technology, and we are recognized as a leading player in this space overseas.''
Besides, DeNA does not have the strict hierarchy of a traditional Japanese company. ''It's an organization in which it is not the weight of your position that counts but the weight of what you say that counts,'' Mr. Mihara said.
This past April, 100 new employees, 20 of whom were non-Japanese, joined the company fresh from university.
Justin Sharps, 24, a recent graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of them. He joined DeNA last autumn and, after some language training, was assigned to an active engineering task within a month.
''One of the things that I liked was that they gave new engineers a push straight out the door,'' he said. ''I was writing production code a month after joining, which was a great opportunity.''
He said that the company's culture focused on tasks, which allowed young people to ''emerge with a strong set of engineering skills that you almost couldn't get anywhere else.''
''I am given a quite lot of responsibility, even in areas that I have not studied,'' he added.
At DeNA, Mr. Sharps is developing gaming platforms from which to launch mobile social networking games. The company's Mobage gaming social network service has 40 million registered users, which helped DeNA make 145 billion, or $1.8 billion, in revenue for the fiscal year that ended in March.
I.T. firms like Rakuten and DeNA are no longer following the traditional belief that new hires should be given a reprieve to prove themselves.
''Japanese companies' approach has been to hire a whole bunch and then train them collectively,'' without regard to individual skill levels, said Mr. Higuchi of Rakuten's global human resources department. ''And then the company decides which department to allocate them to later.''
This one-size-fits-all approach no longer works in companies like Rakuten. ''We need to hire globally competitive engineers from around the world,'' Mr. Higuchi said. ''Graduates from overseas universities like China are often better trained in their fields,'' he added. ''Japanese universities don't provide practical training to students.''
Other strategies adopted by Japanese companies include using mergers and acquisitions as a way to obtain high-quality personnel. Since 2005, NTT Data, a leading systems integration firm, has been buying up Western companies like Keane, a $1 billion U.S. American I.T. service provider, and Value Team, an Italian systems integrator. The group's work force rose from 27,000 to 57,000 in the process.
NTT Data's human resources senior manager, Ichiro Tanaka, said that his company needed partners overseas to service their multinational clients. But a deeper reason may be to obtain human talent, he noted, since recruiting from Tokyo may not be enough.
''Our company name is not known overseas,'' he said. ''But our local partners have a solid and sustained system of corporate recruitment.''
In 2007, NTT Data acquired a majority stake in Vertex Software, an Indian company. It now hires 4,000 new employees each for in India alone for the group, mobilizing its 150 strong team of recruiters for India. ''That's something the parent company cannot do. You have to be a locally established company to do that,'' Mr. Tanaka said.

HEADLINE: Flood Insurance, Already Fragile, Faces New Stress

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON, FELICITY BARRINGER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Eric Lipton reported from Washington, Felicity Barringer from San Francisco, and Mary Williams Walsh from Philadelphia. Jon Hurdle contributed reporting from Tuckerton, N.J.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government's flood insurance program, which fell $18 billion into debt after Hurricane Katrina, is once again at risk of running out of money as the daunting reconstruction from Hurricane Sandy gets under way.
Early estimates suggest that Hurricane Sandy will rank as the nation's second-worst storm for claims paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program. With 115,000 new claims submitted and thousands more being filed each day, the cost could reach $7 billion at a time when the program is allowed, by law, to add only an additional $3 billion to its onerous debt.
Congress, just this summer, overhauled the flawed program by allowing large increases in premiums paid by vacation home owners and those repeatedly hit by floods. But critics say taxpayer money should not be used to bail it out again -- essentially subsidizing the rebuilding of homes in risky areas -- without Congress' mandating even more radical changes.
''We are now just throwing money to support something that is going to end up creating more victims and costing more money in the future,'' Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, said of the program, which insures 5.7 million homes nationwide near coasts or flood-prone rivers. 
Even with the new rules, critics argue, it will be many years, if ever, before many homeowners are required to pay premiums that accurately reflect the market cost of the coverage. Some communities have long resisted imposing more appropriate building codes to prevent damage, putting the program at further risk of devastating losses when storms like Hurricane Sandy hit. And despite some efforts in recent years, many of the flood maps the program relies on are out of date -- which can have expensive, and even deadly, consequences in this era of rising sea levels if homeowners are not cognizant of the risks they face.
The program's giant debt makes matters worse because simply covering the interest owed the Treasury consumes from $90 million to $750 million a year, depending on interest rates. This means it is much harder to build reserves for future catastrophes.
But others on Capitol Hill argue that the changes adopted in July are an important first step, and that Congress must give the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the program, a chance to apply them before any additional changes are considered.
Already, 44 members of the House of Representatives have called for Congress to appropriate whatever money is needed to help victims recover from Hurricane Sandy, and aides on Capitol Hill say that under such extreme losses, they expect lawmakers will do what they have to do to keep the program solvent -- even amid a federal budget crisis.
''It is a program we require people to participate in, so we have to make sure it is adequately funded to handle claims,'' said Representative Timothy H. Bishop, Democrat of New York, whose district in Long Island has more than 100 miles of coastline. ''You can't say: 'Awfully sorry. Hope this works out for you.' ''
The federal government's flood insurance program, established in 1968, is one of the world's largest. The insurance is mandatory for homeowners with a federally backed mortgage if they live in an area subject to flooding at least once every 100 years. The average annual flood insurance premium is about $615, but for homeowners in areas at higher risk of flooding, an annual policy can cost from $1,200 to $3,000, according to Steve Harty, president of National Flood Services, a claims-processing company, depending on the level of coverage.
The federal program collects about $3.5 billion in annual premiums. But in four of the past eight years, claims will have eclipsed premiums, most glaringly in 2005 -- the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma -- when claims totaled $17.7 billion. Private insurance companies have long avoided offering flood insurance to homeowners.
''It's like rat poison to them,'' said Tony Bullock, an insurance industry lobbyist, explaining how the risk outweighs the benefit for private insurers. ''You need the federal backstop.''
But the program is still a moneymaker for the private insurance industry. Even though these companies bear none of the risk, they take, on average, $1 billion a year of the premiums the government collects, as compensation for help in selling and servicing the policies. Federal auditors argue the payments are excessive.
FEMA officials declined to address whether changes beyond the already passed legislation are needed to strengthen the program.
''These reforms are being implemented,'' the agency said in a written statement. ''Right now, we're focused on helping survivors.''
More than one million property owners who live in homes at least four decades old also have historically paid only about 40 percent of the estimated true cost of the coverage the government provides -- in large part because of lobbying by the real estate industry, mortgage brokers, homeowners associations and other groups to keep federal authorities from charging more.
Perhaps the most troubling problem, program officials acknowledge, is that only a tiny share of enrolled properties accounts for a giant share of the overall claims, as the properties are repeatedly flooded and rebuilt in low coastal regions and in hurricane flight paths.
One Biloxi, Miss., property valued at $183,000 flooded 15 times over a decade, costing the program $1.47 million, according to federal data provided by the agency to a member of Congress. Another in Humble, Tex., has resulted in over $2 million in flood payouts even though it was worth just $116,000.
An analysis of two decades of claims by the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania shows that certain states, like Texas, which has the second-largest number of policies, pay much less in insurance premiums than the homeowners there collect in damage claims, evidence of the inherent inequity in the national program.
The problem of repetitive claims is much less prevalent in coastal New York and New Jersey, where FEMA estimates Hurricane Sandy flooded 100,000 insured homes.
But homeowners in those two states have fought measures that would reduce storm damage. Barrier island communities in the Northeast, for example, have resisted overtures from the Army Corps of Engineers to build sand dunes as a natural flood barrier, arguing that the dunes would block ocean views or harm the local tourism industry.
Other communities, like Tuckerton, N.J., have failed to take steps recommended by FEMA to better protect homes after flooding through a program that pushes owners to elevate new homes above minimum required heights or to move flood-prone buildings.
Hurricane Sandy damaged more than 300 of the 660 houses in Tuckerton's beach area, including 22 that were washed away, according to Phil Reed, the town building inspector.
Fifteen years ago, Don Horneff, 74, had his Tuckerton house raised on pilings nine feet above ground level. As a result, he said, Hurricane Sandy's floodwaters ran only through his basement.
That is the kind of protective measure that federal officials want mandated into all new or rebuilt homes in flood zones.
Last week, piles of mattresses, fencing, chairs, appliances and other debris sat outside many of the homes on Mr. Horneff's street -- and a backhoe worked to clear the mess. ''All around me, the homes that were lower, most of them will have to be demolished,'' he said, surveying his neighborhood. ''It's very sad. They have lost everything.''
The pending costs for Hurricane Sandy would have been even higher if a greater share of residents along the East Coast had signed up for the insurance, which is voluntary outside the 100-year-flood zones. There would also have been more premium dollars, though not enough to pay the claims.
The fact that many homeowners hit by Hurricane Sandy have no flood or homeowners insurance could prompt Congress to provide assistance to the uninsured, too, as happened after Hurricane Katrina, further raising the cost to the federal Treasury.
Officials in New Jersey and New York say the federal government must move quickly to put the flood insurance program back on stable footing, even if it means increasing the federal deficit.
''All we want in our community -- not any more and absolutely not less -- is what is due to Sea Isle,'' said Leonard C. Desiderio, the mayor of Sea Isle City, N.J., one of the coastal towns hit hard by Hurricane Sandy.
Hurricane Katrina put the program so deeply into debt that federal officials have acknowledged they will never be able to fully repay the $18 billion Treasury-financed loan that bailed the program out.
FEMA, as a result of this year's legislation, has the authority to raise premiums by as much as 25 percent per year over the next five years. The increases will be imposed mostly on vacation homes and other properties that repeatedly flood, but whose owners have paid far below market insurance rates. The legislation also authorizes the creation of a national reserve fund to help the program handle major flood catastrophes, and urges Congress to appropriate $400 million a year to update the thousands of out-of-date flood control maps. That would likely force new homes to be built elevated off the ground in spots where rising sea levels or recent major storms have had an impact.
Lawmakers who pushed the legislation call it major progress in fixing the program's well-documented failings.
''The program is on a much more responsible path than it had been just one year ago,'' said Zachary Cikanek, a spokesman for Representative Judy Biggert, Republican of Illinois, who co-sponsored the legislation.
But others say much more needs to be done. The federal government should ensure continuous coverage in flood-prone areas, spreading the risk among a larger pool of homeowners, who now often allow their coverage to lapse, said Robert Hunter, an insurance administrator in the Ford and Carter administrations.
The 20,000 communities that participate should also be adopting stronger building or flood prevention codes the way Florida has since Hurricane Andrew did $23 billion worth of damage in 1992. Mr. Hunter pointed to earthquake-prone Chile, where builders must assume the liability for catastrophic earthquake damage for 10 years after construction. ''This program still encourages unwise construction instead of discouraging it, and to me that means the program has failed, even with the reforms Congress just adopted,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''People are being killed and their properties are being destroyed because of a government that gives the false impression that there is less of a flood risk than there really is.''

HEADLINE: Labor Leaders Have Obama's Back, and Are Ready to Help

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Having helped President Obama win re-election, labor leaders will meet with him on Tuesday and intend to offer their robust support for what they view as his mandate: stand tough against cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and keep pushing to raise taxes on the wealthy.
Organized labor's emphasis on broader policy, rather than union-specific legislation, is somewhat of a change from 2008, when leaders pushed for bills that would make it easier to organize workplaces. 
As the administration begins talks with Congressional Republicans to modify a range of tax increases and budget cuts scheduled to go into effect next year, the unions say they will rally their forces on a broader agenda, seeking to counter business and conservative groups that are pushing for cuts in social programs and tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals.
''We expect to have the president's back on the agenda that the voters just declared support for,'' said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which spent $75 million in backing Mr. Obama and various Democrats this year. ''The president has always said he needs a movement behind his mandate.''
Mr. Obama has talked of going beyond the Beltway to stir up support for his plans, including increasing taxes on households with incomes of more than $250,000. Union leaders have made clear that they are happy to turn out the troops to -- in a tactic from the Franklin D. Roosevelt era -- ''make him do it.'' Union members held rallies in 100 communities last Thursday as a first step in promoting the president's budget plan.
Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative director, said, ''We agree with the president that tax rates for the wealthiest 2 percent need to go up to provide revenues to invest in jobs, education, infrastructure and training.''
When Mr. Obama was first elected, labor pushed for the stimulus bill and health care legislation, but also sought a host of more specific bills, such as the so-called card check bill, which are no longer on the top of their agenda. Card check would make it easier to unionize workers by allowing a union to win recognition by persuading a majority of a workplace's employees to sign cards saying they favor unionization instead of having to go through an often-lengthy campaign and secret ballot election.
Card check was blocked by Republicans in Congress, and with that party controlling the House of Representatives, it seems unlikely to return as an issue this year.
''When you look at how close the election returns were, the president did benefit substantially from organized labor,'' said Charles B. Craver, a labor law expert at George Washington University. ''The question now is, will he do anything, can he do anything for labor? If he tries, the Republicans will block it.''
After Mr. Obama's first victory, the International Association of Firefighters pushed Congress to enact a bill that would grant firefighters and police officers the right to bargain collectively in all 50 states. But that effort fizzled.
''We have to shift our strategy until we see the realistic opportunities of a 60-vote majority in the Senate or a change in the rules,'' said Harold Schaitberger, the firefighters' president.
Union leaders say Mr. Obama needs to pursue strategies to reduce income inequality, and some support a bill to raise the minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, to $9.80 after two years.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the service employees also back immigration reform, sharing that goal with business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
''We think getting 11 million workers out of the shadows and allowing them the same rights as other workers will be real important to improve their lives and incomes,'' Ms. Henry said.
Union officials would still love to somehow enact card check, but they are also brainstorming other less ambitious bills that promote unionization, which they say is crucial to expanding the middle class.
Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor issues of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he does not see much chance of Congress passing bills aimed at easing unionization. And he said that union-backed measures to raise the minimum wage or make it easier to unionize would hurt Mr. Obama's hopes of creating jobs.
Mr. Johnson voiced fears that Mr. Obama would name more pro-union officials to the National Labor Relations Board and might push forward with some languishing proposals, including one that would give preference to companies in winning federal contracts if they pay higher wages and have not violated labor laws.
Chamber officials also fear that organized labor will seek to block a trans-Pacific trade agreement the administration is working on.
Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, the nation's largest union, which worked hard for Mr. Obama, said he was confident the administration would focus less on shaking up public high schools and elementary schools -- a move that angered the teachers' unions -- and more on increasing access to early education and making college more affordable.

HEADLINE: In Spielberg's 'Lincoln,' Passive Black Characters

BYLINE: By KATE MASUR. 
Kate Masur, an associate professor of history at Northwestern, is the author of ''An Example for All the Land: Emancipation and the Struggle Over Equality in Washington, D.C.''

 BODY:
Evanston, Ill.
THE latest film by Steven Spielberg, ''Lincoln,'' which opens nationwide on Friday, has the makings of an Oscar shoo-in, particularly for Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in the title role. The first scene is arresting: Two black soldiers speak with the president about their experiences in combat. One, a corporal, raises the problem of unequal promotions and pay in the Union Army. Two white soldiers join them, and the scene concludes as the corporal walks away, movingly reciting the final lines of the Gettysburg Address.
Unfortunately it is all downhill from there, at least as far as black characters are concerned. As a historian who watched the film on Saturday night in Chicago, I was not surprised to find that Mr. Spielberg took liberties with the historical record. As in ''Schindler's List'' and ''Saving Private Ryan,'' his purpose is more to entertain and inspire than to educate. 
But it's disappointing that in a movie devoted to explaining the abolition of slavery in the United States, African-American characters do almost nothing but passively wait for white men to liberate them. For some 30 years, historians have been demonstrating that slaves were crucial agents in their emancipation; however imperfectly, Ken Burns's 1990 documentary ''The Civil War'' brought aspects of that interpretation to the American public. Yet Mr. Spielberg's ''Lincoln'' gives us only faithful servants, patiently waiting for the day of Jubilee.
This is not mere nit-picking. Mr. Spielberg's ''Lincoln'' helps perpetuate the notion that African Americans have offered little of substance to their own liberation. While the film largely avoids the noxious stereotypes of subservient African-Americans for which movies like ''Gone With the Wind'' have become notorious, it reinforces, even if inadvertently, the outdated assumption that white men are the primary movers of history and the main sources of social progress.
The nation's capital was transformed by the migration of fugitive slaves from the South during the war, but you'd never know it from this film. By 1865 -- Mr. Spielberg's film takes place from January to April -- these fugitives had transformed Washington's streets, markets and neighborhoods. Had the filmmakers cared to portray African-Americans as meaningful actors in the drama of emancipation, they might have shown Lincoln interacting with black passers-by in the District of Columbia.
Black oral tradition held that Lincoln visited at least one of the capital's government-run ''contraband camps,'' where many of the fugitives lived, and was moved by the singing and prayer he witnessed there. One of the president's assistants, William O. Stoddard, remembered Lincoln stopping to shake hands with a black woman he encountered on the street near the White House.
In fact, the capital was also home to an organized and highly politicized community of free African-Americans, in which the White House servants Elizabeth Keckley and William Slade were leaders. Keckley, who published a memoir in 1868, organized other black women to raise money and donations of clothing and food for the fugitives who'd sought refuge in Washington. Slade was a leader in the Social, Civil and Statistical Association, a black organization that tried to advance arguments for freedom and civil rights by collecting data on black economic and social successes.
The film conveys none of this, opting instead for generic, archetypal characters. Keckley (played by Gloria Reuben) is frequently seen sitting with the first lady, Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Sally Field), in the balcony of the House of Representatives, silently serving as a moral beacon for any legislator who looks her way. Arguably her most significant scene is an awkward dialogue with Lincoln in which he says bluntly, ''I don't know you,'' meaning not just her but all black people. Keckley replies, as a representative of her race, that she has no idea what her people will do once freed. As if one archetype were not enough, she adds that her son has died for the Union cause, making her grief the grief of all bereaved mothers.
Meanwhile, Slade (Stephen Henderson) is portrayed as an avuncular butler, a black servant out of central casting, who watches in prescient sorrow as his beloved boss departs for the theater on a fateful April evening.
It would not have been much of a stretch -- particularly given other liberties taken by the filmmakers -- to do things differently. Keckley and Slade might have been shown leaving the White House to attend their own meetings, for example. Keckley could have discussed with Mrs. Lincoln the relief work that, in reality, she organized and the first lady contributed to. Slade could have talked with Lincoln about the 13th Amendment. Indeed, his daughter later recalled that Lincoln had confided in Slade, particularly on the nights when he suffered from insomnia.
Even more unsettling is the brief cameo of Lydia Smith (played by S. Epatha Merkerson), housekeeper and supposed lover of the Pennsylvania congressman and Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Stevens's relationship with his ''mulatto'' housekeeper is the subject of notoriously racist scenes in D. W. Griffith's 1915 film ''Birth of a Nation.'' Though Mr. Spielberg's film looks upon the pair with far more sympathy, the sudden revelation of their relationship -- Stevens literally hands the official copy of the 13th Amendment to Smith, before the two head into bed together -- reveals, once again, the film's determination to see emancipation as a gift from white people to black people, not as a social transformation in which African-Americans themselves played a role.
The screenplay, written by Tony Kushner, is attentive to the language of the period and features verbal jousting among white men who take pleasure in jabs and insults. By contrast, the black characters -- earnest and dignified -- are given few interesting or humorous lines, even though verbal sparring and one-upmanship is a recognized aspect of black vernacular culture that has long shaped the American mainstream. Meanwhile, perhaps the greatest rhetorician of the 19th century, Frederick Douglass, who in fact attended the White House reception after Lincoln's second inauguration in March 1865, is nowhere to be seen or heard.
It is a well-known pastime of historians to quibble with Hollywood over details. Here, however, the issue is not factual accuracy but interpretive choice. A stronger African-American presence, even at the margins of Mr. Spielberg's ''Lincoln,'' would have suggested that another dynamic of emancipation was occurring just outside the frame -- a world of black political debate, of civic engagement and of monumental effort for the liberation of body and spirit.
That, too, is the history of abolition; ''Lincoln'' is an opportunity squandered.

HEADLINE: Primal Emotions Come to Fore in Politics

BYLINE: By RICHARD FRIEDMAN, M.D.. 
Dr. Richard A. Friedman is a professor of clinical psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College.

 BODY:
Just one look at the dejection on the faces of Romney supporters or the jubilation of Obama supporters on election night should tell you that politics is first and foremost a very emotional affair.
Ann Romney was crying while her husband delivered his terse concession speech, not because a majority of Americans voted against his economic policy, but because of the personal - and highly public - rejection of Mitt Romney as their next president.
Nor were President Obama's supporters ecstatic because his health care policy would not be overturned. Rather, both camps were in the grip of powerful emotions akin to the passion of spectators rooting for their team at a sporting event. 
Oh, yes, Democrats will wax passionately about social justice and income inequality, and Republicans will carry on about the pernicious nature of big government and the virtues of individual achievement.
But political affiliation is not driven by ideas alone. Most people do not choose a political party by carefully analyzing its policies or even its track record for competence. Instead, some social scientists argue that people select their political party in early adulthood the way they choose their friends or social groups: They go for the party that has people who resemble themselves.
Once you've selected your party, you are likely to retrofit your beliefs and philosophy to align with it. In this sense, political parties are like tribes; membership in the tribe shapes your values and powerfully influences your allegiance to the group.
So strong is the social and emotional bond among members of a political tribe that they are likely to remain loyal to their party even when they give it low marks for performance. Yankees fans don't jump ship when their team loses any more than Republicans switch parties when they lose an election.
Research has shown that when a team wins an athletic contest, fans the next day speak about how "we won," and feel generally more optimistic, stronger and self-confident. Conversely, the losing side feels depressed, defeated and angry.
Interestingly, some studies found that testosterone levels rose in a group of male fans whose team went on to win and fell in fans whose team was defeated. Testosterone is well known to elevate both mood and aggression. Thus, winning or losing doesn't just change your mood; it changes your physiology and brain function.
Political defeat unleashes similar painful emotions, and there is some preliminary evidence that it has biological consequences as well. For example, a study in 2009 found that during the 2008 presidential election, a group of McCain voters had an increase in the stress hormone cortisol after the announcement that Barack Obama had won, while those who had voted for Mr. Obama had no significant change in their cortisol levels. Cortisol is secreted by the body in response to acute and chronic stress. The clear implication of the study was that political defeat is a biologically stressful experience.
Not just that, but political contests have an element of thrill and expectation that is a bit like gambling. Intrade, for example, gave real-time market predictions about the probability of winning for each presidential candidate. Everyone who voted essentially bet on a candidate and expected a reward. We are hard-wired to go after various rewards and get a squirt of dopamine in our brain's reward circuit when we get one. This dopamine signal confers, among many things, a sense of pleasure. Conversely, when we don't get the reward we expected, the activity in our reward circuit is suddenly depressed and we don't feel very good.
Thus, Republicans found themselves in a grim situation on election night. As they told reporters, they were confident of victory, so the defeat was all the more stunning. Senior Romney advisers told CBS News: "We went into the evening confident we had a good path to victory. I don't think there was one person who saw this coming."
For some political followers - and figures - the experience of defeat is so unacceptable that they resort to primitive denial. Consider the Republican strategist Karl Rove on election night. The moment Fox News called Ohio for Mr. Obama, Mr. Rove boldly challenged the network's team of voting analysts. Mr. Rove was entitled to his dismay, of course, but not his own facts - and Fox News stood by its call.
What makes political loss particularly painful for followers is the defeat of their leader, whose appeal derives in large part from the ability to make followers feel understood and cared for. In this sense, an effective leader arouses feelings in supporters that resemble the feelings children have for their parents. That's why watching your presidential candidate go down is a bit like seeing your father get fired or beaten up.
But what is the experience of defeat like for the candidate himself? One gets a clue from the work of William Shaffir, a sociologist at McMaster University in Canada, who interviewed defeated politicians who spoke to him on the condition of anonymity. As one defeated official told Dr. Shaffir: "It's a sudden stop. It's just like someone shut off the tap. It just ends. It's over. It's death."
The defeated candidate experiences an abrupt and painful loss of social role - a classic stressor that can trigger depression. When the election is over, the followers go back to work. But the defeated candidate has to reinvent himself and find a new role in life.
So for those of us celebrating this presidential election, we should not forget that though victory is sweet, it can be short-lived. Sooner or later we will be the losers. A little chest-thumping is in order and is even good for tribe morale. But we should try our best not to gloat.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fiscal Delusion

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. RUBIN. 
Robert E. Rubin was Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999 and is a co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
NOW that the election is over, Washington's attention is consumed by the looming combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases known as ''the fiscal cliff.'' That combination poses risks, including economic contraction and erosion of confidence in government. But it also offers a chance to address our unsustainable and dangerous fiscal trajectory.
Much of the current energy around establishing sound fiscal conditions is focused on plans that theoretically would both contribute revenue to deficit reduction and significantly reduce individual income tax rates. Though hugely appealing, that's a tall order. 
These plans rely on reducing or eliminating many tax deductions, exclusions and the like, known collectively as tax expenditures. Reducing tax expenditures to pay for both lower personal income tax rates and deficit reduction may seem like a politically attractive alternative to raising tax rates or cutting entitlements or other spending.
However, many of these tax expenditures are important and popular policy programs on which people now rely. They include the deductibility of mortgage interest, charitable contributions and the exclusion from income of employer-provided health insurance. Some tax expenditures should be cut back and reformed. But when the substantive effects and political realities of large-scale reductions are examined, it becomes clear that there would not be sufficient savings to reduce tax rates and also cut the deficit.
Not long ago, a former senior official involved in the federal budget process told me that various senators used to meet with him periodically and argue for reducing tax expenditures. He would say that was a good idea, and then go down the list of large tax expenditures. At each one, the senator would say, ''Oh no, we can't do that,'' and at some point the senator would repeat his proposition and the conversation would end.
The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service examined the full range of existing tax expenditures and concluded that, ''Given the barriers to eliminating or reducing most tax expenditures, it may prove difficult to gain more than $100 billion to $150 billion'' a year. But most plans based on reducing tax deductions and other expenditures project revenues of three to four times that amount. And the 1986 Tax Reform Act, cited as an example of lowering rates through tax expenditure reductions (called base broadening), left all of the major individual tax expenditures largely unchanged.
The plans that reduce both tax rates and deficits, like the impressive work by the Simpson-Bowles commission, have served a great public service -- raising awareness of our fiscal risks, bringing Democrats and Republicans together, providing a framework aimed at stabilizing debt at an acceptable level, and recognizing the need for substantial revenue increases and spending cuts.
However, these same plans also pose a serious risk to achieving the very objective they seek. If we invest too much time and effort pursuing plans that ultimately prove undesirable and unworkable, we may go down a road that leads nowhere. Then we would be forced to search for a new solution when it will almost surely be too late. In effect, we will have pursued the policy equivalent of a wild-goose chase only to discover that, to mix metaphors, the tax expenditure goose doesn't have enough golden eggs.
Advocates of extensive tax expenditure reduction argue -- correctly -- that all deficit reduction choices involve substantive costs and are politically difficult. They then suggest that, when compared to other possibilities, substantially more cuts may be doable than the Congressional research numbers suggest.
Maybe, but I think that's unlikely when compared to the alternative of restoring the topmost tax brackets to their Clinton-era level.
Raising tax rates for those with the highest incomes challenges the supply-side proposition that even moderately higher rates would hurt growth. President Bill Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction plan increased income tax rates for roughly the top 1.2 percent of incomes. Opponents said this would lead to recession. Instead, we had enormous job creation and the longest economic expansion in our history.
A recent report by the Hamilton Project, an economic policy project on whose advisory council I serve, reviewed 23 studies of the impact of tax-rate changes on the propensity to work and found that most of them concluded there was no meaningful effect. Tax expenditure reductions, on the other hand, will not raise nearly the revenues needed for sufficient deficit reduction without increasing taxes on the middle class significantly and are likely to disrupt important social and economic goals, though many economists don't acknowledge that.
When you compare raising the marginal rates for roughly 2 million Americans to phasing out health insurance exclusions that would affect 150 million Americans -- even if some reform should be done -- I don't think it's a close call substantively or politically.
We should let the Bush high-end tax cuts expire, with an achievable, progressive reduction in tax expenditures. And we should have spending cuts, including entitlement reforms, equally matched by revenue increases. The entire program -- including budgetary room for public investment and a moderate upfront jobs package -- could be enacted now and deferred for a limited time with a serious mechanism to guarantee implementation.
For plans that both reduce deficits and lower rates, some suggest that, instead of raising the top two brackets to Clinton-era levels, we can find the same revenues by limiting tax expenditures for those groups. That would have some meaningful negative policy impacts, unlike increasing the top rate. The bigger problem is that such a step would yield only a fraction of the necessary revenue, requiring higher taxes on the middle class.
The pressure of the fiscal cliff, the fact that doing nothing is not viable, and the distance to the next election all combine to make this a special opportunity to meet our fiscal imperative. We need an open, cleareyed debate so we don't squander it.

HEADLINE: Seaport Museum Works to Dry Out

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Cultural organizations typically seek contributions with drawn-out, understated courtships -- cocktail parties for donors, dinners for prospective trustees.
There is no time for such niceties these days at the South Street Seaport Museum, which was deluged by the storm that upended much of New York.
''Hurricane Sandy has dealt us a body blow,'' Susan Henshaw Jones, the museum's president, said in a letter to supporters just days after the storm. ''Please send whatever you can!''
The water surged to six feet at the lobby entrance, wiping out the building's electrical systems and destroying its cafe, admission desk, computer system and gift shop. The surrounding seaport, a tourist hub of restaurants and retail stores, is also a mess, with silt wedged between the cobblestones and many storefronts boarded up.
''South Street itself was running like a river,'' said the museum's waterfront director, Capt. Jonathan Boulware who stayed in the museum's Fulton Street building on the night of the storm as it carried ''debris and signs and barricades and pieces of timber and in some cases vehicles along.'' 
South Street Seaport is hardly alone as an arts organization that is reeling from the hurricane; 3LD Art & Technology Center, an art and performance space on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan was flooded, for example, along with art studios in Red Hook and art galleries in Dumbo, in Brooklyn.
The damage suffered by 57 nonprofit theaters added up to more than $800,000, according to a survey by the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York.
A gallery run by the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition in Red Hook saw its 8,500-square-foot main floor decimated. "We did not expect five feet of water to wash through the whole gallery," said John Strohbeen, the coalition's president. "It had taken us years to build it up. Now we're trying to put it all back together again."
But the timing was especially rough for the seaport museum. Having been rescued last year by the Museum of the City of New York after a decade of economic struggle, the institution was just beginning to get back on its feet.
Last January the museum reopened after being closed for almost a year for the expansion and updating of its galleries. The number of visitors has reached 100,000 since January.
But the clock is running. A $2 million grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation gave City Museum up to 18 months to see if it could make a go of the seaport museum. Counting a six-month extension, that interim period expires in April.
The storm would seem like a good excuse as any for the City Museum to wash its hands of the project, whose financial challenges include a decade of back rent and utilities payments owed to the city's Economic Development Corporation and the cost of maintaining a fleet of 11 antique vessels.
The ships, it turned out, did surprisingly well in the storm, officials said, as the museum prepared by lengthening mooring lines so that the vessels could rise and fall with the surge.
Still, the damage elsewhere is substantial. Ms. Jones said she couldn't yet estimate the total cost, except to say that replacing the electrical system will run in the millions of dollars. The system, which includes the museum's escalator, elevators, heating and air conditioning, must not only be replaced but also be relocated to a higher floor to avoid damage in another flood.
''I've never seen anything like it,'' said Captain Boulware, one of three staff members who stayed overnight in the storm. ''The speed with which the water came -- we could watch the water rising on the pilings, on the railings. There were breaking waves running across the pier.''
The repair work is likely to take months, but Ms. Jones said she hoped to reopen around Thanksgiving and run the museum on generators.
Unclear is how quickly the museum's rental tenants, which include the Josh Bach men's clothing store on Fulton Street and Skipper's outdoor restaurant on Pier 16, will be able to reopen after extensive damage, Ms. Jones said.
At Bowne & Company Stationers (founded 1775), a printing shop that is part of the museum, more than 200 drawers of antique wood and metal type were drenched. The drying efforts of volunteers were slowed by the lack of power in this stretch of downtown, which was just restored at the end of last week.
School groups, a typically solid source of income, will be slow to return, given the classroom time lost because of the storm.
Kate D. Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, said that before the storm the museum's progress had been impressive. She mentioned in particular what had been the museum's current exhibition organized by the American Folk Art Museum, which explores Lower Manhattan's history as a seaport and mercantile center; none of the objects on display were damaged in the storm. Now the job is to get back on track, she said.
''Everybody wants to try and keep going on the commitment we've made to a vibrant museum there,'' Ms. Levin said.
Ms. Jones has been running both institutions simultaneously -- an effort complicated by the storm. Each day she heads downtown to Fulton Street from the City Museum on Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street. ''It was a hard balancing act,'' she said, ''but it got tougher.''
Under Ms. Jones the Seaport Museum has balanced its $4.5 million operating budget, mended some of its ships and raised its visibility. Two fund-raisers over the last year exceeded projections. The first, on the occasion of the museum's 45th anniversary in May, brought in $250,000, the second, a celebration of ''Moby-Dick'' in October, $90,000.
During a tour of the museum last week Ms. Jones pointed out how high the water, laced with oil, had reached on the wall of the museum's lobby. She acknowledged that the way back is expensive: the temporary kerosene heaters alone are costing $7,500 a month. And tourists who do make it to the seaport area these days are coming to see the damage, not an exhibition on New York's maritime history.
But the museum recently received a temporary generator from the Port Authority. And Ms. Jones's plea for financial help has so far raised $25,000, with donations ranging between $20 and $2,000.
''We are not in the slightest bit discouraged,'' Ms. Jones said, an optimism buoyed she said by the tenacity of her staff and many volunteers. ''We want to get back on our feet as fast as we possibly can.''

HEADLINE: Angry Turkish Secularists Plant Their Flag at Trial

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Yesim Erden contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SILIVRI, Turkey -- The protesters converge each day on the village of little tents dotting the landscape here outside a sprawling prison and courthouse. They go about their business of tending a garden of fruits and vegetables, but their primary mission is to denounce the Islamist-inspired government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
One man, Riza Yaman, traveled from Germany to spend some time at the camp. ''The republican traditions are being compromised and replaced with religious traditions,'' he said.
Mr. Yaman is one of dozens of men and women who have been coming here for a little more than a year, angry secularists protesting outside a trial of hundreds of military officers charged with plotting to overthrow the Islamic-rooted government. The case, which has also ensnared journalists, academics and others, has come to symbolize Turkey's attempt to come to terms with its history of military coups and state-sponsored assassinations. With its harsh judicial tactics and an ever-widening net of suspects, the trial has also illuminated concerns about the accrual of power by Mr. Erdogan and questions about his commitment to democracy. 
This is supposed to be Turkey's time. The country is a rare haven of economic growth and political stability in a region in turmoil. It has been hailed by many across the Arab world as a model for blending faith and democracy. Elected 10 years ago, Mr. Erdogan is poised to become the longest-serving prime minister in the history of the Turkish republic and is planning a 2014 run for the presidency, which he hopes to refashion from a largely ceremonial post to one with strong executive powers along the lines of the United States system.
But Turkey is facing a reckoning of its own. It is wrestling with an identity defined by both a history of iron-fisted secular rule and the promise of Islamist-infused democracy. It has a population that is deeply divided between Islamists and secularists, and its charismatic leader is facing challenges on multiple fronts. He has been criticized for his Syria policy, taken to task for a widening crackdown on free expression and mired in an escalating fight with Kurdish militants that recently prompted him to suggest reinstituting the death penalty, which was abolished in 2002 as part of Turkey's bid to enter the European Union.
''Turkey is going through this period of psychological questioning,'' said Haluk Sahin, a former columnist and a journalism professor at Istanbul Bilgi University.
The court case, named Ergenekon for a mythic valley that is the moniker of the clandestine terrorist organization to which the defendants are accused of belonging, is at the center of Turkey's many fissures.
Mr. Erdogan came to office promising to advance democracy and face Turkey's past by expanding rights for Kurds and women and relaxing restrictions on the news media. He allayed the fears of the old guard that he had a hidden Islamist agenda by embracing the prospect of membership in the European Union, which was central to Turkey's democratic ambitions but now seems more distant than ever.
''Not only did a new party come to power, but a new mentality took place,'' Mr. Erdogan said in a recent speech, looking back a decade to when his party won its first election.
Yet the recent sight of security forces clashing with thousands of secularist protesters who were celebrating Turkey's Republic Day in violation of a government ban belied the government's democratic credentials. Turkey's reputation has also been rattled by reports from the European Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group based in New York, that have undermined Mr. Erdogan's efforts to portray Turkey as a rising democracy for the region to emulate.
The European Union said the Ergenekon case, and other criminal cases, raise ''real concerns about their wide scope and the shortcomings in judicial proceedings.'' The C.P.J. said Turkey is ''waging one of the world's biggest anti-press campaigns in recent history.'' More journalists are in jail in Turkey than in any other country, the C.P.J. report said.
The government's response to the criticism has been largely to ignore it.
''By turning a blind eye to the report made by the E.U. and the Committee to Protect Journalists, one can deceive oneself and pretend to be living in a very democratic country,'' wrote Ozgur Mumcu, a columnist for the newspaper Radikal. ''But not everyone shares these same hallucinations.''
The court proceedings are at the heart of how Turkey manages to face an authoritarian past and chart a democratic future. Initially many Turks viewed the trial, which began in 2008, as a necessary reckoning with a painful past, but as it has dragged on there is rising sentiment that it is just another chapter in a long history of rule by authoritarian elites, this time with an Islamic bent.
Turkey is endlessly fixated with the past. Its competing interpretations play out each day in the newspapers. From one edition of a local paper this week came these stories: Was the reformist president, Turgut Ozal, who died suddenly in 1993, actually poisoned by his enemies? Did Adnan Menderes, the prime minister in the 1950s who was hanged after a military coup, give orders for a pogrom in 1955 against non-Muslims? And who, exactly, was behind the coups of 1960, 1971, 1980 and 1997?
The courthouse in which the Ergenekon defendants are facing trial is in Silivri, a town on the Sea of Marmara an hour's drive west of Istanbul. The caretakers of the tent encampment are dissidents, nationalists, secularists, the family and friends of the accused, and even some defendants.
The tents, set up as a permanent base of protest, call to mind a refugee camp. And in a sense, the men and women who visit, sometimes for a day but often for longer, are exiles from Turkey's past. They are a political minority in today's Turkey and, as loyalists to the secular and nationalist traditions of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded modern Turkey in 1923, they are fearful that Mr. Erdogan has decisively banished them from the center of power.
Yet as they offer their complaints, they express a worldview that seems rooted in Turkey's undemocratic past. Some deny that a massacre of the Armenians occurred in 1915, in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire, in a tragedy that Turkey has still not confronted. Most believe that the Central Intelligence Agency secretly runs Turkey's affairs. And they regard multiculturalism and the expansion of rights for Turkey's Kurds as a step toward a partition of the country.
On a recent day, after a lunch of rice and beans and watermelon, the camp's visitors drank tea and smoked cigarettes before returning to the court for afternoon testimony.
Hidir Hokka, the camp's overseer, views modern Turkey and Mr. Erdogan's rise as a plot by the United States and Europe to exact revenge for Ataturk's rebellion after World War I that thwarted the Allies' plans to control much of present-day Turkey.
In a recent speech to his party, Mr. Erdogan evoked a different history: the decades of rule by an unelected secular elite -- dominated by the military -- whose power has been destroyed by cases like Ergenekon.
''It might be possible to rule the country under the control of a handful of elites,'' he said. ''But in a democratic republic, you must take your strength from the people.''

HEADLINE: Mixed Verdict on Fraud at a Money Market Mutual Fund

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Regulators failed on Monday to win a clear victory over the father-and-son team whose mutual fund collapsed in one of the central blowups of the 2008 financial crisis. It was the latest setback in efforts by regulators to go after individuals responsible for risk-taking that nearly brought down the American economy.
A federal jury in Manhattan rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission's claim that Bruce Bent, the man credited with inventing a popular investment vehicle known as a money market fund, defrauded investors when his flagship fund failed in September 2008, sowing panic among ordinary investors. 
The collapse was a significant turning point because the fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, was pitched to investors as a nearly risk-free alternative to a bank account. The S.E.C.'s lawyers accused Mr. Bent and his son, Bruce Bent II, of falsely assuring investors that the fund could be rescued as it foundered under the weight of hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds issued by Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt on Sept. 15, 2008. The Reserve Primary Fund ceased operation two days later.
The S.E.C. did convince the jury that the younger Mr. Bent's statements were negligent, and that the parent company had made fraudulent statements. But the decision clearing the Bents of fraud accusations underscored the difficulty prosecutors and regulators have had in holding financiers accountable for precipitating the financial crisis.
''There is no other way to read this than as a significant loss for the S.E.C.,'' said Thomas O. Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney and formerly the senior counsel for the S.E.C.'s Division of Enforcement.
Regulators are continuing efforts to shore up the money market fund industry against the problems revealed by the collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund. A council of top regulators was set to meet on Tuesday to determine how to impose new rules on the industry after a few S.E.C. commissioners scuttled a previous push to improve the safety and transparency of the funds.
While the S.E.C. imposed some new rules on the industry soon after the crisis, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said that money market funds are still vulnerable to the type of runs that nearly brought the industry down in 2008.
The elder Mr. Bent is widely hailed as the creator of the world's first money market mutual funds, which since the 1970s have been marketed to small investors as a low-risk investment with an unchanging share value of $1 and the potential to earn a more attractive yield than a bank savings account.
''He did for money market funds what mutual funds did for small investors, bringing Wall Street to Main Street by allowing individuals to participate in what had been the playground of institutions,'' said Peter G. Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual funds.
Before the financial crisis, the flagship fund run by the Reserve Management Company loaded up on $785 million of debt issued by Lehman Brothers. The debt, which made up about 1 percent of the fund's assets, was suddenly worthless after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, and led to the fund's ''breaking the buck,'' which is when the value of the assets falls below $1 a share.
During the trial, lawyers for the S.E.C. faulted Mr. Bent for not describing the true extent of the fund's perilous state during an emergency meeting called on the day that Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection.
In closing arguments, a lawyer for the S.E.C. claimed that the Bents tried to soothe investors' fears while knowing that they would be unable to avert disaster for the fund.
Hurricane Sandy delayed the jury's verdict when the courthouse in Manhattan was shuttered for a week.
After the jury announced its verdict, a spokesman for the Bents, Mark Arena, said that the men were ''gratified that the jury found'' that the men ''committed no fraud.'' Mr. Arena said that the Bents planned to appeal the jury's findings that the younger Mr. Bent was liable for negligence.
The Bents have spent their time since 2008 winding down the management company that they privately held. While the funds no longer exist, some assets remain that the court could seek to pay any damages. Mr. Crane said when he last visited Mr. Bent in his nearly empty office near Times Square about nine months ago, he expected him to be withering under the S.E.C.'s case. ''But he was unbowed,'' Mr. Crane recalled.
Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement, emphasized the points on which the commission's case was affirmed.
''Today's verdict of liability sends the message that fund executives cannot withhold from investors and trustees key information about their fund's vulnerability,'' he said. ''This case, along with our actions against more than 100 other entities and individuals, demonstrates our continuing commitment to pursuing cases arising out of the financial crisis.''
Last month, federal prosecutors brought a case against Bank of America, accusing the bank of scheming, through its Countrywide Financial unit, to defraud the government by producing loans at a manic pace without instituting adequate controls. Critics of the S.E.C. have complained that even in a case where federal prosecutors are charging ''brazen'' bad acts, no individuals were charged.
Just how difficult it is to prosecute executives was illuminated in August, when a federal jury in New York acquitted a manager at Citigroup who was accused of selling a complex financial security involving residential mortgages. The manager, according to the charges, failed to disclose that Citigroup had made wagers against the investment or to fairly explain to investors how Citigroup had selected the assets in the portfolio.
Despite the headline-grabbing charges, the jury exonerated the manager and found that the bank had already provided details of the investment's risks. In an unusual move, however, the jury included a message to the S.E.C. with its verdict urging the agency not to lose steam in pursuing charges against individuals.
''This verdict should not deter the S.E.C. from investigating the financial industry, to review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary,'' the jury wrote.

HEADLINE: Japan Tiptoes Toward Recession

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy shrank at a pace of 0.9 percent in the three months through September, government data showed Monday, as sluggish exports compounded slowing demand and edged the nation's economy toward recession.
The decline in gross domestic product came to an annualized 3.5 percent contraction. It was a reversal from Japan's robust performance earlier this year, when it outperformed most of its peers in the Group of 7 industrialized nations. 
But growth has since stalled, hit by a slump in exports amid economic woes in Europe and a damaging territorial spat with China, both major trading destinations for Japan. A strong yen has also hurt competitiveness among Japanese exporters.
At home, the pace of reconstruction after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster of March 2011 appears to be slowing. Private consumption declined at the largest rate since early 2011.
''These are tough numbers,'' Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a parliamentary session Monday. He said the government, which has led the post-disaster reconstruction effort with 20 trillion, or $252 billion, in spending, would consider further measures ''with a sense of urgency.''
Still, some economists say they expect the Japanese economy to continue to shrink in the next quarter, pitching it into recession before conditions improve.
''Japan's recovery since both the Lehman shock and the Tohoku earthquake appears to have halted lately,'' and Japan now appears headed for recession, Masamichi Adachi, economist for Japan at J.P. Morgan Securities, said in a research note after the G.D.P. numbers were released.
''The recession is likely to be short, however, as a resumption of positive growth from the first quarter next year is expected with a pickup in external demand, and associated firming in domestic private demand,'' Mr. Adachi said.
Economists at the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo also predicted that a recession was probable but would probably be short-lived.
''Although the Japanese economy will face harsh challenges for the time being, the situation is likely to bottom out by the end of the year,'' the economists said in a note. ''A rebound in economic indicators in the United States and China suggests that Japan's exports will also bottom out by the year's end, so the possibility that the economy will continue to retrench in the new year is low.''
If, however, Japan's rocky relations with China were to worsen, the recovery could take longer, the economists said. A spat over a group of islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both nations has prompted some Chinese consumers to boycott Japanese brands, casting a pall over Japan's exports to its neighbor.
The numbers Monday also put renewed pressure on the Japanese central bank to do more to shore up the economy. The central bank, the Bank of Japan, eased monetary policy last month for the second month in a row by expanding an asset lending program, after government officials had urged the bank to take more drastic steps to keep economic recovery on track.
The bank, which has struggled over the past decade in its efforts to kick-start the Japanese economy and tackle persistent deflation, is set to review monetary policy again next week.
''The government must pursue various measures to address fiscal woes, ease regulations and bolster economic growth. But I would also like the Bank of Japan to take powerful monetary easing measures to get the country out of deflation,'' Seiji Maehara, the economics minister, told a news conference Monday.
With its mature economy and declining population, Japan, which now has the world's third-largest G.D.P. behind that of the United States and China, faces being further eclipsed by its Asian neighbors.
In a report published last week on long-term economic trends, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said Japan would continue to grow but at a sluggish rate, and its share of global economic output would fall far behind that of fast-rising China and India over the coming decades.

HEADLINE: Plan to Become an Ex-Smoker for Good

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Few smokers would claim that it's easy to quit. The addiction to nicotine is strong and repeatedly reinforced by circumstances that prompt smokers to light up.
Yet the millions who have successfully quit are proof that a smoke-free life is achievable, even by those who have been regular, even heavy, smokers for decades.
Today, 19 percent of American adults smoke, down from more than 42 percent half a century ago, when Luther Terry, the United States surgeon general, formed a committee to produce the first official report on the health effects of smoking. Ever-increasing restrictions on where people can smoke have helped to swell the ranks of former smokers. 
Now, however, as we approach the American Cancer Society's 37th Great American Smokeout on Thursday, the decline in adult smoking has stalled despite the economic downturn and the soaring price of cigarettes.
Currently, 45 million Americans are regular smokers who, if they remain smokers, can on average expect to live 10 fewer years. Half will die of a tobacco-related disease, and many others will suffer for years with smoking-caused illness. Smoking adds $96 billion to the annual cost of medical care in this country, Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month. Even as some adult smokers quit, their ranks are being swelled by the 800,000 teenagers who become regular smokers each year and by young adults who, through advertising and giveaways, are now the prime targets of the tobacco industry.
People ages 18 to 25 now have the nation's highest smoking rate: about 34 percent counted in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2010 reported smoking cigarettes in the previous month. I had to hold my breath the other day as dozens of 20-somethings streamed out of art gallery openings and lighted up. Do they not know how easy it is to get hooked on nicotine and how challenging it can be to escape this addiction?
Challenging, yes, but by no means impossible. On the Web you can download a "Guide to Quitting Smoking," with detailed descriptions of all the tools and tips to help you become an ex-smoker once and for all.
Or consult the new book by Dr. Richard Brunswick, a retired family physician in Northampton, Mass., who says he's helped hundreds of people escape the clutches of nicotine and smoking. (The printable parts of the book's provocative title are "Can't Quit? You Can Stop Smoking.")
"There is no magic pill or formula for beating back nicotine addiction," Dr. Brunswick said. "However, with a better understanding of why you smoke and the different tools you can use to control the urge to light up, you can stop being a slave to your cigarettes."
Addiction and Withdrawal
Nicotine beats a direct path to the brain, where it provides both relaxation and a small energy boost. But few smokers realize that the stress and lethargy they are trying to relieve are a result of nicotine withdrawal, not some underlying distress. Break the addiction, and the ill feelings are likely to dissipate.
Physical withdrawal from nicotine is short-lived. Four days without it and the worst is over, with remaining symptoms gone within a month, Dr. Brunswick said. But emotional and circumstantial tugs to smoke can last much longer.
Depending on when and why you smoke, cues can include needing a break from work, having to focus on a challenging task, drinking coffee or alcohol, being with other people who smoke or in places you associate with smoking, finishing a meal or sexual activity, and feeling depressed or upset.
To break such links, you must first identify them and then replace them with other activities, like taking a walk, chewing sugar-free gum or taking deep breaths. These can help you control cravings until the urge passes.
If you've failed at quitting before, try to identify what went wrong and do things differently this time, Dr. Brunswick suggests. Most smokers need several attempts before they can become permanent ex-smokers.
Perhaps most important is to be sure you are serious about quitting; if not, wait until you are. Motivation is half the battle. Also, should you slip and have a cigarette after days or weeks of not smoking, don't assume you've failed and give up. Just go right back to not smoking.
Aids for Quitting
Many if not most smokers need two kinds of assistance to become lasting ex-smokers: psychological support and medicinal aids. Only about 4 percent to 7 percent of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without help, the cancer society says.
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have free telephone-based support programs that connect would-be quitters to trained counselors. Together, you can plan a stop-smoking method that suits your smoking pattern and helps you avoid common pitfalls.
Online support groups and Nicotine Anonymous can help as well. To find a group, ask a local hospital or call the cancer society at (800) 227-2345. Consider telling relatives and friends about your intention to quit, and plan to spend time in smoke-free settings.
More than a dozen treatments can help you break the physical addiction to tobacco. Most popular is nicotine replacement therapy, sold both with and without a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration has approved five types: nicotine patches of varying strengths, gums, sprays, inhalers and lozenges that can curb withdrawal symptoms and help you gradually reduce your dependence on nicotine.
Two prescription drugs are also effective: an extended-release form of the antidepressant bupropion (Zyban or Wellbutrin), which reduces nicotine cravings, and varenicline (Chantix), which blocks nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing both the pleasurable effects of smoking and the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Combining a nicotine replacement with one of these drugs is often more effective than either approach alone.
Other suggested techniques, like hypnosis and acupuncture, have helped some people quit but lack strong proof of their effectiveness. Tobacco lozenges and pouches and nicotine lollipops and lip balms lack evidence as quitting aids, and no clinical trials have been published showing that electronic cigarettes can help people quit.
The cancer society suggests picking a "quit day"; ridding your home, car and workplace of smoking paraphernalia; choosing a stop-smoking plan, and stocking up on whatever aids you may need.
On the chosen day, keep active; drink lots of water and juices; use a nicotine replacement; change your routine if possible; and avoid alcohol, situations you associate with smoking and people who are smoking.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Democrats Like A Romney Idea On Income Tax

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With both parties positioning for difficult negotiations to avert a fiscal crisis as Congress returns for its lame-duck session, Democrats are latching on to an idea floated by Mitt Romney to raise taxes on the rich through a hard cap on income tax deductions.
The proposal by Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, was envisioned to help pay for an across-the-board income tax cut, a move ridiculed by President Obama as window dressing to a ''sketchy deal.'' But many Democrats now see it as an important element of a potential deficit reduction agreement -- and one they can claim to be bipartisan. 
The cap -- never fully detailed by Mr. Romney -- is similar to a longstanding proposal by Mr. Obama to limit income tax deductions to 28 percent, even for affluent households that pay a 35 percent rate. But a firm cap of around $35,000 would hit the affluent even harder than Mr. Obama's proposal, which has previously gotten nowhere in Congress.
''Let's just say there's a renewed interest,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''Part of it is people reflecting on Obama's proposal, but when Romney said what he said, it just added fuel.''
''I was a little surprised Romney proposed a dollar cap when he did it,'' Mr. Conrad added.
The attention on the plan is evidence that ideas on deficit reduction are beginning to take firmer form as the January deadline for dealing with expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions draws close. The lame-duck session that begins Tuesday could be one of the most pivotal in years, and the political atmosphere is considerably different than when lawmakers left in October for the fall campaigns.
President Obama has been re-elected convincingly. Democrats, once in danger of losing control of the Senate, instead gained at least one seat. House Republicans held control, but as many as 16 incumbents lost, including some of the party's most uncompromising voices, like Representatives Joe Walsh of Illinois and Allen B. West of Florida, who refuses to concede his seat despite his continuing deficit in the vote count. The somber mood among Republicans could ease negotiations to avert more than $500 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases.
''The worst time to work together on a bipartisan basis is right before an election,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference. ''The best time to work on a bipartisan basis is right after an election.''
Returning lawmakers will find a long to-do list greeting them Tuesday and seven short weeks to do it. In the House, members may once again try to grapple with the farm bill, which expired during the recess. Dairy farmers in particular are clamoring for a resolution, and a year of record drought gave urgency to a bill.
Across the Rotunda, the Senate may once again take up a cybersecurity bill. An earlier measure that would have established optional standards for the computer systems that oversee the country's critical infrastructure was stopped by a filibuster as some leading Republicans yielded to the concerns of major business interests; members from both parties would like to see a renewed effort on a bill as soon as possible. A military policy bill, which generally passes easily on the floor, was caught up in the fight over looming Pentagon cuts and did not make it to the floor.
But the most pressing task is averting the sudden expiration of all the Bush-era tax cuts, a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits at the same time that across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts kick in. Most economists believe that ''fiscal cliff,'' if not mitigated, would send the economy back into recession. Democrats say any plan to avert the crisis must include a combination of tax increases on the rich and spending cuts. Republicans say they are willing to overhaul the tax code to increase federal revenue, but they refuse to raise income tax rates.
That has kicked off a scramble to find ways to raise revenue without higher rates by closing loopholes and tightening deductions and tax credits. Senior Democrats made clear Monday that the search for such tax changes should not be seen as a replacement for higher tax rates on the rich.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the Romney proposal to cap deductions would work only in concert with allowing the top two income tax rates to revert to the level of Bill Clinton's presidency, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, up from the current 33 percent and 35 percent.
To come close to the level of deficit reduction needed to get the nation's fiscal house in order, the presidential deficit reduction commission known by the names of its chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson, assumed those top rates would jump, Mr. Van Hollen said. But beyond those rate increases, more revenue will have to be raised.
''This is a promising idea for tax reform,'' Mr. Van Hollen said, ''if you start at the higher Clinton era rates for high-income earners.''
The idea gained currency when Martin Feldstein, a prominent Republican economist and former chairman of Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, embraced it during the campaign to show that Mr. Romney's tax plan was not as far-fetched as Democrats portrayed it. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and something of a ringleader in the search for a bipartisan deficit deal, has also embraced the idea.
But with the presidential campaign over, it is taking on new salience. The Democratic centrist group Third Way has made it the centerpiece of a package of tax changes that it says could raise nearly $1.3 trillion over 10 years without raising rates.
The Third Way proposal would limit tax deductions to $35,000 but would exclude charitable giving. Universities, foundations and other philanthropies have been the biggest impediment to passing Mr. Obama's more modest 28 percent limit, which did not exclude the charitable tax deduction.

HEADLINE: The Need for U.S.-Iran Talks

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Boston
MITT Romney used the word ''peace'' or ''peaceful'' a dozen times in the last presidential debate, as if he'd been communing with the ghosts of John Lennon and Mohandas Gandhi. But the American people were not fooled. In re-electing Barack Obama, they voted for peace and against a third war in a Muslim nation in little over a decade.
Americans are tired of their trillion-dollar wars. A recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 67 percent of Americans believe the Iraq war was not worth it, 69 percent think the United States is no safer from terrorism as a result of the Afghan war, and 71 percent say the Iraq experience should make the country more cautious about using force [pdf]. 
The risk was real that Romney -- surrounded by hawks like the former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, beholden to the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, and prodded by his friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel -- might take the United States to war in Iran. Certainly, any chance of a diplomatic resolution of the crisis caused by Iran's nuclear program would have receded for the foreseeable future.
Armed conflict with Iran in 2013 is still possible. If a reminder were needed, Iran's firing shots earlier this month at a U.S. drone provided it. Israel is impatient with the steady progression of Iranian enrichment. Obama, while opposed to war and largely impervious to Netanyahu's clumsy prodding, has said he will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. There is no more immediate strategic challenge for the re-elected president.
The question of whether the quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace or for a breakthrough with Iran should be the first diplomatic priority for Obama's second term amounts to a no-brainer. It's Iran, stupid. (There are no good options in Syria and -- as with most Middle Eastern issues -- American noncommunication with Iran on the matter is unhelpful. Iran's constructive role in the 2001 Bonn conference on Afghanistan is too often forgotten.)
War with Iran would be devastating, to a Middle East in transition, to U.S. interests from Afghanistan to Egypt, and to the global economy. The time available for averting conflict is limited. Israel-Palestine, by contrast, is a draining confrontation but not today the potential spark to a conflagration; nor does it offer any new encouraging elements; nor is it likely that Netanyahu, if re-elected next year, would cease using Iran as a diversion from serious engagement with the Palestinians, who are divided in crippling ways they and the United States are reluctant to address.
But do any new avenues with Iran exist? Is there any political space for them? During Obama's first term Republican machismo prevailed on many fronts. Demonization of Iran was a never-ending source of rhetorical inspiration. Democrats were not far behind.
Diplomacy is in urgent need of resurrection. It is becoming a lost art in an age of declamation. During a recent conversation, William Luers, a former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and the director of The Iran Project, and Stephen Heintz, the president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, told me they avoid the phrase ''diplomatic solution'' in conversations about Iran on Capitol Hill. Instead they say ''political solution.'' Diplomacy just sounds too wimpy.
But, as they well know, diplomacy with Iran is needed. Diplomacy involves accepting that in order to get what you want you have to give something. The key question is: ''What do I want to get out of my rival and what do I have to give to get it?''
Pressure alone, in the form of sanctions, is not going to stop Iran's nuclear program. At some point, as with Nixon's bold breakthrough with China, undertaken against furious protests (just as vehement as Aipac would be on talks with Iran), the questions must be asked: ''What do we want, what do they want, and what do we both want?'' Areas of overlapping interest must be developed.
This will take unusual courage from Obama -- and more good sense from an economically squeezed Islamic Republic than normally emanates from Tehran. Still, Obama is now a second-term president. He is freer -- and the macho school of foreign policy is weaker. He must develop, through a special envoy, a direct line of communication with Tehran. Iranian-American trauma, now decades old, is inseparable from the nuclear crisis.
What do we want from Iran? Open up all its nuclear facilities, get rid of all its 20 percent enriched uranium, end all threats to Israel, stop rampant human rights abuses, changed policies on Hamas and Hezbollah, a constructive approach to Syria. What can we offer? Lift some sanctions, stop a range of covert actions, take regime change off the table, put the right to limited enrichment (up to 5 percent) on the table, and address the regional role of Iran.
A creative diplomat could juggle the above and work to build confidence through phased tradeoffs. But first Obama must get beyond the conventional wisdom on Iran, think big, act bold, ignore the visceral Iran-haters and stop believing coercion alone is the answer.

HEADLINE: Pace of Lending Drops in China

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Chinese banks made fewer local currency loans in October than expected, while total financing in the economy expanded more slowly than in September, data released Monday showed, suggesting that Beijing might need to do more to ensure that policy is loose enough to promote growth. 
Chinese banks extended 505.2 billion renminbi, or $81.1 billion, in new local currency loans in October, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, said, missing market expectations of 600 billion renminbi. So-called total social financing, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, stood at 1.29 trillion renminbi last month, down from 1.65 trillion renminbi in September.
The moderating credit data followed a flurry of factory output, investment and trade statistics last week that signaled that the world's second-largest economy, after that of the United States, was striding further along the road of recovery and showed that Beijing could not yet relax efforts to lift economic growth from its weakest levels in three years.
''I think lending growth will remain constrained in the coming months, as the current focus is shifted to other direct financing avenues, such as corporate bonds and trust loans,'' said Jiang Chao, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.
''The October lending figure missed the market expectations, but we should pay more attention to the total social financing data, which suggests that the monetary condition is still supportive to the real economy,'' Mr. Jiang said.
Also Monday, China released figures showing that M2, a broad measure of money supply, had risen 14.1 percent in October from a year earlier, slightly less than economists' expectations for an increase of 14.5 percent.
Bank lending is a centerpiece of China's monetary policy, given that it is controlled by Beijing in order to manage inflation and economic growth.
The October new loan data were released on the central bank's Web site and implied that total lending was on course to exceed 8.5 trillion renminbi in 2012. That would be expansionary when compared with the 7.5 trillion renminbi in new loans extended in 2011.
The Chinese cabinet said last month that it would provide a ''reasonable'' amount of credit in the fourth quarter to promote activity and speed construction of important projects.
Since monetary policy was eased this year, credit supply has increased while inflation has stayed low, allowing Beijing to hold off on additional pro-growth measures.
Some analysts think that may change this month after the ruling Communist Party selects new leaders.
Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the central bank, cautioned last week that external risks still loomed large and said the bank had room to respond if necessary.

HEADLINE: U.S. Markets Fidget, Fret and Go Nowhere

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
United States stocks closed nearly unchanged on Monday, after a day of uneven trading plagued by investors' fears about the approaching spending cuts and tax increases.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.31 points at 12,815.08, as of 6 p.m. Monday. The closing level of the Dow was revised several times after trading closed. The New York Stock Exchange experienced a trading glitch during the day, forcing it to alter its normal procedure for determining the closing prices of some stocks.
The Dow spent the day alternating from small gains to losses, never rising more than 46 points or falling more than 32. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.18 points to 1,380.03. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.61, to 2,904.26.
Trading was light. The federal government and the American bond market were closed for Veterans Day, and no economic reports were released.
Federal spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to begin with the new year, unless a divided Congress and the White House can find a compromise.
Some traders thought the tentative trading action was inevitable, because there has been no positive or negative news about the economy or the possibility of a deal to avoid the spending cuts and tax increases.
''Nothing good is going on,'' said Scott Freeze, president of Street One Financial in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. ''Everything forward-looking remains dreary.''
Last week, after voters returned a long-deadlocked and divided government to Washington, the Dow dropped 434 points in two days and had one of its worst weeks of the year.
Even if lawmakers work out a compromise, as they usually do, the political fight until then is sure keep investors on edge, pitching the stock market back and forth until the matter is resolved. Economists say the so-called fiscal cliff could cost the economy $800 billion and three million jobs and would steer the United States back into recession.
President Obama, a Democrat, and Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, have spoken of compromise but appeared to take firm stances on some issues. Mr. Obama will meet with labor representatives as well as other liberal groups on Tuesday. He will hold separate meetings with the business community on Wednesday.
The effect on the markets has been widespread. Fears about the American economy were blamed for keeping a lid on European markets and Asian markets, which closed mostly lower.
In Greece, lawmakers passed a new austerity budget, and the country's international lenders drafted a report saying it had made progress in righting its finances. Greece is hoping the other euro countries will give it an additional $40 billion in bailout loans. The budget and the report are crucial steps toward that goal.
Still, the new bailout is no sure thing: some of the potential lenders must seek approval from their parliaments. Greece's main stock market index closed down 3.6 percent.
Mr. Freeze of Street One Financial was among the underwhelmed. ''At this point, all the Greek news is just noise,'' he said. ''None of these bailouts really solve the underlying problem. Now, if all of a sudden Spain became incredibly solvent and its unemployment rate went to 5 percent, then you'd see'' a reason to buy.
Leucadia National announced it would buy the investment banking firm Jefferies Group. Jefferies's chief will run the combined company. Stock in Leucadia, a holding company with investments in eclectic industries including beef processing and medical products, dropped 66 cents, or 3 percent, to $21.14. Jefferies shares soared $2, or 14 percent, to $16.27.

HEADLINE: Academic 'Dream Team' Helped Obama's Effort

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
Late last year Matthew Barzun, an official with the Obama campaign, called Craig Fox, a psychologist in Los Angeles, and invited him to a political planning meeting in Chicago, according to two people who attended the session.
''He said, 'Bring the whole group; let's hear what you have to say,' '' recalled Dr. Fox, a behavioral economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
So began an effort by a team of social scientists to help their favored candidate in the 2012 presidential election. Some members of the team had consulted with the Obama campaign in the 2008 cycle, but the meeting in January signaled a different direction.
''The culture of the campaign had changed,'' Dr. Fox said. ''Before then I felt like we had to sell ourselves; this time there was a real hunger for our ideas.'' 
This election season the Obama campaign won a reputation for drawing on the tools of social science. The book ''The Victory Lab,'' by Sasha Issenberg, and news reports have portrayed an operation that ran its own experiment and, among other efforts, consulted with the Analyst Institute, a Washington voter research group established in 2007 by union officials and their allies to help Democratic candidates.
Less well known is that the Obama campaign also had a panel of unpaid academic advisers. The group -- which calls itself the ''consortium of behavioral scientists,'' or COBS -- provided ideas on how to counter false rumors, like one that President Obama is a Muslim. It suggested how to characterize the Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in advertisements. It also delivered research-based advice on how to mobilize voters.
''In the way it used research, this was a campaign like no other,'' said Todd Rogers, a psychologist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a former director of the Analyst Institute. ''It's a big change for a culture that historically has relied on consultants, experts and gurulike intuition.''
When asked about the outside psychologists, the Obama campaign would neither confirm nor deny a relationship with them. ''This campaign was built on the energy, enthusiasm and ingenuity of thousands of grass-roots supporters and our staff in the states and in Chicago,'' said Adam Fetcher, a campaign spokesman. ''Throughout the campaign we saw an outpouring of individuals across the country who lent a wide variety of ideas and input to our efforts to get the president re-elected.''
For their part, consortium members said they did nothing more than pass on research-based ideas, in e-mails and conference calls. They said they could talk only in general terms about the research, because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with the campaign.
In addition to Dr. Fox, the consortium included Susan T. Fiske of Princeton University; Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California, San Diego; Robert Cialdini, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University; Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago's business school; and Michael Morris, a psychologist at Columbia.
''A kind of dream team, in my opinion,'' Dr. Fox said.
He said that the ideas the team proposed were ''little things that can make a difference'' in people's behavior.
For example, Dr. Fiske's research has shown that when deciding on a candidate, people generally focus on two elements: competence and warmth. ''A candidate wants to make sure to score high on both dimensions,'' Dr. Fiske said in an interview. ''You can't just run on the idea that everyone wants to have a beer with you; some people care a whole lot about competence.''
Mr. Romney was recognized as a competent businessman, polling found. But he was often portrayed in opposition ads as distant, unable to relate to the problems of ordinary people.
When it comes to countering rumors, psychologists have found that the best strategy is not to deny the charge (''I am not a flip-flopper'') but to affirm a competing notion. ''The denial works in the short term; but in the long term people remember only the association, like 'Obama and Muslim,' '' said Dr. Fox, of the persistent false rumor.
The president's team affirmed that he is a Christian.
At least some of the consortium's proposals seemed to have found their way into daily operations. Campaign volunteers who knocked on doors last week in swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada did not merely remind people to vote and arrange for rides to the polls. Rather, they worked from a script, using subtle motivational techniques that research has shown can prompt people to take action.
''We used the scripts more as a guide,'' said Sarah Weinstein, 18, a Columbia freshman who traveled with a group to Cleveland the weekend before the election. ''The actual language we used was invested in the individual person.''
Simply identifying a person as a voter, as many volunteers did -- ''Mr. Jones, we know you have voted in the past'' -- acts as a subtle prompt to future voting, said Dr. Cialdini, a foundational figure in the science of persuasion. ''People want to be congruent with what they have committed to in the past, especially if that commitment is public,'' he said.
Many volunteers also asked would-be voters if they would sign an informal commitment to vote, a card with the president's picture on it. This small, voluntary agreement amplifies the likelihood that the person will follow through, research has found.
In a now classic experiment, a pair of Stanford psychologists asked people if they would display in a home window a small card proclaiming the importance of safe driving. Those who agreed to this small favor were later much more likely to agree to a much larger favor, to post a large ''Drive Carefully'' sign on their lawn -- ''something no one would agree to do otherwise,'' Dr. Cialdini said.
Obama volunteers also asked people if they had a plan to vote and if not, to make one, specifying a time, according to Stephen Shaw, a retired cancer researcher who knocked on doors in Nevada and Virginia in the days before the election. ''One thing we'd say is that we know that when people have a plan, voting goes more smoothly,'' he said.
Recent research has shown that making even a simple plan increases the likelihood that a person will follow through, Dr. Rogers, of Harvard, said.
Another technique some volunteers said they used was to inform supporters that others in their neighborhood were planning to vote. Again, recent research shows that this kind of message is much more likely to prompt people to vote than traditional campaign literature that emphasizes the negative -- that many neighbors did not vote and thus lost an opportunity to make a difference.
This kind of approach trades on a human instinct to conform to social norms, psychologists say. In another well-known experiment, Dr. Cialdini and two colleagues tested how effective different messages were in getting hotel guests to reuse towels. The message ''the majority of guests reuse their towels'' prompted a 29 percent increase in reuse, compared with the usual message about helping the environment. The message ''the majority of guests in this room reuse their towels'' resulted in a 41 percent increase, he said.
Salespeople have known the value of such approaches for a generation, and political campaigns have also used them before this election. Social scientists began offering their services to Democrats back in 2004, when President George W. Bush's campaign was attacking the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, as a flip-flopper and making the label stick.
Dr. Fox and others got an audience with someone in the Kerry campaign, but the meeting didn't lead to any active consulting, he said. The group circulated a paper outlining its members' expertise and proposals and in 2006 got a meeting with some senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Harry M. Reid.
Consortium members said they knew of no such informal advisory panel on the Republican side. Efforts to contact the Romney campaign were unsuccessful.
The researchers said they weren't told which of their ideas were put to use, or how. But sometimes they got hints. Dr. Fiske, the Princeton psychologist, said she received a generic, mass-market e-mail from the Obama campaign before the election.
''It said, 'People do things when they make plans to do them; what's your plan?' '' Dr. Fiske said. ''How about that?''

HEADLINE: Once Upon a Time in Tabernas

BYLINE: JESSE NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Spain's Tabernas Desert was the backdrop to countless spaghetti westerns that have become cultural touchstones. More than 40 years ago, three film studios kept the area abuzz. Alvaro Deprit returned to explore the region and found the good, the bad - and the lonely. 

 BODY:
Clint Eastwood's bizarre debate with an empty chair at the Republican National Convention left many puzzled over the actor's legacy. Will his cameo as a political gunslinger overshadow the star who rose to fame as the raspy-voiced, lone hero of spaghetti westerns?
The Spanish photographer Alvaro Deprit had a more essential question: whatever happened to the barren landscapes that once provided the backdrop for those legendary movies by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone? His films with Mr. Eastwood - "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," "A Fistful of Dollars," "For a Few Dollars More" and "Once Upon a Time in the West" - defined a new genre and became wildly popular the world over.
"Everyone in my generation was born with those movies," said Mr. Deprit, during a phone interview from his home in Rome. "They always remain in our collective imagination."
For a month and a half last winter, Mr. Deprit lived in southeastern Spain's Tabernas Desert and photographed the locations where European directors like Mr. Leone filmed their movies, mainly because the desert resembled the American West - dry, rugged, dusty - and because it required a comparatively lower budget.
Mr. Deprit, 35, who is from Madrid, said a strong sense of fiction and nostalgia pervades the Tabernas Desert today. His photographs are part record, part homage. They are his attempt to capture the surreal quality of a forsaken film location inhabited by people bound to a way of life that has long since ended.
"The feeling you get is of a world which is disappearing," he said. "It's a bit melancholy."
Three studios - Fort Bravo, Mini Hollywood and Western Leone - still sit in the middle of that desert, although they are no longer frequented by the likes of Mr. Eastwood. To the contrary, Mr. Deprit said, the studios have morphed into theme parks and tourist destinations, and have become something of a parody of their former selves.
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the Tabernas Desert was a hive of cinematic activity. Hundreds of spaghetti westerns were shot there and, for a while, the desolate landscape was awash in gunslinging, gravelly-voiced actors looking for treasure, bandits or revenge.
But after two decades of movie making, Tabernas was abandoned as a film location. Today, for a fee, tourists can wander among the old sets - many built by Mr. Leone and renovated by a hotel chain - or visit the cinema and wagon museums. One theme park offers daily "western shows" in which actors stage a gunfight in the town square, hang an outlaw near the sheriff's office, and dance the Cancan in the Yellow Rose Saloon. There is also a zoo, a restaurant and souvenir shop.
According to Mr. Deprit, 35, many of the people still living in Tabernas today are actors and stuntmen left over from Mr. Leone's time. Like Laurence Burton, a member of the Blackfoot Indian Nation in Canada (below), they stayed behind long after the film crews disappeared, hoping to find work in the tourism industry that thrived briefly, and then declined as the economy soured.
Times are tough for those actors, Mr. Deprit said. Many still dress like the cowboys they played in the movies. Some are aging and others struggle with alcoholism. In any case, it's hard to find work when you're no longer nimble enough to jump on and off a galloping horse.
"It's not just a set," Mr. Deprit said. "There are people that live there. They remind you all the time about the old times, the golden times, when many movies were made there."
But those memories cannot trump the area's reality: even the tourists who visit the area seem disappointed.
"They arrive there and realize that it's a sort of an improvised show," Mr. Deprit said. "There are a couple of gunshots and that's it. It's quite superficial."
For Mr. Deprit, documenting the fading film industry in Tabernas is part of an ongoing project about the Andalusia region in Spain. The area is changing quickly, he said, listing the economic crisis and the erosion of traditional lifestyles as evidence.
Sifting through Mr. Deprit's photographs does feel like exploring a place fading into its afterlife. Nonetheless, fans of Mr. Leone's films may still hear a familiar soundtrack playing in the background: the clip-clop of horse hooves, a swinging saloon door, rapid gunfire and then, a high lonely whistle echoing across the desert.

HEADLINE: Regulator to Press for Financial Response Team for Disasters

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Bart Chilton, a regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, plans on Tuesday to urge financial firms and federal authorities to bolster coordination in the face of future calamities. 

 BODY:
Hurricane Sandy caught Wall Street by surprise. The markets went dark for two days while Lower Manhattan, Wall Street's backyard, reeled from the storm.
Now, one financial regulator is taking steps to address the flat-footed response.
Bart Chilton, a regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, criticized the "floundering" that kept the stock market shuttered. In a speech on Tuesday, he plans to urge financial firms and federal authorities to bolster coordination in the face of future calamities.
"Now that we have this stark and frankly frightening example to work from, we'd be negligent not to move quickly to make sure that our emergency systems are comprehensive and fully tested," Mr. Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency, said in remarks prepared for a financial industry conference in New York. 
Mr. Chilton, who is also set to appear on CNBC on Tuesday morning to outline his concerns, argued in the speech that in "fair weather and foul, we need to ensure that our financial markets can continue to provide the grease for our country's economic engines."
Mr. Chilton called for the creation of a private-public task force that would convene in advance of crises like hurricanes. Calling it the Financial Market Multi-Agency Command, Mr. Chilton said the group would mandate technology testing protocols, spell out guidelines for operating in a crisis and potentially sketch a timetable for recovery efforts.
"We obviously can't predict the future, but we can - and should - attempt to think of and plan for as many contingencies as possible," he said in the prepared remarks for his speech at Sefcon, an annual gathering of the derivatives industry. 
Mr. Chilton's plans face several hurdles. A number of Wall Street task forces already exist, and most seemed to perform well in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. 
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main trade group, ran multiple phone calls with hundreds of regulators and Wall Street officials to coordinate plans for reopening the markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission advised the group. And the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of financial regulators that was created after the financial crisis, convened to analyze whether the storm posed a wider threat to the financial system.
But Mr. Chilton's concerns center on the lack of preparation in the lead up to the storm. The New York Stock Exchange was forced to scuttle plans for shifting to an emergency backup platform because several trading firms had never tested their connections to this electronic system.
The new task force, he said, could mandate "significant" advance testing.
"Not only were many firms unsure about whether their galoshes were waterproof," he said, "they hadn't even tried them on."

HEADLINE: Trouble With Numbers

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: As careful as we try to be with words, sometimes our eyes glaze over and our brains freeze when we encounter numbers. Just pausing for an extra moment over a number - does this figure make sense? - might be enough to save us from some unfortunate corrections. 

 BODY:
As careful as we try to be with words, sometimes our eyes glaze over and our brains freeze when we encounter numbers. Just pausing for an extra moment over a number - does this figure make sense? - might be enough to save us from some unfortunate corrections.
Here are a few examples from the last few weeks.
Correction, 10/3:
 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about private equity funds' growing need to get their cash holdings invested, misstated the amount of money that the firms would have to return to investors if it is not invested in the next 12 months. It is $200 billion, not $200 million. 
Aaarrgh! The most common and most frustrating numerical error of all. Confusing "million" and "billion" is not a typo - it's wrong by a factor of 1,000, an indication that we weren't thinking about what we were writing. Every reference to millions, billions and trillions should be double-checked, in every story.
Correction, 10/9:
 An article on Monday about the popularity of carwashes as a fundraising tool for various causes in Phoenix misstated the number of cars per capita. There are about 600 cars for every 1,000 residents, according to the Department of Energy, not one car for every 600 residents. 
This flunked the common-sense test. One car for every 600 people? How do they all fit? How does everyone else get around? An editor raised a question, but the reporter mistakenly confirmed the original figure. A quick check of national figures online would have made clear that this wasn't right.
Correction, 10/12:
 A headline on Wednesday about a report by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life outlining changes in Americans' religious affiliations misstated a trend. The percentage of those calling themselves Protestants has sharply declined, not the number of those calling themselves Protestants. 
A somewhat more subtle mistake. The wording in the story was correct, but the headline confused "percentage" or "portion" with "number": Study Finds That the Number of Protestant Americans Is in Steep Decline. Be careful of the nuances of numbers when condensing for a headline.
 
 More Trouble With Numbers 
Sometimes the number problem is not an error, but an omission or a lack of context to help the reader understand the numbers. An interesting sports column (10/16) about plans to renovate a famous English soccer stadium said this:
 Liverpool has yet to confirm the capacity of the new-look Anfield, but the consensus seems to be that it will grow by about 15,000 from its current size. 
Unfortunately, the story never says what the current capacity is, leaving a gaping hole in the reader's understanding of the situation.
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 The hosts insult and mock, like Alex Wagner did in recently describing Mr. Romney's trip overseas as "National Lampoon's European Vacation" - a line she borrowed from an Obama spokeswoman. 
Avoid this use of "like" as a conjunction. Make it "as Alex Wagner did."
 Still, the pace of economic activity is short of what's needed to substantially reduce the unemployment rate, now at 7.8 percent and also well below the level of growth typical in this stage of a recovery after a sharp downturn. 
We needed a comma after "percent." Without it, this reads as though the unemployment rate is "also well below..." - not what we meant.
 Sandy is expected to be a strong - perhaps historic - tropical storm that could cause severe coastal flooding, intense wind damage and knock out power to millions of people for days. 
The elements in the series are not parallel. One fix: Replace the comma after "flooding" with "and."
 "It was a stupendously bad decision to hold this race, and the fact that they pulled the plug at the last minute only hurts the very people they tried to help in the first place," said Alan Vinegrad, a former U.S. Attorney who has run six marathons, including New York City twice. 
Style: make it "a former United States attorney."
 To college students: "Because the president has been spending about a $1 trillion more every year in this country than we are taking in, he is putting debt on you that you didn't even know about. Each man women and child in this country has about $50,000 worth of government debt." 
Assuming "a" was part of the quote, make it "about a trillion dollars more."
 Each of the three songs written with Mr. Martin and Shellback feel like inside jokes about the squeaky-clean pop of eras past. 
Make it "The three songs ... all feel like inside jokes" or "Each of the three songs ... feels like an inside joke."
 In other scenes, other principals, played by actors, are filmed as if in a documentary, laconically recounting what happened to the camera. 
O.K., so what did happen to the camera? (Be careful where you put those prepositional phrases.)
 Some of these investors will succeed, and these lucky few will pay fewer taxes because of the use of these retirement plans, costing the government money that could total billions. 
We're referring to the amount, not the number of taxes, so make it "less in taxes."
 Whether they have gone through formal reparative therapy, most ex-gays agree with its tenets, even as they are rejected by mainstream scientists. 
In this case - where the meaning is "regardless of whether" - we needed to say "whether or not."

HEADLINE: In Cairo, a Curfew Against Chaos

BYLINE: ISSANDR EL AMRANI


HIGHLIGHT: The Egyptian government wants to ease the mess of Cairo life by shortening the workday. That's putting the horse before the cart. 

 BODY:
CAIRO - There aren't many advantages to living in this city. It is falling apart under the weight of overpopulation, traffic is gridlocked, the pollution is toxic, and there are few parks or other green areas in which to seek respite. But residents will proudly say that there are few cities that offer Cairo's oddly laid-back buzz. 
Part of the city's charm is that it is a genuinely 24-hour place: Cairenes think nothing of visiting a doctor at 11 p.m., shopping for shoes at midnight and having tea and a shisha at 3 a.m. One late night in New York City, I remember thinking, "Where are all the cars?" In Cairo, you'd never see an empty street in the wee hours of the morning. Taxi owners here are like airlines: they keep their vehicles humming 24 hours a day; there's no point in letting an investment stay unproductive. 
In a whimsical documentary about Cairo the late Youssef Chahine, Egypt's best-known auteur filmmaker, suggested that the city's density explained its constant activity. When three generations share a single small apartment, people sleep in shifts, and those who stay up at night need something to do.
This is why the government's recent decision - made without public consultation or forewarning - to impose closing times on shops, cafs and restaurants nationwide came as such a shock. The authorities argue that forcing stores to close early will save electricity, something of a necessity because Egypt is constantly on the brink of brownouts. (This summer there were even prolonged blackouts when the national grid collapsed because of air-conditioner use). The curfew, it is hoped, will also improve traffic by sending people home early, and impose order on residential areas that are otherwise kept awake at night by street noise.
At least that's the theory. Shopkeepers, chambers of commerce, business associations and much of the opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government say the decision will hurt an already struggling economy. Many also fear that enforcing strict closing times will only exacerbate the traffic problem, at least at certain times - especially since the government intends to impose the new rule without preparation. Metro and bus service has not been increased, for instance, and no special provisions have been made to accommodate shorter working days, like increased parking space.
After the government's original deadline for closing most shops at 10 p.m. and restaurants at midnight - Nov. 1 - came and went with nary a change in behavior, it relented. It pushed back the curfew for shops to midnight and the deadline for implementation to next week. Some restaurants and bars will also get to stay open till 2 a.m.
One wonders why the government chose this issue to tackle as the economy teeters on the brink of collapse. Some blame the Brotherhood's dour moralism. Is this, the new regulation's opponents ask, an attempt to prevent Egyptians from having fun? One Islamist preacher did defendthe move on religious grounds: "Those who object to the decision are imbeciles. They are against the implementation of Islamic law that will help build the society in a truly Islamic way," he said. 
It might be possible to promote a less indolent way of life in small towns. Yet that's hard to imagine in Cairo, and it may not be desirable. After all, the city's hectic schedule is a response to its problems. 
In most countries, opening hours are regulated to improve labor conditions and the quality of urban life. But by shortening the workday in Cairo, the Egyptian government is putting the cart before the horse: it is hoping for a better regulated city without tackling the causes of its dysfunction, namely poor urban planning, inadequate public transport and crumbling infrastructure.
If the Egyptian government started at the beginning, it might win over those of us who love the chaos of Cairo and pave the way toward making it a more efficient city. With its curfew, however, it risks provoking residents who are masters at undermining, often in surprisingly creative ways, the state's authority.

HEADLINE: Support Waivers for Anti-Tax 'Pledge'

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Some incoming Congressional freshmen, and even some incumbents, seem to be backing away from the anti-tax "pledge" sponsored by Grover Norquist's group. 

 BODY:
It is known simply as "the pledge." And if you are a Republican member of Congress, it has been considered heresy to do anything short of fully devoting yourself to its low-tax principles.
But as Congress gathers for its lame-duck session and confronts a serious set of economic and tax questions that could bring the country to the brink of the "fiscal cliff," one of the lingering questions is whether the pledge - drafted and enforced by Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform - will hold up.
Already there are indications it may not. According to a report in The Hill, the Capitol Hill newspaper, incoming members of Congress and even a few returning ones are refusing to honor it. The pledge calls for elected officials to oppose "any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates."
And, perhaps more critically, signing the pledge also includes vowing to oppose reducing tax deductions and credits. Members of both parties have signaled that they would be willing to accept a tax compromise that included eliminating certain deductions, especially those for high-income people, as opposed to a broad tax increase.
Mr. Norquist told The Hill he was not concerned that some members might walk away from the pledge. "That doesn't keep me up at night," he said.

HEADLINE: Did the G.O.P. Win the Election?

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Party leaders are pushing the Romney tax plan as a "bipartisan" solution. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday morning, Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri advised President Obama to advance Mitt Romney's tax plan. "Look at ways to increase revenue by one growing the economy" he said on Fox News, "and two, maybe look at the tax code, just like Governor Romney suggested, you look at the tax code and increase revenue without increasing taxes."
Mr. Blunt's not the only Republican to tell the newly re-elected Democratic president, who campaigned on a promise to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, that he should embrace his failed rival's scheme instead.


Rep. Dave Camp, for instance, said in a Wednesday press release that "there is a better path forward than simply increasing tax rates, and one in which both sides can claim victory. There is bipartisan support for tax reform that closes loopholes and lowers rates." Eric Cantor said in a letter to his Republican caucus that "What would be best is a fundamental reform of the tax code that lowers rates, broadens the base, makes America's business competitive again, and reduces the burden imposed by taxes on work and investment."
Mr. Obama may need to tell Mr. Cantor, as he did in 2009: "Elections have consequences and Eric, I won."
The repackaging of the Romney plan as a "victory" for "both sides" is of a piece with the argument that the election wasn't really a "win" for the Democrats, since it wasn't a referendum on policy.
Paul Ryan, in his first post-election interview, said "I don't think we lost it on those budget issues, especially on Medicare-we clearly didn't lose it on those issues." He also added he was open to a deal including "higher revenues through tax reforms."
In school I had a friend who broke up with his girlfriend in a messy fight. She showed up at his house the next morning as if nothing had happened. The Republicans are acting like that girlfriend; only they're even more delusional: They're carrying on as if the Fox pundits who predicted a Romney landslide were right.

HEADLINE: Aftermarket Industry Showing Renewed Strength

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The aftermarket accessories industry is seeing significant growth in China, the Middle East and other developing countries. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - The aftermarket automobile accessories industry is showing more strength than it has since the most recent recession, judging from the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show that concluded earlier this month at the convention center here.
The sprawling show, which has a footprint of more than 2.5 million square feet, was the biggest in its 45-year history -- attracting a record 135,000 overall attendees, including 60,000 buyers and 3,000 media members, according to Della Domingo, a SEMA spokeswoman.
"Our industry generated $29.8 billion dollars of retail sales in 2011," said Peter MacGillivray, a SEMA vice president. "We're optimistic about 2012, we're projecting as much as 4 percent growth this year. And that is just in the United States. We are also experiencing explosive new growth in China, the Middle East and other developing countries."
The industry's heyday was 2007, when United States sales topped $34 billion, Mr. MacGillivray said. Sales dropped drastically in 2008 and 2009, then started a long, slow climb.
"We are not quite back up to pre-2008 levels," Mr. MacGillvray said, "We are still in recovery mode, but where we are as an industry right now is an indication of how far we've come since everything bottomed out."
Organizers had high hopes for this year's SEMA show, but worries crept in that attendance might suffer from flight cancellations and weather delays caused by Hurricane Sandy.
"We're relieved that it didn't have much of an impact," Mr. MacGillivray said. "This show is so important to the small businesses, they'll do just about anything to get here."
He added that less than 10 percent of the exhibitors and attendees were from the northeastern part of the United States, where the storm hit the hardest. And many of those attending from that part of the country had departed before the storm hit.
"Despite the storm, it was an amazing year for the SEMA show," Ms. Domingo said in an email. "The highest number of exhibitors and attendees in all show history."
The SEMA show, which specializes in aftermarket parts and custom accessories for the transportation industry, is divided into 12 sections: business services; collision repair and refinish; a global tire expo; Hot Rod Alley; mobile electronics and technology; powersports and utility vehicles; racing and performance; the restoration marketplace; restyling and car care accessories; tools and equipment; trucks, SUVs and off-road; and wheels and accessories. This year, many automobile manufacturers - Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Hyundai and Honda among them - had especially large displays of customized vehicles.
Although the show itself is closed to the general public, this year it expanded from inside the convention center into adjacent parking lots for publicly viewable ride-and-drive demonstrations and a Global Rally Cross racing competition. After the show, the public was invited to the SEMA Cruise, a recent addition, in which all the show's thousands of cars are invited to parade out of the convention center and through Las Vegas streets.
The first SEMA show, which was little more than an informal swap meet and flea market, was held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles in 1967. The following year it was moved to the convention center in Anaheim, Calif., where it stayed for nine years, until Leo Kagen, one of the founding members of the association, relocated it to Las Vegas in 1977.
"Everybody said I was crazy to move it, because it was really doing well in California," Mr. Kagen, 96, said in an interview last month, after it was announced that a SEMA scholarship to encourage women to train as automotive re-stylists had been established in his name. "I guess I have the last laugh now!"
SEMA recently signed a contract extension to continue holding the show at the Las Vegas Convention Center through 2017.

HEADLINE: Identity Voters

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's not just Those People. 

 BODY:
So Paul Ryan doesn't believe that he and his party lost on the issues; it's just that too many of those "urban voters" (hmm, I wonder who he means) for some reason showed up at the polls.
Actually, in a way Ryan does have a point: there are ethnic and racial groups that consistently favor one party over the other in ways that seem to reflect something more than economic self-interest. In the figure below -- based on a bit of a catchall from the exit polls and the Pew pre-election poll-- the blue line shows the average relationship between income and presidential preference, and the various markets show some groups that were far off that line. (I couldn't find a good number on median income for Jewish households, but assume that it's in the same general vicinity as Asian-Americans):
As you can see, it's not just those "urban" voters who seem to vote their identity. Asians and Jewish households are much more Democratic than you might expect given their relatively high incomes, presumably because they see the GOP as believing fundamentally in a white Christian nation from which they will forever be outsiders. 
And then there's the other identity-politics minority, which is every bit as anomalous in its voting behavior as those urbanites. 
Some of the attempts to predict future trends argue that over time Hispanics will become politically "white", the way Irish and Italians did. Maybe, although somehow that hasn't happened yet to my tribe. But isn't it equally likely that over time Southern whites will finally become culturally assimilated, and start voting like the rest of their fellow citizens?

HEADLINE: Ford Introduces Transit Connect Wagon and a Bit of Category Confusion

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: With three rows of seats, the Transit Connect Wagon can seat seven passengers, just like a minivan. 

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. - Ford introduced its 2014 Transit Connect Wagon in a news conference here on Tuesday. A people-mover based on the small Transit Connect commercial van that has been available since 2009, it shares that vehicle's distinctive high-roof shape and will be offered with either a 120.6-inch wheelbase and three rows of seats or a 104.8-inch wheelbase and two rows of seats.
With three rows of seats, the Transit Connect Wagon can hold seven passengers, just like a minivan. Both second- and third-row seats fold flat, creating an abundance of cargo space behind the front seat, just like a minivan. Sliding doors on both driver and passenger sides of the vehicle, just like those on a minivan, provide easy access to second- and third-row seating and, in combination with a liftgate at the rear, make for easy loading of whatever one might wish to transport. 
"How is it not a minivan?" one of the assembled journalists asked after the presentation. 
"It's a smaller package," said Tim Stoehr, Ford's commercial truck marketing manager. 
The journalist pointed out that the subcompact Mazda5 is called a minivan.
"They can call it whatever they want," said Mr. Stoehr.
In truth, Mazda avoids the supposedly offensive minivan moniker as well, saying that the "Mazda5 refuses to be categorized." Both automakers perhaps believe that consumers find the M-word so offensive that applying it to a product would be suicidal. They could be right. 
While the Transit Connect Wagon is clearly a minivan with a high roof, unlike other seven-passenger minivans available in the United States it is expected to deliver at least 30 m.p.g. on the highway. E.P.A. fuel-economy estimates are not yet available. 
Engine choices will include Ford's 1.6 liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder and a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter. No engine specs were provided, but in the Ford Fusion the 1.6-liter EcoBoost delivers 178 horsepower, while the 2.5-liter generates 175 horsepower -- with the turbocharged EcoBoost having a stouter torque curve and slightly better fuel economy.
Mike Levine, a Ford spokesman, said the cargo space of the long-wheelbase model with both second- and third-row seats folded was over 100 cubic feet. That makes it only slightly less cargo-capable than the Nissan Quest, which measures 108.4 cubic feet. The maximum cargo area of Chrysler's Town and Country minivan is 143.8 cubic feet.
The Transit Connect provides ample legroom for all passengers, even those in the third row. The third-row seat has 5 inches of adjustment built in, and when slid all the way forward, 19.8 cubic feet of cargo space is available behind the seat. 
Several trim levels will be offered, and options will include leather seating surfaces, a touch-screen display, a rear-view camera, the MyFord Touch communication and entertainment system, and a full-glass panoramic roof.
Mr. Stoehr said no production estimates were available, but the mix is expected to be 80 percent long-wheelbase and 20 percent short-wheelbase models. The vehicle will be built in Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain. That plant builds a number of vehicles on Ford's C1 subcompact platform, so according to Mr. Stoehr, production is flexible and the mix can be adjusted to meet demand.
The Transit Connect Wagon is expected to arrive at Ford dealerships in late 2013. No pricing information is available at this time.

HEADLINE: The Cost, in Dollars, of Raising a Child

BYLINE: NADIA TAHA


HIGHLIGHT: We all know raising kids is expensive, but few people know exactly how much it costs. 

 BODY:
In an article in the Your Money special section we just published about bulletproofing your finances, I wrote about one big money move that would be awfully beneficial to my bottom line: not having children. For all that we know about how expensive it is to raise a child, however, we don't know exactly how much it costs.
So I decided to come up with an estimate, rough as it is, for what it would cost my spouse and me to have one child. I figure it would run close to $2 million by the time it was all over. How did I come up with that estimate?
The United States Department of Agriculture Department publishes an annual report on what families spend on their children, so I used that as a basis for some of my calculations and then tailored them to our own finances and geography. In 2007, The Wall Street Journal tried to improve upon the government figures, but some of the expenses they included seem based on the budgets of the truly rich, like furniture from Pottery Barn and bottled water delivery.
Without excessive expenditures, surely people like us could raise a child for more than the $435,030 the government estimates but less than the $776,000, $1 million or $1.6 million guessed at on the pages of the Wall Street Journal. Right?
I had hoped so, but my estimation of what my spouse and I might spend - and, crucially, what we might lose - having a child ended up being more than those estimates.
In order to be as conservative as possible, I stuck with the Agriculture Department's figures for the cost of food, transit, clothing and miscellaneous expenses (personal care items, entertainment, reading materials) for children in a two-parent household in the urban Northeast with a combined income of over $103,350.
Those costs are higher in New York City, but our earnings are below the average for the category we fall in, and I wanted to be conservative in my calculations. But for housing, health care and child care I changed the numbers to be more specific to where we live. I used the average cost of full-time child care in New York City for the first few years, $12,750 to $16,000, according to the Administration of Child Services, and then reverted to the Agriculture Department numbers for child care and education until age 18.
My health insurance plan would charge us nearly $4,000 more each year for an additional dependent. Co-pays, prescriptions and other therapies could easily cost another $750 each year. At some point, our hypothetical child would probably have braces as we both did, which costs $4,000 out of pocket.
To estimate the cost of housing a child, I subtracted our rent from the rent we would pay to live in our neighborhood in a more suitable space -- one with higher security, a more responsive landlord, reliable heat and better stroller-accessibility. Staying in our neighborhood and continuing to rent would keep our other costs in check, especially because of the quality of the public schools here.
Just as our parents paid most of our undergraduate tuition, my husband and I would want to help our child pay for college. To pay for half of the projected tuition at an average-price four-year public university would require we save $5,328 each year from birth to age 18, according to BlackRock's college savings calculator.
And since we would probably not cut off our child financially once he or she reached the age of majority, I added the cost of the basics (housing, clothing, food, transportation and health care) between age 18 and 25, when the child would no longer be covered under our health insurance. Later in life, when this young adult has children, we will still spend money by supporting our grandchildren at a rate of $8,289 every five years, the average according to a MetLife study of grandparents' relationships with their grandchildren.
Then there are the losses I would suffer as a working mother: half a year of forgone wages while on maternity leave and earning 73 percent of what men earn instead of 90 percent like nonmothers (or in my case, the equivalent fraction of my current salary) for the remainder of my career, according to a Columbia University study on the motherhood wage gap. This doesn't include reduced benefits like 401(k) contributions, but it still adds up to over $700,000. The flip side of this equation is what economists call the "fatherhood premium," which increases a man's earnings about 4 percent.
Of course these expenditures and losses are not the strict minimum required to raise a child - not by a long shot. But if we were to have a child and do what most other parents do by trying to give this new little life the very best start possible, it would probably cost us $1.8 million including everything I mentioned above.
Then there are other sacrifices to mental health and perhaps fiscal health, too, albeit in ways that are hard to predict. Some of those disadvantages seem readily apparent, like lower marital satisfaction, higher depression rates, plus that "mommy track."
So did you think about the cost, in dollars, of having a child before you decided to become a parent? Or do you find the whole idea of factoring in it at all to be odd?

HEADLINE: Defense Opens Insider Trading Case With Attack on Witnesses

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Anthony Chiasson and Todd Newman are accused of conspiring with six others to earn roughly $70 million from illegal trading in technology stocks. 

 BODY:
Jurors were presented with a stark choice in the insider trading trial of two former hedge fund managers. The defendants were either the senior links in a "corrupt chain" of Wall Street traders, or scapegoats for the criminal conduct of their subordinates.
On Tuesday, a jury heard opening arguments in the trial of Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager of Diamondback Capital Management. They are accused of conspiring with six others to earn roughly $70 million from illegal trading in technology stocks.
The other six defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the prosecution. Two of the six, Jesse Tortora, a former Diamondback analyst, and Spyridon Adondakis, who goes by Sam, a former analyst at LevelGlobal, are expected to be the government's main witnesses.
 They "will paint a picture of a corrupt network of professionals who chose to break the rules and to trade on inside information all in order to make a quick buck," said Richard C. Tarlowe, a prosecutor.
Yet the defense spent much of Tuesday attacking the credibility of the government witnesses. "The biggest mistake Todd Newman ever made, and the reason he's sitting here today, is because he hired Jesse Tortora," Stephen Fishbein, a lawyer representing Mr. Newman, said in his opening statement.
"Sam Adondakis is an easy, practiced liar," said Reid H. Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Chiasson. "His word cannot be trusted."
Early this year, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged the eight Wall Street traders with participating in a "tight-knit circle of greed" that relied on secret financial information provided to them by corporate insiders at the computer company Dell and the chip maker Nvidia.
The trial, in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Richard J. Sullivan, is expected to last six weeks. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison, though they probably would receive far less time.
On Tuesday, prosecutors described how confidential information moved "across a corrupt chain of people" and ultimately into the hands of Mr. Chiasson, 39, and Mr. Newman, 47. That information, Mr. Tarlowe said, gave the defendants "an unfair advantage over honest investors who were playing by the rules."
The prosecution previewed several pieces of evidence, including e-mails and instant messages among the defendants and their analysts. The communications, according to the government, suggest that in 2008 the managers had secret information about Dell's gross margin numbers, crucial figures in its earnings release. With access to those inside numbers, Level Global made $50 million and Diamondback about $2.8 million by betting against Dell stock before the company released its earnings, the prosecution said.
Lawyers for the defense spent much of their opening statements trying to distance their clients from those accused of being their co-conspirators.
Mr. Tortora and Mr. Adondakis, with a few of the other defendants, worked together earlier in their careers as technology industry analysts at Prudential Equity Group in San Francisco. Mr. Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Chiasson, said that the group referred to themselves as "the clique" and likened themselves to "Fight Club," a 1999 cult film about a secret, underground fight club.
"The first rule of the fight club is that there is no fight club," Mr. Weingarten said, paraphrasing a famous line from the movie.
The clique "traveled together, partied together, drank together, vacationed in the Hamptons together," he said. "They were very close, and they shared information as well."
But neither Mr. Chiasson nor Mr. Newman was part of this clique, and they were far removed from the original sources of inside information, their lawyers insisted. Instead, the two defendants were depicted as upstanding, hardworking portfolio managers whose investments were grounded in legitimate research.
Both defendants processed so much data over the course of a trading day, their lawyers said, that they would not have been aware of improperly obtained data. To underscore that point, lawyers for Mr. Newman showed the jury a slide highlighting how in a given year, Mr. Newman made 32,222 trades, or roughly 128 trades a day, in the stocks of 366 companies.
The defense lawyers said that Mr. Tortora and Mr. Adondakis had falsely accused their clients to protect themselves. In November 2010, Mr. Tortora had lost his job at Diamondback and was living in Florida. When F.B.I. agents knocked on his door and presented him with evidence of insider trading, his only way out was to help the government, Mr. Fishbein, Mr. Newman's lawyer, said.
"Make Todd Newman a scapegoat so Jesse Tortora does not have to face the consequences of crossing the line," said he said.
Mr. Weingarten urged the jury, which includes a dog walker and a retired postal worker, not to resent the extraordinary wealth of Mr. Chiasson, who is worth tens of millions of dollars.
"It's crazy how we pay people in our society," Mr. Weingarten said. He noted that his "beloved" New York Yankees paid Alex Rodriguez many millions of dollars a year, only to pinch-hit for him this year in the bottom of the ninth inning of a playoff game.
"In 2007, he made A-Rod kind of money," Mr. Weingarten said, referring to Mr. Chiasson. "I know you will not hold his economic success against him."

HEADLINE: Channel Surfing: 'Doomsday Preppers,' After the Hurricane

BYLINE: NEIL GENZLINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Watching new episodes of "Doomsday Preppers" in light of the Hurricane Sandy aftermath. 

 BODY:
Next time a storm or some other calamity leaves you with a refrigerator full of spoiled food and an empty stomach, you should probably not make your way to Plato, Mo., in search of sustenance. There's a 15-year-old named Jason there who has made himself a baseball bat studded with nails - a "maceball bat," he calls it - and he sounds more than eager to use it on you if you make a grab for his canned tuna.
 That's right, "Doomsday Preppers" returned to the National Geographic Channel for its second season on Tuesday night, and Jason was one of the earnest, rather frightening preppers the program introduced in back-to-back episodes. Don't worry, though; you may never get close enough to feel the wrath of his maceball bat. He might shoot you with one of his guns first.
 Of course, thanks to Hurricane Sandy, millions of people on the East Coast have freshly experienced some of the traumas these preppers prep for - loss of electric power; fuel shortages; lack of food; even looting. So there was perhaps some renewed interest in the excesses of the doomsday preppers, each of whom is expecting a different type of calamity: economic collapse, nuclear war, biological attack. Are there things these people do that might be relevant to a heavily urbanized zone like the New York area?
 Well, certainly having some canned food and bottled water makes more sense than ever, but it's hard to imagine millions of New York apartment dwellers having the capacity to store hundreds of gallons of water and gasoline each, as some of the preppers do. (Most seem to live in areas like Plato - population 109 - where land is plentiful.) And the prospect of everyone in New York owning a huge cache of weaponry is just plain terrifying.
 One of the families profiled Tuesday, the Bryants, another Missouri clan, are actually preparing for Sandy-like weather: They're afraid of a series of catastrophic tornadoes. And their segment did raise an interesting question: How do you prepare to have an adequate supply of insulin if family members are diabetic, as is the case with the Bryants?
 Another place you don't want to head next time there's a disaster is Nashville, because you might run into Big Al, who's also profiled Tuesday. He did not seem to have a studded baseball bat, but he did have a country song about prepping. Based on the excerpts in the show, it's a particularly bad country song, which is saying a lot. (Sample lyric: "You might wish you had a gun when you can't call 911.") Imagine being stuck in this guy's bunker for six months with no entertainment other than him singing it over and over.
 But seriously: What prepping have you done or thought about doing since Sandy? And are these doomsday preppers visionaries, or menaces?

HEADLINE: Grow America's Unusual Approach to Spurring New Ventures and Creating Jobs

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: It doesn't invest money in companies; it gives them money. 

 BODY:
When Alan Hall saw a hardworking neighbor fall asleep at a meeting, he knew something was wrong. The man, Mr. Hall learned, had been laid off and taken on three new jobs - newspaper delivery in the morning, accounting in the afternoon, managing a convenience store by night - to support his family.
"He was barely keeping his nose above water," said Mr. Hall, a co-founder and managing director of Mercato Partners, an investment firm. So Mr. Hall asked a company in which he is an angel investor to hire the man, who holds an M.B.A., and offered to cover his starting salary. More than a year later, his neighbor is still at work and thriving.
Mr. Hall said the experience made him wonder: "How many millions of Americans in the United States today are unemployed or underemployed and going through the same stress that Phil was? What can I do to help?" With a windfall behind him - Mr. Hall had sold MarketStar, a global sales and marketing firm he founded, to the Omnicom Group in 1999 - he'd also amassed the resources to attempt a solution. 
In March, Mr. Hall unveiled a new company, Grow America, with the stated mission of creating jobs by spurring entrepreneurship and bolstering new ventures. Mr. Hall's program doesn't invest money in companies; it gives them money. A pilot program, now underway in Utah, is on track to give away $1 million in cash and services through a series of pitch competitions culminating in January. At that time, Mr. Hall says he intends to expand his contests - along with mentoring, marketing and networking help - across the country.
"Our goal is to help 100,000 businesses next year, with the idea that they all grow and hire employees," Mr. Hall said, adding that his competitions will be open to ventures across all industries, so long as they're at one of three stages: initial idea, start-up or ready to grow. As for the program's potential success, he added, "I will measure it in how many people now work who didn't before." We caught up with him to ask a few questions:
 Q. 
 Tell us about your plans. 
 A. 
This January, we're launching our national initiative with an online competition. We'll invite people from around the country who have ideas for start-ups, along with founders of new and growth-stage companies, to participate as contestants. We'll give away $4,000 to a single company every two weeks to get the ball rolling. That totals $100,000 a year.
If the time comes when we're able to encourage sponsors and our numbers go up, then we would clearly start to do more, with cash around various categories.
The money we give away is really just a token, but it gets people introduced to the other things Grow America can provide.
 Q. 
 What else can you offer? 
 A. 
There are three other areas where we can help: mentoring, marketing and networking. The entrepreneurs we work with, they all want advice, they want counsel. They want someone to tell them what the right next steps are and how to avoid pitfalls. They like to share experiences and to talk with one another.
We've also developed an online platform for entrepreneurs to gather insight, information, knowledge that helps them with the various steps of their business. We'll have podcasts for them, webinars of all sorts.
 Q. 
 Grow America is a for-profit firm, but you're giving away money, rather than investing it. How does that work? 
 A. 
I'm coupling philanthropy with capitalism, which I believe are the two most powerful engines that move things along in the economy. In this case, I give money to companies and seek no return whatsoever. It sounds strange. But the idea is that, when I give money away, somehow I make money on the other side more abundantly. It's almost a scriptural thing for me.
 Q. 
 How will Grow America make money? 
 A. 
We'll invite sponsors to join us. It's good P.R. for them. They believe in the vision and, obviously, at some point in time they might be able to help some of the entrepreneurs with their products and services.
Beyond my money, let's say we have a sponsor, like a Microsoft, an Intel, a bank, whoever. We would be taking a portion of those sponsor dollars, applying them back to overhead, then applying the rest to the competition awards, with the hope that, at the end, there's a small profit so we can maintain what we're doing. But we're giving most of that money away.
 Q. 
 Have you tried anything like this before? 
 A. 
For the last six years, we've offered a program here in Utah called Grow Utah, holding contests and educating entrepreneurs, and those things have been very successful. We did that in every community here in the state. We've seen 7,000 new people employed and more being hired because of that initiative. Utah is a small state, but seven thousand is a pretty good jump in a state like this. I thought, "Let's take this Grow Utah model and put it on steroids."
The Utah program was funded with my money coupled with sponsor money; the other sponsor here locally has been Zions Bank. For each of the past last six years, it's been about a half a million -- split between the two of us -- per year. So about $3 million, or $1.5 apiece.
 Q. 
 Is there a company you've funded so far that stands out to you? 
 A. 
Keep in mind: I don't vote. I don't judge. I don't do anything. I just hand out money. But one company we've funded that I thought was singular was CompleteSpeech. It makes a speech-therapy device that allows immediate, visual feedback on how to pronounce the right sound. It's obviously a company that can be profitable, but here they are helping people with speech impediments in a most miraculous way.
They're going to price the device so any family in the United States could have it, any therapist could have it. We were just pleased as can be to give them $100,000 to move their company forward. They're now in the process of adding people and putting dollars into their marketing efforts. They already have customers -- they just needed additional staff to ramp up.
 Q. 
 Will you still be able to seed it at a national scale? 
 A. 
No, no. I wish I were John Rockefeller. My piece will be much more modest compared to what others will give. I'm still part of it, but my end goal is to find others who are like-minded and want to keep this initiative going for the good of the country.
We're making what we call thousands of small bets. We don't know which businesses are really going to take off. We're saying, "We don't know who will succeed, but let nature take its course. When someone takes off and starts hiring people? Happy day." We have to get as many people into the pipeline as we possibly can, connect them with resources. We believe if we get everybody thinking about this and working on it, something good will come of it.

HEADLINE: Our Long-Term Fiscal Future Is Better Than It Looks

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The Republicans have handed President Obama the tools for changing tax policies, if he is intrepid enough to use them, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Despite Republican propaganda to the contrary, the long-term fiscal problem of the United States is principally that revenues are too low. If fixing this problem required a legislated tax increase, the nation would be in serious trouble, because Republicans will forever block it as long as they have the ability. Fortunately, they handed Barack Obama the power to permanently fix our fiscal problem if he has the courage and skill to use it.
The core problem, from the Republicans' point of view, is that they stupidly enacted temporary tax cuts during the George W. Bush administration. Their expiration creates a bludgeon that could eventually beat sense into them on the tax issue.
At the time the tax cuts were enacted, I recall arguing with my longtime friend Grover Norquist that temporary tax cuts were a really bad idea. Supply-side theory has always held that permanent tax changes are vastly more powerful than temporary changes, I told him. He didn't disagree, but said the Bush tax cuts were de facto permanent because Democrats would never have the guts to permit them to expire; they would be renewed forever. People and businesses will know that, Mr. Norquist said.
That was a foolish position for political and economic reasons. People and businesses don't make the sorts of changes in their behavior that would give the economy a supply-side boost unless they have confidence that today's tax regime will be in place when the payoff from increased work, saving or investment is realized.
A perfect example is the research and development tax credit. Economic theory is clear that R.&D. needs to be subsidized because the social benefits greatly exceed what businesses can capture from it, thus leading to less R.&D. than necessary to sustain growth. For this reason, Congress created the R.&D. credit in 1981.
But the credit has never been permanent. It has expired every few years and expires again at the end of this year. Academic studies show that even though it may be de facto permanent, the fact that it isn't actually permanent in law greatly inhibits its effectiveness.

Corporations can't risk taking it into account when calculating rates of return on planned R.&.D, for it might have expired when they need it down the road. The credit ends up being a bonus for what they would do anyway without the credit.
For this reason, Republicans and Democrats support making the R.&D. credit permanent. Congress always refuses, because renewal of the credit is a great way to shake down corporate lobbyists for campaign contributions. The lobbyists don't mind, because when the credit is renewed they can demonstrate that they have added to the company's after-tax bottom line. In Washington, this is called a win-win - except for the economy, which doesn't get the R.&D. that it needs.
A key reason that the tax-rate reductions of the Bush administration failed to have any stimulative effect is because they came with expiration dates from Day 1. Republicans insisted on cutting them on a partisan basis, without negotiating with Democrats. Consequently, they lacked the votes in the Senate to overcome the so-called Byrd Rule, which limits legislation that raises the deficit to a maximum of 10 years when budget reconciliation procedures are used.
Republicans needed to use those procedures to enact their tax cuts, in order to overcome a Senate filibuster by Democrats. Permanent tax changes would have required bipartisanship, which the Republicans rejected.
In 2010, Republicans congratulated themselves that their strategy was working when they refused to negotiate with President Obama because he demanded that tax cuts for the rich be allowed to expire. Faced with an earlier "fiscal cliff" on Jan. 1, 2011, he caved to Republican intransigence and agreed to a two-year extension of all the Bush tax cuts. That extension expires at the end of this year, and President Obama has renewed his demand that taxes on the rich be allowed to rise.
Republicans like the House speaker, John Boehner of Ohio, are talking bravely about holding the line on taxes, and Mr. Boehner has dismissed the demand for higher tax rates for the rich.
But the economic and political dynamics this year are much different than they were two years ago. Then, Republicans were coming off a huge electoral victory; this year they have suffered a huge political defeat.
In December 2010, the economy was too fragile to take risks, even temporarily. President Obama had no choice but to cave. Today, the president's hand is greatly strengthened, the economy is much stronger, and he is running out of time to get America's fiscal house in order on his watch. Republicans are chastened by their defeat, and he will never hold a stronger hand against them than he does now. Therefore, taking the risks with the tax cuts, at least temporarily, is now a viable option.
If things go bad because of Republican inflexibility, the political dynamics change completely in January. At that point, Republicans have to accept whatever tax cut Obama is willing to support to replace the Bush tax cuts in whole or part. His veto pen would be enough to force Republicans to negotiate in good faith for a change, even if Democrats didn't control the Senate.
Any 2013 tax cut that would offset the effect of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire can easily be made retroactive. The Internal Revenue Service can delay changing withholding tables for average wage earners if it chooses, on the assumption that their tax cuts will be preserved under any possible compromise, thus forestalling any impact from the fiscal cliff on the vast majority of Americans.
And here's the kicker. All President Obama has to do is insist that whatever retroactive tax cuts are enacted next year be temporary. Not only will this mitigate the impact of higher taxes for the same reason that temporary tax cuts are limited in their impact, but he will have another opportunity in a year or two to bludgeon Republicans back to the negotiating table, where their adamant opposition to higher taxes will again be negated by an automatic tax increase absent Congressional action.
Revenues are just 15.8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a postwar average of 18.5 percent, which even Mr. Norquist accepts as a long-term goal. The sooner we get there, the sooner we can get the national finances on track toward sustainability.
Because Republicans now lack the power to prevent legislated tax increases, the nation is no longer held hostage to their stubborn opposition to any tax increase whatsoever, which has torpedoed every serious effort to reduce the trajectory of debt since 2010.
That is why I am optimistic about our fiscal future.

HEADLINE: Notes for Next Time

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What Republicans should learn from the Obama campaign. Hint: it's not all about the Latino vote. 

 BODY:
Thanks to David Petraeus's adultery and the so-called "fiscal cliff," it's almost possible to forget that there was a presidential election just a week ago. (And God knows the Republicans would like to!) But before the campaign disappears into the haze of social life in Tampa and tax reform proposals in Washington, here are four under-the-radar lessons from President Obama's successful re-election bid.
 Even in national races, politics is still local. 
While Mitt Romney ran a national campaign - emphasizing the economy and the unemployment rate to voters in Reno, Racine and Raleigh alike - the White House ran a much more regionalized effort. If you lived in Northern Virginia, the president's pitch focused on abortion and contraception. If you lived in Ohio, the race was a referendum on outsourcing and the auto bailout. If you watched Spanish-language television in Colorado or Nevada, the campaign was all about the president's backdoor implementation of the DREAM Act.
Some of these regional pitches mostly escaped the national press's notice. In early October, the Atlantic's Molly Ball reported on an Obama ad running quietly in rural Ohio, which attacked Romney from the right on coal, turning his environmentalist record in Massachusetts against him. After the election, Obama's Florida campaign bragged about having used Paul Ryan's past support for lifting the Cuban embargo to get a foot in the door with Florida's reliably Republican Cuban community.
On paper, some of these pitches seemed to conflict with one another. The White House's leftward pivot on abortion risked alienating socially conservative Hispanics. The raw economic nationalism of Obama's Midwest strategy made an uneasy fit with his liberalizing push on immigration. His pro-coal and anti-Cuba pitches could have prompted pushback from liberal activists.
But because the Romney campaign never found a way to exploit these tensions within the Democratic coalition, Obama was able to narrowcast successfully. He won the states he needed, not with a single unifying message, but with a series of appeals carefully calibrated to the realities on the ground.
 It's easier to fight public-sector unions than it is to fight Medicare. 
The Republican Party's overconfidence throughout the campaign season was partially inspired by the party's recent experience at the state-house level, where Scott Walker and Chris Christie had taken on entrenched liberal interest groups and survived the predictable backlash. The Walker recall election in Wisconsin, in particular, loomed large in Republican hopes for tipping that state into Romney's column: It was a case where the Democratic coalition was out-mobilized in a state that Democrats usually win, and it seemed to many conservatives to be a sign that even voters in blue states understood that what Walter Russell Mead calls the "blue social model" needed reform.
This optimistic theory tended to downplay recent counter-examples, from Ohio to California, where the blue social model proved more popular than the Republican governors attempting to reform it. But what overconfident Republicans really missed was the fact that the blue social model looks different at the state and national levels, and what works in a state-level debate may not resonate as much in a national campaign.
In many blue states, what makes the current fiscal picture unsustainable are mostly the promises that legislators have made to public-sector unions - a powerful and influential constituency, to be sure, but ultimately just one constituency, which can be successfully isolated and cast as an enemy of the common good.
At the national level, by contrast, our fiscal problems are almost all bound up in entitlement spending - and while there are specific interest groups that benefit from that spending, the ultimate beneficiaries are, well, all of us. This makes the conservative pitch on reforming Medicare and Social Security a harder sell to voters than the pitch that Republican governors have been making on union benefits and pensions. And it helps explain why, conservative optimism about the state's tilt notwithstanding, the same Wisconsin electorate that kept Walker in office last year delivered the state to the Democratic ticket pretty easily last week.
 The black vote still matters. So does the white vote. 
In the days immediately following Mitt Romney's defeat, it seemed like the only demographic issue anyone wanted to talk about was the Republican Party's problem with the Hispanic vote. But, as The New Republic's Nate Cohn has pointed out in two important post-election pieces, Romney's defeat owed as much to how African-Americans and whites voted as it did to his underperformance with Latinos.
Nationally, the black vote held at around its 2008 levels and Romney slightly exceeded John McCain's low, low, low percentages. But in the South and Midwest, black turnout was up from 2008, which helped deliver key states like Virginia and Ohio to the incumbent. For example, Cohn notes that "Obama's margin of victory in Ohio was almost entirely attributable to historic levels of black turnout in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Toledo." Meanwhile, while Romney won a record-high share of the white vote, that share was padded by huge margins across the South. In crucial states like Iowa and New Hampshire, he actually ran behind George W. Bush's 2004 totals with white voters. And there's evidence that in battlegrounds like Ohio, many Republican-leaning white voters just decided to stay home - which was all Obama really needed them to do.
The bad news for Republicans in these numbers is that their party's problems are pan-ethnic, and can't just be solved by pandering on immigration. The good news is that they have multiple places where they could plausibly improve their performance post-Obama. Just winning 12 percent of the black vote instead of Romney's 6 percent, say, or matching or exceeding Bush's performance with Midwestern whites, would go a long way toward rebuilding a Republican majority.
 The advantages of incumbency keep going up. 
The get-out-the-vote edge has shifted to the Democrats over the last eight years for a variety of reasons, from the tech community's leftward tilt to the particular talents of Obama campaign advisers like Jim Messina. But in part, like Karl Rove and George W. Bush in 2004, team Obama reaped the benefits of incumbency, parlaying their experience running a national campaign once before and the advantage of not having to go through a primary campaign into a financial and organizational edge that any rival would have had difficulty overcoming.
Such advantages have long existed in our politics, which is why so few incumbent presidents taste defeat. But with the pace of digital change so swift, and the get-out-the-vote toolkits so complex and cutting edge, the advantages of incumbency may be steadily increasing. Especially in campaigns that come down to turnout in a few key states, having four full years to hire, recruit, innovate and organize - and, of course, to carpet the swing states with field offices - can make all the difference in world.
There won't be an incumbent on the ballot in 2016. But Obama does have a debt to the Clintons to pay off, and bequeathing Hillary his campaign operation might settle it. That possibility alone should inspire any Republican who hopes to improve on Romney's showing to internalize the lessons of this campaign as early as possible, leaving plenty of time to get ready for whatever surprises await.

HEADLINE: Guest Lesson | Thinking Critically About Food in a Season of Plenty

BYLINE: SUZIE BOSS


HIGHLIGHT: The second in a series about designing real-world projects for schools, this post suggests ways for students to think about social issues around food in their own communities. 

 BODY:
 This is the second post in a series in which the education writer Suzie Boss suggests ways to use The New York TimesFixes blog and other resources as inspiration for designing real-world projects for schools. 
In her first post,"For Authentic Learning, Start With Real Problems," Ms. Boss explains the concept of project-based learning and suggests ways in which this strategy can work with recent issues in the news.
 Thinking Critically About Food in a Season of Plenty 
With Thanksgiving and the winter holidays practically upon us, it is natural to be thinking about favorite recipes and family celebrations. 
Without dampening that holiday spirit, you can turn this into a season for critical thinking with projects that encourage students to investigate why we eat what we do.
In a previous post we suggested how you might use Fixes, a series that is part of the Opinionator section of The Times, as the starting point for timely, relevant project-based learning, or P.B.L. The authors of Fixes explore some of today's most pressing social problems and the innovators working to solve them. 
Through P.B.L., students can investigate and develop solutions to similar issues, often focusing on their own communities. In the process, they learn academic content and also develop important "soft" skills, like collaboration and problem-solving. 
Let's whet your appetite with some examples.
 Filling the Grocery Gap 
In "Time to Revisit Food Deserts," the Fixes author David Bornstein highlights recent research about access to healthy foods in low-income neighborhoods. He also models the kind of questioning and analysis that you want to encourage students to do in project-based learning. Mr. Bornstein asks: "Is access to healthy food a primary barrier to healthy eating? And, if so, will increasing it lead to better health outcomes?" 
Students could bring this line of questioning closer to home by finding out whether their community fits the United States Department of Agriculture definition of a food desert. (Here's a mapping tool from the Department of Agriculture.) If students determine that their community is lacking when it comes to fruits and vegetables, they might be motivated to find out, "How can we fill the grocery gap in our neighborhood?" 
P.B.L. hooks students' interest by asking them to explore questions that matter to them. Investigating access to fresh, affordable foods in their community might involve taking surveys, mapping locations of grocers or produce carts, and interviewing nutritionists and other experts. Often, projects end with students sharing what they have learned with a public audience.
Earlier this year, for instance, high school students from CUNY's College Now at Hostos Community College set out to discover whether there are enough supermarkets in the Bronx. They wanted to find out, "Who gets supermarkets, who doesn't, and why?" Collaborating with the Center for Urban Pedagogy, they conducted consumer research in the aisles of grocery stores. They interviewed experts from fields ranging from real estate to food distribution to urban planning. They summarized their findings in a booklet about food justice called "Funky Fresh" and hosted a public event to share their research and recommendations. 
Food deserts aren't limited to urban neighborhoods. Last year, students in rural Bertie County in North Carolina designed and built a farmers' market for their community as a strategy to improve eating habits in a region where many families experience obesity-related illnesses. Read about the evolution of their project in this Edutopia post, "Studio H: How Design/Build Curriculum Can Transform a Community."
 Reframe the Food Drive 
Many schools take part in holiday food drives. Expand on this tradition by planning projects that challenge students to examine the causes and consequences of hunger, and, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, learn about the role these food drives play in emergencies. Here are some resources for inspiration:
- Start with statistics to give students a better understanding of who goes hungry."Families Struggle to Afford Food, Survey Finds" paints the big picture of what experts call "food insecurity." An online tool, "Map the Meal Gap," allows students to research and compare statistics about hunger at the country level.

 Many Right Answers 
In project-based learning, there may be multiple solutions to the problem or issue that students are investigating. That means there is room for creativity when it comes to brainstorming potential solutions. Projects also set the stage for critical thinking because students will need to evaluate the pros and cons of ideas.
To get students primed for innovative problem-solving, have them read Tina Rosenberg's Fixes column,"In 'Food Deserts,' Oases of Nutrition." She explains why in poor places like Jakarta, street food offers cheap eats but leads to poor childhood nutrition. She explains: "Overcrowded, kitchenless housing has given rise to a culture of street food that has done wonders for tourism in Asian cities - the most crowded parts of the planet. But it has also condemned tens or hundreds of millions of people to an almost nutrition-free diet."
Ms. Rosenberg describes how Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organization, has encouraged some street vendors to pursue a niche market - creating a special menu of cheap but healthy fare for children 5 and under. Vendors operate out of brightly colored carts that play music. There is education along with enterprise. As Ms. Rosenberg explains: "Four dolls on the cart represent different food groups and are named for benefits of good nutrition - Strong, Smart, Lively and Taller. The cart also has built-in toys teaching shapes or colors that kids can play with while they wait."
From that article, you could shift to a discussion of how fast-food restaurants in the United States appeal to young diners. That is a topic for which most students will have plenty of background knowledge. 
Depending on your subject area, you might design a project that explores the ethics of fast-food advertising or analyzes the economics, nutritional impact or cultural history of fast food. For a social studies project, students might investigate a recent proposal to allow food stamps to be used to buy fast food. (For background, read "No Funds for Fast Food." ) As a culminating event, students could hold a public forum and offer pro-and-con arguments about the proposal.

HEADLINE: Lessons From Another Storm

BYLINE: By TESS VIGELAND; Devin Maverick Robins contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JOPLIN, Mo.
IF you didn't live through Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath, it's hard to fathom the extent of the destruction. Photos and videos go only so far. You simply cannot understand it if you haven't been through it.
Unfortunately, plenty of Americans have been through it, in one form or another. And their empathy about the length of the recovery runs deep. ''I hope they don't get discouraged, because it does take a long time,'' said Raye Frerer of Joplin, Mo., where a tornado left a 14-mile scar last year. ''Here we are, 18 months later, and we're still not back in our home.''
Even today, you can stand on what passes for a hill in Joplin's midsection, at 23rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, look east and look west and see empty space. The trees are still gone. Apartment complexes are gone. The hospital is gone. The high school is gone.
That's what happens when an EF-5 tornado touches down, eviscerating everything in its path, as it did here on Sunday, May 22, 2011. Winds reaching 250 miles per hour tore homes and other buildings from their foundations and sent debris flying for miles, and 161 people died. 
As Joplin's residents make their way through the stages of grief, they are eager to talk about it. They want to share how they survived and how they're preparing for the next one, because they now understand that this kind of disaster can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time. We all know the risks, and we promptly learn to ignore them. After all, you can't function very well if you live in daily fear of disaster.
But you can prepare yourself for the possibility, however remote, that something like what happened to the people of Joplin -- or New Orleans, or Northridge, Calif., or New York City and the surrounding areas last month -- will happen to you. And one of the easiest steps you can take is to disaster-proof your finances.
The tornado here caused nearly $3 billion in damage. Some 61,000 insurance claims were filed, with a total payout of more than $2 billion. Of that, 31 percent went to homeowners and 5 percent to people who lost their cars and trucks.
But many people did not get as much relief as they had expected. The long road back to financial wellness has been more difficult than it perhaps had to be. And those lessons have stayed with them.
The Rising Storm
Ms. Frerer, 58, was at her mother's home south of Joplin that Sunday afternoon. They were celebrating Mother's Day a week late, and her mother, who is close to 80, looked out the window from a small breakfast nook and said, ''That's the blackest cloud I've ever seen!'' Ms. Frerer turned to her husband, Fred, and told him she didn't want to get her hair wet, so maybe it was time to head home.
Mr. Frerer, 60, is retired, and Ms. Frerer is a teacher. When they got to their house in Joplin, Mr. Frerer stood in the road to check the sky. When he came back in, he grabbed a twin mattress from one of the beds, and the two of them settled onto the floor of their small bathroom with the mattress on their heads.
''My chest started getting tight and my ears, all of a sudden they started popping,'' Ms. Frerer said. ''They must have popped hundreds of times. And I thought, 'Lord, what on earth am I going to do?' I thought, 'God, I'm prepared to meet you.' ''
She had been through tornadoes before, and they usually sounded like freight trains. ''This one sounded like World War III,'' she said. ''You could feel it, almost like a cosmic tug of war between good and evil.''
The house shook, objects pummeled the walls outside the bathroom, and then, as suddenly as it had arrived, the storm ended.
They stood up from under the mattress and opened the bathroom door. Ms. Frerer could see that the nearby middle school had been destroyed, and she wondered whether there would be school tomorrow. Then she realized she shouldn't be able to see outside.
''I stepped into the hall, and the only part of that house still standing was the bathroom that we were in,'' she said.
Money issues take an obvious back seat to the imminent possibility of death at moments like this. But they surface fairly soon after.
The Frerers were more prepared than many people are, and for that they credit Financial Peace University, the biblically tinged educational enterprise of Dave Ramsey, a nationally syndicated talk-radio financial adviser. One of the so-called baby steps Mr. Ramsey recommends is to set aside $1,000 where it is easily accessible. The Frerers had some of that amount stashed in a small safe in their bedroom closet. The closet wasn't there after the tornado, but the safe was.
They kept another portion of the money in an envelope that ended up embedded in a vent. They remembered the cash a couple of days after the storm and were able to retrieve it.
Disaster preparedness experts say cash is an important element of any emergency planning, because you don't know if banks will still be standing or if A.T.M.'s will be operational. But a common question is how much you should have on hand. Ted Beck, president of the National Endowment for Financial Education, suggests the same amount as emergency officials recommend for food and water: three days' worth.
The Frerers also had homeowners' insurance. Ms. Frerer contacted their insurance company, State Farm, that first night as they took shelter nearby at her brother's house. She got through despite spotty cellphone coverage but had to leave a message when no one picked up. (With so many cell towers down, calls were hard to make. Text messages, she learned, were more likely to go through because they are shorter bursts of data.)
She said one lesson she and her husband learned was that people should try to build a close relationship with an insurance agent, so the agent will try to contact them if a disaster happens. Another couple in their neighborhood had such a relationship, and six days after the storm, that couple had keys to a fully stocked temporary apartment.
The Frerers spent the first few days staying with friends and family, trying to figure out what kind of financial assistance they would get from insurance and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. By the time they started looking for rental apartments or hotel rooms, there weren't any available. Ms. Frerer said another lesson was to go ahead and book something immediately after a disaster, assuming you can afford to front the money before seeking reimbursement from your insurance company.
When the insurance adjuster arrived two days later, she gave the Frerers a check for about $1,000. Several weeks later, another adjuster told them they were about $30,000 short of what they needed to rebuild their home to what it had been. That was in large part because the cost of supplies and materials skyrocketed in the Joplin area after the storm. The couple looked into buying an existing house, but prices for those also went up because of high demand and diminished supply -- the tornado had destroyed 7,000 homes.
''My house was insured for more than the house down the street sold for six to nine months before,'' Ms. Frerer said, ''so I thought, 'Hey, we're good to go.' Well, not necessarily.'' She said she had begun checking her insurance coverage yearly and making sure she understood every part of her policy. Mr. Beck, the National Endowment for Financial Education president, suggests doing this at the same time you do the annual check of smoke detectors in your home, so it becomes a habit.
One bit of bureaucracy the Frerers came up against was the insurance company's demand for a detailed list of the contents of their destroyed home, including what they paid for each item, its current value and its replacement value. ''Like, I have 16 T-shirts or I have 22 pairs of whatever,'' Ms. Frerer said. ''What kind of toiletries, makeup -- I kid you not. The detail they wanted was overwhelming.''
She had a receipt box for major purchases, but not for smaller items. And that box? ''It's probably blown across to Illinois by now,'' she said.
Mr. Beck said that without receipts, the best way to prove what you owned was with photos and videos. Every year or two, walk around your house and take a detailed inventory of what you own. Put the videos or photos on a DVD or thumb drive and keep it in a safe deposit box or somewhere else outside your home, or store it online. You can also give copies to family members who do not live in your area.
The Frerers are now living in a small rental while they build a new, large house less than a mile from the one that blew apart. The school district bought their old land for rebuilding. Because of the insurance shortfall, they are dipping into their savings and retirement funds. They say their financial recovery was helped by the fact that they had paid off their mortgage and had no debt. But Ms. Frerer's voice still catches when she thinks about how much worse it could have been.
''It makes us thankful for things that aren't financial,'' she said. ''I'm not going to dwell or think about what I've lost. We come from pioneer stock, so that's the way we want to live. We're just going to pull up our bootstraps and thank God for what he provides and get on with living.''
Starting All Over
Michael and Tabitha Davison were apart on the night of the tornado. He was at a home south of the tornado's path with their 15-year-old son and a youth group from the church where he works as a custodian. She teaches at a private religious school and was with their daughter, Emma, at the family's home, directly in the tornado's path, trying to fix a plumbing problem: a shower head that had leaked for the entire decade since they bought the house, just before Sept. 11, 2001.
''I mention that as an important detail,'' Ms. Davison, 39, said. ''We moved into the house with a tragedy, and we left the house with a tragedy.''
Joplin's warning sirens first sounded around 5:10 p.m. Ms. Davison said she didn't hear them. Mr. Davison, 42, texted her, ''Don't worry, we're in the basement,'' which alerted her to the coming storm. About 10 minutes later the sirens sounded again. She looked out the window and didn't see anything, and the radar on local television news showed what seemed like a small storm cell. But as a resident of Tornado Alley, imprudence was not her style.
She and Emma, 12, moved to the one room in the house -- the laundry -- with an exterior wall and an interior wall between them and the direction the storm was coming from. They dragged in a large cedar chest, and Emma climbed in with a few stuffed animals and her iPod. Ms. Davison sat down next to the chest, placed her hand inside to keep contact with her daughter and hoped for the best. And then, the tornado was upon them.
''Trains are nothing compared to this sound,'' she said. ''You hear this ferocious thing just hitting your house, and you start to feel the walls moving. We were praying the Lord's Prayer. It sounds melodramatic now, because we were not injured in any way, but at that time I faced my death, and possibly the death of my child.''
Emma started crying as rain began to fall on them -- on the first floor of a three-story house.
They emerged to find a living room that opened to the sky, and a second-story staircase to nowhere. A van outside the house was decimated. In one bit of good news, they found all three of their cats unharmed.
Ms. Davison's mother had always told her to get replacement cost insurance, as opposed to what is known as an actual cash value payment. With a cash value policy, the insurance payment is for what your home and its contents were worth before they were destroyed. Replacement cost insurance covers what it would cost to buy all of your belongings new, whenever you need to replace them. Replacement cost coverage is usually 10 to 20 percent more expensive than cash value coverage, but the Davisons chose that option through their insurance carrier, Horace Mann.
Their policy included an inflation guard that automatically adjusted to cover increases in rebuilding costs. That saved them from the gap experienced by the Frerers when construction materials became so expensive after the storm. The policy also included $10,000 worth of debris removal and demolition costs, as well as money to pay for a rental property, which they did not use because so many friends and family members opened their homes.
Because the Davisons' insurance was so comprehensive, they moved quickly to buy another home. They didn't want to deal with all the decisions involved in building a house from scratch, and they didn't want to stay in their old neighborhood, where all the trees were suddenly gone. Within six weeks, they had a check in hand large enough to pay off their mortgage and to cover the full cost of the new home, which they got at a discount because they were able to pay cash.
They also had some money to restock the new home, including with a few major appliances. Ms. Davison said people tended to forget about all the little things they own. ''Think about replacing all your spices at $3 or $4 or $5 a bottle,'' she said. ''When you have to start a whole house, you buy everything from scratch all at once.''
The Davisons were also lucky that both of them were able to keep working. The church where Mr. Davison works sustained damage, but not enough to keep him off the job, and Ms. Davison's school was not in the tornado's path. They said the insurance payout involved a significant amount of paperwork, particularly when it came to buying the house, but it still took them only two months to get into their new home. For that, they praised their insurance company.
Ms. Davison said that one important element of preparation was knowing how to get access to medications after a disaster. ''If you're going to put together a kit, one thing that would be really good to have is just the names of your prescriptions and how many milligrams you're taking,'' she said.
This was a common problem faced by Joplin residents. Stephanie Brady, vice chairwoman of Joplin's long-term recovery committee, noted that many pharmacies, including the local Walmart, were damaged or destroyed, as was a hospital and several other large medical buildings. ''That was one of the big expenses that people had,'' she said. ''They've lost their prescriptions and they couldn't get a new one, an actual script, let alone have the money to purchase it again.''
Ms. Davison said she wished she and her husband had thought to put shoes on as the tornado approached, and that would be a priority next time. They also now have a fire-safe box containing important household documents, after losing their college diplomas and marriage license in the storm. But even if they had done all of this before May 22, 2011, they said no plan would have been sufficient for what happened.
New, and Stronger, Shelter
Carrie Cook, 39, works in the advertising department of the local cable television company. She was supposed to be cleaning her apartment that Sunday evening. An inspection was scheduled the next day, an annual walk-through that occurs in rental housing subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as hers is. Instead, she had driven to her mother's house for dinner with her 9-year-old son, Zachary. As they arrived, the sirens sounded. She asked her mother if they should leave the area, but dinner was in the oven, so they decided to stay. Minutes later, Ms. Cook's ex-husband drove up with their other son, 7-year-old Aidan.
''He said, 'Everybody get in the car!' And he told my mom, 'You're coming, too,' '' Ms. Cook said. ''We got in his truck and drove to my dad's house, and as we were going into his storm shelter the fence and everything was falling down, so we were in the middle of it. It was right on us real fast.''
After the tornado passed, they drove back to her mother's house. A trip that usually took 10 minutes took more than 30 because of downed power lines and other debris on the roads. Her mother's house was still standing, while others around it had been ripped from their foundations, but it was not habitable. Ms. Cook's car, still sitting in the driveway where she had left it, was destroyed. ''It looked like a bomb had blown off in it,'' she said. ''The windows were all gone, shot out.''
She wasn't going to leave her mother there that night, so she suggested they all stay at the apartment complex. Instead, her father and ex-husband insisted on going alone to check on it. They made a videotape of that journey, and in viewing it again recently, Ms. Cook choked up. The top floor of the two-story complex was sheared away. Their first-floor apartment was uninhabitable. ''They had brand-new beds that my dad and their dad had just built for them,'' she said of her sons. ''They had those for one week. All you could see underneath was drawers of their pajamas.''
Added Aidan: ''There was a Dumpster in our living room.''
Ms. Cook said the calculation of what this could do to their finances started that night. ''When I saw the picture of my apartment and I had already seen my car, all that processing started,'' she said. ''I couldn't sleep. I immediately went into panic mode: 'Where are we going to live?' ''
For the first few nights they stayed in hotels, courtesy of her mother's employer, and after that in a succession of apartments.
The saving grace for Ms. Cook was that she had renter's insurance. A recent survey by the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, showed that less than a third of renters in the United States purchased renter's insurance, despite owning an average of $30,000 worth of household goods. The Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, another industry group, said the cost of insuring that amount of property was about $12 a month, which would also cover $100,000 worth of liability if someone were injured on the premises.
''I got my first check within five days,'' Ms. Cook said. And what led her to buy that insurance? ''I didn't get it because I was afraid of a tornado,'' she said. ''I got it because I couldn't control what anybody else did'' in the apartment building.
Ms. Cook did not work for three weeks after the storm because her sons' day care had no electricity, and she was sorting through what little was left of the apartment.
She said she still felt that she had been underinsured -- and the insurance she did have meant she did not qualify for FEMA assistance, despite repeated appeals for aid.
FEMA's Individuals and Households Program provides grants of up to $31,500 for temporary housing and repairs, as well as replacement of some essential household items. But money paid out in the immediate aftermath of a disaster must be repaid once an insurance settlement is received, and any money FEMA provides as a supplement to insurance is only for repairs to an existing home, not for the cost of rebuilding one.
Like Ms. Frerer, Ms. Cook found it difficult to complete the required inventory statement. ''I had to remember what else I'd lost, such as my grandmother's ring that I'd gotten as a sweet 16,'' she said. ''It was difficult to remember, it was depressing and it was time-consuming.''
She had also opted for full coverage on her car, instead of just liability, even though it was paid off. That meant another insurance check that covered the cost of an equivalent used car.
Ms. Brady of Joplin's long-term recovery committee said the lack of adequate vehicle coverage was a significant issue for a lot of lower-income families that carried only liability insurance. She said that 18,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed and that public transportation wasn't available for two weeks after the storm. ''So a lot of people lost their jobs because they couldn't get to it because they didn't have that transportation, and it just compounded the situation,'' she said.
Like the Frerers, Ms. Cook is a follower of Dave Ramsey, the talk-radio financial adviser, and she did have some cash hidden in a piece of furniture in her apartment. That was one piece that was still intact after the storm came through. It wasn't a lot, but at that point every dollar was helpful. She said she was able to get through the first few months in large part because of the kindness of strangers. ''People from everywhere donated money,'' she said. ''They'd hand you a Bible and it had $20 in it. They would just come up to you and give you gift cards.''
Ms. Cook recently moved into one of 65 homes that Habitat for Humanity is building this year in Joplin. She said getting the house was ''a work of God.'' She filled out an application after the storm, and the organization sent someone to interview her family. They fell into the sweet spot for Habitat -- somewhere between the people who make too little to maintain a house properly and those who make enough to buy one on their own.
''We are able to look at this tragedy as one of the best days of our lives,'' she said. Habitat even built them a storm shelter, so she and the boys have somewhere to escape to when the next tornado comes.
In their new house, all around, they hear the din of construction on the other houses that are slowly rising from the ruined streetscape. It nearly drowns out the chimes they've placed on their brand-new front porch. But not quite.

HEADLINE: Opting Out of Parenthood, With Finances in Mind

BYLINE: By NADIA TAHA

 BODY:
MOST people want to be sure that they can buy and pay for a home, save up for an emergency fund and enjoy a comfortable retirement. They will go to great lengths to meet those goals, and they make life choices accordingly.
My husband and I, both in our late 20s, share those kinds of goals with others like us, but it seems obvious that the single decision that can best help us achieve them is one that many newly married, affluent young adults don't usually consider: Don't have children.
To many, this may seem like an extreme measure -- heresy, even. But opting out of parenthood isn't such a fanatical financial move. In fact, it's rather prudent.
My reasoning starts with the numbers and how nobody has any good ones that address the actual costs of raising a child from birth through age 40. And yes, for many parents, it really can take that long. 
The Agriculture Department, which publishes an annual report on what American parents spend on their children, estimated in 2011 that a middle-income couple spent $12,290 to $14,320 a year on a child, depending on the child's age and where they lived. Couples in our income bracket who live in the urban Northeast spent $22,760 to $27,720 per child.
But the study omits some major expenses, like college, and it cuts off at age 17, when adolescents have started driving and venturing into other life experiences that generally cost more. Also absent is an accounting of indirect costs, like forgone earnings. ''We don't include that because we don't have good data on that,'' said Mark Lino, the economist behind the study.
What's more, those figures include only a fraction of the expenditures that might not be made if a family had no children, like buying a house in a neighborhood with better schools or getting a family pet.
For most of history, having children was a given, but the availability of contraception has made it a lifestyle choice, something you can plan for. Compared with previous generations, more women today are forgoing having children. The Pew Social and Demographic Trends report found that in 2008 the percentage of American women who did not have children by their early to mid-40s was double what it was in 1976.
Having children has enormous financial consequences, but anyone trying to determine just how high those are will have a difficult time. Tools to help you decide whether you can afford to have a child are harder to come by than retirement calculators. The books that I've found on the subject, like ''Maybe Baby'' and ''Why Have Kids?'' mention little more than the idea that money gets tighter when there are more mouths to feed.
''People who haven't had children are completely unaware of the extreme financial impact it has on your life,'' says Kristin Harad, a certified financial planner who founded VitaVie, a company that specializes in helping new parents. ''They are absolutely shocked.''
Not only are children expensive, but any estimate of their lifetime cost has to include the often significant loss of income from becoming a mother, even if she continues working full time.
It's important to remember that the costs don't necessarily disappear completely once children leave the nest, or even after they finish college, get jobs or even marry and have children of their own. Thanks to wage stagnation and high unemployment and underemployment, more young adults are living with their parents, or accepting financial help to live on their own.
I cannot fathom how anyone could enter into this without a number of some sort in mind, so I decided to come up with a rough estimate of what it would cost my spouse and I to have a child.
I started with Dr. Lino's figures in the Agriculture Department report. I then added housing, child care, health insurance, public university tuition and other expenses. You can see how I broke it down in a post on the Bucks blog.
If we were to have a child and do what most other parents around us do in trying to give a new life the very best start possible, we would probably spend over $1.7 million in today's dollars.
The number is actually the easier part of all. Deciding whether to have children is so difficult because it requires evaluating benefits you simply cannot know or understand unless you experience them firsthand.
Some people have a profound emotional desire to have children. But I don't. Young as we are, it would take a pretty big financial, practical and emotional shift for that to change.
My husband and I have good jobs, a supportive family and a happy home. We both enjoy being around children and find babies unfailingly adorable.
Still, financial security is a very high priority. My worry that I may not always be able to guarantee that for my family is a major factor in my decision-making, although it's hardly the only consideration. And while I may never feel financially at ease enough to comfortably afford children of my own, I take heart in knowing that my husband and I will be able to give an extra boost to the young people in our lives we already know and love, and the others that we will grow to love.
Part of what I imagine makes parenting so hard is the challenge of making financial compromises, and the emotional fallout from those choices. It must be difficult to accept that no matter how you set aside your own interests, you cannot afford the very best of everything for your child.
And sometimes the interests of a parent and a child conflict head-on. Parents see their original financial goals derailed in favor of new ones. Saving money and paying down debt is even harder when earnings have diminished and expenses have increased because of the addition of a new stakeholder who is now the most important priority.
''But who will care for you when you are old and sick?'' some well-intentioned people ask. I don't believe in bringing people into the world for personal gain, and even if I did, swapping the supposed promise of elder care for the certain need for us to provide child care is not worth it.
I've learned from firsthand experience that the professional support that comes from good long-term care and health insurance policies is superior to what family can offer. When I was the primary caregiver for my father as he was dying of pancreatic cancer, it was painfully clear to me that regardless of how much I loved him and how hard I tried to care for him, a qualified professional would have done a better job.
Besides, children are not an insurance policy for eldercare. Health care providers will tell you that hospitals and nursing homes serve many parents and grandparents who don't have regular visitors.
Parenting involves lots of sacrifices, and that is partly why I am disinclined to try it. But choosing not to have children does not reflect selfishness, or at least no more than parents display in having children in the first place. People don't decide to have children because those hypothetical offspring need someone to care for them; those children's needs don't exist until they are brought into the world.
People choose to become parents for all kinds of reasons: because they crave the emotional connection that comes with loving and being loved and needed by a child, to pass on their genetic and cultural traits and to strengthen other family bonds.
And if we decide against doing so, it will partly be out of concern for the welfare of others. My husband in particular worries that creating more human lives strains an already overtaxed planet.
I tried to glean some insight from my discussions with women who are personal finance and parenting experts. I hoped they would help me reconcile the knowable and unknowable advantages and disadvantages of having children. Instead I was assured that a cost-benefit analysis was neither necessary nor helpful, and that one day I would feel the urge to procreate, and so I would.
The more compelling conversations were with other mothers -- neighbors, friends and co-workers -- to whom I casually mentioned that I was writing an article about considering not having children. Before I could even put it in a financial context, more than a few of them cut me off to say just three words: Good for you.

HEADLINE: A New Coronation for the King of the Elephants

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE Republican Party may have had a tough night last week, but elephants wearing golden crowns will soon be a common sight around the country: Babar, king of the elephants, and his queen, Celeste, are the stars of an elaborate promotional campaign that is now under way.
The campaign, with advertising, marketing and retail elements, seeks to reintroduce the Babar brand to American children and to their parents and grandparents. It is being billed as the 80th anniversary of Babar, looking ahead to next year: the English-language version of the first Babar book, ''The Story of Babar,'' appeared in the United States in 1933, two years after the original French version was published. 
Among those observing Babar's eight decades are Saks Fifth Avenue, which is stocking boutiques with Babar merchandise and featuring the character in store windows and holiday catalogs; Abrams, the publisher of Babar books; Books of Wonder, the children's bookstore in Manhattan; and licensees like Yottoy Productions, which will make plush toys and other playthings.
The celebration is being overseen by two companies that work in tandem to manage the Babar brand: Nelvana, a division of Corus Entertainment that specializes in children's entertainment, and the Clifford Ross Company, which represents artists like Edward Gorey as well as familiar characters like Babar and Tom Swift.
The Babar campaign, with an advertising budget estimated at $100,000, is an example of the kind of nostalgic appeal known as comfort marketing, which is particularly popular in uncertain economic times. The campaign combines two aspects of comfort marketing: an anniversary commemoration and classic characters.
''It's a strategy used regularly in the children's marketing business, and when it's well executed it can reinvigorate a property,'' said Marty Brochstein, senior vice president for industry relations and information at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association. Among the other examples he offered were Clifford the Big Red Dog and Thomas the Tank Engine.
The ''approval and empathy'' generated by the fact that parents and grandparents may remember Babar give the character ''a seal of approval,'' Mr. Brochstein said. ''The classic nature of a Babar is a security blanket for retailers and licensees.''
Andrew Kerr, head of consumer products for North America and the Australia-Asia region at Nelvana, acknowledged the challenge, particularly in North America, of ''taking a brand perceived to be an overseas brand and bringing it to life on shelf in retail.''
That process has been aided by a new animated children's television series, ''Babar and the Adventures of Badou,'' in Canada and the United States. (Badou is a grandson of Babar's whose age, 8, makes the character more relatable to its target audience.)
Nelvana and Ross are looking to sell Babar books and merchandise ''across three strata of retail,'' Mr. Kerr said.
The top tier is composed of stores like Saks and Books of Wonder, which are frequented by many older parents and grandparents.
Books of Wonder is representative of the ''independent book retailer,'' Mr. Kerr said, which is to be ''rewarded for supporting the Babar brand over the last several decades.''
Peter Glassman, president and owner of Books of Wonder, is an admirer of Babar's.
Babar has long been ''one of the mainstays of our classic picture book section,'' Mr. Glassman said, so when Nelvana approached him about the anniversary celebration, ''we were flattered and thrilled to participate.''
''They're working with us to transform the store into a Babar wonderland,'' he added. In addition to Babar books, this ''wonderland'' will include products from Yottoy, like plush dolls bearing the Yottoy brand, and wooden toys made by a French company, Vilac.
Mr. Glassman said he was wary of overcommercializing Babar. ''Nelvana shares a sensitivity to the Babar material,'' he said. ''If they had done Babar beer, or Babar ninja figures, I would have been upset. So far, everything is being done with a great deal of respect.''
The second retail tier consists of outlets like department stores, and the third tier of mass-market retailers like Target and Walmart. The Babar campaign's initial efforts are focused on the top tier, Mr. Kerr said, and the others will follow in a year or two.
Yottoy supplies merchandise based on licensers' classic and contemporary characters to all three retail tiers. Its customers include Books of Wonder and Saks on the high end, Barnes & Noble in the middle and Toys ''R'' Us on the mass-market level.
Yottoy specializes ''in a lot of classic properties,'' said Kate Clark, the company's president and co-founder. She listed examples like Paddington Bear, Madeline and the Velveteen Rabbit.
In those instances, said Peter Doodeheefver, Yottoy's creative director and co-founder, ''we try to create a toy that evokes the feel of the time the character originated in.'' So the Babar and Celeste plush toys ''have a classic silhouette that represents the classic toys from almost 80 years ago,'' he said, ''like your grandmother played with them.''
Mr. Brochstein said he thought Nelvana and Ross were ''doing all the right stuff'' to stimulate interest in Babar, and added that having an upscale retailer like Saks as a partner was appropriate for a character born in France. ''There, the European aspect of Babar works,'' he said. ''It makes total sense.''
Sometimes, though, Mr. Brochstein cautioned, licensers ''catch bad luck'' -- as when, for instance, another character being introduced at the same time ''pushes to the side'' the one the licensers are bringing out.
Mon Dieu! Would anyone dare do that to the king and queen of the elephants?

HEADLINE: Newly Elected State Senator Defects to Republican Party

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
The Republican Party, which emerged from Election Day with its leadership of the State Senate in serious doubt, persuaded a Brooklyn Democrat to switch sides on Tuesday, increasing the odds that Republicans would retain control of the chamber. 
The Democrat, Simcha Felder, a former city councilman who is a deputy to the New York City comptroller, John C. Liu, defeated a Republican incumbent, David Storobin, last week. Mr. Felder had said he was open to aligning himself with the party that best served the needs of his district, and on Tuesday he announced his decision after meeting with the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican.
''I have enormous respect for the senators from both parties, but I must choose to caucus with those senators who will best serve the communities I represent,'' Mr. Felder said, citing economic development, education and taxation as among his concerns.
Both Republicans and Democrats are predicting that they will control a 63-seat Senate in January. After Election Day, the Democrats had 31 seats in the Senate, compared with 30 for the Republicans, but two races remain too close to call and depend on absentee ballots.
Democrats hold narrow leads in the two undecided races, which would give them a one-vote majority after Mr. Felder's defection.
''The voters sent a clear message on election night that they want the Senate led by a Democratic majority,'' a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, Mike Murphy, said, adding, ''We look forward to working with Governor Cuomo to achieve the progressive agenda he has laid out.''
But Republicans are trying to woo four Senate Democrats who, unhappy with the leadership of their caucus, formed an Independent Democratic Conference in 2011. Mr. Skelos met last week with their leader, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx; a spokesman for Mr. Klein declined to comment on Tuesday night.
Elected officials have suggested that Mr. Skelos could negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the Independent Democrats or other disaffected Democrats to control the Senate. In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Skelos said that he believed the Republicans would ''be back in the functioning majority.''
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, last week used the phrase ''governing coalition'' to describe his expectation of Senate leadership next year.

HEADLINE: Saving a Program That Saves Lives

BYLINE: By KENNETH J. ARROW. 
Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economic sciences in 1972, is an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University.

 BODY:
Stanford, Calif.
EVERY year, some 30 million children in Africa survive the first few perilous weeks of life, but within five years 2.5 million of them die. More than a half million of these deaths are a result of an easily curable disease: malaria.
In recent years, some progress has been made against malaria, which is caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The world spends roughly a billion dollars a year trying to contain the disease -- mostly through insecticide-treated bed nets -- and treating it at government-run clinics. 
But just as nets are vulnerable to holes and wily mosquitoes, so, too, have our efforts to treat malaria been plagued by gaps, failures and the extraordinary cleverness of the pathogen itself. In the past, for example, the disease was cured by a decades-old drug called chloroquine that was largely sold over the counter. The falciparum parasites, though, grew resistant to it.
Then, 10 years ago, the World Health Organization recommended abandoning chloroquine in favor of a very effective combination therapy based on artemisinin (A.C.T.). But that regimen has been far too expensive for most malaria sufferers, many of whom end up buying the cheaper, ineffective chloroquine from local shops.
That was the dilemma facing a United States Institute of Medicine committee that I led in 2002. We were asked to recommend ways to make authentic A.C.T.'s available and affordable where malaria is endemic, including in remote areas where public hospitals or clinics are distant, costly and -- once reached -- often out of the drugs.
The answer we arrived at was remarkably straightforward: to subsidize the therapy and sell it as cheaply as chloroquine in Africa's private pharmacies and shops, where half of all patients first seek treatment for malaria-like fevers.
That idea was at last put in place in 2010, when the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria began a pilot program in which it provided a ''co-payment'' to the manufacturers of A.C.T.'s, thereby allowing commercial wholesalers and private or government health services to purchase the drugs at a fraction of the already low negotiated price. The program, known as the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), was introduced in seven African countries, covering about a third of the area where malaria is endemic on the continent.
Strikingly, it has worked. Since 2010 the private sector has moved subsidized A.C.T.'s rapidly through standard supply chains to urban and rural Africans at prices poor families can afford. Independent researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and ICF International, a consulting group, recently published their formal evaluation in The Lancet, concluding that the initiative met high benchmarks for availability and price everywhere it was substantially implemented, even in remote rural areas.
Still, it may not end well for AMFm. The Global Fund is to meet on Wednesday, with American representatives in attendance, to consider what comes next. The recommendations on the table are to cut back, not expand, the subsidy program.
Critics have said that the evaluation of the pilot program is not definitive because it was not designed to count the number of children's lives saved. In addition, some point out that AMFm allows people who believe they are suffering from malaria, but who may in fact be sick from something else, to buy the drugs without a firm diagnosis.
There is truth to both of these claims. And yes, in an ideal world, all sick people would be properly diagnosed and treated with the right medicine at the right time in a public clinic close to home. But decades of investment have not produced a working health care system in most of Africa, especially in poor rural areas.
This initiative is an interim measure to ensure that fewer children die for lack of effective anti-malarials, while efforts continue to help build effective public health systems. Universal diagnosis is certainly desirable, but even long-established treatment (and much smaller) programs do not properly diagnose every illness. Moreover, diagnosis makes sense only if the treatments that follow are both affordable and accessible.
During the last few years, we have learned a lot about using private markets to deliver lifesaving treatments. ''Version 2.0'' of AMFm could be improved, perhaps by encouraging the effective use of diagnostic tests.
The risk is that efforts to develop and implement ''the perfect'' will end up killing ''the good'' in the process. That has long been the playbook for too many in the global anti-malarial community -- the governmental agencies, charities and nongovernmental organizations that have spent billions but found few perfect solutions to date.
These experts have had their say. It's high time that we also listen to malaria-control program managers from the pilot countries where AMFm has been in place. Last month, at a meeting held by the Institute of Medicine in Washington, those managers voiced unanimous support for continuing and expanding the program and warned of serious consequences if A.C.T. prices rose.
They, and many others are asking now, in what world does it make sense to abandon a simple program that saves lives?

HEADLINE: $375.1 Million Art Sale Is Sotheby's Record

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
''I have all the time in the world,'' Tobias Meyer, Sotheby's principal auctioneer, said on Tuesday night as he leaned over the lectern and flashed a smile at Lisa Dennison, the auction house's chairwoman. She was on the telephone, trying to draw a higher bid from a client. Two tenacious collectors were competing to take home ''No. 1 (Royal Red and Blue),'' a classic Mark Rothko painting from 1954 that is also a conspicuous example of what dealers like to call ''wall power,'' and the bidding was already at $61 million.
The painting ended up selling to another mystery telephone bidder for $67 million, or $75.1 million including Sotheby's fees. 
The Rothko was the high point in a contemporary art sale of exceptionally strong prices and spirited bidding that ultimately made $375.1 million, the highest total for any sale in Sotheby's history, beating the previous record of $362 million set in May 2008.
After last week's disappointing auctions of Impressionist and modern art, it was also a night of great relief for the international group of collectors and dealers who packed Sotheby's salesroom.
''There were huge prices,'' Allan Schwartzman, a Manhattan art adviser, said toward the end of the sale. ''It was all about fast money looking for places to park.''
Shortly before the Rothko sold, Jackson Pollock's drip painting ''Number 4, 1951'' -- a layered patchwork of red, blue, yellow, green and ocher oil paints, metallic aluminum and flecks of shiny black enamel -- which was expected to bring $25 million to $35 million, sold to Ms. Dennison, bidding on behalf of her telephone client, for $36 million, or $40.4 million with fees, a record for the artist at auction. (Final prices include the buyer's commission to Sotheby's: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Of the 69 works on offer, only 11 failed to sell.
Four bidders went for Bacon's ''Untitled (Pope)'' from 1954, which had been expected to sell for $18 million to $25 million, but sold to a telephone bidder for $26.5 million, or $29.7 million including Sotheby's fees.
Not everything topped expectations. Gerhard Richter, the 80-year-old German artist, currently holds the title of the most expensive living artist at auction, after a painting belonging to Eric Clapton sold at Sotheby's in London last month for $34.2 million. Richter's prices have been rising ever since a recent traveling retrospective that went to the National Gallery in Berlin, the Tate Modern in London and the Pompidou Center in Paris. On Tuesday, Sotheby's had a 1990 Richter that was estimated to bring $15 million to $18 million.
Perhaps there are just too many examples of the artist's work -- Christie's has several on offer at its sale on Wednesday night -- and this painting had only one bidder, who was willing to pay $15 million, or $17.4 million including fees.
The sale also included several Warhol paintings from the 1960s. ''Green Disaster (Green Disaster Twice),'' a 1963 work based on a photograph of a brutal car crash, went for $15.2 million. The buyer was Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate, who is a large Warhol collector. Great works on paper by Warhol are rare, and on Tuesday night three of them, also from the 1960s, brought strong prices. Top among them, ''Suicide,'' a gruesome image of a man jumping to his death that was expected to bring $6 million to $8 million, went to Philippe Sgalot, a Manhattan dealer, for $16.3 million -- a record for a work on paper by the artist. (Sotheby's previously sold it in 1992 for $132,000.) As the dealers and collectors were milling outside of Sotheby's toward the end of the evening, many said they were amazed at how strong the results were, given the shaky economic picture around the world. ''It was surprising,'' Mr. Sgalot said. ''But Sotheby's had works that were fresh to the market and they put them in the beginning of the sale. That set the tone for the rest of the evening.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Authorities Putting Pressure on Businesses to Help Censor the Web

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Adam Century contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As the Chinese cyberpolice stiffened controls on information before the Communist Party leadership transition taking place this week, some companies in Beijing and nearby cities received orders to aid the cause.
Starting earlier this year, Web police units directed the companies, which included joint ventures involving American corporations, to buy and install hardware to log the traffic of hundreds or thousands of computers, block selected Web sites, and connect with local police servers, according to industry executives and official directives obtained by The New York Times. Companies faced the threat of fines and suspended Internet service if they did not comply by prescribed deadlines.
The initiative was one in a range of shadowy tactics authorities deployed in the months leading up to the 18th Party Congress, which is scheduled to end on Wednesday, in an escalating campaign against information deemed threatening to party rule. The effort, while spottily executed, was alarming enough to spur one foreign industry association to lodge a complaint with the government. Several foreign companies quietly resisted the orders, which posed risks to communications and trade secrets that they take pains to secure. 
The events surrounding the party congress magnify the constant challenge facing China's Internet security apparatus, which is to maintain the party's lock on political power without choking off a wired China from the global economy.
The more intrusive recent measures appear aimed at plugging some of the gaps in China's nexus of surveillance and censorship, sometimes termed the ''great firewall.''
''It goes this way pretty much every time there's some big political event in Beijing: the DVDs are gone, the prostitutes are gone, and the Internet's slower,'' said David van Meerendonk, an American who operates an information technology company here. ''They're struggling to find a balancing point.''
Over the past couple of weeks, partial blocking has crippled access to Google and other sites, at times completely. It has also disrupted programs that many people here use to circumvent surveillance and reach blocked overseas sites by other means. Some Internet providers have cut service for hours, citing ''maintenance.'' Democracy activists and foreign journalists have reported increased attacks on their e-mail accounts.
On domestic social networks, already vigorously policed, censors have fine-tuned their craft. Sina Weibo, the nation's most popular microblogging site, has experimented with ''semi-censorship,''as one blog termed it, filtering search results for once-unsearchable terms. One semi-censored term was the Chinese shorthand for the party congress itself: shiba da. Blocking it had prompted some of China's more playful microbloggers to resort to a similar-sounding English substitute: ''Sparta.''
Hu Jintao, China's departing leader, in his report on the opening day of the congress last Thursday, gave no sign of any relaxation in controls. ''We should strengthen social management of the Internet and promote standardized and orderly network operation,'' he said.
The police and other agencies rely on legions of local censors, automated filtering and strict regulation of Internet service providers.
GreatFire.org, a Chinese-based blog that tracks government filtering, found in tests this month that Google e-mail was being partly blocked, and that blocking intensified after the congress began. One possible explanation for the strategy was that ''authorities are nervous of fully blocking Gmail,'' it said. ''The government may be scared of a backlash from the urban, educated and young people who tend to use Gmail, not to mention the businesses that rely on it.''
In late summer, the police stepped up jamming on circumvention software, according to two party insiders with Chinese security ties. Students who use Freegate, free software backed by the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong, said that as early as August they experienced unusually frequent disruptions.
China says its online security policies are needed to fight pervasive fraud, cyberattacks, pornography and rumormongering.
But many of the controls seem aimed more at checking antigovernment activity. And the latest effort to enlist business represents a new front for the systems, already installed at many hotels, schools and coffee chains. Many corporations, especially foreign companies, use encryption and circumvention technologies to safeguard communications, allowing local employees to use blocked Web sites and skirt police surveillance.
This past summer, the Internet police in the provinces of Hebei and Shandong ordered three American companies to install the monitoring systems at local joint ventures, according to a spokesman for the Quality Brands Protection Committee, a foreign industry group representing more than 200 major corporations operating in China.
Elsewhere, American, Japanese and Korean companies received similar orders, executives said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for their companies and feared compromising local business relationships.
The orders, first reported by CNN, cited existing regulations and designated vendors. The police in the Hebei city of Qinhuangdao notified one company that it would face a fine of 15,000 renminbi, or about $2,400, and lose Internet service for half a year if it did not install the system by mid-August.
Technology specialists warned that foreign companies installing the devices could be directly exposed to intellectual property theft and cyberattacks.
''This box, in addition to being able to monitor any queries about Tiananmen Square or Tibet or the Dalai Lama, also would be able to intercept all network communications from the China operations back to headquarters,'' said Thomas Parenty, an information security consultant for foreign companies in China.
The Quality Brands committee spokesman said he believed the initiative amounted to overzealous local enforcement rather than national policy. The group has raised its concerns with the police and commerce ministries.
The ministries did not respond to questions.
Sometimes, enforcement seemed superficial. ''I said, 'We don't have a network, so I could not use the piece of equipment,' '' said the manager of one Western company, recalling the day the Beijing police tried to carry out the directive.
''He said, 'Just sign.' So I did,'' the manager added. ''I did not buy any equipment. I think the idea was to create fear that they can and will check.''
