HEADLINE: Grounded No Longer, Shuttle Atlantis Is Readied for Space 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
After a three-month grounding to repair cracks in the fuel systems of the space shuttle fleet, the shuttle Atlantis is to resume flying this week with a mission to continue construction of the International Space Station.
 Carrying a crew of six, the Atlantis is to blast off on Wednesday carrying a 28,776-pound truss segment to be part of the main support beam of the station. The launching of the 11-day mission from Cape Canaveral, Fla., is to occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., with the exact time kept secret until 24 hours before liftoff as a security measure. 
 Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were tracking several tropical storms but said none appeared to threaten the launching. 
For the first time in program history, a shuttle's flight from launching pad to orbit will be transmitted live via a small television camera mounted atop the large external fuel tank that is attached to Atlantis. 
NASA officials hope to see Atlantis's rapid ascent, the separation of its solid-fuel boosters two minutes into the flight and the earth's curvature against the blackness of space as the craft enters orbit. Eight minutes into the flight, the empty fuel tank with its attached camera will be jettisoned, eventually to burn up in the atmosphere. 
The four-shuttle fleet was grounded when tiny cracks were discovered in metal liners within liquid hydrogen fuel pipes in all the spacecraft. Because of fears that pieces of the liners might break off and damage an engine, engineers developed a welding and polishing technique to repair the cracks.
A further delay was avoided when NASA developed a quick fix for cracks in steel ball bearings supporting both of the huge Apollo-era transporters that carry fully-fitted shuttles from their assembly hangar to launching pads three miles away. The agency found the manufacturer that made the bearings, the size of soccer balls, 35 years ago and had dozens of replacements made and installed.
Atlantis's cargo bay is virtually filled with the truss, which is 45 feet long, 15 feet wide and 10 feet tall. The so-called S1 truss is to be attached to the starboard side of a central truss section installed on the station's Destiny science module last April. An almost identical module, the P1 truss, is to be attached on the port side in November by a crew aboard the shuttle Endeavour. 
Additional sections will be added over the next year and a half, leading to a 356-foot support beam with four sets of giant solar power panels attached. 
NASA engineers point out that the $390 million S1 truss, built by Boeing, is much more than an empty aluminum girder attached to the station to support other equipment. The unit, crammed with wiring, cables and piping, will be a major part of the station's communications, data relay and cooling systems.
"Truss is really a misnomer," said William Gerstenmaier, space station program manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. "S1 is really a full spacecraft. The only thing it lacks is propulsion. It's a very, very complex spacecraft." 
Ron Torcivia, the truss payload manager at Johnson, said the unit contained 15 miles of electrical wire, one-third of a mile of fiber-optic cable, 426 feet of stainless steel tubing and 637 pounds of anhydrous ammonia coolant that will be circulated through the piping with nitrogen gas to carry excess heat away from the station. The truss contains three expandable pivoting radiator panels through which the ammonia will pass to dump heat into the environment of space, which is minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
Only one radiator, each 75 feet long and 15 feet wide when extended, is to be deployed during the installation mission, he said. After the port-side truss is attached in November, all six radiators will be deployed, able to cool the equivalent of eight 2,000-square-foot homes, Mr. Torcivia said. 
Atlantis will be commanded by Capt. Jeffrey S. Ashby of the Navy, who is making his third space flight, and piloted by Col. Pamela A. Melroy of the Air Force, on her second flight. When it docks at the space station two days after launching, the shuttle will be greeted by the Russian astronauts Valery G. Korzun and Sergei Y. Treschev, and an American, Dr. Peggy A. Whitson, who are on a five-month stay there. The shuttle will carry 1,000 pounds of cargo, including food and experiments, to be transferred to the station. 
The next day, astronauts in the station will use the outpost's large robotic arm to lift the truss from the shuttle cargo bay and move it to the end of the center truss, where a hook and electronically driven bolts will join the two segments. 
This mating will be followed by the first of three six-and-a-half-hour spacewalks by two astronauts to connect cables and wiring so that the truss unit can draw power and start a protracted activation process. During the spacewalks, astronauts will also attach a cart to the truss sections that can carry tools and equipment around the station complex. The cart will be attached to a mobile transporter already aboard that moves the station's cranelike robot arm along the truss on a pair of rails. 
The spacewalks will be conducted from the station's airlock by the Atlantis astronauts Dr. David A. Wolf and Dr. Piers J. Sellers. Dr. Wolf, a physician on his third space flight, spent 119 days aboard the defunct Russian Mir space station in 1997. Dr. Sellers, a meteorologist born in England, has not flown in space before.
The two other members of Atlantis's crew are also space rookies: Dr. Sandra H. Magnus, a material scientist who has done research on stealth aircraft technology, and Dr. Fyodor N. Yurchikhin, an economist and mechanical engineer employed by the Russian aerospace company RSC Energia. 
The shuttle is to return to the Kennedy Space Center on Oct. 13.

HEADLINE: Deflating Self-Esteem's Role in Society's Ills 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
Low self-esteem is to blame for a host of social ills, from poor academic performance and marital discord to violent crime and drug abuse.
 Or so goes the gospel, as written over the last several decades by social scientists, self-help book authors and the California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility, a panel created in 1986 by the California Legislature to conduct a three-year study of the topic. 
 Recently, however, some psychologists have begun debunking the notion that a poor self-image is the malady behind most of society's complaints -- and bolstering self-esteem its cure.
"D" students, it turns out, think as highly of themselves as valedictorians, and serial rapists are no more likely to ooze with insecurities than doctors or bank managers.
At the same time, high self-esteem, studies show, offers no immunity against bad behavior. Research by Dr. Brad J. Bushman of Iowa State University and Dr. Roy F. Baumeister of Case Western Reserve University finds that some people with high self-regard are actually more likely to lash out aggressively when criticized than those with low-self esteem. The list of groups -- neo-Nazis, street toughs, school bullies -- who combine preening self-satisfaction with violence belies the power of one to ameliorate the other. 
"I think we had a great deal of optimism that high self-esteem would cause all sorts of positive consequences, and that if we raised self-esteem people would do better in life," Dr. Baumeister said. "Mostly, the data have not borne that out."
In an extensive review of studies, for example, Dr. Nicholas Emler, a social psychologist at the London School of Economics, found no clear link between low self-esteem and delinquency, violence against others, teenage smoking, drug use or racism, though a poor self-image was one of several factors contributing to self-destructive behaviors like suicide, eating disorders and teenage pregnancy.
High self-esteem, on the other hand, was positively correlated with racist attitudes, drunken driving and other risky behaviors, Dr. Emler found in his 2001 review. Though academic success or failure had some effect on self-esteem, students with high self-esteem were likely to explain away their failures with excuses, while those with low self-esteem discounted their successes as flukes.
Not that feeling good about oneself is entirely without benefit. People with high self-esteem are happier and show more initiative than those with low self-regard, Dr. Baumeister noted.
But when it comes to whether people use that initiative for good or for ill, or whether they succeed or fail in many different areas of life, research indicates that psychological factors other than self-esteem are far more important.
For example, in the studies Dr. Bushman and Dr. Baumeister carried out on aggression, they found that it was narcissism, self-love that includes a conviction of one's superiority, rather than a positive self-image per se, that led people to retaliate aggressively when their self-esteem was threatened. 
In one study, each subject was asked to write an essay that was then criticized by a partner, really a confederate of the researchers. Then the subjects were given a chance to get back at their partners by pushing a button and blasting them with a high-decibel noise. People who scored high on scales of self-esteem were in general no more likely to take advantage of the opportunity than those with low self-esteem. But those who also scored high on narcissism turned up the volume and leaned on the button.
In another study, the researchers gave tests of self-esteem and narcissism to 63 men serving prison sentences for rape, murder, assault or armed robbery in Massachusetts and California.
They compared the prisoners' scores to those found in other studies for groups of men the same age, including Vietnam veterans, college students, dentists, recreational dart throwers and problem drinkers. The violent offenders, Dr. Bushman said, did not differ from the other men in self-esteem. But they scored much higher than the other men on narcissism. (A third group of prisoners, in Minnesota, showed no significant differences in either self-esteem or in narcissism, an anomalous result the researchers hope to explain through further research.)
Many experts believe that such findings offer a persuasive rebuttal to the claims of the so-called self-esteem movement. But the accretion of evidence has done little to dampen the enthusiasm of therapists, child-rearing experts and school administrators. Many secondary schools include self-esteem building in their curriculums. Self-help books offer strategies -- from hypnosis to dieting -- for increasing self-confidence and self-worth. 
J. D. Hawkins, president of the National Association for Self-Esteem, based in Normal, Ill., said that despite the new research his group held that a positive self-image was important and that self-esteem building exercises were effective.
"For 37 years I've worked with kids and I've proved that those kinds of things work," Mr. Hawkins said. But he added that any conception of self-esteem had to include taking responsibility for one's actions and contributing to society.
"If you are not personally and socially responsible, then your self-worth is built on a false reality and, therefore, it's not healthy," Mr. Hawkins said.
A preoccupation with self-esteem may be inevitable in a society where self-worth is often defined by a diploma from Harvard, a Size 4 dress or a mansion in Southampton.
Dr. Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, argues that the frantic pursuit of self-worth through external trappings exacts a social and personal toll. "The pursuit of self-esteem has short-term benefits but long-term costs," she has written, "ultimately diverting people from fulfilling their fundamental human needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy and leading to poor self-regulation and mental and physical health." 
In a series of studies, the most recent appearing in the current Journal of Social Issues, Dr. Crocker finds that people who pin their self-esteem on academic performance, good looks, the approval of bosses, friends or family members or other societally sanctioned yardsticks are at higher risk for a variety of problems, including academic difficulties, relationship conflicts, aggression and increased use of drugs or alcohol.
In a study of 642 college freshmen, Dr. Crocker found that most students scored high on a commonly used measure of self-esteem. But those who based their views of themselves on things like academic competence, outdoing others in competition, physical appearance or other people's approval were more likely to have difficulties several months later.
The freshmen who based their self-regard heavily on academic performance, for example, reported more stress and more conflicts with professors and teaching assistants than did their peers. They spent more time studying than other students but did no better in their classes.
The freshmen who were invested in appearing attractive, on the other hand, reported more aggressiveness, anger and hostility than others, more alcohol and drug use and more symptoms of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, Dr. Crocker found. They also became more depressed as the year wore on.
The externally driven students were slightly more likely than others to have low self-esteem, but the correlation was small, Dr. Crocker said.
"In analysis after analysis, external contingencies of self-worth, such as appearance, were associated with more problems of all types during their freshman year," Dr. Crocker wrote of the college students in the journal article.
In contrast, students who judged themselves by more internal measures like virtue or religious faith seemed to fare better. They were less likely to show anger and aggression and more restrained in their use of alcohol and drugs.
But Dr. Crocker said it was possible that even these freshmen found their pursuit of self-esteem problematic. On a checklist of "daily hassles," for example, they were more likely to note feelings of loneliness, suggesting, she said, that their devotion to moral strictures was experienced as off-putting by others.
An obsession with external markers of self-worth, Dr. Crocker believes, leads to self-absorption.
As an example, she cited a study, carried out with a graduate student, Lora Park, in which college freshmen who based their self-esteem on academic achievement were given a test and then either told that they had failed or given no feedback. They were then asked to talk to a partner about a personal problem the partner was having.
Afterward, the freshmen who failed the test rated themselves as "preoccupied" during their discussion with their partner. Their partners, in turn, reported that they did not like the freshmen very much and would not want to share personal problems with them again.
The correction for such an exclusive focus on the self cannot be found in self-esteem classes that encourage children to believe that they are special and that their personal success and happiness are paramount, Dr. Crocker and other experts argue.
"Not everything is about 'me,' " she said. "There are sometimes bigger things that we should be concerned about."
Yet more old-fashioned strategies for making one's way in the world, like learning self-control, resisting temptation or persisting in the face of failure have received little study, in part because the attention to self-esteem has been so pervasive.
"My bottom line is that self-esteem isn't really worth the effort," Dr. Baumeister said. "Self-control is much more powerful."

HEADLINE: One Visa Problem Costs a Festival Two Filmmakers 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
The internationally acclaimed Iranian film director Abbas Kiarostami, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1997 for "A Taste of Cherry," was unable to get a United States visa in time to attend the premiere of his new film, "Ten," at the New York Film Festival last Saturday, prompting his friend and fellow director Aki Kaurismaki of Finland to boycott the festival in protest.
 "If international cultural exchange is prevented, what is left?" asked Mr. Kaurismaki, whose new film "The Man Without a Past" will be shown at this year's festival. "The exchange of arms?" 
 Mr. Kiarostami, 62, who has been to the United States seven times in the course of his career, was told this month at the United States Embassy in Paris that the earliest he could get permission to come into the country was December.
Stringent new rules, put in place after last year's terrorist attacks, now require a three-month background check on some applicants for United States visas, in particular those from Muslim countries.
After news of Mr. Kiarostami's visa problems circulated in Europe, Mr. Kaurismaki announced that he would stay away from the festival as a gesture of solidarity. In a prepared statement, he wrote, "Not with anger (which has never brought anything good) but with deep sorrow" he had learned that the Iranian director was refused a visa because of his citizenship. 
If the United States authorities do not want "an Iranian, they will hardly have any use for a Finn, either," he wrote. "We do not even have the oil."
The new visa requirements have created a logjam in the approval process, both at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and at United States consulates overseas. 
The backup has left performers, students and academics stranded, while wreaking havoc on cultural programs across the country and throwing future plans into doubt. "The reaction that this has engendered makes you wonder what the sense of this policy is," said Richard Pena, director of the New York Film Festival, which opened on Sept. 27.
Mr. Pena said Mr. Kiarostami had traveled to Paris to apply for the visa because the United States had no diplomatic representation in Iran. But when he was told that his application would undergo the three-month background check, he refused to make any special appeal on the ground that his career as a film director should speak for itself, Mr. Pena said. "If that wasn't good enough, then he was not going to come," he said.
Last summer several members of an Iranian theatrical troupe, scheduled to perform at the Lincoln Center Festival, were denied visas on the grounds that they might decide to stay in the United States as economic refugees.
And just last month Chucho Valdes, a Grammy Award-winning jazz pianist from Cuba, was denied entry into the United States for a series of fall performances, because he, too, had to submit to a lengthy screening process. Mr. Valdes was one of 22 Cuban musicians who were unable to obtain visas in time to attend the Latin Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Sky's the Limit for Canada's Air Taxes 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
WestJet Airlines of Calgary set out to prove a point in the summer by offering what it described as a "ridiculous" fare of 3 Canadian dollars ($1.90) one way, or twice that for a round trip, on two of its busiest short-haul routes.
 The catch was that the fare excluded taxes. Anyone wanting to take up the bargain, valid for just one Sunday, had to pay what WestJet called the equally ridiculous array of fees, taxes and surcharges imposed on air travel in Canada, some by airlines but mostly by airports or the government. 
 All those charges raised the final cost of that 6 dollar round trip to more than 80 Canadian dollars ($51). 
(A typical price for a round-trip ticket on one of the two routes, between Ottawa and Hamilton, Ontario, was 315 Canadian dollars ($199) in a recent week, or 399.57 Canadian dollars ($253) with taxes and fees.)
Canada's airlines and travel agents are up in arms over these charges. Though the charges appeared gradually over the years, they say, they are pinching particularly hard now, as the travel industry struggles to recover from the downturn in traffic after last year's terrorist attacks on the United States.
The extra charges "actually scare the client away," said Ornan Sharaby, an agent at Travel for Less in Thornhill, Ontario. "They don't understand how taxes can be so high." 
Most nations, including the United States, impose taxes and fees on air fares, but the airlines say Canada's are much higher than those in the United States and rank among the highest anywhere. Six separate charges are typically added to a basic air fare. Tango, Air Canada's no-frills arm, offered a bargain one-way Web fare of about 62 Canadian dollars ($39) from Toronto to Ottawa for a flight leaving today. But passengers must also pay a fee to help maintain the air traffic control system; surcharges to cover the airline's rising insurance and fuel costs; an "airport improvement fee" for Lester B. Pearson Airport in Toronto; an air travel security tax; and goods and services sales tax, including tax on the security tax. That brings the total cost to about 119 Canadian dollars ($75), or about 92 percent more than the basic fare.
The charges are "insensitive to the carrier's economic circumstances," said Warren Everson, vice president for policy and strategic planning at the Air Transport Association of Canada, an airline industry lobby group in Ottawa. Airlines, he said, should be taxed on profits, not on costs.
Travel agents are equally critical of the fees, but they also accuse the airlines of deceptive advertising, by headlining only the basic fare and hiding all the extras -- including the insurance and fuel surcharges -- in the fine print. "One of our goals is fair advertising," said Louise Crandall, a vice president at the Association of Canadian Travel Agents in Ottawa.
Mr. Everson said that the airlines were "sensitive to the point," but that including the taxes in the advertised air fare would be "tantamount to concealing who's getting the money -- it's because of costs that other people are putting on our tickets."
The airlines complain that because most of the charges are fixed amounts, they have a disproportionate impact on the lowest fares, which are typically for short routes where competition from rail and bus services is most intense.
Whatever the cause, the airlines' pain does seem to be rail's gain. For example, the number of first-class train passengers between Toronto and Montreal grew 32 percent in the first eight months of the year, compared with the 2001 period, said Catherine Kaloutsky, a spokeswoman for VIA Rail Canada, which runs the country's passenger rail service. Though a discount air fare between the cities is cheaper than a first-class train ticket, the two work out about the same after taxes and surcharges.
Still, Canadian airlines are generally faring better than their American counterparts. Helped by the collapse earlier this year of Canada 3000, a discount carrier that had garnered about a fifth of the domestic market, Air Canada, the dominant carrier, reported net earnings of 30 million Canadian dollars in the second quarter and said it expected to be profitable again in the third.
The brash, low-cost WestJet, which models itself on Southwest Airlines of Dallas, has reported profits for 22 consecutive quarters.
The airlines say, however, that their financial health is fragile. The extra charges "are money out of our pockets, and we don't have much money in our pockets right now," said Mr. Everson of the Air Transport Association.
The loudest protests are leveled against the security tax, which was put in place on April 1 to cover the 2.2 billion Canadian dollars being spent to upgrade security measures at Canadian airports.
The security tax is 12 Canadian dollars, counting the tax on the tax, for each domestic flight or flight to or from the United States, and double that for each one-way or round-trip ticket to any other country. According to Mr. Everson, the Canadian security tax is the highest in the world, and as much as three times the $2.50 security charge levied on each leg of an American domestic flight up to a maximum of $10.
WestJet says that load factors -- the percentage of seats sold -- on its Calgary-Edmonton and Hamilton-Ottawa routes have dropped each month since the security tax was introduced. The airline canceled 13 flights a week between Calgary and Edmonton from April to June, and two flights a week between Vancouver and Kelowna, British Columbia, another short route.
In response to the complaints, Canada's Department of Finance, which estimates that it collected 48 million Canadian dollars from the security tax from April to June, has hired consultants to review the tax. According to Jean-Michel Catta, a spokesman for the department, the tax will be reduced if revenues exceed the costs of new security projects.
Mr. Catta said, however, that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the government had taken over many airport security functions that used to be the airlines' responsibility.
Even if the security tax does come down, the drop could be offset by increases in other fees. The Ottawa Airport Authority, for instance, said recently that it would raise its airport improvement fee in January to 15 Canadian dollars from 10.

HEADLINE: Japan Names New Economy Czar to Tackle Banking Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Declaring Japan's banks in an "emergency," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi fired his chief financial regulator today and unexpectedly concentrated economic policy making in the hands of a 51-year-old cabinet member known for advocating aggressive action to tackle Japan's long-running banking crisis. 
 Heizo Takenaka, the economy minister, emerged today as "economy czar" as he took over the portfolio of financial regulator from Hakuo Yanagisawa, a minister who had opposed using public money to clean up commercial banks, which are staggering under the weight of bad loans officially estimated at $423 billion. 
 Tonight, in a nationally televised news conference, Mr. Koizumi seemed to give his new "super minister" carte blanche to try new tactics, including a bailout, to right the banks. "I expect Takenaka to take all the necessary steps to fix the banking problems," he said. 
The surprise appointment, part of the first cabinet shuffle since Mr. Koizumi took power almost 18 months ago, came after a weekend of contradictory policy statements by Japanese officials in Washington. After listening to this back and forth, Paul H. O'Neill, the United States Treasury Secretary, said, "I did not come away with an understanding of how these particular interventions are going to contribute to an increase in the gross domestic product." 
Twelve years after Japanese stocks and real estate prices started to collapse, the banks have not recovered. The long-festering issue suddenly burst to the forefront two weeks ago when the Bank of Japan presented an unorthodox plan to buy company shares held by banks that were afraid that a major sell-off would depress the market. 
Repeating a goal to bring Japan's deflation and bad-loan problems under control by the spring of 2005, Prime Minister Koizumi stressed his support for Mr. Takenaka, a onetime Harvard University economics scholar, saying, "I appointed Takenaka to show the government's commitment to speed up the disposal of bad loans."
While Mr. Takenaka does not have a seat or faction in Parliament, he rides on the popularity of Mr. Koizumi, whose government seems to have gotten a second wind. By visiting North Korea two weeks ago, Mr. Koizumi has achieved a rare feat for Japanese prime ministers: a V-shaped rebound in public opinion polls. In today's cabinet shuffle, six cabinet members, or one third, lost their posts, largely to younger politicians.
Inside the cabinet, Mr. Takenaka's only major rival for economic policy-making power is Masajuro Shiokawa, the minister of finance, who at 80 is the oldest cabinet member. 
In Washington, Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said he was "particularly heartened" by the elevation of Mr. Takenaka, whom he called "very committed to reform."
Some economists hailed Mr. Takenaka's elevation as a turning point for the world's second largest economy. Jesper Koll, the chief economist here for Merrill Lynch, predicted, "I think we will look back in two years, and say, this is when the all-out attack on deflation, on the bad loans, started."
Others were more cautious, noting that the bellwether Nikkei stock average initially soared on the news, then fell back, losing 147 points, or 1.5 percent, for the day. Skeptics predicted that Mr. Takenaka would be constrained by bureaucrats in his new agency, by politicians in Parliament, and by a public nervous about moves that would further raise Japan's 5.4 percent unemployment rate. 
"Mr. Takenaka is not an elected politician, so he could easily be a target of anti-reformers," said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst here for UBS. Any use of taxpayer money would have to be approved by Parliament, he added. Parliament reconvenes in mid-October, and some of Mr. Koizumi's worst enemies are from his own Liberal Democratic Party. 
While Mr. Takenaka has favored using taxpayer money to refloat some of Japan's banks, he has also favored a restructuring that would force some to close. 
Three years ago, the government injected $75 billion in the banks, but did not demand major changes in bank policies and personnel.
"The financial system is in the middle of a serious malaise," Mr. Takenaka told reporters today. Calling for transparency to ensure public support for any use of taxpayer money, he said, "We must not engage in things like subsidizing banks in a non-obvious way."
Although bank stocks generally rose here today, the announcement marks more of a shift in policy direction than immediate banking relief, several economists said.
"Outright and immediate injection of taxpayer money is practically impossible," said Takashi Kiuchi, an economic adviser for Shinsei Bank, which was recreated with American capital and management from the ruins of a major bank that went under in the last round of bankruptcies, in the late 1990's.
Marshall Gittler, an economist here with Bank of America, said of the last round of bailouts: "The banks didn't reform, and there was no change in their operations. The problem now is not just getting rid of this batch of bad loans, but making sure the banks change."
With Japan's lost decade of the 1990's stretching into this decade, Mr. Koizumi told the country tonight, "The current top priority is reviving the Japanese economy."
With policy now concentrated in one minister, it remains to be seen if Mr. Takenaka can prevail against political and bureaucratic opponents. 
"With the cabinet reshuffle, he is now the brain that coordinates policy," Mr. Koll said of Mr. Takenaka. "Now let's see if he can get the body to walk."

HEADLINE: Europeans to Exempt U.S. From War Court 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept 30 

 BODY:
The 15 nations of the European Union agreed today to exempt American soldiers and government officials from prosecution for war crimes at the International Criminal Court, an issue that had troubled trans-Atlantic relations for several months.
 The compromise, reached at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers, came close to the blanket immunity for American government employees sought by the Bush administration, although European officials emphasized that in their view it did not undermine the court, which the administration has opposed. 
 "There is no concession," said Per Stig Moller, foreign minister of Denmark, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union. "There is no undermining of the International Criminal Court." 
At a briefing in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said: "We'll study the details of the European Union's decision very closely, and we'll look forward to discussing it in more detail with member states."
Diplomats said today's deal had been pushed hardest by Britain and by Italy and Spain, whose conservative governments are ideologically closer to the Bush administration than, say, the German government.
France, Germany, Belgium and Sweden offered the stiffest resistance to any form of exemption for American citizens, diplomats said. 
The deal that the 15 governments agreed to prevents them from extraditing American government employees accused of war crimes to the court, on the condition that the United States government guarantee that such a suspect would be tried in an American court.
The Bush administration has been pressing governments around the world to sign bilateral agreements not to send American citizens to the International Criminal Court, which is an outgrowth of the ad hoc tribunals set up by the United Nations, with American support, to try war crimes committed in the Balkans and in Rwanda in the 1990's.
The administration fears that with the creation of a permanent court to try alleged war crimes committed anywhere in the world, Americans in peacekeeping or overseas military operations could become targets of politically motivated trials.
Several American nongovernmental organizations have banded together to support formation of the new international court, and their representatives said they were disappointed by today's agreement.
"We are disappointed the E.U. did not take a stronger position amid pressure from the United States, but we agree the I.C.C. has not been de-legitimised by this agreement," said Heather Hamilton, spokeswoman for the World Federalist Association, one of the groups.
Today's agreement allows any European Union nation to sign a separate bilateral agreement with the United States over the court. Germany has been a staunch opponent of this, but Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer noted that today's accord "is very important because the Milosevics and Pinochets of tomorrow will be brought to justice," referring to the former authoritarian leaders of Yugoslavia and Chile.
Britain and Italy are believed to be considering signing bilateral agreements with the United Sates, but diplomats said today's agreement makes such a move less likely. "The E.U. does now appear united on this question," said one diplomat, although differences remain beneath the surface of the compromise.
"This unity could turn out to be no more than skin deep if individual E.U. members go ahead and sign agreements with the United States," the diplomat said.
So far, 12 countries outside the European Union have promised not to extradite American citizens to the court.
The European Union is among those who pushed hardest for an international court, under the auspices of the United Nations, to deal with cases involving genocide, atrocities, war crimes and systematic human rights abuses. More than 80 countries have ratified the court's founding treaty. Notable exceptions include the United States, Israel and most Arab countries.
The court will be based in The Hague, where Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia, is on trial on charges that he committed war crimes during the Balkan wars of the 1990's.

HEADLINE: Dealing With W 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
I got obsessed with the Japanese economy after it was fashionable. 
 Americans paid a lot of attention to Japan in the 1980's, when Japanese manufacturers were conquering the world. Remember when airport bookstores were filled with management tomes bearing samurai warriors on their covers? Then Japan's bubble burst, and most Americans concluded that we had nothing to learn from Japan -- except how a country can stumble when it lacks adequate business and political leadership. And we, of course, don't have that problem. 
 Or do we? Jack Welch's gut is starting to look as overrated as those business samurai. And our political leadership doesn't exactly inspire confidence. In fact, lately I've started to have a truly depressing thought: Bad as Japan's policy has been, it's possible that the United States will do even worse.
It's hard to say anything good about how Japan has handled its post-bubble economy. But I've worried for years about how other countries would deal with similar problems. Sure enough, as America tries to cope with its own burst bubble, it's a lot easier to see how bad economic decisions get made. 
It's true that Alan Greenspan and his colleagues made a much better start than their counterparts in Japan. They knew that the Bank of Japan cut interest rates too slowly, and that by the time it realized the seriousness of the country's problems it was too late: even a zero interest rate wasn't enough to spark a recovery. So the Fed cut rates early and often; those 11 interest rate cuts in 2001 fueled a boom both in housing purchases and in mortgage refinancing, both of which helped keep the economy from experiencing a much more severe recession. 
But it's starting to look as if the interest rate cuts weren't enough. I don't need to tell you about the stock market. Economic indicators strongly suggest that the economy is either sliding into a double-dip, "W-shaped" recession -- bet you thought I was talking about the guy in the White House -- or close enough as makes no difference. Bond markets are clearly predicting that the Fed will have to cut interest rates again. What if the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, goes all the way to zero and finds that it still hasn't turned the economy around?
Not many people realize that in some ways Japanese economic policy responded quite effectively to a sustained slump. It's easy to make fun of the country's enormous spending on public works -- all those bridges to nowhere in particular, highways with no traffic, and so on. Without question enormous sums have been wasted. But it's also clear that all that spending pumped money into the economy, preventing what might otherwise have been a full-fledged depression.
So what will be the U.S. equivalent? Right now we are in effect following the reverse policy: slashing domestic spending in the face of an economic slump. Some of this is taking place at the federal level; the Bush administration is nickel-and-diming public spending wherever it can, shaving a billion here, a billion there off everything from veterans' benefits and homeland security to Medicare payments. More important, the federal government is doing nothing to help as state and local governments, their revenues savaged by recession, make deep cuts in spending on everything that isn't urgently necessary, and many things that are. 
It's true that we haven't yet confronted head on the possibility that Uncle Alan may not be able to save us single-handedly. But last fall's debate over economic stimulus suggested that our political leadership cannot make a rational response to economic problems. Where economists saw danger, the White House and its Congressional allies saw opportunity -- an opportunity to ram through more tax cuts for corporations and the affluent, measures that suited their political agenda but had almost no relevance to the economy's problems. Remember the proposal to give retroactive tax breaks to ChevronTexaco and Enron? 
In the end, the need for stimulus was less urgent than it seemed at the time, but there is no reason to think that we'll do better if, as now seems all too likely, the recovery stumbles.
Of course, the worst thing of all would be if our leadership decides that economics is not its thing, if it simply tries to distract the public from rising unemployment and plunging stocks by going off and invading someone. But we don't have to worry about that, do we?

HEADLINE: White House Predicts Economic Pace Will Pick Up Next Year 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
The Bush administration set out an optimistic view of the economy today, saying the drop in the stock market was probably not enough to derail the recovery and that the most critical component of the outlook, capital investment by businesses, would begin turning around by the end of the year.
 Even as Wall Street endured another turbulent day, administration officials told a conference sponsored by the National Association for Business Economics that the economy was on track to grow at a reasonably healthy pace in the second half of the year and to pick up steam next year. 
 "The U.S. economy continues to grow, and we expect the pace of expansion to pick up next year," said Richard H. Clarida, assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the White House's council of economic advisers, told the group, made up of business economists, that if the stock market did not recover from its losses this year, it could reduce the size of the economy by as much as a full percentage point. But he said that any negative effects from falling stock prices would probably be more than offset by positive forces.
"While this is a significant impact, it would not overwhelm the upward path of recovery," Mr. Hubbard said in the prepared text of his remarks.
Referring to capital investment, which has remained depressed as businesses wait for clearer signs that demand for their products is on the upswing, Mr. Hubbard said conditions were "primed for investment to begin to recover." But he acknowledged that the timing and pace of the recovery would depend on business confidence, which has been held back by concern about the economic implications of any war with Iraq.
The administration's economic assessment, coming as Democrats and Republicans head into the home stretch of this year's midterm Congressional elections, did not dwell on the many risks facing the economy, including the effects of any military conflict with Iraq on the stock market, oil prices and consumer and business confidence. 
But there is concern among some Federal Reserve officials and private economists that the economy is stalling, a victim of uncertainty caused by war talk, weak industrial production and the sharp decline on Wall Street. 
Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told the business economics conference today that there is anecdotal evidence that something is wrong in the economy and that the United States needs faster growth rates.
Mr. Hubbard said the economy would continue to benefit from the Fed's interest rate cuts of last year. He said the economy would also benefit if Congress agreed to make permanent the 10-year tax cut package signed into law by President Bush last year.
He dismissed concerns about the return of the federal budget deficit. Mr. Hubbard said that he did not think that there was a link between eliminating deficits and bringing down long-term interest rates, rejecting the core of the economic policy followed by President Bill Clinton in the 1990's.

HEADLINE: AIDS in 5 Nations Called Security Threat 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

DATELINE: LANGLEY, Va., Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Rates of infection from the AIDS virus in five of the world's most populous countries are rising so fast that they pose potential security threats to their regions and to the United States, a group that advises the Central Intelligence Agency said here today. 
 The countries -- China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia -- have 40 percent of the world's population and by 2010 will have more H.I.V.-infected people than any other five countries, an agency official said. 
 By 2010, the number of infected people in those countries will grow to an estimated 50 million to 75 million, from the current estimate of 14 million to 23 million, said the group, the National Intelligence Council. It is composed of individuals from the government and academic and private sectors. 
H.I.V., the AIDS virus, could harm the economic, social, political and military structure in each of the five countries, a C.I.A. official said in releasing the declassified parts of the council's report.
H.I.V. would spark tensions over spending priorities, driving up health care costs and sharpening military manpower shortages, Dr. David F. Gordon, a C.I.A. official and the report's author, said at a news conference at the intelligence agency's headquarters here.
For instance, Dr. Gordon said, the AIDS epidemic in Russia is likely to help shape how that country emerges in the post-Soviet era. Up to one-third of prospective conscripts to Russia's military services are deemed unfit for service because of H.I.V. or chronic hepatitis from drug use, the report said.
Dr. Gordon said the AIDS epidemic could generate political tensions in Nigeria, a major oil producer. He also said the epidemic could weaken Nigeria's peacekeeping role for the United Nations in Africa.
Nigeria's leadership has been the most active among the five countries in trying to raise awareness about AIDS, in part by publicly warning about the risk of "extinction" of Africa's population, the report said.
"The Nigerian military, concerned about the loss of key personnel from AIDS, now mandates training about the disease for soldiers," it said.
In Ethiopia, many soldiers contracted H.I.V. during the civil war in the 1980's by having contact with multiple sex partners. When the war ended in 1991, thousands of infected soldiers and prostitutes returned home, spreading H.I.V. and AIDS in their villages and towns, and the threat continues, the report said.
Although the governments of China, India and Nigeria are beginning to focus more attention on the threat, it said, all five countries need "dramatic shifts in priorities" to control their epidemics by 2010 because the disease has built up significant momentum, health services are inadequate and the cost of education and treatment will be overwhelming.
The report was given to the governments of each of the five countries about two months ago as a measure to help them combat their epidemics, Dr. Gordon said. Although replies have not been received, the group looks forward to a dialogue with the countries, he said. 
Dr. Gordon now directs transnational issues for the C.I.A. 
The AIDS epidemic is in a different stage of development in each country, but in all of them it is in a much earlier stage than it is in the worst-affected areas in central and southern Africa. In all five countries, risky sexual behaviors are fueling the epidemic, but the rates of spread differ, the agency said. 
H.I.V. is spreading to wider circles through heterosexual sex in India, the movement of infected migrated workers in China and frequent amnesty releases of large numbers of infected prison inmates and rising prostitution in Russia.
The council said that in deriving its estimates, it gathered data from governments and nongovernmental organizations and consulted extensively with scientific and AIDS experts in and out of the American government. But it did not collaborate with the governments of the five countries.
The report cautioned that there was a strong likelihood that the inconsistent use of anti-H.I.V. drugs and the manufacture in foreign countries of unregulated, substandard drugs would probably lead to greater spread of drug-resistant strains of H.I.V. 
The report is the latest in a series of papers by the National Intelligence Council on AIDS since the late 1980's. It expands on one the group issued in December 1999 on the global threat of infectious diseases, including H.I.V., on the United States. The United States has declared the global epidemic of AIDS a national security threat.
The findings also generally affirm a similar bleak warning issued by the United Nations at the 14th international conference on AIDS in Barcelona, Spain, in July, its first long-range forecast of the global epidemic. At that time, the United Nations said AIDS would claim an additional 65 million lives by 2020, more than triple the number who died in the first 20 years of the epidemic, unless more countries vastly expanded their prevention programs.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
European Charm, Yankee Reliability

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
YEAH, I know travel writers are supposed to get all dewy-eyed about that precious inn with the charming rose gardens in the Cotswold countryside, or that delightful three-star with the antique quilts on the beds just a stone's throw from the Champs-Elysees.
 But let's face it, modern travelers: some of those places aren't quite as nice as some travel writers make them sound. As Kurt Ritter was saying recently at the 21 Club in Manhattan, "There are a lot of really crummy three-star hotels in Europe." 
 The plainspoken Mr. Ritter is the president and chief executive of Rezidor SAS, a hotel company based in Brussels that is owned by the SAS Group, which is also the parent of Scandinavian Airlines. He and Jay S. Witzel, the president of Carlson Hotels Worldwide of Minneapolis, were in New York to announce a deal that will greatly expand four of Carlson's hotel brands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa under the management of Rezidor SAS. 
In the United States, about 80 percent of all hotels are affiliated with a national or international brand. In Europe, only about 30 percent are, according to Mr. Ritter.
While conventional wisdom might argue that this indicates that the esteemed hotels of Europe have admirably resisted cookie-cutter standardization at the hands of the rapacious invading American lodging-industry capitalists, a growing body of personal and anecdotal experience suggests otherwise. Suffice to suggest that "Fawlty Towers," the British TV comedy about a rude, inept hotelier operating a successful inn with a dreadful restaurant attached, would not have seemed plausible if it were set in the United States.
In this country, two Carlson brands included in the new licensing arrangement, Country Inns and Suites and Park Inn, occupy the midtier and high-end economy segments of the market. In Europe, South Africa and parts of the Middle East, there is a clear demand for a level of reliability in these niches, which correspond roughly to two-star and three-star, Mr. Ritter said.
"Europe is full of individually owned hotels in those levels, where you simply don't know what you're going to get for your money," said Mr. Ritter, a 1970 graduate of the Ecole Hoteliere in Switzerland. A good many of those hotels, he suggested, are well past whatever glory days they might ever have had.
He added, "We think there is a niche there for us" to market the Carlson brands as hotels with dependable, known standards of amenities and service, especially to the growing ranks of business travelers, who now account for about 75 percent of the business at hotels managed by Rezidor in 38 countries.
The new agreement by the hotel companies includes a large expansion overseas of two other Carlson brands besides Country Inns and Park Inn. Those are Regent International, in the top-luxury, five-star niche, and Radisson Hotels and Resorts, on the upscale, full-service level usually associated with four-star hotels in the European market. Under a 1994 agreement with Carlson, Rezidor has already been managing about 115 Radisson-brand hotels in Europe and elsewhere.
Under the new agreement, Rezidor expects to expand the four Carlson brands to 700 hotel sites the next 10 years. Rezidor recently sold its half-interest in Malmaison hotels, a small British chain that managed stylish urban boutique hotels catering to a young clientele. Mr. Ritter said that his company was planning to work with Carlson to develop a new brand of fashionable, but moderately priced, boutique hotels with prominent restaurants attached. Mr. Witzel said that brand would partly be modeled on the Kimpton Group boutique hotels in the United States.
Reflecting the American model, the new licensing arrangement by Carlson and Rezidor will offer business travelers, including Americans traveling abroad, a range of hotels in those niches. They are then managed under one corporate umbrella, with unified global customer loyalty rewards programs, corporate-purchasing and booking systems, and employee training procedures.
Of course, all big hotel companies in the United States have sites abroad, and many are expanding. Last week, for example, Marriott International opened the 218-room Brussels Marriott, the first full-service Marriott in Belgium, where the company also manages the Renaissance Brussels Hotel. And Carlson Hotels itself already operates its own properties in 81 countries.
But with its ambitious overseas expansion plans within a range of brands from luxury to economy, under foreign management, the new deal by Carlson and Rezidor adds evidence that the once much-maligned American corporate-chain model, while modified to adapt to cultures and tastes in individual countries, may represent the new global standard for the industry.
"In our strategic planning, in deciding what's working and what's not working, we realized that to be a truly global company we had to think globally, and not think American-centric," Mr. Witzel said.
Hammering out the new arrangement expanding Carlson brands abroad took three years, said Mr. Witzel and Mr. Ritter, who became good friends in the process despite frequent tussles over their companies' sometimes distinctly different attitudes toward hotel management, design and overall philosophy.
Ultimately, Mr. Witzel said, "the person with the most expertise" in various matters under dispute was deferred to. "We worked that out, though I won't say the process was without friction," he added.
The dynamic tension led Rezidor to appreciate American approaches to expansion and marketing, Mr. Ritter said. In Minneapolis, it yielded a broader cultural sensibility at Carlson headquarters, Mr. Witzel said.
"Now, we don't try to solve every problem by thinking, let's invent the solution here," he said. "We learned to reach out to people. There used to be always this notion from the American side that we're here to help, but we know better." 
Mr. Ritter said: "That's what they told us at first. We almost believed it."

HEADLINE: Shares of Retailers Fall on Reports of Slow Sales From Chains 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares in retail stores fell yesterday after some of the companies said that September sales were less than expected. Wal-Mart Stores, J. C. Penney, Federated Department Stores and Sears, Roebuck & Company were among the retailers warning of disappointing results. 
 Shares of other chains, including the No. 1 home-improvement retailer Home Depot, also declined. 
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest merchant, cut its September sales forecast, while J. C. Penney said sales fell in September. The parent company of Macy's, Federated, said sales might be unchanged. 
That raised investors' concerns that consumer spending, which kept the economy afloat during the recession, may be faltering as retailers head into the holiday season. 
"Things will likely get a little worse before they get better," said David Abella, an analyst of Rochdale Investment Management. "It just keeps getting a little worse each week."
Concerns about port closings along the West Coast may also be hurting stocks, some analysts said. Many companies, including Wal-Mart and the Gap, have said they made contingency plans to shield themselves from a strike or a lockout.
Shares of Wal-Mart fell $2, to $49.24. 
The discount chain, based in Bentonville, Ark., said sales at stores open at least a year would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the five weeks ending this Friday. The company had expected a same-store sales gain of 4 percent to 6 percent. This might be the third consecutive month that sales missed forecasts.
J. C. Penney, the second-largest department-store company after Sears, dropped $1.68, or 9.6 percent, to $15.92. The retailer said sales declined as demand for sweaters and outerwear was weaker than expected last week. J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., had expected September sales to be unchanged or up slightly.
The recent sales, which reflect lackluster back-to-school results for many retailers, suggest that shoppers are cutting spending on apparel and nonessential purchases as they continue to buy automobiles and homes, analysts said.
Federated shares fell $1.73, to $29.44. The company said sales would be little changed to 2 percent higher. Federated, based in Cincinnati, also owns the Burdines and Lazarus chains. It had expected sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent.
Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said September sales were within the company's forecast for a decline in the high-single-digit percent range. A spokeswoman, Peggy Palter, declined to be more specific. Shares of Sears fell $1.62, to $39. 
Shares in the Target Corporation fell $2.39, to $29.52, in their biggest decline in about a year.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
New Day but Same Sorry Script

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
THE New Jersey Democrats knew precisely how to choreograph this debacle. 
 Scene 1, fallen hero limps off stage. Scene 2, new leading man enters stage right, riding a white steed and triumphantly declaring it a new day. 
 After all, the New Jersey Republicans had originated that two-act drama just 18 months ago. Day 1, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco abandoned his campaign for governor because of "ethics questions." Day 2, the party presented Representative Bob Franks, who triumphantly declared it a new day. 
But it's never a new day in New Jersey. You can change the leading man, change the party, even change the steed (poor steed), but you always get the same sorry script.
Yesterday, with the Democrats' next Senate candidate yet to be chosen, or convinced, Mr. Torricelli played out the last scene of his 20-year public career. His 30-minute speech re-enforced why he was a Democratic Party champion and also why even some Democrats had lost patience.
All of Mr. Torricelli's true devotion and self-promotion were contained in one sentence from his speech: "Don't feel bad for me. I changed people's lives."
He did fight for causes like gun control, environmental protection, shelters for battered women, low-income housing, abortion rights.
Even yesterday, he had a clear vision of the landscape ahead. "America will soon be at war again," he said. "Our economy is terribly troubled. The nation is returning to serious debt. Our open lands, which I love so much, are being lost."
And, of course, his political instincts were sharp. He had been instrumental in his party's winning control of the Senate. But, he said yesterday, "in a strange irony of life," he was now a threat to that majority.
MR. TORRICELLI'S complications were never far below the surface in his political career. Passion sometimes turned into combat. The public interest to which he dedicated his life ended with questions about his private interests. 
Yesterday, he thanked Gov. James E. McGreevey for his friendship, saying they had had long talks about "life and politics." Yet Mr. Torricelli felt compelled to explain that the fight he started two years ago by trying to knock Mr. McGreevey out of the governor's race was just a "12-day disagreement."
He said he wanted no sympathy, but then asked, "When did we become such an unforgiving people?"
The truth is, voters had little time to forgive Mr. Torricelli. They were still trying to figure out what the truth was. He first insisted he had done nothing wrong. Then he said he had made some mistakes and apologized. Then he fought to keep more facts from coming out.
He said he was leaving because "I will not be responsible for the loss of the Democratic majority in the United States Senate." But leaving at this late date -- two months after the Senate Ethics Committee admonished him for accepting gifts -- makes it difficult for the party to replace him on the ballot.
Mr. Torricelli, always the partisan, declared at the end of his speech, "Doug Forrester does not belong in the United States Senate."
But now comes Scene 2. The Democrats are rounding up the usual suspects in searching for their next leading man -- representatives, former United States senators. 
But this is also Scene 2 for Doug Forrester, the Republican challenger who has long said he was running "to retire Bob Torricelli."
On Sunday, with Mr. Torricelli still in the race, Mr. Forrester walked through a street fair in Hoboken, soaking up the warm reception in a Democratic stronghold. "Go get him!" yelled one voter. "I switched my registration to vote for you," an elderly lady whispered to him.
But a few voters came up to him, wanting to know something about his platform other than that he's not Bob Torricelli. "Who are you?" one woman asked, bluntly.
Mr. Forrester said he, too, felt frustrated, having the campaign dominated by "ethics questions." So yesterday, with Mr. Torricelli effectively retired and the ethics questions moot, Mr. Forrester held his own news conference at the State House. 
Mr. Forrester had a new issue, but it was not his platform. What had him fired up was the legal battle brewing over the Democrats' attempt to replace the retiring Mr. Torricelli on the ballot. "We will continue to fight to restore New Jersey's pride," he said. A new day?
Perhaps it's fitting that one of the long-shot choices to replace Mr. Torricelli on the ballot was rumored to be Bill Bradley, who retired from the Senate in 1996, declaring that "politics is broken." It's not a bad line, going or coming.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
A Bad Quarter for U.S. Markets Was Worse in Other Countries

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The American stock market has been a horrible place to be. But it was better than most markets overseas in the quarter that ended yesterday.
 The sinking feeling that gripped the American stock market caused the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks to plunge 17.6 percent, its worst quarterly showing since the market crashed in late 1987. Much of that loss came in the last month alone; the index fell 1.5 percent yesterday. Page C14. 
 But it still did better over the last quarter than markets in Britain, France, Germany and Brazil, where concerns about a possible default on its debt have led to a flight of capital.
There was virtually no place to hide in the stock markets of the world last quarter. The best places turned out to be markets that were already so badly beaten down that perhaps they had little room to fall.
The causes advanced for the decline are numerous, and sometimes not too persuasive. That the falls were so widespread tends to indicate that single-country explanations -- whether the corporate scandals in the United States or the election in Germany -- cannot be complete.
But many of the world's economies seem to be slowing. Germany's economy has all but stalled, and the recent election did not feature proposals for significant economic reforms by either major party. Much of Europe appears to be slowing, too, and while the United States economy rebounded in the third quarter, many fear that growth will slow the next three months.
There is also the issue of economic leadership. Gregory Fossedal, the chairman of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Washington, notes that there has been a profusion of generally small trade disputes this year. The United States, he argues, has been in a poor position to lead on trade after its own efforts to protect farmers and steel companies this year.
Instead, the international focus has been on whether there will be an invasion of Iraq. Some argue that an invasion would be bullish for stocks, pointing to the way stock prices in the United States took off after the last war with Iraq began in 1991.
Among the Group of Seven, the major industrialized countries, the best performer was the country whose economy is widely regarded as the most hopeless. The Nikkei 225, Japan's best-known index, fell only 11.7 percent in the quarter. Its low point, reached in early September, was the lowest since 1983.
In the United States, the third- quarter fall in prices was almost universal. Only 41 of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500 managed to have gains, along with 12 of the Nasdaq 100 stocks and 2 of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. But some bulls took hope from the fact that the S.& P. 500 rebounded yesterday when it neared the low it reached on July 23. In the jargon of technical analysis, that low is being tested, and the market has not yet failed the test.
For the other big gauges, alas, the test was failed earlier in the month. The Dow ended the month at a four-year low, while the Nasdaq was at a six-year low.
The quarter just ended was also extraordinary for its volatility. For the S.& P. 500, 69 percent of the trading sessions ended with the index up or down at least 1 percent from the previous day, and 41 percent showed moves of at least 2 percent.
By that measure of volatility, the quarter was just a bit bouncier than the final three months of 1987, when the figures were 66 percent and 41 percent. To find a more volatile quarter, it is necessary to go back to the 1930's, when wild moves were common during the Depression.
One measure of just how extraordinary the volatility has become is that during the five-year period from the beginning of 1992 through the end of 1996, the S.& P. 500 had just 10 days on which it moved 2 percent or more. There were 26 such days in the quarter just ended.
Wild volatility makes it hard for investors to figure out just what the market is doing, because a big change in direction on one day may just be more evidence of volatility. That was proved in spades this quarter. In July, the S.& P. went down at least 2 percent in each of four consecutive sessions. Then it rose more than 5 percent in two of the next four sessions. In August, it had three consecutive sessions with declines of at least 2 percent, followed by three consecutive gains of 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Labor Lockout At West's Ports Roils Business 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Cargo ships waited offshore today and factory owners worried about parts shortages as port operators from Seattle to San Diego shut down 29 West Coast ports in a dispute with the longshoremen's union.
 After five months of contentious negotiations over a new contract, the operators said they were compelled to shut the ports indefinitely because of what they said was a longshoremen's slowdown that was paralyzing operations. 
 The union called the shutdown an unjust lockout of 10,500 longshoremen.
Economists and political leaders voiced fears that a long shutdown of the ports, which handle $300 billion in cargo a year, could hurt a broad swath of businesses. Retailers complained that the shutdown would make it hard to stock shelves for the holiday season, auto dealers said they might soon run out of some popular Japanese cars, and farmers said fresh produce meant for export would soon rot. 
"Obviously, this is a major economic disaster for U.S. importers and exporters that represent a substantial portion of the nation's economy," said Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, a group that includes Wal-Mart, Kmart, Toyota and dozens of other major importers. "This shutdown is having an immediate impact. We are at the brink of an assembly line shutdown in various places."
The West Coast ports handle about half the nation's imports and exports. 
The Bush administration said it was monitoring the shutdown, which some economists say will cost the economy $1 billion a day for the first five days, with the cost rising exponentially if it lasts several weeks. 
"If it goes on for even a short period of time, it's a problem for the economy," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "We're monitoring it carefully."
The longshoremen's union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, denounced the employers' group for closing the ports, insisting that management was putting the nation's economy at risk. But the Pacific Maritime Association, a group of shipping lines and port operators, said the longshoremen had been staging a slow-motion strike and were to blame for hurting the ports and the economy.
At a news conference at union headquarters here, James Spinosa, the union's president, acknowledged that longshoremen had slowed operations by refusing to work overtime, by not assigning experienced workers to huge cranes and by seizing on safety issues to slow their normal rate of work. He said the union was being more cautious about safety because five longshoremen died on the job over the past year. 
In Portland and Oakland, the employers' association said, crane operators over the last few days were loading and unloading less than half the 30 large metal cargo containers that they normally unload per hour.
Joseph Miniace, president of the employers' association, said it would not reopen the ports until the union agreed to resume work normally and extend its contract. The union's three-year contract expired on July 1, but the union repeatedly agreed to temporary extensions until Labor Day weekend when it refused further extensions.
The employers have agreed to meet with federal mediators this Thursday, but union officials said they were not ready to meet with a mediator. The two sides resumed negotiations for a short time today, evidently making little progress, and said they would meet again on Wednesday.
Mr. Spinosa said the longshoremen would not extend the contract until management met the union halfway on the central issue in the negotiations -- management's desire to use new technologies. 
"The I.L.W.U. will not be intimidated," Mr. Spinosa said. "We will not move into a contract that is not desirable for our workforce."
Among the ports, Portland specializes in importing cars from Asia and exporting grain from the Midwest. Seattle imports a range of goods that go to the Midwest and elsewhere in the country.
Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest ports, handle a wide range of cargo, with much of their imports sold in the West and much of their exports produced in the region.
Industry officials said it would be difficult to divert the West Coast-bound ships to Atlantic or Gulf Coast ports because Pacific cargo ships were generally too large to go through the Panama Canal.
American exporters said the shutdown could be disastrous. Charlie Woo, the president of Mega Toys, which is based in Los Angeles, said: "I got a lot of stuff stuck on a boat right now. In terms of Christmas delivery, this is really the two-minute warning. This is crunch time."
Andrea Greco, vice president of supply for Fila USA, the footwear company, voiced concern that a shutdown would delay shipments until too late in the holiday season. "Past a certain date, they really don't want to take the product," Ms. Greco said.
Off the port of Long Beach, at least 20 hulking cargo ships waited silently, while inside the harbor, scores of cranes, each at least 10 stories high, stood idle.
Many longshoremen -- whose pay runs from $80,000 to $158,000 a year -- voiced anger and frustration that management had shut the ports. Joseph Hanson, a longshoreman for 35 years, said: "We've been working without a contract for three months. We've been working in good faith. They're talking about good faith. There ain't no good faith."
Management wants to introduce new technologies to speed cargo-handling, like using optical scanners to register the cargo that truck drivers carry into the ports. Even though the employers have promised job security to the longshoremen, the union has balked at accepting such new technologies because it worries that some jobs will become nonunion. 
But management officials said the union's rejection of new technologies would hurt the ports' expansion. "On the issue of technology, the union cannot put its head in the sand," Tom Edwards, Northern California director of the maritime association, said at a news conference at a San Francisco hotel. "The lack of technology is already creating severe bottlenecks at the ports, and there's no chance that we will be able to accommodate the expected trade growth from Asia without it. The top ports in Asia and in Europe are at least a decade ahead of us."
The last major work stoppage at the West Coast ports was a 134-day strike in 1971. 
In the last two rounds of negotiations, in 1996 and in 1999, management largely bowed to the union's demands after the longshoremen refused to work overtime and slowed down operations in other ways. Management officials said that the port operators and shipping lines decided not to let themselves be pushed around this time. 
Mr. Miniace said slowdowns are more disruptive than a full-scale strike because they throw off scheduling for arriving ships, for trucks that pick up and deliver cargo and for factories that rely on just-in-time arrival of components for production.
Calling the employers' move "a defensive shutdown," Mr. Edwards said, "When you reduce production in all the West Coast ports by 50 percent, that's a strike, and they're trying to get paid for it when they can." 
Last summer, Bush administration officials said they were thinking of ordering an 80-day cooling off period in the event of a work stoppage -- the first time such a Taft-Hartley order would be used since a 1978 coal strike. Union officials accused the administration of tilting toward management, but in recent weeks the administration has soft-pedaled talk of a cooling-off period.
Of all the states, Hawaii is likely to be hurt most by a prolonged shutdown because it imports more than 90 percent of its goods.

HEADLINE: Chicago-Area Factory Index Falls for Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the Chicago area unexpectedly contracted in September for the first time in eight months, according to a report released today, suggesting that the economic rebound might be in danger of stalling.
 In the report, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its factory index fell to 48.1, with a decline in new orders and a slowdown in production, from 54.9 in August. It was the first reading below 50, which indicates a contraction, since January. Economists had expected a reading of 53. 
 "We know that something's wrong with the economy," said Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in a speech today to economists before the report. Mr. McTeer was one of two Fed officials who wanted the Federal Open Market Committee to reduce interest rates at last week's meeting. Central bankers left the benchmark rate unchanged. 
The index of new orders fell to 49.2 in September, the first decline since January. Its production index fell to 52.8 from 57.1. 
The index of order backlogs dropped to 39.9 from 48.3. An index measuring inventory levels declined to 39.3 from 41.4. The region's manufacturers have been cutting inventories since March 2000. The prices-paid index fell to 57.6 from 63.6 in August. 
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said the economy in the third quarter has been propped up by consumer spending and growth in incomes. It said personal spending rose 0.3 percent in August after a 1 percent increase in July. 
Wages, salaries and other pay increased 0.4 percent in August, the report said, and were 3.5 percent higher than a year earlier. Analysts said that increase was vital for a sustainable recovery because personal spending accounted for about two-thirds of the economy.
"The income numbers have been pretty decent in the past year," said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, suggesting that consumer spending would be "solid, but unspectacular."

Biggest Drop for Attendance in Major Leagues Since the 1995 Season

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Major League Baseball attendance fell by 6 percent this season, the largest drop since 1995, when 20 percent fewer fans came to stadiums after the settlement of the players strike that eliminated the previous year's playoffs and World Series.
 Attendance for the 30 teams was 67.9 million, the lowest total since 63.2 million in 1997, when there were 28 teams. Last year, attendance was 72.2 million, according to the commissioner's office. 
 "We think the economy had a lot to do with the drop," said Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball. "A lot of industries are suffering."
He said the threat of a possible strike "had something to do with it."
Baseball releases only paid attendance figures, which do not not reflect how many people are actually at the games.
Dan Migala, the executive editor of Team Marketing Report, suggested that the labor situation "had a lot to do with" falling attendance, affecting people planning trips, walk-up sales and corporate ticket buying.
He also cited falling attendance at new ballparks with losing teams. The Tigers' attendance at Comerica Park, which opened in 2000, fell 22 percent, to 1.5 million. In Milwaukee, the Brewers' attendance fell 30 percent, to 1.9 million, in the second season at Miller Park. PNC Park in Pittsburgh attracted 1.8 million ticket buyers, 25 percent fewer than last season, when it opened.
"Teams like the Brewers are left with limited options," Migala said. "They did a Mr. Potato Head giveaway, where he was in a Brewers uniform, but you can't do that at every game."
Yankees attendance increased 6 percent to 3.46 million and Seattle's edged up 1 percent to 3.5 million, the most in the majors.
And despite the Mets' disappointing season, attendance grew by 5.5 percent, to 2.8 million.
Meanwhile, television ratings, excluding last weekend, fared better. The rating for Fox's Saturday afternoon game of the week, up 12 percent earlier this season, finished even with last year. Fox Sports Net's 25-team regional average rose 3 percent. ESPN's rating rose 10 percent and ESPN2's was up by 17 percent.
In one of the stranger sidelights to the attendance figures, the Marlins and Expos fought to the final game to avoid being the least-attended team. Going into their games Sunday, the Marlins trailed the Expos by 3,000.
David Samson, the Marlins' president, said that a "good Samaritan" fan, whose name he wouldn't reveal, concerned that the Marlins would finish behind the almost-contracted Expos, bought 15,000 tickets soon after Sunday's game started at 4:05 p.m. The Marlins finished at 813,118, 573 ahead of the Expos' 812,545.
Samson said the fan first called Thursday to suggest that the team count tickets given to charities in its paid attendance so that the Marlins could beat the Expos. The man was told that wasn't how the system worked. Samson said, "The man asked, 'Well, what would it take?' and I said I wouldn't know until I saw the attendance in Montreal."
Once the Expos announced attendance of 25,178 at Olympic Stadium on Sunday, he called the man and told him how many tickets would put the Marlins over the top.
The Marlins were able to announce a paid crowd of 28,599, but less than 10,000 appeared to show up at Pro Player Stadium.
"He didn't buy them in time to give them away," Samson said.
He added: "It's funny. If someone bought 1,000 tickets a day for 15 straight games, nobody would have noticed."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
3 Big Advertisers Seeking New Agencies

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives

 BODY:
Three large advertisers said yesterday that they were beginning account reviews, after unexpectedly parting ways with their agencies.
 The Timex Corporation and the Minneapolis office of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, are ending a 16-year relationship as of Dec. 31. 
 Jim Katz, a spokesman for Timex, the watchmaker, which is based in Middlebury, Conn., said that "after 16 years we feel we wanted to see what else is out there." A review will begin as soon as Fallon completes work on its assignments, he added. 
Fallon has created campaigns for Timex products like Indiglo and helped reintroduce the familiar Timex slogan, "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking." According to the CMR division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, which tracks ad spending, Timex spent $2.3 million to advertise in major media in the first six months, compared with $261,800 for the period a year ago, and spent $6 million in 2001 compared with $10.3 million in 2000.
The Pepsi-Cola North America division of PepsiCo will soon place in review the assignment to create soft drink campaigns aimed at black consumers, to replace the UniWorld Group in New York, which has handled that task for the last four years. Billings were estimated at $10 million.
Bart Casabona, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y., confirmed a report this week in Advertising Age that the company and UniWorld, 49 percent owned by the WPP Group, would part ways after a contract expires on Dec. 31. The review will begin at that time, Mr. Casabona said, as the company seeks to replace UniWorld with another agency owned or majority-owned by black Americans.
Mr. Casabona said the decision not to renew the contract was made before the withdrawal in August of a Pepsi-Cola commercial created by UniWorld, that featured the rap singer Ludacris. The spot was withdrawn amid complaints about the sexually explicit and profane lyrics of his songs, though no such songs were ever part of the campaign.
Finally, the History Channel cable network and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network, are parting after about three years. The network spent $7 million to advertise in major media in the first half of 2002, CMR reported.
The History Channel will begin a review immediately, said Artie Scheff, senior vice president for marketing at the History Channel in New York, after deciding not to renew a contract with Kirshenbaum Bond that expires on Dec. 31. Jonathan Bond, co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond, said that the agency had resigned the account. The History Channel is part of A&E Television Networks, owned by ABC, a division of the Walt Disney Company; the Hearst Corporation; and NBC, a unit of General Electric.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Hewlett To Cut 1,206 Jobs In France 

BYLINE:  Bridge News

 BODY:
 The Hewlett-Packard Company, the world's biggest personal computer maker, will eliminate 1,206 jobs in France as a result of its $18.9 billion purchase in May of Compaq Computer. 
About half of the cuts will be made in Grenoble, in eastern France, and most of the rest will be in the Paris region, the company said yesterday. Workers' committees and unions at Hewlett-Packard have been informed, as French law requires, the company said. Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has said it will drop 16,800 employees. Hewlett-Packard shares fell 36 cents, or 3 percent, to $11.67. The shares have dropped 32 percent since the acquisition closed on May 3.

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS PLANS TO ELIMINATE 1,695 JOBS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, said yesterday that it would cut 1,695 jobs, or 5.4 percent of its work force, as two and a half years of falling stock prices had thinned the assets it has under management. 
The job cuts at the company, based in Boston, came after last October's announcement that it would trim 760 jobs, or 2.3 percent of the work force. That time, the brokerage unit accounted for about half the cuts. A Fidelity spokeswoman said the cuts would be felt in almost every unit of the closely held company, which employs more than 31,000. No fund managers or analysts will lose their jobs, she said.

CESSNA AIRCRAFT TO LAY OFF 400 AFTER BUYING OUT 400

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The Cessna Aircraft Company said yesterday that it would lay off 400 workers after it failed to get enough employees to accept voluntary buyouts. The company said in June that it hoped to cut its work force by about 900 people, or 6.9 percent of its worldwide work force of 13,000, through voluntary buyouts. 
The cuts come as orders for the company's Citation business jet slow. Cessna said the layoffs would come in the next 30 days, on top of another 400 job cuts achieved through the voluntary separation package. The reductions will affect every class of worker, a spokeswoman said. This has been a record year for Cessna, with 300 deliveries of the Citation. But the company expects that to fall to 250 deliveries in 2003, she said. Cessna, based in Wichita, Kan., is a division of Textron of Providence, R.I.

ELECTRONICS COMPANY TO CUT ADDITIONAL JOBS IN U.S.

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The CTS Corporation, a maker of electronic components and assemblies, plans to cut an additional 140 jobs and move more work to China to cut costs, it said yesterday. 
The transfer will take place by the fourth quarter of next year. Last month, CTS cut 160 jobs. It employed 6,000 to 6,200 workers before the new job reductions, a company spokesman said. CTS, based in Elkhart, Ind., now expects related costs to cut third-quarter results by $18.5 million, compared with a previous forecast of $15 million to $17 million. The revamping is expected to increase pretax savings to $15 million to $17 million in 2003 from an earlier estimate of $11 million.

HEADLINE: Chief of Big Pension Plan Is Choice for Accounting Board 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
The chief executive of one of the nation's largest pension programs, John H. Biggs, has agreed to be the first head of a new regulatory oversight board for the accounting profession, people involved in the selection said today.
 Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission offered the job to Mr. Biggs, the head of TIAA-CREF, the big pension fund, and a leading voice for aggressive accounting oversight. The S.E.C.'s first choice, Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, turned down the post. 
 Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., has said he hoped to announce the board by the end of September, but the commission failed to reach agreement on the four other members.
The board was created by Congress two months ago after a wave of corporate scandals shook investor confidence and sent the stock markets swooning. It is viewed by lawmakers and corporate law experts as essential to restoring confidence in the markets by taking steps to end accounting abuses and reduce the record number of earnings restatements over the last few years. 
The new agency, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, has been given a broad mandate to set ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, discipline accountants and conduct annual reviews of the largest accounting firms. 
The board's predecessor organization suffered from a variety of problems, notably its lack of independent financing, which hampered its ability to police the profession. That problem has been addressed by creating a different financing mechanism -- the budget for the new board will come from assessments levied on the corporate clients of the auditing firms.
Mr. Biggs, 66, is an economist, actuary and former top educator and insurance executive. His term as chairman and chief executive of TIAA-CREF is scheduled to expire next spring. With $265 billion in assets for 15,000 institutions, the investment plan -- formally the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund -- is the largest pension system in the country for educational institutions.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Biggs declined today to discuss his role at the oversight board. His views about accounting regulation have become well known in Washington this year.
He has spoken publicly and testified repeatedly to Congress about the need for tougher regulation of accountants. He has called for tighter accounting of stock options granted to corporate executives. He urged Congress to go beyond the proposals made by Mr. Pitt in establishing a tough and independent oversight agency. And at his own company, he has rotated TIAA-CREF's auditors every five to seven years, and not used the same accounting firms to perform both auditing and consulting functions.
"The three changes we have needed for some time and that bear directly on the circumstances of Enron are these," Mr. Biggs told the Senate Banking Committee in February at hearings that laid the groundwork for passage of the law that created the new accounting board. "One, a means of dealing with the widespread overuse and abuse of fixed-price stock options. Two, the need for some basic common sense regarding auditor independence. And three, the need for a strong regulatory model to oversee the accounting profession."
Experts applauded the choice today. "Biggs is an excellent choice," said James D. Cox, a Duke University professor in corporate and securities law who has written extensively on accounting issues. "He comes from an organization that has been in the vanguard in terms of expectations for auditors, and he's been successful in everything he's done."
The S.E.C. is preparing to formally announce the selection of Mr. Biggs soon and is negotiating over the rest of the board. By law, two of the five members must be accountants. Disagreement has centered on the possible selection of Donald J. Kirk, a professor at Columbia Business School and former head of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. He is said to be a top candidate of some officials, including Robert K. Herdman, the chief accountant of the S.E.C. 
Mr. Kirk is opposed by others at the commission and by consumer and investor groups who say he is too close to the profession. They have sought the appointment of Charles Bowsher, the former comptroller general and head of the old Public Oversight Board. But Mr. Bowsher has had a strained relationship with Mr. Pitt since he resigned in protest from that board, saying Mr. Pitt's suggested revamping would give the accounting profession too tight a rein on the regulatory apparatus.
Other candidates for the board include Sheldon Cohen, a former Internal Revenue commissioner; J. Michael Cook, a former chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu; Kayla J. Gillan, a former general counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System; Bevis Longstreth, a former member of the S.E.C.; Mary L. Schapiro, vice chairman of NASD; Joel Seligman, law school dean at Washington University in St. Louis; and Michael Sutton, a former chief accountant at the S.E.C.

HEADLINE: Mexican Oil Contract Is Victory for President 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox has won a major political battle with old Mexico, forcing the powerful union at the state-run oil giant, Pemex, to call off a strike that would have sent the nation reeling. 
 Now comes the larger struggle to make Pemex work. Hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention Mr. Fox's political fortunes, are at stake. 
 There was near-univeral consensus today that the agreement may mark a turning point for Mr. Fox's presidency, which began 22 months ago with sky-high hopes and great promises, most unfulfilled. 
"This was a conflict, pure and simple, about power," said Fernando Solana, a columnist for El Universal, Mexico City's largest daily newspaper. "Finally, the government took control." 
The strike threat came not from the rank and file but from union bosses, who aimed above all to halt the government's corruption investigation of their leader, Carlos Romero Deschamps, a stalwart of the former ruling party defeated by Mr. Fox two years ago. He is accused of illegally helping to funnel $170 million to the party to stop Mr. Fox. 
The party established the union, which has paid it back with money and political clout over the years. But many workers sided with Mr. Fox against their bosses. 
"I've got nothing against the union, organized labor or the workers," Mr. Fox said, drumming up support among hard-hats on an offshore Pemex oil rig. But he called the strike threat political blackmail, and cast this fight as a struggle against the bosses' graft and greed, and for the rule of law. He took it to the workers and the public, and won. 
The labor agreement, struck late Sunday, gives the 90,000 unionized oil workers a 5.5 percent wage increase and a 1.8 percent increase in benefits. The money, in the end, was not the issue. Mr. Fox stuck to his original offer on salaries, and the union took it. He did not buckle or bend, as he has sometimes done. 
Pemex's oil money has greased the political gears of Mexico for decades. While Mr. Fox's anticorruption initiatives may be slowly taking hold, they have made the machine sputter. At the same time, his economic reforms have so far come to almost nothing. They hinge on running Pemex in a new way. 
Pemex is not only the world's sixth-biggest oil producer and at the moment the largest supplier of foreign oil to the United States. Its money runs Mexico. It is taxed at an effective rate of 100 percent, with almost nothing left to explore and exploit new oil and natural gas wells. 
"This can't go on," Pemex's director, Raul Munoz Leos, said in an interview. "With this trend, we will be importing crude in a few years."
Mr. Fox wants to change that system by opening some energy exploration to foreign investment. But the union and the former ruling party, which holds a plurality in Congress, fiercely oppose him. They have seen oil and gas as a sacred patrimony ever since Mexico nationalized them and formed Pemex in 1938.

HEADLINE: Testing Iraq on Arms Inspectors 

 BODY:
Efforts to resolve the dispute over Iraq are proceeding on parallel tracks that appear contradictory but could be complementary. United Nations officials are meeting with Iraqis in Vienna this week to plan for the return of weapons investigators under existing United Nations resolutions. Meanwhile, Washington is calling for a tough new resolution with deadlines and enforcement provisions. 
 Washington can only gain by demonstrating its willingness to exhaust peaceful approaches before advocating war. The existing inspection system is flawed, as years of successful Iraqi defiance have demonstrated. But the Bush administration should use it to explore Iraq's real intentions. If Saddam Hussein means to allow the inspectors to have immediate and unfettered access to all suspect sites, well and good. If he does not, Washington can make a much stronger case to other members of the Security Council that many of the elements of its proposed resolution are necessary. Whether the Vienna talks lead to rigorous new inspections is up to Iraq. If the inspectors go back in, we will learn soon enough what barriers are placed in their way. 
 During the seven years that arms inspectors worked in Iraq under existing resolutions, they destroyed large quantities of illegal weapons, despite Baghdad's deceptions and concealments. The problem is that Iraq has never fully complied with the resolutions, which contain no meaningful deadlines or enforcement provisions beyond the continuation of increasingly porous economic sanctions. Also, in 1998 the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, agreed to allow Saddam Hussein to set ground rules for eight "presidential sites," which precluded surprise inspections at these locations. This arrangement, which never worked, should quickly be overridden by the Security Council. 
As this process unfolds, Washington and London should continue circulating a new draft resolution that may be needed if Iraq balks at inspections. The new resolution would give Iraq seven days after its passage to agree to its terms and 23 more days to turn over a complete list of illegal weapons activities. Member states would be authorized to use military force to assure compliance. 
China, Russia and France do not yet seem sold on the new resolution. France, for example, prefers a two-stage approach, with a first resolution spelling out inspection requirements and military enforcement to be considered later. If a new resolution is needed, we favor one with a deadline and a clear warning that military force is likely to follow if Baghdad fails to comply. But only if and when full-scale inspections fail should the Security Council give final consent to the use of force. That is why the Vienna negotiations over the conditions for a return of weapons inspectors are valuable. They hold out an alternative path for either a return of inspectors or a clearer demonstration of the need for a resolution that explicitly threatens military intervention.

HEADLINE: THE NEW JERSEY SENATE RACE: THE OVERVIEW; 
TORRICELLI QUITS CAMPAIGN, CITING RISK TO HIS PARTY

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat whose aggressive fund-raising helped his party gain its single-seat majority in the United States Senate, announced today that he was ending his bid for re-election, acknowledging that his campaign had become overwhelmed by questions about improper gifts he accepted from a contributor.
 Mr. Torricelli's conduct, which led to a rebuke by the Senate Ethics Committee in July, dominated the campaign, leading Democratic Party leaders in Washington to warn in recent weeks that his election was in danger and that his defeat might cost them control of the Senate. 
 After a judge made a damaging memorandum from federal investigators public last week, Mr. Torricelli, 51, spent the weekend in strategy meetings with Democrats in New Jersey and Washington, and this afternoon informed the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, that he was definite in his decision to withdraw. 
"I will not be responsible for the loss of the Democratic majority in the United States Senate," said Mr. Torricelli, whose voice broke several times as he announced his decision at a news conference in the New Jersey State House. "There is just too much at issue." Excerpts, Page B4. 
Mr. Torricelli's abrupt departure threw the race into chaos, and Democratic leaders were still debating tonight over possible candidates to replace him, including some, like former Senator Bill Bradley, who are not believed to be interested. Former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Representative Robert Menendez were also frequently mentioned. Other potential replacements included two other New Jersey congressmen, Representatives Robert E. Andrews and Frank Pallone Jr., and former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne.
With the election just 36 days away, however, Republicans promised a legal challenge to prevent Mr. Torricelli's name from being replaced on the ballot. New Jersey election law allows political parties to change candidates 51 days or more before the election, but the law is unclear about making a switch after that point.
Gov. James E. McGreevey, who stood beside Mr. Torricelli, during his announcement, said he and fellow Democrats would ask the State Supreme Court to allow the change because of the unusual circumstances.
The Republican nominee, Douglas R. Forrester, who often introduces himself as "the guy running against Bob Torricelli," said it would be improper to change candidates this late in the race.
"The laws of the State of New Jersey do not contain a 'We-think-we're-going-to-lose-so-we-get-to-pick-someone-new' clause," Mr. Forrester said at a news conference after Mr. Torricelli announced his withdrawal.
Democrats said that one provision of New Jersey election law allows the party to replace any candidate who dies or leaves office within 30 days of the election, leaving open the possibility that Mr. Torricelli might be asked to step down from his Senate seat before the election, on Nov. 5.
In the day before Mr. Torricelli publicly announced his departure from the race, he huddled with other New Jersey Democrats at Drumthwacket, the official mansion of the governor, where they searched for last-ditch strategies to resuscitate his troubled candidacy.
By this morning, however, Mr. Torricelli had informed party leaders that he would quit the race, and phoned several Democrats to ask whether they would consider running.
Governor McGreevey said he expected the party leaders to settle on a new candidate by Wednesday at the latest.
Senator Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said she believed that there were several candidates who could quickly focus the race on issues, like environmental protection and abortion rights, that have appealed to New Jersey's increasingly Democratic electorate.
"I am confident that one of the many Democrats who have expressed interest in this race will win on Election Day," she said. "Doug Forrester has not given the voters of New Jersey any positive vision for the state, the country, or our future."
In his emotional speech today, Mr. Torricelli said that he was gratified by the opportunity to serve in Congress for 20 years, and that he was proud of the fights he had waged for stricter gun control, environmental protection, more affordable health care and abortion rights.
But he said he was frustrated that the furor over his ethical violations had obscured all other issues in the race.
"America will soon be at war again, our economy is terribly troubled, the nation is returning to serious debt," he said. "Our open lands which I love so much are being lost, and I can't be heard. I pride myself on my strong voice. It does not matter if you can't be heard at all in a campaign."
Mr. Torricelli's departure completes the precipitous fall of a man who is widely regarded as one of the Senate's brightest political tacticians and most gifted public speakers.
After serving years in the House of Representatives, he won a bruising Senate campaign in 1996, and before taking office was asked to serve on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
As committee chairman in 1999-00 he raised $100 million, became a familiar face on Sunday morning talk shows and was frequently called to the White House to counsel President Bill Clinton on Congressional strategy.
It was during his 1996 campaign that Mr. Torricelli also met David Chang, a constituent who ran a commodities business and sought help recovering money he was owed from the North Korean government. After holding a fund-raiser for Mr. Torricelli and chartering a jet for his campaign, Mr. Chang developed a close relationship, frequently visiting him at his home in Englewood and mingling with him at Democratic fund-raisers.
When the Justice Department's Campaign Financing Task Force found that Mr. Chang had given $53,700 in illegal donations to Mr. Torricelli's campaign and tried to obstruct their investigation, Mr. Chang eventually decided to cooperate with prosecutors.
Mr. Chang told investigators that Mr. Torricelli had lobbied on behalf of his businesses -- including a meeting between the senator and two top officials of the South Korean government in 1999 -- and that Mr. Chang had lavished the senator with tens of thousands of dollars in cash and expensive gifts, including a Rolex watch, an antique grandfather clock, Italian suits and a 52-inch television.
Despite witnesses and documents that corroborated Mr. Chang's claims, Mr. Torricelli denied accepting any "illegal gifts" and in January, when the United States attorney's office decided not to press criminal charges, many political analysts said they considered him a prohibitive favorite to win re-election.
After the ethics committee issued its letter "severely admonishing" Mr. Torricelli for accepting three gifts, he issued a public apology, but could not put the issue to rest. Last week, a federal court ordered the release of a Justice Department document in which prosecutors said they found Mr. Chang's description of their relationship to be credible, and it became clear that the issue would continue to dominate the campaign.
Even as he bowed out of the race, Mr. Torricelli continued to assail Mr. Chang's credibility and insisted, "I have not done the things that I have been accused of doing." But he said he was proud of his 30 years in Democratic Party politics and regretted that his missteps had prevented him from continuing to serve in the Senate.
"It is the most painful thing that I have ever done in my life," he said, his voice again breaking. "I apologize to everyone who has fought so hard."

HEADLINE: Ford Reaches Agreement With Union In Canada 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and the Canadian Auto Workers union said today that they had agreed on a tentative three-year contract covering 13,300 workers at Ford plants in Canada.
 The new contract's provisions on pay and benefits follow closely the pattern set in a deal reached earlier this month by the union and General Motors, including wage increases of 3 percent in each of the first two years and 2 percent in the third year of the contract. Each worker will receive a signing bonus of 1,000 Canadian dollars ($630). 
 The talks with Ford had been expected to be complicated by the company's plans to close a plant in Oakville, Ontario, west of Toronto, that builds F-150 pickup trucks. The closing, with the loss of 1,400 jobs, is part of a cost-cutting drive at Ford plants across North America. 
Ford said it had agreed to transfer 900 of the truck plant's workers to a nearby minivan assembly line, which will be expanded at a cost of 600 million Canadian dollars ($378 million) to produce a new Mercury minivan model. A third shift will be added to the minivan plant in late 2004; the closing of the pickup truck plant has been pushed back six months, to July 2004, under the deal.
Alain Batty, president of Ford's Canadian unit, said at a news conference today that the proposed investment in the minivan line would "revitalize" the Oakville plant. The company has agreed not to dismantle the pickup truck assembly line for the time being, and has held out the prospect of modifying the Oakville complex to permit it to produce several models on the same line.
For the first time in decades, bargaining is not taking place simultaneously in the United States and Canada. The Big Three automakers' American plants have four-year agreements, expiring next year, with the United Automobile Workers.
Each of the Big Three closely integrates its American and Canadian operations, with assembly lines in each country producing parts and vehicles for the entire North American market. A strike in Canada would reverberate at many vehicle and parts plants in the United States.
Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian union, said he did not expect that the U.A.W. would "see much that's a pattern for them" in the deals his union struck with General Motors and Ford. Still, Mr. Hargrove said, "nothing in this agreement will entail moving work from the United States to Canada."
Carlos Gomes, an economist who watches the auto industry for the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said the union "did get most of the things it was attempting to get." Ford's operations in the two countries were the most integrated of the Big Three's, he said, making Ford most vulnerable to a strike in Canada.
A ratification vote on the Ford contract will be held this weekend. The union is then scheduled to start negotiations with DaimlerChrysler, in which the main issue is likely to be the future of a van plant in Windsor; no model is scheduled to be built there beyond mid-2003. Mr. Hargrove said the union would announce a strike deadline at DaimlerChrysler on Oct. 7.
Mr. Hargrove said he was confident that no layoffs would be needed at Oakville. An improved retirement incentive totaling 60,000 Canadian dollars ($37,800) would probably encourage at least 500 older workers to retire there, he said, creating openings for workers who would otherwise be laid off.
Under the existing contract, the base wage at Ford is 27.70 Canadian dollars ($17.46) an hour for assembly line workers, and 33.10 Canadian dollars ($20.86) an hour for electricians, mechanics and other trades.
The auto industry has broken sales records in both the United States and Canada this year with the help of generous discounts and interest-free financing deals. However, September sales are expected to show a slight slackening, reflecting some analysts' concern that the market may be nearly saturated.
Mr. Gomes said that given the present strength of automotive sales and the fierce competition among manufacturers, a strike in Canada would cost any of the Big Three companies much more than acceding to the union's demands would.

HEADLINE: Japan's Executives Fear Economy Is Slipping Again 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Japanese executives now say the country's fragile nine-month old recovery is losing what little momentum it had, according to an influential quarterly survey published by the Bank of Japan.
 The results of the Tankan survey, which includes managers at 8,500 Japanese companies, suggest that without new impetus from the country's main sources of growth -- exports to the United States and Asia -- the Japanese economy could slip back into recession soon. 
 That growing possibility would only worsen the ills that already bedevil the economy, like pernicious deflation, high and rising unemployment and bankruptcy rates, and the banking system's mountain of nonperforming loans.
Although the surveyed managers were not as pessimistic in the September survey as they were three months earlier, the survey found that more of them were acting on their gloomy mood. Many of the companies have lowered their sales and profit forecasts and cut back capital spending plans for the year, the survey found. The availability of credit is also tightening, the survey found, with many companies reporting that banks are less willing to provide them with funds and are raising interest rates for the loans they do offer. 
And the upward momentum reported last quarter -- the June confidence reading, pessimistic as it was, was a huge improvement on March -- has all but evaporated. Since June, the threat of war in the Middle East, rising oil prices, sagging profits and swooning global stock markets have all taken a toll; so has the continuing slide in sales of cars, cellular phones and new homes in Japan.
"It worries me that the global economy is still lumbering along" at a slow pace, said Tadashi Onishi, chairman of Toyoda Machine Works, whose industry is suffering from the downturn in investment in new equipment.
In the September report, the main confidence index of managers at large companies rose four points to a reading of minus 14, meaning that pessimists now outnumber optimists by 14 percentage points. (The reading in March was minus 38.) Tellingly, surveyed companies foresee only a three-point rise in the December survey.
Another slowdown will add to the political pressure on Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to abandon his austerity program and prop up the economy with a flood of public spending. Mr. Koizumi has been trying to reduce the country's budget deficit by cutting public works projects and forcing consumers to contribute an additional 2.5 trillion yen ($20.55 billion) to cover the costs of their employment and social welfare benefits in the fiscal year that will begin April 1, 2003.
Mr. Koizumi surprised investors and analysts on Monday by giving his economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, control of financial regulation as well. The move raised expectations that the government will force the banks to speed up their write-offs of trillions of yen in nonperforming loans. But doing so is bound to lead to more economic pain in the short term, as nonpaying debtor companies are foreclosed and shut down and jobs are lost, analysts said.
Still, the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, said he was not currently considering any extra stimulus spending, even though the economy "remains in a severe state." Instead, his ministry is preparing a series of tax cuts, which will probably be paired with similar-size tax increases to be phased in over the next few years.
The battle between fiscal hawks like Mr. Shiokawa and ruling-party politicians who want more spending will intensify in the coming months, economists predict. So far, Mr. Koizumi has successfully fended off calls for supplementary spending packages, but if the economy slips back into recession -- the second of his 18-month administration -- he may find he has little alternative.
"Exports are no longer accelerating, and financial conditions are tightening," said Tomoko Fujii, an economist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. "Without a policy surprise, we're headed for another slump."

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Slowed in September 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: NEW YORK, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Manufacturing shrank in September for the first time in eight months and construction spending dropped in August, according to two reports released today, suggesting that the recovery is running out of steam. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of business activity declined to 49.5 in September, from 50.5 in August. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 51. An index above 50 signifies growth in manufacturing, while a figure below that shows contraction. The index has not been below 50 since January. 
 "Stagnant and sluggish are apt descriptions for manufacturing at this time," said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the monthly survey for the institute, based in Tempe, Ariz. 
The disappointing data came after reports a day earlier that showed consumer spending, the primary driver of economic growth, had slowed in August. 
Economists had attributed the relative strength in manufacturing in the first half of the year to a surge in inventory replenishment by stores that had allowed shelves to go bare during the recession. Low interest rates also encouraged consumer spending on cars and homes. 
Economists worry, however, that Americans may begin cutting back because of the weak stock market, concerns about job security and the prospect of a war with Iraq. 
In the second report, the Commerce Department reported today that construction spending fell 0.4 percent in August. The downturn was attributed to a reluctance by businesses to spend on new factories and other buildings. The decline came after a 0.1 percent decrease in July.
Economists said the commercial construction continued to be the source of weakness, reflecting reluctance by businesses to make big commitments. 
Another possible factor for sagging commercial construction, analysts said, is the difficulty that some companies have been having in obtaining terrorism insurance since last year's attacks.
Spending on all construction projects fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $829.8 billion in August, representing a 0.4 percent decline from the previous month.
For all commercial projects by private builders, spending declined to a rate of $159.2 billion in August, a 2 percent decrease from July.
On the residential side, spending on housing projects dipped 0.2 percent in August to a rate of $407.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Tone It Down a Notch 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It's hard to believe that just a year ago, in the wake of 9/11, the French newspaper Le Monde carried the headline "We are all Americans now." What a difference a year makes. Today, I figured, that headline would probably read: "We are all anti-Americans now." So I called Alain Frachon, the senior editor of Le Monde, and asked him how his paper was viewing America today. I was close. He said: "The same columnist who wrote that piece a year ago on 9/11 wrote another one this year on the first anniversary. This year, though, his headline was: 'We are all still Americans -- but not every day now.' " 
 What happened? Where did all that empathy go? Obviously, much of that initial burst of pro-Americanism was the world's gut reaction to the horror of 9/11, and when America soon started exercising its power to retaliate some of it was naturally going to dissipate. At the same time, because America today is so much more powerful, economically and militarily, than anyone else, it is always going to engender a certain amount of envy and animosity. 
 But while some will always dislike us for who we are, many now oppose us for what we do or say. And to the extent that we can neutralize some of that before we take on Iraq, we would be doing ourselves a world of good. What to do?
President Bush had the right impulse on this issue during the campaign, when he said America needed to be "humble -- proud and confident of our values, but humble." Unfortunately, his team has lost some of that humility. I loved Don Rumsfeld's briefings during the Afghan war. They were no-nonsense tough, with a dose of American nationalism that resonated with me. But lately I feel, coming from the Pentagon, a certain degree of imperial contempt for the rest of the world, especially the Arab-Muslim world. It's not healthy. I applaud Mr. Rumsfeld's slamming of Yasir Arafat, but when he refers to the "so-called occupied territories" he tells the entire Muslim world that America is utterly indifferent to Israeli settlements and how they have contributed to the current impasse. 
I have long felt that 9/11 was perpetrated and applauded by people who feel envy toward America, or humiliated by its success and their failure at modernity. That doesn't mean we should coddle them. It means we should criticize them -- loudly -- and the regimes that produce them. But there are two kinds of critics in life: those who criticize you because they want you to fail and those who criticize you because they want you to succeed. And people can smell the difference a mile away. If you convey to people that you really want them to succeed, they will take any criticism you dish out. If you convey that you really hold them in contempt, you can tell them that the sun is shining and they won't listen to you.
There is too much criticism-with-contempt oozing from the Pentagon, which, unfortunately, has become the voice of America lately. It feels as if we don't have a rounded foreign policy anymore -- only a defense policy. I would like to hear more of Secretary of State Colin Powell's voice -- a voice that says America is not just about disarming rogues, although we will if we have to, but also about inviting others into our future. And it is too bad that Mr. Bush's instinctive humility has given way lately to Texas cowboy lingo when talking about Iraq. I'm sure it helps whip up crowds at Republican fund-raisers, but, as Mr. Frachon put it, "it doesn't cross the ocean well."
Beyond tone, there is also substance. We will never be taken seriously by the world if we go on telling others that they are either with us or against us in the war on terrorism -- but that in the war for a greener planet, in the war against global warming, sorry, we're not with you, we're taking a powder, because we don't want to give up our energy gluttony. President Bush promised that he would offer a credible alternative to the Kyoto treaty. Where is it? 
The Bush team would also buy itself more support abroad if it made a more energetic effort to defuse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Bush has been great about telling the truth to Palestinians that they need a new leader, but he has been awful about telling the truth to Ariel Sharon that he needs to end settlements, and the whole world sees the hypocrisy.
Good will and popularity are underrated strategic assets. With a few small adjustments in tone or policy, we could buy so much more of both today. And if we launch a war to remake Iraq, we're going to want all the global good will we can get.

HEADLINE: Businesses Drawing Up Contingency Plans 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
As the shutdown of West Coast ports continued, retailers and manufacturers began to focus yesterday on contingency plans to let them ship goods in case the ports remained closed for more than a few days.
 Other retailers, who heard that more than 100 ships were forming lines at West Coast ports, grew increasingly frustrated as the threat of missing the holiday shopping season loomed large. 
 "Yesterday, I don't think anybody was panicking," said Julia Hughes, a vice president of the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, which represents companies like J. C. Penney and the Limited. "Today, there's a note of panic in people's voices, as they realized this could drag on and there wasn't an immediate resolution." 
Manufacturers and retailers who would usually find themselves now in the middle of the shipping period for Christmas inventory began preparing for a possible shutdown of West Coast ports earlier in the year. 
The companies said they increased orders from plants overseas and began stockpiling merchandise in case negotiations between the longshoremen's union and the Pacific Maritime Association were unsuccessful.
The contract expired in July. After failing to reach an agreement with the union, the management closed 29 Pacific ports on Sunday. 
Some manufacturers and retailers that handle nonperishable goods are prepared to weather a shutdown of three to four weeks. Others who have products on board ships are considering other ways of sending merchandise to the United States. 
Ports on the East Coast as well as in British Columbia, Mexico and the Panama Canal have been discussed as potential options if the West Coast ports remain closed. But there are problems with each of those.
"I've talked to all the steamship lines," Dena Sedlak, a manager at Panasonic Logistics, said. "The port to Mexico doesn't have the infrastructure to move our freight, and the ports in Vancouver will become congested very quickly. We're hoping for a settlement as quickly as possible."
The Panama Canal is generally thought to be too small to handle the oversized ships that would need to pass through to come to the East or Gulf Coasts. Air freight is widely considered as too expensive.
Because many retailers prepared for a shutdown, it is quite unlikely that shoppers will immediately see merchandise shortages on store shelves. But manufacturers and their workers will feel the results almost immediately, said Robin W. Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents major importers.
"Any manufacturer that relies on parts that come from Asia has, perhaps, a week or a two-week supply of those parts to keep assembly lines running," Ms. Lanier said. 
Experts say the automobile industry may be among the most vulnerable to a prolonged shutdown. Toyota and Honda said they now make the bulk of their cars, trucks and automobile parts in the United States and were not adversely affected, but smaller manufacturers are suffering greatly.
In Fremont, Calif., 5,000 workers at New United Motor Manufacturing, a joint venture of General Motors and Toyota, may have to stop assembly lines as early as tonight, the company said. Although it had stockpiled parts, they have not been replenished since Saturday, a spokesman, Michael J. Damer, said. 
"We produce 360,000 vehicles per year," Mr. Damer said. "The transmissions come from Japan. The engines come from Japan. You can't build cars without engines or transmissions." 
If the stoppage does not end by Thursday, Mr. Damer said, employees at the company would most likely be diverted to training programs or given the option of taking vacation or time off without pay.
Companies that import and export perishable goods also expressed alarm yesterday. Chiquita Brands International is working to devise a plan to move its bananas to supermarket shelves. Chiquita has 18,000 boxes of bananas in a refrigerated dockside warehouse at Long Beach, Calif., and an additional 180,000 boxes aboard a ship scheduled to pull into Long Beach on Sunday evening.
"We're hopeful that we'll find a way to get our product out of the port and to our customers as quickly as possible," a spokesman, Michael Mitchell, said. "We wrote a letter to the P.M.A. to ask for labor under a provision in the contract for perishable goods. At this point, I haven't heard anything back on that."

HEADLINE: Immigrant Families Are Courted To Revive Canada's Hinterland 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: STEINBACH, Manitoba 

 BODY:
Lidia Tschritter comes to the door barefoot to meet her nine children as they return home from school. Her hair is tied in a kerchief and she wears a homemade flower-print dress that reaches her ankles just as she did in her native Mennonite village in Kazakhstan.
 The front yard of her six-bedroom house has a trampoline for the children next to a sumptuous fruit and vegetable garden. Her husband, David, a carpenter who makes patio doors in a local window factory, will be home any minute to care for the family's barn full of animals. 
 "Canada is wonderful!" exclaimed Mrs. Tschritter, 39, in her archaic German dialect. "We can buy everything we need, worship as we wish, and it's nice and peaceful." This is the snapshot the Canadian government hopes to duplicate thousands of times over as it embarks on a new immigration policy designed to attract young, preferably large foreign families to rural Canada. The goal is to send one million immigrants into the hinterlands over the next decade by matching workers with remote businesses and farms that are starved for skilled labor, and to spread Canada's multiethnic rainbow across the country's vast prairies, tundras and forests. 
Officials hope to remold an immigration policy that has turned Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal into three of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world to distribute the labor riches of places like China, India and Ethiopia more equally.
With Canada's population of 30 million aging and its birthrate plummeting -- Canadian women currently have 1.49 children on average -- the government says that it, like some European countries, must rely on increasing immigration to ward off a population decline. But with the populations of Newfoundland falling by 7 percent between the 1996 and 2001 censuses, Yukon by 6.8 percent, Northwest Territories by 5.8 percent, New Brunswick by 1.2 percent and Saskatchewan by 1.1 percent, populations in some rural areas are already in calamitous decline.
"We need to create more magnets for immigration everywhere," said the minister for citizenship and immigration, Denis Codere, in an interview. "It's a matter of population growth, labor supply, quality of life, the very future of our country."
Not only is the centuries-old dream of populating Canada's vastness at stake. The solvency of national health care, and educational and housing programs that are financed by provincial tax bases, which are shrinking, may also hang in the balance. Enormous stretches in the prairies are suffering a slow death from cuts in farm subsidies, shrinking agricultural profit margins and drought. The decline of the farm economy has throttled businesses and propelled young people to take their skills and ambitions to large cities or to the United States.
Along the frigid Atlantic coast, a depletion of fish stocks has converted entire fishing communities into ghost towns.
Looking to immigration to meet its needs is not new for Canada. Few industrialized countries have so consistently used immigration as a tool for nation building. Canada populated its vast west in the 19th century by handing out land to European immigrants, much as its southern neighbor did. Today Canada's per capita immigration rate is twice that of the United States, and about 17 percent of the population is foreign born.
Canadian authorities, noting negative demographic trends 25 years ago, opened Canada's doors to people from the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. But the new arrivals cluster in a few cities -- 53 percent of the 250,000 who arrive every year settle in Toronto,15 percent in Vancouver and 13 percent in Montreal.
Now, though, the earnings for new immigrants are declining in saturated labor markets, strains have been put on services and urban neighborhoods and schools are growing increasingly segregated. The imbalance also threatens to produce a balkanized Canada, with three metropolitan areas becoming increasingly distinct from the rest of the country.
"We just don't know how a Toronto of the future, which is 60 percent nonwhite with 110 different ethnic groups and languages, is going to relate to the rest of Canada," said Larry S. Bourne, a geography professor at the University of Toronto.
Manitoba played a leading role in changing immigration policy when it developed a successful program four years ago to attract several thousand skilled immigrants, using advertising and contacts with community leaders. It used communities already there to attract German-speaking Mennonites, Argentine Jews, Filipinos and Bosnians.
"For rural areas if we're not in the process of growing, we're in the process of dying," said the Manitoba premier, Gary A. Doer, in an interview. "So what we need is a targeted immigration policy."
Eight other provinces and territories have begun similar efforts to find skilled workers. Federal authorities then fast-track the provincial nominees through health and security checks.
New Brunswick, for instance, is looking for affluent students from China and Hong Kong, who local officials hope will coalesce into their own community and perhaps attract their families. Saskatchewan is looking to Korea and Ukraine to bring experienced farmhands to its hog barns. Mr. Codere has embraced the efforts and will unveil a new federal policy in mid-October that would grant thousands of immigrants three- to five-year work permits under the proviso that they live in rural communities.
If they comply, they will be automatically granted permanent resident status, with the right to apply for citizenship after another three years. By then, officials hope they will have planted roots in the small towns and will stay.
Mr. Codere will also propose ways to quicken retraining and licensing for foreign engineers, teachers and medical professionals seeking work in rural communities.
Skeptics say immigrants will continue to gravitate to cities and some question the constitutionality of limiting people's freedom to move around. Furthermore, they say, not every province is able to build on ethnic populations already present the way Manitoba can.
But at Loewen Windows here in Steinbach, founded a century ago by the son of Russian Mennonites, the owners turned to Mennonites as they sought 150 new workers. Originally from Germany, the Mennonites have a 200-year history in Russia and Kazakhstan. Stalin resettled thousands of ethnic Germans from the Volga region to Kazakhstan after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and later they were encouraged to stay there for the same reason that Canada is seeking them as settlers today.
The newcomers here speak German, and little English, but communication is aided by the fact that many of their supervisors, older Mennonites, speak at least some German, learned from their grandparents.
The housing boom in the United States had propelled the company's sales, and Loewen needed more skilled workers. "I could have put a plant in Georgia, Mexico, Malaysia or China," said Charles Loewen, the chief executive officer, "but we prefer to grow here and immigration helped us hugely."
In nearby Winnipeg, the 15,000-member Jewish population has helped attract Jews from economically depressed Argentina by sending delegations, helping with job interviews and English lessons and making sure prospective immigrants have a Friday night Sabbath dinner during exploratory visits.
The 35 Argentine families who have arrived over the last year have given the Jewish community here renewed confidence it can survive, and hundreds more have expressed interest in coming.
Martin Wayngenten, 30, an accountant, remembered when his rabbi in the city of Parana took him aside and asked him to consider moving to Winnipeg. The rabbi suggested that he and his wife Agustina, 29, a biomedical engineer, would be welcomed with open arms.
"We took out a map and looked up Winnipeg," Agustina Wayngenten recalled. Her husband chimed in, "When you don't have a job, you don't worry about the weather."
They have found jobs, are saving for a house and are expecting their first baby. "I am going to speak to my child in Spanish," Agustina said, smiling, "but he'll be a Canadian."

HEADLINE: Health Insurance for Freelancers; 
A New Group Focuses on an Overlooked Group of Workers

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Finding a silver lining in the events of Sept. 11, 2001, isn't easy, and capitalizing on it is even harder. 
 "I almost don't like to talk about it," said Sara Horowitz, whose nonprofit insurance organization, Working Today, may have hit pay dirt as a result of the attack. "It's, well, sort of unseemly." 
 Working Today provides portable, affordable health insurance for freelance workers in New York. The concept would seem to be an easy sell, given the swelling ranks of part-time, contract and temporary workers across the country. 
But the organization has struggled since its inception to find financing to stay afloat long enough to stand on its own two feet. "It has been a lot harder than I thought it would be," Ms. Horowitz said.
Then, the September 11 Fund, the second-largest pool of philanthropic money raised to help victims of the disaster (after the Red Cross), faced a vexing problem that only Working Today could solve: how to provide a year's worth of health insurance to 15,000 people who are linked only by the effects of the attack.
Suddenly, Working Today looks poised to be a model for delivering health insurance and other benefits in a new way, one better suited to today's mobile, more fluid work force, which is exactly what Ms. Horowitz, winner of a MacArthur "genius" award in 1999, had hoped when she cooked it up. 
"It's sort of sadly ironic that it took something like Sept. 11 to get this concept noticed," said Mara Manus, a former program officer at the Ford Foundation who granted Working Today a $1 million working-capital loan to start it. "She's on to something, she really is."
Health insurance is provided to groups largely by employers and, to a lesser extent, governments and unions. Employees working for the same company are one kind of group. Veterans are another. Poor people are another.
The fund wanted to insure as many as 15,000 people working below Canal Street and in parts of Chinatown north of it who lost jobs or suffered a significant reduction in income as a result of the attacks. They work for an array of employers or none at all. They are rich and poor. They are healthy and sick. They are United States citizens, permanent residents and illegal aliens.
Victims of the trade center attack are in the same boat as part-time and freelance workers: the health insurance system simply is not set up to deal with them.
Ms. Horowitz, whose grandfather was the president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and whose father represented labor unions, saw the trends when she was working as a lawyer for the health care union 1199/S.E.I.U., and immediately understood the implications.
"Look, we didn't set ourselves up and create this organization because we knew this would happen," she said. "We were seeing large national trends that showed a growing number of people working independently, not connected to any one long-term employer, and thus unable to get affordable health insurance. It's not like we were brilliant visionaries."
The number of workers who are free agents of one type or another now make up almost a third of the work force, or 41.8 million people, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Between one-quarter and one-third of them probably do not get insurance from their employers, according to health insurance experts.
But Ms. Horowitz found that the concept of providing health insurance to a group representing a segment of the work force, rather than a group linked by an employer or income, was too radical for many foundations and other organizations.
"Why is there no competition?" Ms. Horowitz asked. "Because there's no funding in it." 
She recalled a meeting in spring 2001 with a foundation that is one of the largest health care underwriters in the country.
"It lasted 10 minutes," she said. "Usually, these presentations turn into discussions, but they had absolutely no interest. I got on the train afterward and was just numb. I couldn't believe that they couldn't see my point."
Ms. Manus, who backed Working Today when she was at Ford, said foundations that back health care focus almost single-mindedly on overhauling existing systems rather than exploring new ones. "In the work force development field, there's a burgeoning awareness that the structure of work is changing," she said. "So funding is going to come from the people paying attention to those changes, not from the health field, which may not even be aware of this issue."
James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, which is the only traditional health care financier among Working Today's backers, said skepticism of Ms. Horowitz's concept by traditional health care backers was understandable if unfortunate. "Public policy has been very skeptical about simply allowing groups to go out and form themselves out of thin air, and for good reason," he said. "To do so would provide an incentive for healthy people to group together and get a great insurance rate, making it almost impossible for less healthy people to get health insurance."
But in 2000, Ms. Horowitz convinced Neil D. Levin, then the state insurance commissioner, that the freelancers, contract workers and temporary employees working in Silicon Alley were a group no different from the employees of, say, Lehman Brothers or Pfizer.
Mr. Levin, who later headed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and who was killed in the attack on the World Trade Center, pushed his officials to be creative, and Working Today was classified as an association, a designation that enabled it to provide insurance.
Working Today is not an insurer. Rather, it forms a group and then buys insurance for it from HIP and other providers. On Sept. 4, 2001, Working Today opened for business; 24,000 people tapped into its Web site (www.workingtoday.org) in the first week. "Then no one signed up after Sept. 11," Ms. Horowitz recalled. "For the first three months, we thought, oh my God, maybe this won't work."
But in January, eligible uninsured workers started signing up, and now Working Today has almost 1,000 subscribers. They had to show proof that they earned $9,000 in a six-month period or that they were employed in technology jobs for at least 120 hours. Technology is defined as everything from software development to online journalism. The insurance costs an average of $255 a month, which is automatically deducted from their checking accounts.
"The monthly cost is very affordable," said Chris Lombardi, a writer with multiple sclerosis who pays $235 a month.
Before she signed up with Working Today in July, Ms. Lombardi and her partner had been getting by on her partner's Cobra, a federal program that lets workers get insurance at a reduced cost from their former employer for up to 18 months after they leave a job, which cost them $763 a month. She had looked into an insurance program through the National Writers Union, which would have cost about $600.
Ann Quinn, a marketing consultant, started her own business two years ago and began searching for insurance for her family when her Cobra began running out. "It was really expensive," she said.
She read about Working Today and then attended a seminar for free agents at which Ms. Horowitz spoke. "She was like an evangelist," Ms. Quinn said. For coverage for herself, her husband and her daughter, Ms. Quinn pays $740 a month, almost $300 less than she was paying through Cobra, and the insurance she has through Working Today includes preventive dental care.
"There are other options for free agents, but they're pricier and not as flexible," she said. 
Working Today will one day be about more than just health insurance, too, if Ms. Horowitz has her way. She intends the organization to evolve into a sort of human resources department for the nation's floating work force, offering a smorgasbord of benefits. Already, it offers life and disability insurance as well as free checking.
"Through a fluke, Sept. 11 exposed this huge national problem of how to provide health insurance to people who don't get benefits from an employer or the state," Ms. Horowitz said. "It's not like the problem didn't exist before Sept. 11, but it took that disaster to highlight this huge, other disaster we have."

HEADLINE: Japan and U.S.: Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With the American economy still sputtering and the Federal Reserve divided over whether to cut interest rates again, foreboding comparisons between the United States and Japan are gaining a renewed currency.
 Japan's stock market and real estate bubbles began losing air in 1990, almost exactly a decade before stocks in the United States peaked, and the country has still failed to recover fully. The Japanese market remains near an 18-year low, consumer prices are falling and the central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero, limiting its ability to lift the economy today. 
 Few policy makers or economists expect this country to fall into the same trap, largely because the American bubble never reached the size of Japan's and American financial and political systems appear more flexible. Still, numerous signs suggest that the United States could suffer a hangover that lingers for at least a few years. 
Although stocks rallied yesterday, the overall market is still likely to decline this year for the third consecutive year, its longest losing streak since 1939-41.
None of the American economy's three engines -- consumers, businesses or the government -- appear poised to propel the nation sharply ahead in the near future. After the economy grew at a moderate pace this summer, business spending on new factories and equipment has weakened again in recent weeks, and large retailers warned this week that their September sales were lower than expected. 
"It takes more than a bubble to become Japan," said Adam Posen, a former Fed staff member and a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
"But," he added, "there's no question that the props for keeping up growth are going away."
The Fed is clearly concerned that it is flirting with danger. The risk remains small that the economy will remain in the doldrums for years but the weak demand for new goods has caused prices nearly to stop growing and presented perhaps the single biggest economic threat: deflation.
If the American economy grows less than many forecasters expect, prices could begin falling and set off a dangerous chain of events similar to the one afflicting Japan. Consumers there have cut their spending, waiting for future bargains, and some are unable to pay off debts that are effectively growing more burdensome by the month.
Reflecting the seriousness of the debate here, two top Fed officials dissented last week from Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and voted to reduce interest rates again. Having cut rates 11 times last year to lower the cost of borrowing, the Fed has helped prop up the economy but has yet to end the downturn altogether.
"I don't know at what point welcome disinflation might morph into unwelcome deflation," Robert D. McTeer, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve and one of the two dissenters, said in a speech on Monday. "I don't think we're there yet."
"But that really doesn't much matter," Mr. McTeer added, "because I do believe faster real growth is essential." Promoting faster growth will also ward off deflation, he said.
In a study of the lessons to be learned from Japan's decade-long slump, Fed economists said this summer that governments should take extraordinary steps to support prices -- like deep rate cuts or new spending -- when falling prices become a serious risk. Deflation is often difficult to anticipate and far harder to end once it has started than to prevent in the first place, the study said.
Mr. Greenspan and most economists say the economy is growing quickly enough to avoid deflation. "Despite the draining impact of a loss of $8 trillion of stock market wealth, a sharp contraction in capital investment and, of course, the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, our economy held firm," Mr. Greenspan said last week in a speech in London.
Although both countries have huge capitalist economies, Japan and the United States also differ in important ways. 
Equity markets, which tend to pull their money quickly from failing companies, dominate corporate finance in this country, while banks, which often must make concessions to avoid foreclosures, dominate in Japan. The United States also has a two-party political system that by design or happenstance has injected much more money into the economy recently than Japan's ruling party did at the start of its slump. 
Meanwhile, the Fed has cut interest rates more quickly than Japan's central bank did. Unlike the Bank of Japan, the Fed can still significantly cut its benchmark interest rate, now at 1.75 percent.
The biggest similarity may be that many people in both countries came to see their own economy as recession-proof at the height of the respective booms and sent stocks to unsustainable prices as a result.
"In both cases, people had decided that the structure of the economy had changed fundamentally," said Jeffrey A. Frankel, an economist at Harvard and a former adviser to President Bill Clinton. "People thought they found the secret to eternal youth."
The troublesome signs of the last few weeks have increased worries that the American economy could follow a path similar to, if perhaps not as rugged, as the Japan took on the downside of the boom.
Investors have sent the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes to about 3.7 percent, near a 40-year low. The level suggests that the economy will either dip into a new recession soon or grow only mildly for the next few years.
"The U.S. economy has become the big growth engine that won't," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Consumers have continued to increase spending throughout the downturn, however, and Americans' optimism and willingness to take on debt make them unlikely to curtail shopping to the degree that the Japanese have, economists say. But with stocks and incomes both down, consumers here have begun to hold onto more of their money, increasing their savings rate to 4 percent in recent months, up from less than 3 percent at the end of the boom, according to the Commerce Department.
Given that the savings rate usually hovered between 8 and 10 percent in the 1970's and 80's, it could rise further.
"There is a slow change taking place in consumers," said David A. Levy, a longtime bear and the chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. "Consumers are going to lose the idea that they can count on their stock market portfolios to save for them."
The government has also helped growth over the last year, with federal agencies creating new security programs and states continuing projects begun during the boom years. Now, however, many states face budget deficits and are required by their constitutions to close them through spending cuts or tax increases.
Businesses have been cutting their spending and payrolls for almost two years and yet remain saddled with too much capacity.
With a glut of goods in many industries, inflation has now fallen low enough that an unexpected economic shock could cause a broad range of companies to cut prices to sell their goods, economists say. In the last year, consumer prices have increased about 1 percent, one of the smallest annual growth rates since the early 1960's, according to the Commerce Department.
One possible shock would be a new wave of corporate scandals that further unnerved investors and froze both business and consumer spending. "The most worrisome parallel" between Japan and the United States, Mr. Posen said, "is the lack of control that boards and outside investors had over companies."
In Japan, many individual investors have simply given up on stocks. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed yesterday at less than 25 percent of its peak, which came on Dec. 29, 1989. Here, many investors have grown nervous and taken some of their money out of stocks, but remain confident enough that stocks are still more expensive than they were for much of this century, based on the ratio of their values to corporate earnings.
Another shock would be a sharp rise in mortgage defaults -- caused by a spike in oil prices, for example, or another hit to consumers' budgets -- that could lead banks to cut back on lending and lead home prices to fall. Since 2000, the rise in real estate values, while still mild compared with the sharp increases during the 1980's in Japan, has allowed many households to take out larger mortgages and then spend the cash.
The most likely outcome, however, is an economy that grows more quickly than Japan's but more slowly than the American economy of the mid- to late 90's, many forecasters say.
"In Japan, the entirety of balance sheets collapsed," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, a technology and investment company. "From stocks to land to golf club memberships, everything fell 70 to 90 percent." 
"We have a very defensible system, but we got too giddy, and we had a bubble," he added. "The immediate future is pretty pedestrian."

HEADLINE: Study Gives States Low Marks In Making College Affordable 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Most states are doing better at preparing students for higher education but are making little progress in helping young people to enroll in, afford or complete college, according to a new study by the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. 
 The study, which graded each state in five categories, gave the nation's colleges a D in affordability, down from a C-minus when the center issued its first state-by-state report card two years ago. 
 The report found that many states had improved slightly on such measures as the percentage of family income needed to pay tuition or the average undergraduate's yearly loan. But California, with its network of low-tuition community colleges, was the only state to get an A on affordability. Because the other states have lagged farther behind California since the last report, New York and 11 other states received failing grades on affordability. 
What makes the situation particularly dire, education experts said, is that the data on which the grades were based were collected in 2000, before the economy took the downward turn that has forced drastic cuts in state aid for higher education, and, at some state colleges, tuition increases of 20 percent or more. 
"We've had a fair bit of damage to access and affordability, and it's going to get worse," said Robert Atwell, president emeritus of the American Council on Education. "What we are seeing, and will see more of, is a situation in which the states have to put so much money into mandatory things like prisons, Medicare and K-12 schools, that there's less left for higher education. Institutions are having to jack up their tuition fees to make up for that. If the federal government and the states don't expand need-based aid, we're going to have lots of people turned away." 
At a time when many cities and states have for several years been working on broad school reform efforts, the most positive findings in the report concerned the academic preparation young people get in middle and high school. 
The report found that 30 states are providing better academic preparation than they did two years ago. In some areas, the improvements have been dramatic. In Arkansas, for example, 23 percent of eighth graders take algebra, the prerequisite for higher-level math, compared with only 8 percent in the 2000 report. 
The report found that where students live still plays a large part in determining the likelihood that their school work will be challenging enough to prepare them for college. In North Carolina, for example, about 61 percent of high school students take at least one upper-level math course, compared with only 31 percent in New Mexico. 
Massachusetts ranked highest of the states in academic preparation. But New York, Maine, Tennessee and Virginia all showed improvement on each measure of college preparation, from the number of high school students taking upper-level science courses to the proportion achieving good scores on Advanced Placement exams. Details of the report are available on the Web at www.highereducation.org. 
The report found few gains in either the proportion of students who enroll in higher education, or those who complete it. In 10 states, fewer than three in 10 young adults ages 18 to 24 are enrolled in college. Here, too, geography matters: in Massachusetts, 54 percent of high school students finish high school and go on to college, compared with only 28 percent in Arizona. 
Even if they get to college, many students do not stay long enough to complete a certificate program or degree. In most states, only a minority of full-time college students complete bachelor's degrees within five years of graduating from high school. And in most states, only about half the first-year students at community colleges return for their second year. In 24 states, the report found, there has been either no progress, or slippage, in the last two years on the proportion of students sticking with their studies. 
"Completion is the Achilles' heel of higher education,' said Patrick M. Callan, the president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, which is a nonprofit group based in San Jose, Calif. "It's an area where we're just staying flat." 
By producing a report card that grades higher education by state, rather than by institution, the center is trying to shift the nation's attention to the community colleges and local public colleges that provide the bulk of the higher education Americans receive. 
"This country is so mesmerized by our huge research universities, which represent 3 or 4 percent of our enrollment, that we lose track of the higher education most people experience," Mr. Callan said. "With all the talk about No Child Left Behind, we've finally gotten to the point where we understand that a school district doesn't succeed unless all its students succeed. Now we need to get to the point where we think about how well higher education serves the vast majority of Americans, which means thinking about community colleges."

HEADLINE: Westchester Budget Gap Fuels A Feud Over Who Is to Blame 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Passing a county budget in Westchester is never a peaceful process, but a looming shortfall has gotten the bickering off to an early start.
 Republican county legislators had harsh words today for County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, saying he has created a budget mess with his chronic overspending and then tried to blame increases in Medicaid and state-mandated programs for the problem. 
 The legislators, led by George Oros, the Republican minority leader, took the unusual step of calling a news conference about the county budget without seeing Mr. Spano's proposal, which is normally released around Nov. 15. In the past, legislators have usually waited for Mr. Spano to start the budget process. 
"The county executive has put out a lot of misinformation and unfairly put the fiscal woes of the county on Albany," Mr. Oros said.
Mr. Spano, in turn, accused the legislators of turning the county's budget woes into a partisan political issue, and of trying to deflect blame from Republican political candidates, including Gov. George E. Pataki, who is running for re-election.
"Their response has a lot to do with covering for the governor," Mr. Spano said. "I'm not singling out the governor at all. The governor, the Senate, the Assembly -- they're all responsible."
Mr. Spano and other county officials across the state have warned for months now that sharply rising costs in state-mandated health and service programs were derailing their budgets. Westchester officials have projected a budget gap of more than $100 million in the coming year, saying they may have to raise the county property tax levy by 29 percent or higher, or cut county programs and services drastically.
On Wednesday, Mr. Spano is releasing part of his budget proposal a month early: the state-mandated programs and services that the county largely has no control over. He plans to announce the rest of his budget in November.
As part of his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Spano will propose an increase in the property tax levy. "We wanted to make the point that it's the state that's raising your property taxes," said Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to Mr. Spano.
Mr. Spano also sent out nearly 100 letters today to state and local candidates in Westchester, calling on them to oppose increases in the counties' share of state-mandated programs, to vote to reduce the counties' share of Medicaid costs, and to support an amendment to the State Constitution banning unfinanced state-mandated programs.
Several candidates and their aides declined to comment on Mr. Spano's proposal until they had read it.
Mr. Oros criticized Mr. Spano's two-part budget as a "smoke and mirrors" maneuver to hide "five years of bad fiscal policy made right here in White Plains."
"Yeah, we have to deliver services, but we don't have to use a stretch limo," Mr. Oros said. "We can use a pickup truck, a used pickup truck."
Ms. Tolchin responded, "He'll get the budget tomorrow. He can try to find the stretch limo then."

HEADLINE: Rivals Once So Similar Now Vie in a House Race 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Oct. 1 

 BODY:
In their six shared years in the House of Representatives, Nancy L. Johnson and James H. Maloney have never been all that far apart on the issues. 
 As different as each looks and sounds from the other -- Mr. Maloney, 54, is a tough-talking brick wall of a man, and Mrs. Johnson, 67, is a congenial political matriarch with two decades of House experience -- their statements and votes on health care, defense and the environment, and even the prospect of a new war with Saddam Hussein, show them to be more alike than not. 
 But with the national spotlight on Connecticut's recently redrawn Fifth Congressional District, Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Maloney are battling not only for personal victory but also for their party's ability to control the House of Representatives next year. So now the two are engaged in a difficult battle to show voters their differences. 
In a state where politics tends more toward patty-cake than pugilism, those stakes have made the race seem like an all-out brawl.
In their first debate on Monday, in Waterbury, for instance, Mr. Maloney, seeking his fourth term, pilloried Mrs. Johnson, now in her 10th term, as more interested in protecting health insurance companies than their patients, calling her plans to privatize a segment of Social Security income "fiscal madness."
She, in turn, called him an anonymous backbench Democrat who cast "reckless" votes whose impact he did not really understand.
"I am more senior, I am more experienced, I am more knowledgeable about the issues and more respected by my colleagues," Mrs. Johnson, in raised tones, told about 200 members of the American Association of Retired Persons.
The two were forced into a race against each other after state legislators consolidated Connecticut's six Congressional Districts into five last year, combining most of her old Sixth District with part of his Fifth. 
Because it will not only decide which party wins the new district but also knock out an incumbent from the losing party, the race is considered a must-win by both parties' national organizations vying for the control of the House, where Republicans hold a six-vote majority.
Mrs. Johnson, well financed and better known in the new district, appears to hold the thinnest of leads, if two-week-old poll results, the most recent independent survey available, are to be trusted. That poll, released on Sept. 13 by the Center for Survey Research and Analysis of the University of Connecticut, found that likely voters preferred Mrs. Johnson over Mr. Maloney by a five-point margin, 44 percent to 39 percent. Sixteen percent of voters were still undecided, though, and with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points, the survey showed that the race was "anyone's to win," said Ken Dautrich, the poll's director.
In a race in which it is far easier to differentiate the candidates' personalities than their views -- Mr. Maloney and Mrs. Johnson are both moderates known to break their own party ranks on big issues -- voters may ultimately base their decisions on intangibles, Professor Dautrich said.
Unlike most House Democrats, Mr. Maloney, a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee, supported repeal of the estate tax and the "marriage penalty" tax. He was also one of 25 Democrats to support a constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds vote to raise federal taxes. 
Ms. Johnson, the fourth most senior Republican on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and chairwoman of a subcommittee on health care, has often broken from the Republican majority. She supports, for instance, abortion rights (Planned Parenthood has given her a 100 percent score on her voting record), and the League of Conservation Voters gave her a 79 percent rating in 2001. 
Both candidates, focusing on older voters, have presented themselves as protectors of Social Security and fighters for cheaper prescription drug plans.
But, Professor Dautrich said, "Personality-wise, they are poles apart. You've got this big guy who tends to be outspoken, hard to get along with, and you've got this woman who is statesmanlike, courtly." 
Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Maloney have had each other in their cross hairs since last year, when Connecticut lost a seat in Congress because of a decline in population. The new Fifth District, with about 386,000 registered voters, includes about 13,000 more Democrats than Republicans. But 42 percent of the voters, or about 161,000 people, are unaffiliated with either party, according to Chris Barnes, a University of Connecticut political science professor.
Although Mr. Maloney, of Danbury, has a 2 percent advantage in voter registration, he lacks Mrs. Johnson's popularity and money. As of June, she had raised $2.38 million -- about $1 million more than Mr. Maloney -- and voters in her old district, the Sixth, are more loyal to her than are Mr. Maloney's constituents in the old Fifth District, Professor Dautrich said, based on the recent poll.
In an interview Friday, Mrs. Johnson mocked Mr. Maloney's record since he took office in 1997. In that time, she said, 23 bills she has sponsored have become law, compared with one of his.
"As I get my record of accomplishment out to people, I gain strength," Mrs. Johnson said. With her party outnumbered in the district, she added, "I have the momentum in a situation where he should."
Mr. Maloney said Mrs. Johnson takes credit for Democrat-led legislation. He said he expected to pick up support in his opponent's old territory, which includes the rolling hills of Litchfield County and in Mrs. Johnson's hometown, New Britain, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 4 to 1. 
Mr. Maloney, who has pledged to make a fourth term his last, also said his opponent's 20-year stretch in the House has left her out of touch with constituents. 
"The Congress was not designed to be an institution for entrenched incumbents enjoying sinecures," he said. 
"She's more in touch with the H.M.O.'s and the Washington insiders," he added. 
Despite the tough talk, Mr. Maloney faces an uphill fight against a candidate with more money and a willingness to trade punches with him, said Amy Walter, an analyst for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan group in Washington.
Referring to television advertisements paid for by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that portrayed Mrs. Johnson as more sympathetic to corporate executives at Enron than to the shareholders they hurt, Ms. Walter said: "Anytime anyone goes on TV and says anything bad about her, she has the resources to go up and blunt that and still keep talking about herself. What Maloney needs is something to break his way in order to win this."
That could be a weakening economy, public dissatisfaction with the debate over Iraq or simply an Election Day swell of grass-roots support, Professor Dautrich said.
"Who decides to go out and vote that day is a huge question," he said. "Five points can easily be made up in one day."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about two incumbent members of Congress from Connecticut who are now running against each other misstated the demographic change that caused the state to lose a seat through reapportionment. It was a slowing of population growth relative to other states, not a decline in population.

HEADLINE: With Few Port Jobs at Issue, Economic Stakes Are Vast 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 1 

 BODY:
In the tense standoff that has shut 29 West Coast ports and threatens to undermine the nation's economy, employers and union officials agree that the heart of the dispute involves just a few hundred jobs.
 These are not the tough, blue-collar dock jobs depicted in the Marlon Brando film "On the Waterfront," but rather clerical jobs usually paying nearly $120,000 a year. They are held by longshoremen who keep track of cargo movements. 
 The union's big fear is that when management introduces new technologies to speed cargo handling, these highly prized jobs will be contracted out to companies using nonunion labor. 
Many businesses find this confrontation especially maddening because the billions, even tens of billions of dollars, in damage that the port shutdown can do to the nation's economy is so much greater than the amount of money separating the two sides. By some estimates, it would cost the employers about $20 million a year if the few hundred disputed jobs ended up union rather than nonunion.
"It's pretty silly," said Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, a group that includes Wal-Mart, Target, Toyota, Panasonic and dozens of other businesses that rely on the ports. "If they're just disputing 200, 300 jobs, to shut the whole economy down over that sounds extreme."
On Sunday night, the Pacific Maritime Association, a group of terminal operators and shipping lines, announced that it was closing ports from San Diego to Seattle and locking out 10,500 longshoremen. The employers said they were acting defensively, in response to a job slowdown that was paralyzing the ports, but union officials said the longshoremen were merely working more cautiously than usual because of safety concerns resulting from the deaths of five longshoremen this year. 
Alarmed that the shutdown would hurt the nation's stores, the National Retail Federation asked President Bush to move to reopen the ports immediately. He is empowered to order an 80-day cooling-off period to reopen the ports, but such a Taft-Hartley injunction has not been invoked in a quarter-century. 
Ms. Lanier said her group might also ask the president to reopen the ports if there was no progress soon in contract talks.
No progress was made today in negotiations because union officials walked out of a meeting in Oakland with Peter Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, when they discovered that management negotiators had two armed guards with them at the talks. 
"This is an outrageous action," said James Spinosa, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. "This is total irresponsibility on their part. Thug tactics will not work with us."
But officials with the Pacific Maritime Association insisted at a news conference that they were not trying to intimidate the union leaders. "We had the security detail because obviously we thought it was necessary," said Tom Edwards, Northern California director of the maritime association. "It was a precautionary measure. That's all it was." 
As a result of the flare-up over the security guards, the two sides said talks scheduled for Wednesday might be canceled. The union said it would refuse to negotiate with management's designated negotiating committee, insisting instead that it would talk only with the maritime association's executive committee. The maritime association insisted that only its negotiating committee would take part in the talks.
With his administration monitoring the stalemate, Mr. Bush urged the two sides today to use a federal mediator to resolve their dispute. "It's a problem, something that we're just going to have to get these parties to work through and get back to work, open these ports up," Mr. Bush said. "It's important to our economy to do so."
Over the next few days, pressures on the president to order a cooling-off period will undoubtedly grow. But Mr. Bush could face a quandary because unions whose support he and Congressional Republicans have vigorously sought oppose ordering a cooling-off period. 
Several economic studies estimate that if the shutdown lasts five days, it will cost just under $5 billion, and if it lasts 10 days, the cost will soar to nearly $20 billion. 
The employers say the dispute is about the union's resistance to using new technologies. But the longshoremen insist they will accept new technologies but only if the remaining cargo-tracking jobs remain union.
Joseph Miniace, the maritime association president, said the union should not worry about jurisdiction because management had pledged that no workers would be laid off once new technologies were introduced. He estimated that new technologies would eliminate 400 of the current 1,600 marine clerks' positions, but he tried to reassure the union by pledging to find other jobs for those workers.
Mr. Edwards, the maritime association official, said, "We have guaranteed across the table in writing that we have guaranteed every longshoreman and every marine clerk a job, and there is no intent of cutting or laying people off."
Mr. Spinosa said the union's big fear was that many of the cargo-tracking jobs that result from the use of new technology would be contracted out to companies that use nonunion workers. The union worries that unless it fights over jurisdiction now, then a few decades from now most waterfront jobs will be nonunion, and his union will be a shadow of its muscular self. "We endorse technology, but what we don't endorse is to have our work go elsewhere," Mr. Spinosa said. "Lifetime jobs without a commitment to the future is not an area we want to find ourselves. We're looking for jobs that have longevity tied to them." 
David Olson, an expert on port operations at the University of Washington, said the feud over jurisdiction was not just about money. "To the longshoremen, jurisdictional issues are near sacred," he said. "These are things they have fought over since the 1930's, and the concept of a nonunion clerk violates principles on which the organization was built."
Management is hoping to introduce new technologies like optical scanners to speed the entry of trucks carrying cargo and global positioning satellites to follow the path of cargo. The employers say these new technologies are vital to lowering their costs and remaining competitive with ports elsewhere. 
Professor Olson said management feared that if all these new technology-related jobs were union, then unionized workers could repeatedly devise ways to slow the introduction of additional technologies. "This dispute is not just about money, it's also about control," he said.

HEADLINE: McCall Tries To Make Best Of Bad Week In Campaign 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall did not summon so much as a note of his customary preacherly inflection yesterday, and his jokes were halfhearted as he unveiled his state budget reform plan at a breakfast forum at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Manhattan.
 It was a sharp contrast to the cocksure jubilation that Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate for governor, displayed Thursday night in the same hotel, when he had a crowd of Democratic supporters, including Al Gore, chanting, "It's time for Carl McCall." 
 So maybe Mr. McCall is not a morning person. Or maybe it was that since that Thursday night, the McCall campaign has seemingly met with nothing but bad news. 
On Friday, The New York Post published the first of two 1997 letters that Mr. McCall wrote on official stationery, asking corporate executives to consider giving jobs to his daughter and a cousin. The letters have had Mr. McCall on the defensive for the past five days, with prominent Democrats like Senator Charles E. Schumer saying publicly that he was wrong to write them.
Another blow came on Monday night, when NY1 News reported that the endorsement of the United Federation of Teachers would go to Mr. McCall's Republican opponent, Gov. George E. Pataki, even though Mr. McCall had made education his top issue in the race.
And a new poll released yesterday, but taken before the McCall letters came to light, showed Mr. McCall trailing the governor by 16 points.
But as Mr. Pataki toured upstate, distributing millions of dollars in economic development and high technology money, Mr. McCall tried to stay on track, releasing a plan that he said would solve the state's annual late-budget trouble.
He said he would require a balanced budget, move the start of the fiscal year from April to July, require independent revenue forecasts and end "messages of necessity," sent by the governor so that the Legislature can vote on bills before they have been "aged" for three days. Lawmakers in Albany have complained that they have passed legislation without reading it. 
"I will not approve a plan that has not been subject to open discussion by the public and legislators," Mr. McCall promised. "I will not issue messages of necessity to eliminate the possibility of public disclosure and debate on important public issues."
But the poll, by the Marist College polling institute, underscored some of Mr. McCall's political weaknesses, which have forced him to tread carefully when answering questions about issues like taxes.
The poll of 813 registered voters showed that, among likely voters, Mr. Pataki had 48 percent of the vote, Mr. McCall 32 percent and Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, 9 percent, with just 9 percent of voters still undecided. For Mr. McCall and Mr. Pataki, the poll shows no change from three weeks ago and, statistically, is not a significant deviation from a Quinnipiac University poll released last week.
But consultants said the gap was not small enough to give Mr. McCall the lift he needs to help him raise campaign funds.
Among likely voters, the poll showed Governor Pataki leading by six percentage points in New York City, an area that strategists say should be Mr. McCall's base. And in the suburbs, the governor is leading 56 percent to 28 percent. The narrowest gap is upstate, where the governor leads 45 percent to 30 percent.
Yesterday, as Mr. McCall addressed a city audience, his efforts to appeal to suburban and upstate voters seemed to haunt him.
He has taken great pains to play down a statement, made last December and featured in a Pataki advertisement, that he favored reinstating the city's tax on commuters, which was abolished in 1999. Mr. McCall has said in recent months that he is opposed to any new taxes. 
Asked about the commuter tax yesterday, Mr. McCall first noted that he had opposed Governor Pataki's repeal of the tax. Then he explained that his wish to bring the tax back came out of concern for the city after 9/11. But after hearing more about the property tax burden on suburban residents, he said, he changed his mind. 
But if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were to push for the tax, Mr. McCall said, "Obviously when I become governor I'm going to have to listen to what the mayor is promoting."
The political contortions seemed at one point to overwhelm the candidate. Asked by Greg David, the editor of Crain's New York Business, on what basis he opposed all tax increases, Mr. McCall said, "On the basis that I'd like to get elected." He quickly added, over the laughter, that New Yorkers feel overtaxed.
Mr. McCall used the forum to challenge the governor again to a one-on-one debate. Mr. Pataki has said he will debate only if every candidate is included, including the Marijuana Reform Party candidate and Mr. Golisano.
Mr. McCall also accused Mr. Pataki of hypocrisy for defending the state against a lawsuit that seeks more money for city schools and of using state money to buy the endorsement of 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care workers' union. The governor designated proceeds from the planned privatization of a public health insurance company to bankroll a multibillion-dollar health care package with $1.8 billion for worker salaries and benefits.
Mr. McCall said he did not object to workers' benefits, but to the passage of the package "in the middle of the night" with no public comment. "It was an outrageous political deal where taxpayer money was used to buy an endorsement," he said.
A spokesman for the governor, Michael McKeon, defended the health care package. "It's astounding that Carl McCall opposes historic legislation that will help the hospital and nursing homes provide the best health care workers for the patients who need it," Mr. McKeon said.
Mr. McCall refused to confirm a report that Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, had told him at a meeting on Friday that she would endorse the governor, who provided $200 million for teacher raises this year.
"The fact is that the governor has been making deals with union leaders," Mr. McCall said, "and those leaders have had to -- had to -- endorse the governor as a result of that." He added that he did not think that the votes of union members would follow.
Both Mr. McCall and a spokesman for Ms. Weingarten confirmed that the two had met, but they would not say what was discussed.
A Democrat familiar with details of the meeting said that the teachers' union would endorse Mr. Pataki. Mr. McKeon, the governor's spokesman, said: "It's not done until it's done. There are meetings that still need to happen."
In the wide-ranging breakfast discussion, Mr. McCall was also asked again about the letters he had written on behalf of his daughter and cousin. Again, he said he had not done anything wrong. "There was no coercion in it," he said. "Politicians do this all the time."
The State Democratic Party chairman, Herman D. Farrell Jr., came to Mr. McCall's defense, saying that he himself received constant requests to forward resumes for constituents.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Steep Rise In Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 Layoffs increased more sharply in New York than in any other state in August, according to new data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The number of New Yorkers left jobless by layoffs of 50 or more workers rose by 5,035 compared with the same month last year. In all, 11,213 New Yorkers lost their jobs in August because of large layoffs. The state was the third-hardest-hit in total workers laid off, after California, with 34,590 workers laid off, and Texas, with 11,660. While most layoffs occurred in manufacturing, the bureau said, there were also big reductions at temporary-help agencies and in transportation. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BRITAIN; 
Blair, at Party Conference, Reaffirms Support for U.S.

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: BLACKPOOL, England, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair today confronted doubters in his Labor Party with his case for threatening to use force against Saddam Hussein and with his belief in steadfast alliance with America. 
 "Sometimes and, in particular, dealing with a dictator, the only chance of peace is a readiness for war," he told his party's annual conference in a combative response to the unease expressed by many delegates this week over his hard-line stance on Iraq. 
 "Let us lay down the ultimatum," he asserted in his keynote speech. "Let Saddam comply with the will of the U.N." 
The standing-room-only audience packed into the Winter Garden Center here applauded the line. But 40 percent of them had voted on Monday for a motion barring a British role in any military action, even one sanctioned by the United Nations.
"I know the worry over Iraq," he said, taking up the subject gingerly. He outlined the general consensus over the danger that Mr. Hussein poses and said he understood the anxiety over the possibility that Britain might join the United States in any armed move against Iraq. "So far most of you are with me," he said, to nervous laughter. 
"But here is the hard part. If he doesn't comply, then consider. If at this moment, having found the collective will to recognize the danger, we lose our collective will to deal with it, then we will destroy not the authority of America or Britain, but of the United Nations itself." 
Mr. Blair opened his talk with a quip aimed at critics who accuse him of being an unquestioning follower of President Bush. "How about the Ryder Cup?" he said, referring to last weekend's victory by European golfers over the American team. "See -- me and George Bush on different sides." 
Moments later he took up the matter directly, saying it was easy these days to be anti-American. 
"America stands strong and proud, but at times resented," he said. "For all the resentment of America, remember one thing. The basic values of America are our values too, British and European, and they are good values: democracy, freedom, justice." 
He declared, "My vision of Britain is not as the 51st state of anywhere, but I believe in this alliance, and I will fight long and hard to maintain it because alliance with America is in the interests of this country."
As for Britain's role in Europe, he said Britain should adopt the euro if a set of economic tests laid down by the British Treasury are met. "If the tests are passed," he said, "we go for it." 
Twelve European Union countries have been using the euro as currency since the beginning of this year, but Britain, along with Denmark and Sweden, chose not to be among the first wave of joiners. Today, Mr. Blair said, "the euro is not just about our economy, but our destiny." 
Mr. Blair is thought to be eager to hold the necessary referendum on using the euro next year, while the second most powerful man in the government, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, continues to be wary of the economic consequences if Britain moves too soon. 
Delegates have chastised Mr. Blair not just for his stand on Iraq but also for his government's approach to the principal domestic issue in Britain -- improving public services. 
Led by a young generation of militant trade union leaders who framed the issue as a class war, speakers attacked his determination to involve private contractors in building and delivering public services, charging that it amounted to "creeping privatization." A motion proposed by the unions to conduct a formal review of the program, known as the private finance initiative, gained the support of 67 percent of the delegates.
Mr. Blair was defiant today in saying he would press ahead with the policy, regardless of the vote on Monday. "Come on," he said, directing his remarks at the militants, "this isn't the betrayal of public services -- it's their renewal." 
He told the union leaders and their supporters that he would not agree to the proposed review because, he said, it would dry up private cash for public projects at the very moment that schools and hospitals were being built in record numbers.
Putting the argument in a larger context, he said that the cooperative relationship with business was part of the ongoing reform of the Labor Party that he began in the same hall with a speech in 1994 that led to rewriting the party constitution to rid it of socialist doctrine.
With a warning not to "fall for the far-left's eternal delusion," he told union leaders that in trying to dismantle this new arrangement, they were pursuing discredited old principles. 
"There's nothing wrong with the old principles, but if the old ways worked, they'd have worked by now," he said. "If you believe in social justice, in solidarity, in equality of opportunity and responsibility, then believe in the reforms to get us there."
He ended his speech by declaring that this "journey of modernization" had to be seen through. Delegates gave him a four-minute standing ovation.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: PETROLEUM; 
Stable World Oil Prices Are Likely to Become a War Casualty, Experts Say

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Amid all the unknowns about the American campaign against Saddam Hussein, the one certainty is its potential to shake up oil markets. 
 Already, oil prices have risen substantially over the last few weeks, because of traders' and consumers' concern that a war in the Persian Gulf could disrupt supplies and set off price spikes. Prices rose on similar fears before the Persian Gulf war a decade ago, but fell back once the first shots were fired, replacing uncertainty with action. 
 Longer term, the impact depends on the outcome of any military campaign, and the fallout. 
Some analysts warn that if Mr. Hussein were ousted, Iraq could dissolve into civil war. If so, its oil exports -- 1.1 million barrels a day under the United Nations' oil-for-food program -- could be drained from the world market. 
Bush administration strategists and Western oil companies have a rosier view. Iraq's reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia's, they note. Revived by the lifting of sanctions and a flow of foreign investment, Iraq's production could rival Saudi Arabia's in five to seven years.
"Oil will be the engine of Iraq's reconstruction," said Gregg Sullivan, a spokesman for the State Department, which has set up working groups to develop plans for a post-Hussein Iraq. "No one is talking about a Marshall Plan for Iraq because oil will take care of that."
A market awash in Iraqi oil would mean lower prices -- an economic boon to the United States, the world's top consumer of oil. It could also rattle the cohesion of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose control of oil prices the Bush administration seeks to loosen, those analysts say.
But success for the United States could roil the economies of oil-producing countries from Indonesia to Mexico to the Middle East. 
The deepest concerns are for Saudi Arabia, where some officials worry that an American-led attack on Iraq could touch off upheaval, given the powerful anti-American feelings there. A prolonged period of low oil prices would erode the kingdom's budget revenues, making it harder for Saudi Arabia to support the vast welfare state vital to its stability.
Over the past three months, the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf has spread anxiety through oil markets, lifting prices almost 18 percent, to above $30 a barrel. 
According to oil traders, those prices reflect worry that Baghdad would retaliate against American allies -- perhaps by bombing oil facilities in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. 
Saudi officials say that their facilities are well defended, and that even if an Iraqi attack succeeded, they could quickly repair the damage. Any price increases, in that case, would be short-lived. Industry experts point out that destroyed Kuwaiti fields were restored in about a year after the gulf war. The loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from world markets during the gulf war was offset by increased Saudi production. 
As before the gulf war, there is a sharp debate about the extent to which oil is driving Washington's policies toward Iraq. That would seem inevitable, given the potential of Iraqi oil fields. "It's not about oil, but becomes about oil," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a research group.
A decade of United Nations sanctions has weakened the Iraqi oil industry, whose production capacity is about three million barrels a day but which is producing about half that, analysts said. 
If a removal of Mr. Hussein led to foreign investment in Iraq, production could increase to seven million barrels a day within five years, according to Fadhil Chalabi, a former Iraqi under secretary of oil who is executive director of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. Saudi Arabia pumps about 7.7 million barrels a day and has a production capacity of 10 to 10.5 million barrels.
Other experts contend that Iraq, even at a higher capacity, would not displace Saudi Arabia in oil markets. 
"It's a truly ludicrous strategic error that continually crops up in discussions of oil -- that bilateral relations have anything to do with supplies," said Chas. W. Freeman Jr., the United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1989 to 1992. "If Saudi Arabia were not selling to the United States, we would still be indirectly dependent on Saudi Arabia, because of the major role it has in the international oil trade."
Indeed, Mr. Freeman and other experts doubt that a post-Hussein Iraq would fight OPEC quotas or leave the cartel, because the new regime would favor the higher oil prices that would bring it revenues to rebuild the country.
Still, a friendly regime in Baghdad could enhance American leverage over Saudi Arabia, according to a recent report by the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm. World demand for oil is expected to remain weak in the medium term, the report said, so if more oil were pumped into that market, prices -- and arguably Saudi power -- would decline.
"The 'new' Baghdad's willingness to cooperate with the United States with respect to military bases, expanded oil production and perhaps even peace with Israel would all work to diminish Saudi influence," the report said.
So far, Saudi officials claim that more Iraqi oil would not threaten their country's prosperity, because increased demand would help keep prices stable.
The Petroleum Finance report suggests that Saudi Arabia could wrest control of oil markets now by flooding them quickly with oil, touching off a collapse in prices and discouraging investment in new fields, like those in Iraq. The Saudis have the money to weather low prices for a time, the report contends.
But for that approach to work, the Saudis would have to win the agreement of their OPEC partners and the Saudi business community, industry analysts said. 
The effects of lower oil prices would be felt well beyond the Middle East. Countries friendly to the United States but dependent on oil revenues could suffer. The new oil production that the Bush administration has encouraged in Russia and West Africa could wither. Oil companies would be reeling. 
"What's actually going to happen here is bad for our business," said a senior Western oil company executive about the prospect of Mr. Hussein's ouster. "We're looking at short-term price spikes, possible supply disruptions and then, after the fact, the question, 'Was that all about oil?' "

PERSON: Walter H. Annenberg 

HEADLINE: Walter Annenberg, 94, Dies; Philanthropist and Publisher 

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
Walter H. Annenberg, the philanthropist, art collector and former ambassador to Britain who at one time presided over a vast communications empire that included TV Guide and The Philadelphia Inquirer, died yesterday in Wynnewood, Pa. He was 94 and had homes there and in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
 Over the years, Mr. Annenberg became one of the country's biggest philanthropists, giving away more than $2 billion in cash , according to Christopher Ogden, the author of "Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg" (Little, Brown, 1999), to say nothing of his art donations. The recipients ranged from the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J., the small prep school he attended, to the United Negro College Fund ($50 million) to organizations for the reform of public education ($500 million) and Israel, whose Emergency Fund received a contribution of $1 million from him after the June 1967 war. 
 In 1991 Mr. Annenberg pledged his renowned collection of blue-chip Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces, itself said to be worth more than $1 billion at the time, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which he was a trustee emeritus. The works are exhibited at the Met for six months every year. 
Raised as a rich man's son -- by the time of his birth his immigrant father, Moses, had already developed a profitable newspaper distribution business in Milwaukee -- Walter Annenberg multiplied his heritage many times over. "I started out with an awful lot handed to me," he once told an interviewer. As chief executive of Triangle Publications, which he inherited as a debt-ridden corporation at his father's death in 1942, he made it into one of the communication world's great powers, with newspapers, radio and television stations, national magazines and racing sheets.
In 1988 he sold the remaining portions of Triangle to Rupert Murdoch for $3.2 billion, saying that he planned to devote the rest of his life to education and philanthropy. (He had sold two Triangle newspapers, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News, to Knight Newspapers in 1969 for $55 million; the broadcast companies were sold in the early 70's for $87 million.)
An imposing figure with a courtly manner, a deep, resonant voice and the formal bearing of a royal chamberlain, Mr. Annenberg was a fervid patriot and Republican whose close friends included Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, to whom he gave considerable financial support. His friendship with Mr. Reagan went back to the 1930's, when Mr. Annenberg was a frequent visitor to Hollywood, and for years the Reagans had a tradition of celebrating New Year's holidays at Sunnylands, his palatial 240-acre compound in Rancho Mirage, Calif., near Palm Springs, where President Nixon was also a guest at various times. The Annenbergs divided their time between Sunnylands and Inwood, a baronial manor in Wynnewood, Pa., on Philadelphia's Main Line.
In 1969, Nixon named Mr. Annenberg ambassador to Britain, the most coveted American diplomatic post. The appointment was criticized on grounds that he had little experience in foreign affairs. And at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on his nomination, he faced questions about his father's sentencing in 1940 to a three-year prison term for income tax evasion, an event that had plagued the son for much of his adult life. He was praised, however, for telling the committee, "I have actually found that tragedy a great source of inspiration for constructive endeavor."
In a statement yesterday, President Bush called Mr. Annenberg "a shining example of generosity, patriotism and dedication to serving others" and praised his "commitment to education reform" and his support for scholarships.

The Legacy of His Father
It has often been said that Mr. Annenberg's assiduously cultivated image of respectability and his well-publicized philanthropic largesse stemmed in part from distress over his father's past. "If there is one single factor that has shaped Walter Annenberg's character and, indeed, given guiding direction to his life it is the legend and legacy of Moses Annenberg," wrote Gaeton Fonzi in "Annenberg: A Biography of Power" (Weybright & Talley, 1970). "No man so venerates the memory of his father. No man is so haunted by it."
But Mr. Annenberg preferred to ascribe his philanthropy in part to the elder Annenberg's concern for the downtrodden. Hard-nosed as he was in business, Moses Annenberg felt compassion for the poor, his son said, and while bestowing money on street people he would say, "There but for the grace of God go you and I."
The lavish way of life enjoyed by Mr. Annenberg and his wife, Leonore, was most visible at Sunnylands -- completed in 1966 at a cost of $5 million -- where the couple spent the winter months. An airy, Astrodome-size extravaganza of glass and Mexican lava stone, pink marble floors and clustered plantings, the 32,000-square-foot house -- surrounded by well-guarded fencing -- sits on acres of rolling terrain. A well-primped, mock-English country landscape in the desert, with trees, hills, ponds, waterfalls, it has a nine-hole golf course and even an artificial swamp for the birds that Mr. Annenberg liked to watch.
Sunnylands, named for a 5,000-acre fishing camp Moses Annenberg once owned in the Poconos, was also the setting for the bulk of the Annenberg art collection. Among its more than 50 pieces are works by van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, Degas, Boudin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Fantin-Latour, Vuillard, Gauguin, Corot, Manet, Morisot, Seurat, Braque, Bonnard, Picasso, Matisse, Rodin, Giacometti and Arp. 
Mr. Annenberg delighted in showing off his treasures, 15 of which were purchased en bloc from his sister Enid Haupt. Taking a visitor on a house tour when he was in his early 80's, he gestured toward a painting by Vuillard, noting that he had bought it because the seven women depicted in it reminded him of his seven sisters. Indicating a Cezanne still life, he pointed out that a fold in the napkin surrounding a dish of apples echoed the incline of Mont St.-Victoire, the artist's obsessive landscape motif, in another Cezanne that hung across the room. "I must have quality," he said. "An interest in art grows in you and it takes over. My wife and I set out to get things that we genuinely loved and respected and wanted to live with."
In 1993 Mr. Annenberg bought a sixth van Gogh, "Wheat Field With Cypresses," for $57 million from a Swiss collection, and gave it to the Metropolitan Museum. "I thought it was something the museum should have," he said at the time. 

Voted 'Best Businessman'
Walter Hubert Annenberg was born in Milwaukee on March 13, 1908, the sixth of nine children. A shy but personable youth, born with a malformed right ear and hampered by a stutter, he was doted on by his father as his sole male heir, according to "The Annenbergs" (Simon & Schuster, 1982) a biography by John Cooney.
In 1920 Moses Annenberg moved his family to New York, where he quickly established himself. To his own holdings in the newspaper distribution business, he added the New York-based Daily Racing Form, expanding it into seven papers across the country. In time he owned virtually every racing publication in the nation. 
At 15 Walter was sent to Peddie, which, unlike most prep schools in that era, did not discriminate against Jewish boys. There he played football, basketball and baseball and was on the track team. On the day of his graduation, he earned his first laurels as a philanthropist by donating $17,000 to the school for a running track. He was prophetically voted "best businessman" and "most likely to succeed" by his classmates.
After a desultory year at the Wharton school of business at the University of Pennsylvania, he dropped out in 1928 to pursue the stock market, where, through his own acumen, he had already established a portfolio worth $3 million, according to Mr. Ogden's book. But when the market crashed in 1929, he found himself $350,000 in debt from buying on margin. A disappointment to his father, who nevertheless paid his debts and continued to support him in lavish style, Walter had become a playboy who frequented cafe society in New York, gambled and was often seen in the company of Hollywood starlets. His father, bent on "making a man" of him, brought his 21-year-old heir into the company in 1929.
In 1936 Moses also bought The Philadelphia Inquirer, which had a national reputation as the bible of the Republican Party. He made himself a power in Pennsylvania Republican politics and contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the G.O.P.
But then the ax fell. On Aug. 11, 1939, Moses was indicted by a federal grand jury in Chicago for evading $3,258,809.97 in income taxes. Walter was also indicted along with two other business associates. But a guilty plea by Moses, whereby he agreed to pay $9.5 million in taxes, penalties and interest and serve three years in jail, saved his son. As part of the settlement, charges against Walter and other business associates were dropped. The son never forgot this sacrifice. On the wall behind his desk at The Inquirer hung a brass-and-mahogany plaque, which bore the legend -- taken from a prayer -- "Cause my works on earth to reflect honor on my father's memory."
Sentenced to three years, Moses was released in two, afflicted with a brain tumor that killed him a month later.
After his father's death in 1942, Walter took over as editor and publisher of The Inquirer. To the surprise of its staff, he turned out to be a shrewd, tough boss who knew what he wanted. Under his guidance, The Inquirer initiated a host of public-spirited campaigns aimed at everything from cleaning up the city's water supply to reforming Philadelphia's corrupt magistrate system to crusading against the use of fireworks. Its coverage of World War II was also widely admired.
One of the paper's most successful campaigns resulted in opening the art-rich but exclusive Barnes Foundation in nearby Merion, Pa., to the general public. In 1952 The Inquirer filed suit against the tax-exempt foundation to enable public access, and after many legal setbacks, the newspaper's prodding brought action from the state attorney general's office. In 1961 the Barnes Foundation was forced to broaden its admissions policy.

Furthering His Interests
More than occasionally, however, Mr. Annenberg used The Inquirer's columns to settle scores and snipe at enemies, killing articles about or banning mention of people who had offended him, particularly members of Philadelphia's social hierarchy by whom he felt snubbed.
And there were egregious examples of his use of the paper to further his own interests, economic or otherwise. One such case is cited by Mr. Fonzi in his 1970 book. It involved the unsuccessful campaign of Milton J. Shapp for governor of Pennsylvania on the Democratic ticket in 1966. One of Shapp's chief campaign issues was the proposed merger of the Pennsylvania and the New York Central Railroads, to which The Inquirer had given heavy editorial support.
Shapp characterized the merger as "a legalized multimillion-dollar swindle." The next day The Inquirer began a series of merciless attacks on the candidate, involving misleading headlines, distorted news stories and vitriolic editorial comment. The attacks were so vicious, according to Mr. Fonzi, that Shapp's opponent, Gov. Raymond Shafer, began to worry that the backlash would hurt him. What was not brought out, however, until the gubernatorial race was over, and then only because he was elected to its board of directors, was that Walter Annenberg was the biggest individual stockholder of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
In 1962 Mr. Annenberg barred his television stations in Philadelphia and New Haven from broadcasting an ABC documentary on Nixon's career that included an interview with Alger Hiss, who was convicted of perjury in 1950 when he denied having collaborated with a Communist spy network. The next day The Inquirer carried a front-page statement from the publisher: "I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served in permitting a convicted treasonable spy to comment about a distinguished American," Mr. Annenberg declared, disregarding the fact that Hiss had been convicted of perjury, not espionage. The censorship occasioned a storm of protest from viewers and readers that reverberated for weeks.
Mr. Annenberg's successful efforts to expand the Triangle Publications empire included the start-up of Seventeen magazine in 1944; the founding of TV Guide in 1953 and the purchase of radio and television stations. Highly successful, Seventeen was born of a collaboration between Mr. Annenberg and Helen Valentine, the promotions manager of Mademoiselle magazine, after he had noticed the prevalence of teenage fashions in shop windows on Fifth Avenue and realized that there was no magazine aimed at this lucrative market.
Seventeen was an overnight success, selling 400,000 copies of its first issue, and for many years it carried more advertising than any other women's magazine.
In 1954 Mr. Annenberg's sister Enid, who had established herself as a hardworking feature writer on The Inquirer during the war, took over as editor and enlivened the magazine's layout and content. WFIL-AM and FM, two of Philadelphia's leading radio stations, had been acquired by Triangle in 1945; a television station soon followed. Subsequently, Triangle acquired other radio and television stations in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and California, most of them affiliated with national networks.
These television interests led Mr. Annenberg into one of his most successful ventures, TV Guide, which he established by acquiring and merging several local television magazines. It was published in regional editions with features about television programs and personalities in addition to the listings. Available at supermarket checkout counters, the magazine eventually reached an estimated 17 million homes, the largest circulation of any magazine in the country.

High Profile in Britain
With his designation by President Nixon in 1969 as ambassador to Britain, Mr. Annenberg decided to curtail his business activities. He sold The Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News that year, without prior notification to staff members, an action that typified for many of them his aloofness and imperiousness as a publisher.
His appointment as ambassador was viewed negatively in influential quarters, here and in Britain. Some critics suggested that he had bought the nomination with campaign contributions, and at confirmation hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he was aggressively questioned by Senator J. William Fulbright, the committee's chairman, who did not vote for his appointment.
Mr. Annenberg's patrician predecessor as ambassador, David K. E. Bruce, and his wife, Evangeline, were said to be dismayed at the appointment; they broke with tradition by staying on in London in a high-profile way after their successors arrived. The Bruces were definitely less than charmed when Mrs. Annenberg brought a team of Beverly Hills decorators to London to give the 35-room embassy residence a much-needed six-month redo at a cost of $1 million.
During Mr. Annenberg's early tenure as ambassador, the British press poked fun at his lack of qualifications and his bumbling speaking style. Presenting his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II, he was asked by the queen, in front of television cameras, how he was faring while Winfield House, the embassy residence, was being restored. He replied, "We're in the embassy residence, subject, of course, to some of the discomfiture as a result of a need for, uh, elements of refurbishment and rehabilitation."
His first public speech as ambassador, in which he lambasted student radicals in the United States but barely mentioned Anglo-American relations, did not endear him to the British establishment. Yet in his five and a half years as ambassador, he redeemed himself by hard work, his wife's talent for gracious entertaining (she later served as chief of protocol during the Reagan administration), and gifts to favorite royal causes like the restoration of St. Paul's Cathedral.
Eventually, he became friends with Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. In 1976, the queen named him an honorary knight, and in 1983, when she visited the United States, she came for lunch at Sunnylands. Prince Charles spent the weekend there in 1974 while on shore leave from a naval cruise, and visited many times thereafter. On Mr. Annenberg's return from Britain (for the rest of his life, he liked to be called Ambassador) it also became something of a shrine to British royalty, with photographs and other mementos of the royal family displayed in abundance.
Mr. Annenberg's first marriage, in 1938, to Veronica Dunkelman of Toronto, ended in divorce in 1950. The couple had a son, Roger, a schizophrenic who committed suicide in 1962 at age 22, and a daughter, Wallis Annenberg, of Los Angeles, who survives him. 
In 1951, Mr. Annenberg married Leonore Cohn Rosenstiel, who also survives him, as do two of his seven sisters, Enid Haupt and Evelyn Hall, both of New York City; two step-daughters; four grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; five great-grandchildren and a step-great-grandson.

Zeal for Education
His interest in the mass media's potential for education led Mr. Annenberg to establish, in 1962, the large, handsome M. L. Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, named for his father. In 1971, he set up another Annenberg communications school at the University of Southern California. Both aimed at turning out not just reporters, but also researchers, managers and policy analysts. He also financed, in 1986, the Annenberg Institute in Philadelphia, successor to the former Dropsie College there and the inheritor of its 180,000-volume library. The institute is devoted to expanding the understanding of Western history and culture as they developed from Middle Eastern foundations.
But his 1976 proposal to set up a fine arts center at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that would provide mass art education using television technology ended in defeat. On his return from London in 1974, he had joined the Met's board, and hatched the idea of establishing a center at the museum that would make great art more available to the general public. His plan called for the use of film, television, tapes, slides and reproductions to educate the widest possible audience about the history and nature of art. The project's head would be Thomas P. F. Hoving, then the Met's director, and Mr. Annenberg offered $40 million to get the ball rolling. 
At first the idea was welcomed by Met officials, who suggested that the center could become part of the museum's new southwest wing, where it would displace planned exhibition areas. But opposition began to build among local politicians and Met trustees. Questions arose over the center's function, its autonomy from the rest of the Met's operation and the use of city-owned land for a project that some saw as unrelated to the museum's fundamental activities. Mr. Hoving was denounced for the conflict of interests entailed in his negotiating for the job of the center's director while still head of the museum.
Several City Council members opposed the project on grounds that it would entail further expansion of the museum into the sacred precincts of Central Park, already a sore point raised by the Met's vast building projects of the 1970's. The furor became so intense that Mr. Annenberg, after trying to explain the project by means of an advertisement in The New York Times, abruptly decided to drop it. 
A good deal of the money from the sale of Triangle in 1988 went into the M. L. Annenberg Foundation (last year the foundation reported assets of $2.9 billion), enabling Mr. Annenberg to expand his already far-flung philanthropies considerably, largely in the field of education. In 1991 he pledged $60 million to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to support mathematics and science programming for students from kindergarten to the 12th grade. His donation of $50 million to the United Negro College Fund in 1990 was hailed as the largest gift ever for historically black colleges.
In 1993 Mr. Annenberg gave $365 million to three universities -- Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California -- and to Peddie, his prep school alma mater. That same year, he announced what is probably the biggest gift ever made to benefit public education, $500 million, spread over five years and among several institutions and organizations bent on boosting the efficacy of public schools, the bulk to be spent in urban areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. 
In 1989, when he gave $15 million for acquisitions to the Metropolitan and $5 million to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, he said: "Having reached the age of four-score years, I am trying to be a constructive citizen. I have heard it said that no good deed goes unpunished, but I don't intend to let that discourage me."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY; 
Bush Tells Congress to Move Quickly on Terrorism Insurance

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush urged Congressional leaders today to resolve their differences by the end of the week and adopt legislation to protect the insurance industry from losses from future terrorist attacks.
 At a meeting in the White House, Mr. Bush asked House and Senate lawmakers working on the legislation to reach an agreement quickly, saying that lack of affordable terrorism insurance was costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
 Both the House and the Senate have adopted measures intended to make terrorism coverage widely available at affordable prices by limiting the liability of the industry. But the House and Senate approach the issue differently, and administration officials and Senate Democratic leaders have been squabbling over a largely symbolic provision that would limit the ability of terrorism victims to sue for punitive damages. 
Prospects for legislation had dimmed as lawmakers, already preoccupied with legislation on homeland security and Iraq, prepared to leave town soon for the final weeks of the campaign season. Despite months of intensive lobbying by the insurance, real estate and financial services industries, the legislation has stalled largely over punitive damages. 
The lawmakers have not reconciled the two bills. In the House version, the federal government would be required to make loans to the insurers to pay most of the cost of terrorist attacks that result in more than $1 billion in damages. Under the Senate bill, the government would pay 80 percent of losses up to $10 billion and 90 percent above that. The House bill gives the treasury secretary discretion to decide whether to actually require the insurers to pay back the loans, presumably leaving the costs to be paid by taxpayers.
Mr. Bush did not express a preference for either measure today but emphasized that it was important for the lawmakers to quickly come to agreement. His top aides have insisted that the limitations on punitive damages remain in any final legislation.
"This is a way for us to work together to put people back to work here in America," Mr. Bush said. He said that more than $15 billion in construction projects have stalled because developers cannot get affordable insurance. 
Mr. Bush's push for the measure reflects a no-lose political strategy. If Congress reaches an agreement on the measure, he can rightly claim credit for it. If it fails, he can blame Congressional Democrats, and in particular the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, for the failure.
White House officials say Mr. Bush is planning to make a speech about the issue later this week before representatives from labor, real estate and financial services.
Reports of the true dimensions of the insurance problem are anecdotal and conflicting. Several construction projects that Mr. Bush highlighted earlier this year as being stalled are now under way, while others are clearly encountering problems.
While the administration has been campaigning for nearly a year for the legislation, the issue took on new urgency last week when Moodys' Investors Service downgraded its ratings on some of New York's most prominent buildings, including Rockefeller Center, the headquarters of Citigroup, and two major structures in Times Square, the Conde Nast building and the Marriott Marquis.
Still, in a sign that there is no consensus about the dimensions of the problem, Fitch Ratings said that after reviewing about a dozen loans on individual buildings and groups of buildings -- about the same number reviewed by Moody's -- it felt only three should be downgraded because of inadequate terrorism coverage. One of the buildings was an office tower at 280 Park Avenue, which Moody's had also downgraded.
A third ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, said last June that it did not anticipate changing ratings on any commercial real estate loans because of lack of terrorism insurance since it was virtually impossible to calculate the risks of another attack.
While the insurance, banking and real estate industries have been campaigning hard for government help, they concede that the lack of terrorism coverage so far has had less impact on the economy than they predicted immediately after the World Trade Center attack.
In Richmond, Va., John B. Levy, the president of John B. Levy & Company, a real estate investment bank, said government help on terrorism insurance would welcome. But he said that terrorism insurance was not the only thing slowing the real estate business.
"Terrorism coverage is but one reason that people are rethinking new projects," he said. "There are a lot of other reasons, including increased vacancies, declining rents and uncertain corporate financial strength."

U.S. Seeks 'Tough' Terms For U.N. Inspections in Iraq
Hours after Iraq came to an agreement with United Nations officials on the return of weapons inspectors, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that any search of Saddam Hussein's arsenals should be delayed until the Security Council passed a "new, strong, tough resolution" setting terms. Iraqi officials agreed to allow the inspectors to do their work under the terms of existing Security Council resolutions. A1

Iraq said it was planning for the arrival of United Nations weapons inspectors in two weeks, promising them access to its most sensitive sites, but drew the line at Mr. Hussein's presidential palaces. A12

Bush Stance Shifts
President Bush seemed to soften his tone about military action against Iraq, saying he was open to compromise with both Congress and the United Nations as long as each passed "tough" resolutions that did not tie his hands if Saddam Hussein refused to disarm. But his spokesman said that Mr. Bush was still determined to oust Mr. Hussein, and urged the Iraqi people to rise up against him. A1

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
AOL's chairman takesa few moments to define his role and to calm jittery investors.

BYLINE:  By David D. Kirkpatrick 

 BODY:
STEPHEN M. CASE, the chairman of AOL Time Warner, under fire from some directors and major shareholders over the disappointing performance of its AOL division, yesterday laid out his continuing contributions as the leader of its board and an adviser to its management. 
 At a Goldman, Sachs investors conference in New York, Mr. Case did not comment on reports of a possible challenge to his job from other directors. But he spoke publicly about his role at the company for the first time since July, when the poor current performance of the AOL division and accusations of potentially overstated revenue began to arouse shareholder ire at his part in AOL's acquisition of Time Warner. 
 Mr. Case seemed to strike a balance, conveying that he was making a positive difference to the company while emphasizing that the chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, was in control of its day-to-day operations.
Mr. Case said that he planned to serve as an "executive chairman" of its board without specific authority in the company's operations. He added that he considered it good corporate governance for the chairman to be a step removed from management. But he also said that he helped lead a committee on corporate strategy with Mr. Parsons. When asked by company executives, he said, he would "roll up my sleeves and try to be helpful." For example, he added, he meets once a week with Jonathan F. Miller, the new chairman of the AOL unit.
Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney and another speaker at the conference, played down reports that Disney was negotiating with AOL Time Warner to form a joint venture combining ABC News with CNN. He said the chances of a deal were "50-50 at best."
But he also went out of his way to praise Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and an AOL Time Warner director who has been said to object to potential terms of the joint venture under discussion. "Frankly, I think that Ted Turner has done such a fantastic job creating the whole business and has had such a keen spirit about what it should be that, should it happen with us, I would be thrilled," Mr. Eisner said.
Mr. Eisner, who, like Mr. Case, is under pressure from shareholders and directors disappointed with his company's recent share price, acknowledged that its ABC television and Disney studios entertainment divisions "have not been entertaining enough."
But he said changes were already under way. He added that he believed that the economic downturn would soon end and that pent-up demand would attract crowds back to Disney's theme parks and cruises. 
Barry Diller, chairman of USA Interactive, however, said he doubted that a sustained advertising rebound was at hand. Mr. Diller leads one of the few media companies with the wherewithal to spend at the moment, but he said he planned to hold back from big new purchases for now, betting that the business might deteriorate further over the next six to nine months. 
Mr. Diller also seemed to play down the widely discussed possibility that his company might buy the Universal entertainment business back from the cash-short Vivendi Universal -- Mr. Diller sold it to Vivendi a few years ago, when acquisition prices were at a peak. He said he thought the previous sale price had been a fair one and would still be "the day after tomorrow." 
Mr. Case acknowledged that in addition to the industry malaise, AOL Time Warner had suffered from some management missteps after the merger. "There was a lack of leadership at the AOL division," he said, as some of its top executives went elsewhere. He was presumably referring to the movement of many AOL executives to run the combined company. He said the company's emphasis on aggressive financial targets in the merger's first year had instilled an undue focus on short-term profits at the expense of attention to serving AOL's members. 
But Mr. Case said the company's new management, including Mr. Parsons and Mr. Miller, was rectifying these problems and taking steps to revive AOL. Describing the changes in AOL's business, Mr. Case said he believed that online advertising, once the principal engine of AOL's profits and growth, would become less important than other sources of revenue, like subscriptions, fees for premium services and sales of goods and services to members online. He confirmed that a new emphasis on online commerce was a big reason that AOL Time Warner had hired Mr. Miller, formerly an executive involved in a home shopping channel and online retailing.
Mr. Case also described several projects under development that might help attract consumers to the company's digital cable and broadband Internet offerings, including adding video to instant messaging, adding video to online personal advertisements, expanding the availability of digital music for sale online and offering what he called "personal television."
He said the company was testing special set-top boxes in Rochester that let consumers pause live broadcasts. Elsewhere, the company is offering a version of HBO that lets consumers order films when they want them. Other prototypes under development would also allow consumers more control over what they watch, he said. 
On the subject of the company's potential accounting problems, Mr. Case said AOL Time Warner hoped to provide more information soon. AOL Time Warner has started an internal inquiry into three transactions that may have overstated the AOL division's revenue by $49 million over 18 months. Mr. Case said the company hoped to provide more information about the progress of its inquiry on Oct. 23 when it reports its third-quarter results. But he warned that the internal investigation might not be concluded by then. "Time will tell what we have got here," he said.

HEADLINE: Torricelli Adds to Volatility In Battle for Senate Control 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Senator Robert G. Torricelli's stunning decision to drop his re-election bid has added new volatility to the battle for control of the Senate, with eight races now considered too close to call and Democrats in a fierce struggle to hang on to their precarious one-seat majority.
 After two years of dedicated combat between the parties, neither is predicting a large breakthrough next month. Republican and Democratic leaders say it is possible for one side to pick up several seats in the midterm elections. But the more likely outcome, they say, will be a one-seat edge that reflects a nation every bit as divided as it was after the 2000 election. 
 Yet for all the nervousness on both sides, Democrats have in recent weeks become particularly jittery. Party leaders had counted on the shaky economy and the issue of corporate responsibility to give them a lift. But they now complain that Iraq has made it more complicated to press hard on domestic issues that could best help their candidates. 
In the most telling sign of the Democrats' discomfort, many party leaders said it was preferable to be searching for a new, long-shot candidate in New Jersey little more than a month before November than to be clinging to Mr. Torricelli. Before he dropped out of the race on Monday, many Democrats said Mr. Torricelli looked certain to lose a seat that is critical to retaining the Senate.
Asked to assess his party's chance of keeping its bare majority, Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said today, "It's certainly not as good as the day before yesterday," though he added that could change if Democrats succeeded in getting a new candidate on the ballot in New Jersey.
Still, Mr. Breaux said: "This is a rock in the road. It's something that no one expected. We didn't even think this seat would be contested. Not only has it turned out to be contested, our candidate has dropped out." Party officials said late today that former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg would be the Democrats' candidate in New Jersey. 
With five weeks to go before the election, Republicans are more optimistic. But they are still cautious. 
"If the elections were today we would win," said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "We would net one seat up. But the elections are not today."
Indeed, in a sign of their own uncertainty, Republicans seemed to be fighting hard against the Democrats' effort to put a new candidate on the New Jersey ballot with the same fervor they had for President Bush's legal battle in Florida in 2000.
There is very little maneuvering room for either party. Democrats control the Senate, 50 to 49 to 1, because of a decision by Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont to become an independent last year. So a one-seat switch in the Senate would carry enormous implications. It would put Republicans in control by dint of Vice President Dick Cheney's tie-breaking Senate vote, most likely giving the Republicans control of the White House and both chambers of Congress and President Bush more power to push his domestic program and judicial nominees.
Some Democrats went as far as to say privately that they would be better off without Mr. Torricelli even if they could not field another candidate and had to cede the race. They argued that they would then be free to shift millions of dollars from New Jersey into other close races.
"Is this a high-risk strategy that may or may not succeed?" a senior party strategist asked. "Yes, but it's better to have some hope than no hope."
Beyond New Jersey, at least seven other Senate races are considered tossups by politicians and strategists in both parties. Four are currently held by Republicans in Arkansas, Colorado, New Hampshire and Texas. Three are held by Democrats in Minnesota, South Dakota and Missouri.
A few other seats could also be in play. Strategists are watching closely whether Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has been damaged by controversy over a surreptitious taping of a strategy session of his opponent, Representative Greg Ganske, by a former Harkin aide. A new weekend poll still showed Mr. Harkin with a large lead, but even Democrats said its findings may be overstated.
Another wildcard is Louisiana. Republicans are trying to force Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, into a December runoff by fielding three candidates against her in Louisiana's November election, in which all candidates regardless of party run on one ballot. If no one gets above 50 percent. the two top candidates face each other in December.
That means there is a chance control of the Senate would not be known until December. "It could be a lot like the presidential election where everybody's kind of sitting in this limbo land," Mr. Frist said. Democrats insist they are confident that Ms. Landrieu will win on the first ballot.
Part of the reason for the year's close races is the tug and pull on voters as they face both the uncertainty of terrorism and the troubled economy. "Those two forces are playing off against one another," said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster. He said he still believed that the voters would lean toward the Democrats in the final weeks. "You look at the economy, look at the stock market, you look at health care and corporate governance," he said. "All of those things say it should be a Democratic year."
But Republicans have worked hard to neutralize those Democratic strengths by advancing proposals of their own. "We've gotten very proficient at checkmating each other's issues," said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.
Traditionally, the party of the president loses seats in midterm elections. And Republicans faced other potential difficulties this year. Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 20 are held by Republicans and 14 by Democrats, giving the G.O.P. more seats to defend. Although no Democratic incumbents retired, four Republican incumbents in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas chose not to seek re-election.
Geography has helped level the field. Many of the races are taking place in the South and Midwest in states captured by Mr. Bush, thus putting Democrats on difficult terrain. Eager to restore a Republican Congress, Mr. Bush himself has jumped aggressively into the contests, shattering fund-raising records and helping recruit the G.O.P. Senate field.
Mr. Bush personally wooed Representative John Thune of South Dakota to take on Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat. The contest has been neck and neck in the polls all year.
Mr. Cheney helped clear the field for Norm Coleman, a former Democrat who is running as a moderate Republican in Minnesota and is competing aggressively with two-term incumbent Paul Wellstone, a liberal.
And the White House put its weight behind Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina months before the G.O.P. primary in an effort to hold the seat of Senator Jesse Helms, who is retiring. Polls show that Mrs. Dole leads Erskine Bowles, the Democratic candidate who is a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.
Republicans say they also have a good chance of holding their own in New Hampshire. A few months ago, the Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen, looked like a prime candidate to oust incumbent the Republican senator, Robert C. Smith, an iconoclastic conservative. 
But many G.O.P. leaders supported Representative John E. Sununu in a Republican primary because they viewed the 38-year-old as a more potent opponent to the moderate governor. He defeated Mr. Smith on Sept. 10, and different polls now show him either in a dead heat with Ms. Shaheen or running ahead.
Still, Republicans, too, can afford few losses -- and they could face a few. Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas is considered to be in the fight of his life. A minister who is a social conservative, Mr. Hutchinson has faced questions about his divorce of his wife of 29 years and marriage to an aide. His challenger, Attorney General Mark Pryor, is a moderate with a fabled Arkansas political name. His father, David, was senator for 18 years. 
Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado is also suddenly in a dead-heat against Ted Strickland, a Democrat, in a rematch of their 1996 race. And in Texas, where Senator Phil Gramm is retiring, the Republican state attorney general, John Cornyn, is facing a spirited challenge from Democrat Ron Kirk, a former mayor of Dallas, who if elected would become the only black Senator.
Republicans are seeking to offset any losses and bolster their majority in the Midwest, where they need to defeat at least one of three incumbents, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wellstone or Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri. Mrs. Carnahan was appointed senator when her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, was killed in a plane crash late in his 2000 Senate race and still defeated the incumbent, John Ashcroft.
For all of Washington's preoccupation with Iraq, most races are focusing on domestic issues. In New Hampshire this past weekend, the candidates had their sights on economic matters.
Ms. Shaheen turned to the issue of corporate responsibility, appearing at a news conference with Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic sponsor of stalled House legislation that would immediately impose federal taxes on any corporation that moved its address offshore to avoid taxes after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Mr. Sununu stuck with his party in a procedural vote that kept Democrats from forcing Mr. Neal's bill to a floor vote, though he has supported a measure to keep corporations that switch their addresses offshore from obtaining federal contracts.
"John Sununu is on the wrong side of this issue, Ms. Shaheen said. He refused to break with his party leadership and do what's right for New Hampshire."
And Mr. Sununu was hitting hard at her record as governor and the long-running tax and school controversy set off by a State Supreme Court ruling that found New Hampshire's school financing system unconstitutional.
"She promised to veto a broadbased tax," he told Republicans at a party picnic. "Then she proposed one, proposed a sales tax to stick on everyone in New Hampshire. On the issues most important to New Hampshire, she has absolutely failed."

PERSON: Frank Lautenberg 

HEADLINE: Man in the News -- Frank Raleigh Lautenberg; 
A Known Quantity, Ready for One More Senate Run

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Two years ago, as Frank Lautenberg was preparing to trade in his Senate seat for retirement, he was already expressing regret for his decision not to run for re-election after 18 years in Washington. "It feels lousy," he said at the time. "I'm going to miss this place."
 Apparently, he still misses it. 
 In tapping Mr. Lautenberg to fill the ballot spot occupied by Senator Robert G. Torricelli, party leaders are clearly hoping his familiar, untarnished name and his skills as a seasoned fund-raiser and advocate for Democratic causes will be an effective foil to Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican candidate, and help keep the Senate in Democratic hands. 
With a thatch of white hair and an avuncular demeanor, Mr. Lautenberg, 78, is the respected figure Democrats wanted for what they hope will be a furious 35-day campaign to keep Mr. Torricelli's seat in Democratic hands. Although he never attained the near-cult following of his Senate colleague Bill Bradley, Mr. Lautenberg was widely admired by Democrats as a liberal, hard-working legislator who championed tough environmental regulations and strict antismoking rules, including the bill that banned smoking on domestic flights and the law that raised the nation's drinking age to 21. 
"In a chaotic and confusing time, Lautenberg seems like the most reasonable choice," said David Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University. "He's a real trouper and a party loyalist and unlike so many politicians, he left office with quiet dignity."
And with five weeks left until the election, his name alone is worth millions. "He doesn't have to buy recognition," said State Senator Richard J. Codey, New Jersey's Democratic chairman. "People in this state know who he is." 
Frank Raleigh Lautenberg was born in 1924 in Paterson, N.J., the son of Polish and Russian immigrants. His father tried his hand as a farmer and a bartender but died when Mr. Lautenberg was 18. 
Mr. Lautenberg worked several years in a sandwich shop opened by his mother, then enlisted in the Army during World War II, serving in Europe. After returning in 1946, he attended Columbia University on the G.I. Bill of Rights and graduated with a degree in economics. In 1954, after several years of selling insurance, Mr. Lautenberg and two friends started a company called Automatic Data Processing, now known as ADP, which employs more than 20,000 people. After retiring from the company in 1982 to serve in the Senate, he returned in 2001, when he was appointed an honorary director.
With a net worth estimated at $11 million to $56 million, according to 2-year-old financial disclosure forms, Mr. Lautenberg can also be expected to reach into his own pocket to help finance a campaign that will require many millions of dollars to win.
Although he first won office in 1982 by spending $5.5 million -- most of it his own money -- on a campaign for a seat in the Senate, in later years he found the task of running for re-election onerous. When he announced his decision not to seek re-election, he cited the never-ending quest for campaign money as the main reason for his retirement.
"I did not want to sit there all those hours each day asking for money," he said at the time. 
In the end, another liberal multimillionaire, Jon S. Corzine, stepped into the breach and spent in excess of $60 million, a Senate record, to win Mr. Lautenberg's seat. 
During his years in Washington Mr. Lautenberg was known as a hard-driving senator who delivered the goods to New Jersey, including a $500 million light-rail system in Hudson County and many millions more to clean up Superfund sites across the state.
"He wasn't a Rhodes scholar type, but more like an Al D'Amato, someone who took care of business at home," said Gerald M. Pomper, who teaches political science at Rutgers University. "But unlike D'Amato, there's not much bad you could say about Lautenberg."
Party officials, however, are already quietly worrying about one potential bad thing: Mr. Lautenberg's age. Several veterans of long-ago battles could not help but note the irony of an elderly Mr. Lautenberg running against a challenger 29 years his junior. That is because it was exactly 20 years ago that Mr. Lautenberg won his first elected office by beating Representative Millicent Fenwick, who was then 72.
During that campaign, Mr. Lautenberg gained considerable traction by repeatedly questioning her "fitness" and "her ability to do the job."

HEADLINE: Mystery Effect In Biotech Drug Puts ItsMaker On Defensive 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
As director of hematology at the Hotel Dieu hospital here, Nicole Casadevall had seen such cases before. A patient in her 60's had developed pure red cell aplasia, in which the body's germ-fighting defenses go haywire and attack its own bone marrow, leaving her severely anemic and facing a lifetime of transfusions to survive.
 Dr. Casadevall knew of several diseases -- lymphoid cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus -- that could cause red cell aplasia. But this patient had none of them. Indeed, the woman had regularly been injected with a drug to stimulate the production of red blood cells while she received dialysis twice a week. Why, then, was she now unable to make any red blood cells at all? 
Four years after Dr. Casadevall began to investigate this mystery, answers remain elusive. But the pattern that she uncovered -- that her patient was just one of scores in the same condition, nearly all of whom had taken a drug made by Johnson & Johnson -- has raised doubts about not just the company but about a whole class of drugs that are a cornerstone of biotechnology. 
The Johnson & Johnson drug, Eprex, is the market-leading version of a protein known generically as erythropoietin, or EPO, that is the best-selling genetically engineered drug ever, and one of the largest-selling drugs of any kind in the world. EPO is given to patients with conditions that hamper red blood cell production -- usually people being treated for kidney problems, like dialysis patients, or for cancer.
Global sales of EPO products exceeded $13 billion last year, with Johnson & Johnson alone accounting for $3.4 billion of that. EPO drugs were the company's best-selling pharmaceutical group, providing more than 10 percent of its revenue.
It was Dr. Casadevall's work in the cloisterlike confines of the Hotel Dieu, and her publication of the results earlier this year, that alerted doctors and nurses to the problem. That alert contributed in part to increased reporting of red cell aplasia, intensifying the questions about Johnson & Johnson's drug. 
Of the 141 cases of red cell aplasia reported in EPO users, most have involved people taking Eprex in Europe, Canada and Australia. Only a handful of cases have appeared in patients using other brands of the drug, including Procrit, Johnson & Johnson's name for the EPO drug it sells in the United States.
Johnson & Johnson makes Eprex at a factory in Puerto Rico. But Procrit is produced for Johnson & Johnson at a factory in Colorado run by a competitor, Amgen, which developed the drug. Regulators and scientists seeking to explain the cases of red cell aplasia have focused on the Puerto Rico plant, and Johnson & Johnson's competitors -- mainly Amgen of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Roche of Switzerland -- say the problem is specific to Eprex, not to their EPO drugs.
Those companies cannot help but see opportunity in the tarnishing of Eprex's reputation. Indeed, the problems with Eprex could help Amgen, which now sells a new version of EPO called Aranesp in competition with Johnson & Johnson.
Johnson & Johnson, though, contends that the handful of cases of red cell aplasia in users of its competitors' drugs are evidence that the problem, whatever it is, goes beyond Eprex. Yet J.& J., the third-largest American drug maker, is racing desperately on two fronts: to solve the mystery and to salvage its leading pharmaceutical product.
"Frankly, I'm not sure we realized when we began just how difficult and complex this would become," said Per Peterson, the chairman of pharmaceuticals research at Johnson & Johnson. "But our knowledge is evolving, and we know much more today than we did a year ago."
Dr. Peterson said the company debated whether to take Eprex off the market several times as reports of red cell aplasia multiplied, but decided not to do so, concluding that the drug's benefits far outweighed the risks. Economics, he insisted, were not a deciding factor, noting that Johnson & Johnson did not hesitate to withdraw a popular heartburn drug, Propulsid, when it was linked to dozens of deaths two years ago.
European regulators, loath to withdraw a drug that has proved valuable for hundreds of thousands of patients, have limited their response so far to recommending changes in how Eprex is administered. They have advised doctors to give it intravenously rather than through injections under the skin, noting that most cases of aplasia have been associated with injections. At the same time, they are appealing to doctors to report any new cases.
Dr. Casadevall said she agreed that Eprex should not be taken off the market. When bioengineered EPO reached the market a dozen years ago, she said, "it changed the lives" of patients with kidney disease. Because EPO is naturally produced in the kidneys, when those organs fail people often need to deal with anemia as well as receive dialysis to clean their blood.
"At long last, such patients could live without the risk of anemia," she said. "It was a revolution."
Her belief in that advance was so strong that she was at a loss to explain why her patient in 1998 was acutely anemic, despite being administered Eprex. To try to unwind the riddle, she enlisted the help of Patrick Mayeux, a biochemist at the Cochin Institute of Molecular Genetics in Paris.
Mr. Mayeux used radioactive tracers to study the patient's bone marrow, the soft tissue inside bones that produces red blood cells. He discovered antibodies that not only neutralized the red-cell-producing effect of the Eprex that the woman was taking, but also her own body's ability to replenish its red blood cell supply. Most puzzling, the production of the destructive antibodies seemed to be set in motion by the drug itself.
That unexpected conclusion was soon confirmed by a stream of new, similar cases elsewhere in Europe, Canada and Australia. In virtually all of them, patients on kidney dialysis had been injected with Eprex.
Scientists make Eprex, like other brands of bioengineered erythropoietin, by splicing the human EPO gene into hamster cells. But genetically engineered EPO is subtly different from the natural protein. In the patients with red cell aplasia, Mr. Mayeux found that antibodies treated the drug as a foreign protein -- and then did the same to the patient's natural EPO as well.
Early in 1999, after Dr. Casadevall had reviewed three cases of aplasia, she notified the pharmacological centers of Johnson & Johnson and Roche. In the meantime, reports of similar occurrences of red cell aplasia had been coming in to the drug companies from doctors and hospitals. "Perhaps at the beginning they thought it was only one or two cases," she said. "They thought it was chance, not important. But with each new case, they became more and more anxious."
Dr. Casadevall said she knew of two cases in which people who were using erythropoietin had died, though she said she did not know which brand of the protein they were being given and doubted that the deaths were related to the drugs. In most cases, patients who develop red cell aplasia are treated with transfusions or immunosuppressant drugs that neutralize the antibodies. In some cases, she said, patients undergo kidney transplants.
Dr. Peterson praised the work of Dr. Casadevall, calling it "first-rate science," adding that "she has done a tremendous service by calling attention to this problem."
Johnson & Johnson's response has taken several forms: to try to figure out why so many Eprex users have developed aplasia, to seek to shift attention to cases involving its competitors' drugs and to try to hang on to its lead in the European market.
After discovering the pattern that seemed to implicate Eprex, Johnson & Johnson reviewed the way it makes the drug at its factory in Manati, P.R. Among other changes, it reduced the amount of silicone in syringes used to inject Eprex because tiny amounts of the silicone can leak into the drug.
Johnson & Johnson also got a better grip on distribution. Because Eprex prices vary from country to country, independent dealers would buy it in cheaper countries, like Greece and Portugal, and ship it to countries with higher prices in Northern Europe. But did they keep Eprex at temperatures of 36 to 46 degrees, and protect it from light, as required? Johnson & Johnson found that one shipper did not deliver under the right conditions.
The company's troubles with Eprex were compounded last spring when J.& J. learned that the Food and Drug Administration was reviewing accusations by a former employee, Hector Arce, that he had been told to falsify data to conceal manufacturing lapses. The company denies the accusations, which Mr. Arce made in a whistle-blower lawsuit; it says he was a boiler operator not directly involved in making Eprex. The F.D.A. is still investigating.
In the meantime, Johnson & Johnson began to note red cell aplasia in patients taking competing products, including NeoRecormon, which is made by Roche, and Epogen, which is manufactured by Amgen. Dr. Peterson said Johnson & Johnson found that three people taking NeoRecormon exclusively had developed red cell aplasia. If Roche tracked reports of the condition as carefully as Johnson & Johnson did, he added, "they probably would have come in the same ballpark we have been in."
Alexander Klauser, a spokesman for Roche, disputed that. He said his company had not seen evidence to suggest the problem was with combinant EPO in general; rather, that it appears to have something to do with Eprex itself. He acknowledged red cell aplasia in one patient using only NeoRecormon, and said Roche had "no explanation" for it.
At the same time, Johnson & Johnson ordered its sales representatives to knock on doctors' doors throughout Europe to make sure that the drug was being properly stored and administered. It also wrote to doctors telling them of the difficulties that Eprex was encountering.
In an article in February in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Casadevall and Mr. Mayeux professed ignorance of just how the body recognizes Eprex as a foreign protein. Despite continued research since, they can still only speculate. "The trick now is to determine the part of the molecule toward which the antibodies are directed," Dr. Casadevall said. "But it is very difficult technically."
One clue may have been in the sharp rise in reported cases of red cell aplasia in 1999. J.& J. changed the manufacturing process at the Puerto Rico plant in 1998, ending the use of a human blood protein as a stabilizer in Eprex at the request of European health officials concerned about the spread of mad cow disease.
"We clearly speculate that the removal of human serum albumin is a contributing factor to the problem facing patients," said Dr. Peterson, the Johnson & Johnson scientist.
Complicating this theory, Roche never used human blood protein as a stabilizer in its formula for NeoRecormon. Mr. Mayeux, the French scientist, said the problem might be attributable to "something in the patients themselves, some susceptibility in their immune system."
Dr. Casadevall said her first patient still relies on transfusions to survive. "She's a rather older woman with other illnesses, including diabetes," she said. "She received immunosuppressant treatment, though light, because her general health was not good. She is still not cured."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
Telling Chile's Story, Even if Chile Has Little Interest

BYLINE:  By Alan Riding 

DATELINE: PARIS Oct. 2

 BODY:
Five days after the Chilean army overthrew the elected Socialist government of President Salvador Allende Gossens on Sept. 11, 1973, Patricio Guzman was arrested by military intelligence officers. He was then interrogated in the national stadium in Santiago for two weeks before he was released and fled the country. He was lucky. While many Allende supporters were being jailed, tortured and killed, he escaped because he was "only" a documentary filmmaker.
 Yet in the nearly three decades since the coup, Mr. Guzman, a gentle-mannered man of 61, has earned a significant place in the history of Chile's failed experiment in nonviolent revolution. Through a series of documentary films, notably his monumental 270-minute "Battle of Chile," he has become a chronicler of Allende's three years in office and a collector of the bitter memories of the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, which lasted until 1990. 
 His latest film, "The Pinochet Case," which is showing at the Film Forum in New York, recounts the story of General Pinochet's unexpected arrest in London on Oct. 16, 1998, at the request of the Spanish authorities, who had charged him with genocide, terrorism and murder. It then records the 16-month legal fight until a British court approved his extradition to Spain and the British government ordered his release on grounds of ill health. 
Accompanying this reporting, however, Mr. Guzman uses the testimony of nine women -- some torture victims, others relatives of murdered or missing people -- to tell of the dictatorship. "Instead of using a voice-over to provide the background, they do that," Mr. Guzman explained in an interview in his Paris apartment. "They provide the counterpoint to the story. From journalism to memory to journalism."
The stories they tell are heart-rending. Among them were Victoria, whose son disappeared; Nelly, whose husband disappeared; Luisa, whose two sons were murdered in 1985; Cecilia, who was detained from 1981 to 1992; Ofelia, who survived torture in a house of horrors known as the Villa Grimaldi. The counterpoint of their memories are recent images of the disinterment of some of the thousands who died during the dictatorship.
At the end of the film, General Pinochet is back in Chile and, newly vulnerable after the humiliation of his experience in London, his immunity from prosecution as a senator for life is lifted and he is charged with torture and other crimes. Deemed by government doctors to be unfit to face trial, he remains under house arrest. And as if completing the circle, the movie's final image is a statue of Allende being erected in front of Moneda Palace, where he died.
But for Mr. Guzman the story is not over and perhaps never will be. It is a story fed by memories that he feels committed to keep telling even though Chile is now governed by its third elected civilian government since General Pinochet stepped down and many Chileans prefer not to look back.
"What shocks me is the lack of space for memory in Latin America," he said. "There is no great literature on repression. In Chile great writers have not spoken out with the exception of Ariel Dorfman. Movie directors turn away from the topic. Most artists feel it is a tired theme. They want to move on, to write about or cover other things. I think we'll have to wait for those who are 15 now to address this past."
Yet for the next generation, Mr. Guzman's movies will stand as a record. Indeed, when he returned to Chile in March 1971 after six years of studying cinema in Spain, his immediate thought was to record what he saw. "I sensed a different climate the moment I arrived," he recalled. "The look on people's faces, the music, the middle classes, peasants and workers in the streets, something I had never seen before in my life, a sense of fiesta so unlike Chile."
The result was a 100-minute documentary called "The First Year." But as economic conditions deteriorated in Chile, Mr. Guzman was paralyzed until he received the gift of 30 hours' worth of film stock from the French documentary maker Chris Marker. With that he resumed work with his cameraman, Jorge Muller, later murdered by the dictatorship, this time going into factories and union meetings to record what he calls "the invisible reality."
They were still at work on the morning of the coup, but Mr. Guzman had the foresight to hide everything he had filmed. And thanks to the Swedish Embassy in Santiago, he recovered his historical record four months later in Stockholm. He spent the next five years in Cuba turning it into "The Battle for Chile." "For me, the real coup was in 1979 when I finished the film," he recalled. "I suddenly had no mission and fell into a terrible crisis."
He was rescued by the search for memory, first when he made "Pre-Columbian Mexico," a television series around a Mexican village, and then in 1986 when he visited Chile for the first time since the coup to make "In the Name of God," about liberation theology under the Pinochet regime. Six years later, he returned to the subject of liberation theology, this time across Latin America, in "The Southern Cross."
"The Mexican film made me understand how a documentary can play a role in the preservation of memory," he said. "A country without documentary films is like a family without a photo album. When you see the photo, you remember your past, but the same photo also redefines your past. So there is a to and fro with memory. You return to a forgotten story, and in the process you rewrite that story."
With that in mind, then, for a film called "Chile, Obstinate Memory," Mr. Guzman returned to Chile in 1996 to trace those whom he could identify from "The Battle for Chile." "The Pinochet Case" produced a similarly powerful record. While only 9 of his 40 witnesses appear in the film, a French cable channel, Histoire, plans to broadcast the testimony of all 40 in 10 one-hour programs. Their accounts will also be published in a book.
Mr. Guzman's next project, a biography of Allende for the 30th anniversary of his death, next year, also dwells on memory. He said: "I want the memories not of political leaders, but of old people who have different memories, of people whom no one knows exist, people who retain the collective popular memory. What did Allende mean to them?"
His frustration is that Chile seems less interested in his work than the rest of the world is. His movies have never been shown on Chilean television and stay only three or four weeks in theaters. " 'Obstinate Memory' ran for four weeks in Santiago and for four months in Buenos Aires," he said. "In Santiago 'The Pinochet Case' was taken off after three weeks to make room for 'Harry Potter.' "
But his own energy seems unaffected. "I do what I do because the subjects fascinate me," he said. "I may be in a furrow, but it's not claustrophobic. Memory is a concept, but it is also an animal that enters your body. Remembering can be very powerful. It's an animal that you also have to dominate."

'This Weird House': Design School for the Nervy

BYLINE:  By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS normally depend on contractor crews to work on their homes. Joseph Holtzman, the editor in chief of the idiosyncratic design magazine Nest, which has dwelled equally on Proust's bedroom and Farrah Fawcett memorabilia, took a different approach. He posted want ads at a dozen design schools.
 The job description was vague: students were needed "to breathe life into a showpiece house" located in a rural byway about 20 miles south of Albany, in Ghent, N.Y. No particular skills were required: applicants with enthusiasm and an inclination to debate the deeper implications of stripes versus polka dots were a plus. 
 Six students (out of 22 who applied) attended what came to be called "Camp Nest" this summer, signing on for two months of labor sweetened with a lot of creative free play. "It was like an art student's 'Real World' crossed with 'This Old House,' " Erich Nagler, 20, a junior at the Parsons School of Design in New York, said of the eight-hour days spent etching bathroom mirrors and showers in a red-and-green plaid and decorating the camp "bus," a 1984 Cadillac, with shark fins and a toothy grin. 
The two-story house was an undistinguished 1950's gabled shed, a former hunting lodge complete with walk-in freezer. In the 70's, it became the swinging weekend pad of a New York gynecologist.
Last year, Mr. Holtzman bought the house, along with five acres of woodland and several adjacent buildings, for $220,000, a purchase made possible in part by the sale of a Matisse painting that had been a gift from his father. The compound sits along the upper edge of a valley that rolls eastward toward the Berkshires. A sludgy pond on the far side of the road served as Camp Nest's modest waterfront, where the heartiest took dips after days spent elbow deep in paint and cement mix.
"I thought it would be more economical and enjoyable" to hire design students, said Mr. Holtzman, 45, whose bashful demeanor, longish flyaway hair and Mad Hatter wardrobe of many-patterned shirts lend him an air of unquenchable youth. He added, "I thought I would get more craft value and that the kids would take my direction."
The four men and two women, all in their early 20's, knew better than to expect cookouts and canoeing. As students at some of the country's more progressive design schools, including the Rhode Island School of Design and Cooper Union, they thrived on experiment. But nothing could have prepared them for immersion into the world of Mr. Holtzman, whose early issues of Nest, a quarterly, contained a story about Barbie's first dream house and a cover photograph of cat litter embellished with gold glitter.
"They wanted to know if it was a cult," said Pablo R. Garcia, a graduate student at the Princeton School of Architecture, who was the go-between for the local contractor and also the all-round recreation director. (Mr. Holtzman called him Counselor Bob.)
Unorthodox as his projects may be, Mr. Holtzman has a shrewd sense of people's attraction to eccentric aesthetics packaged with obsessive sophistication. He started Nest in 1997 with seed money from the sale of his Baltimore home. The initial circulation of 9,000 has grown to 80,000. 
Dennis Palazzolo, 22, an art student at Cooper Union, said he thought he was prepared for the adventure. Mr. Palazzolo, who wears a pair of clunky-chic glasses he made from epoxy, bone and aluminum, said, "I worked for an artist in the Hamptons the summer before on these monumental steel sculptures, and I thought that was as weird as it could get." That was before he arrived at Mr. Holtzman's work in progress.
Evi Westmore, 27, a local weaver, seamstress and jewelry maker who periodically joined the crew, said, "When I heard that there was going to be a ballroom with 40,000 balls hanging from the ceiling, I thought, 'I have to be part of this.' " Ms. Westmore was entrusted with making curtains from Mr. Holtzman's collection of original Wiener Werkstatte textiles. "It was thrilling just to handle them," said Ms. Westmore, who lined the 80-year-old fabrics from Vienna with double layers of ticking for protection. 
For all his love of the arcane, Mr. Holtzman never meant his house to be pretentious. "I want it to be a comfortable, easy house where dogs can be on the furniture, not a decorator statement," he said. "But at the same time, I want it to be a laboratory of my ideas." In this test-tube habitat, nothing was left to chance -- or left unadorned. Even the bright touches of red, blue and yellow on the exterior trim of the house are an inside allusion. "It's a Dutch-shaped house, and Dutch to me means de Stijl, so I used de Stijl colors," Mr. Holtzman said.
The camp's organization was basic. The students were paid $400 a week plus room and board. Sleeping arrangements were crude: they crashed at night on cushions in whatever rooms were not under construction. The students cooked communally (a fish-and-artichokes combo was Mr. Palazzolo's speciality, but the default meal was nachos.) On weekends they went to local diners and dives where Mr. Holtzman picked up the tab. Mr. Garcia shepherded the students through the workday and arranged field trips to MASS MoCA in North Adams, Mass., and other cultural pit stops.
Mr. Holtzman arrived from Manhattan on weekends, often with a retinue of editors, artists, photographers and antiques dealers. Conversation was constant as Mr. Holtzman weighed each design decision out loud. "Joe seemed to be making last-minute decisions," Michael Lambert, the local contractor in charge, said, "but I think he always knew what he was working toward."
The liveliest exchanges took place around bonfires built on the lawn by Mr. Nagler, a former Eagle Scout from Texas, whom Mr. Holtzman nicknamed Wilbur. There were no rounds of "Kumbaya" sung around this campfire. The campers were more likely, say, to analyze the nature of shelter, a discussion provoked when Mr. Holtzman, overheated by the flames, made a shield out of tripods and a blanket.
Down at Mario's hardware store, however, Mr. Lambert encountered local skeptics. He said: "They'd ask me, 'What are you doing with that yellow paint? Are you still down there? How long is that going to last?'
"A lot of them can't believe that anyone would think of putting stripes on the roof or painting the ridge-cap red and white. But it's brilliant the way it all holds together." 
Much of the work was grueling, like insulating the guesthouse and rebuilding a stone wall. But there was also room for free expression. John Tompkins, an architecture student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, recalled working on the main living area, where 12,000 black and green tiles had to be laid in irregular bands. "It was a real work in progress and kind of overwhelming at first," Mr. Tompkins said. "That was when we all started to bond." The floor took several weeks to finish, with the students spending a few all-nighters listening to a dirge-pop band called Magnetic Fields. 
Mr. Holtzman encouraged the students to work out their own patterns wherever they liked. "It may have been menial labor but it never felt like it." said Mr. Palazzolo, who contributed a "blob of a tile that looked like it had melted over the field of other tiles."
After the floor was completed, and the cabinetry had been painted in crisp black-and-white optical-pop circles, the furniture arrived. Overstuffed Victorian couches and armchairs came upholstered in materials that Mr. Holtzman had custom-made in Como, Italy. One fabric is an elegantly drawn linen chintz featuring a marijuana plant. Another has line drawings of rabbits copulating, while a third has drawings of rabbits giving birth, both of cotton velvet. (The chintz is $95 a yard and the velvet $87 a yard, at www.nestproducts.com.) 
The bronze torchiers in the room came from the Andy Warhol estate. A clutch of high-backed A. W. N. Pugin chairs were designed in the 1880's for the British House of Lords. "It's all knock-around stuff," Mr. Holtzman said. "I don't want anything in here treated as if it were precious." To prove it, he invited the students to make it their dorm room. Suddenly, Camp Nest began to look more like the Nest Salon.
Painting the swimming pool took on added urgency as temperatures soared in August. But even the color palette for the pool was an experiment. The goal, Mr. Palazzolo said, was to create "a counterintuitive pool"; the standard Hockney blue wouldn't do. They considered painting it pink to suggest a gigantic gaping mouth. Mr. Holtzman hoped to achieve a deep purple, but settled for a muddy brown. Once the pool was ready, it became part of the daily ritual; the first one in signaled the end of the workday.
It wasn't all sweat and swatches. A quarry swimming hole "right out of the movies" was a favorite hangout, said Nick Delaveleye, a student at Cooper Union, who joined the group in midsummer. And when Carl Skoggard, a Nest staff writer and Mr. Holtzman's companion, returned from Berlin, there was a truly camp party, complete with a drag queen tripping out of a cake.
By August, rooms in the main house had assumed their idiosyncratic condition. One bedroom had a wall made of layers of beeswax etched with baseball diamonds, and another had cartoon-thin lines drawn around the walls to make it a "drawing of a room." By the last few weeks, the students had moved on to framing up rooms in the guesthouse (called the Rocksavage Suite, for David Rocksavage, a filmmaker and the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley) and painting the insides of the meat locker, the future Nest archive, shocking pink. 
By September, most of the students had returned to class and were nostalgically recalling their time spent in Mr. Holztman's pattern-happy world. "He changed the way I look at things," said Mr. Nagler, who is back at Parson's. "I'm sick of the coldness and oversimplicity and the lack of interest in a lot of design today. Joe is having more fun. The places he makes are nice to be in."
In turn, Mr. Holtzman found inspiration in the students who had gathered around him. "If I can get a kid to like what I'm doing, it means everything to me," he said. But would he do Camp Nest again next summer? No. He said: "I'm not really very social. I prefer being in rooms by myself."

HEADLINE: France Telecom Names a Chief 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
France Telecom reshuffled its board today, naming Thierry Breton, the chairman of Thomson Multimedia, to run the company and find a way to lighten its crushing $70 billion debt load.
 Board members representing labor unions and employees said that Mr. Breton, who will be both chairman and chief executive, told them he had received assurances that the French government will play a major role in any financial overhaul. The state owns 56 percent of France Telecom. 
 Last week, the French finance minister, Francis Mer, said a new chairman of France Telecom would have until the end of October to present proposals for an overhaul. But board members said Mr. Breton told them he would need about two months to sort out the group's finances and come up with a plan.
Mr. Breton, 47, comes with a track record as a turnaround artist. In five years at the helm of Thomson Multimedia, he made the company a world leader in consumer electronics through brands like RCA that are household names for Americans.
But some analysts say that only immense government aid, and not just a change of management, can right France Telecom. "If the company were not state-owned," Elie Cohen, an academic economist, told a 24-hour news channel, "it would already be in liquidation." He said France Telecom "requires serious treatment," not just "wonder workers."
Mr. Breton's name was floated as a possible new chairman almost immediately after Michel Bon, stepped down on Sept. 12, saying that France Telecom's huge losses prompted him to resign. The telecommunications company began to hemorrhage money in the second half of 2001 and ended the year with a record loss; it reported a loss of 12.2 billion euros ($11.9 billion) for the first half of 2002. 
Mr. Breton's biggest challenge will be to find 15 billion euros to pay the portion of the company's debt, about one-fifth, that comes due in 2003. To ease its cash squeeze, France Telecom cut off financing for its money-losing German wireless affiliate, MobilCom, just after Mr. Bon resigned.
But it postponed a decision on whether to raise cash by asking shareholders to buy $15 billion in new stock. Government officials do not want new stock issued because the share price is already so low -- it has shed more than four-fifths of its value since January.
Today, investors welcomed the nomination of Mr. Breton, bidding up the share price more than 10 percent, to 8.43 euros, after a similar rise Tuesday.
Mr. Breton enjoys an image of a writer and intellectual gadfly. The first of his four novels, "Softwar," published in 1984, described a subterranean war between the United States and the Soviet Union, a story some have interpreted as prefiguring the deployment of software viruses as weapons of conflict. Yet if his performance at Thomson is a guide, Mr. Breton will work quickly and thoroughly to transform France Telecom.
After arriving at Thomson in 1997, Mr. Breton sharply reduced costs and expanded revenue, in part by de-emphasizing hardware like TV sets and video players and emphasizing services like media consulting. During his tenure, hardware fell from supplying 90 percent of Thomson's revenue to just 40 percent.
After the refinancing, Mr. Breton's toughest task at France Telecom will be facing down French unions. France Telecom was carved in the 1990's out of the former telecommunications ministry, and roughly four-fifths of its 148,000 employees in France have civil service status, meaning they are almost impossible to fire or lay off.
Throwing down a gauntlet, the big, Communist CGT union said it was "out of the question to give a blank check to the management of France Telecom."
Many of France's largest unions plan joint mass demonstrations on Thursday to protest against the layoffs and loss of benefits that they foresee if more public services are privatized and exposed to market forces. The protests are expected to cripple the operations of France Telecom, as well as French electric and gas utilities, the postal service, the national rail system, the airports and Air France for the day.
Success by Mr. Breton is crucial to the conservative government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which is struggling with an economic slowdown that has eroded tax revenue and raised the cost of unemployment benefits. Mr. Raffarin wants to sell stakes in other state-owned companies to replenish the treasury. But after the turmoil at France Telecom, he will find it hard to persuade small French shareholders to invest in other privatized enterprises, analysts said.
At a meeting on Tuesday, Thomson's board voted to divide the posts of chairman and chief executive, which Mr. Breton held. The board named Frank E. Dangeard, a lawyer and former investment banker who was Mr. Breton's right-hand man at Thomson, to be chairman, and Charles Dehelly, the No. 3 under Mr. Breton, as chief executive.

 Latin Beat
From West Africa the vibrant music crossed the sea, evolving and throbbing its way out of the Caribbean to New York. Here stars like Machito, Tito Puente (left) and Tito Rodriguez, joined by countless composers, arrangers and dancers, spread the joy of Latin music. Beginning Saturday, the story of salsa will be documented at the Museum of the City of New York with all manner of memorabilia. The show, "Raices: The Roots of Latin Music in New York City," through Jan. 26, is a collaboration between the museum and the nearby Raices Latin Music Museum at Boys and Girls Harbor, a Smithsonian Institution affiliate.

Getting a Life
"There never was yet an uninteresting life," wrote Mark Twain. "Inside the dullest exterior there is a drama, a comedy and a tragedy." In Hartford, the art of biography will be in the spotlight from 9:15 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, in the Wallace Stevens Theater at the Hartford Financial Services Group. The Mark Twain House will sponsor a symposium with speakers and panelists like the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographers Justin Kaplan ("Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain"), William McFeely ("Grant: A Biography") and Edmund Morris ("The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex").

Lost and Found
To the rising Nazi party, they were degenerate artists. As Germany struggled with runaway inflation during the Weimar Republic, a men's clothing manufacturer befriended these artists and swapped suits and coats for their self-portraits. His name was Siegbert Feldberg. In time, like many of the artists, he left Germany, taking his collection, easy to pack and deemed of lesser value by the Nazis because the works were on paper. Included were self-portraits by Max Liebermann, Kathe Kollwitz, Oskar Kokoschka (left), Erich Heckel and other late Impressionists, Expressionists and members of the New Objectivity movement. From Sunday through Dec. 8, the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College, in Chestnut Hill, Mass., documents these artists -- many of them Jews who died in the Holocaust -- with 56 works in "Reclaiming a Lost Generation: German Self-Portraits From the Feldberg Collection, 1923-1933."

New and Bigger
The grand opening and dedication of the new University of Minnesota College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture expansion and building, designed by the acclaimed New York architect Steven Holl, is scheduled for Saturday in Minneapolis. The copper-clad and translucent glass building, Ralph Rapson Hall, bears the name of the longtime (1954-1984) head of the School of Architecture, whose modernist works include the United States embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: Japan Looks to Eastern Russia for Oil 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: KORSAKOV, Russia 

 BODY:
While the United States courts western Russia as a new source of non-OPEC oil, Japan is looking to the Russian Far East, ensuring that Sakhalin Island will become a major supplier of oil and gas to Japan within a decade.
 In the largest foreign direct investment in Russian history, an expected $13 billion is starting to pour into two gas and oil projects here on Sakhalin Island, a Siberian Kuwait of hydrocarbons that begins only 25 miles above Japan's northern tip. 
 "Japan seeks to diversify its energy sources away from the Middle East," said Andy C. Calitz, commercial director for the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, a multinational oil and gas group here that is led by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. "Japanese demand launched Alaska. Japan launched Brunei. Japan launched Australia. And Japan is going to launch Sakhalin." 
In 2003, Sakhalin Energy is to start work on a 560-mile pipeline down the island to feed gas from an offshore operation to what is to be the largest liquefied natural gas plant in the world. From an ice-free terminal a few miles east of here, tankers are to start supplying, in late 2006, a dozen gas terminals around Japan, the world's largest importer of gas by ship. Sakhalin Energy, the first energy producer on the island, has been pumping and exporting oil since 1999.
A group led by Exxon Mobil is developing a Sakhalin offshore section, with the goal of producing oil in about three years. The project's target of 250,000 barrels a day is the equivalent of 6 percent of Japan's daily oil imports. In 2006, Exxon Mobil plans to start building a gas pipeline to Japan, potentially a 1,000-mile, $16 billion undertaking.
"The Japanese see the obvious benefit of having this enormous gas station on their border," said William D. Miller, executive vice president of BP Sakhalin, a BP-led group that plans to drill its first exploratory well in 2004 in a third international block. He said that based on existing information about Sakhalin's offshore oil and gas reserves, "You can compare it to Alaska's North Slope."
With Russian companies saying they can one day supply 10 percent of American oil imports, Lukoil, the largest producer, has gone to Houston promoting a plan to build pipelines and terminals to make Russia's northwestern port of Murmansk an export outlet to the United States. Russian and American government officials and oil company executives have met at the first U.S.-Russia Commercial Energy Summit.
"There could truly be a fabulous energy linkage between the United States and Russia," said Jeffrey Valkar, director of the American Business Center, a promotion office financed by the United States government, in the island's capital, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
But geography and infrastructure dictate that most of Sakhalin's oil, and virtually all of its gas, will go to Asia, largely to Japan.
An oil tanker can go from this port to Tokyo in three days, about one-third the time it takes to go to California. And Asia, eager to escape the $1.50 a barrel "Asia premium" charged by Middle East exporters, is expected to swallow up almost all of Sakhalin's oil exports in coming years. Moreover, Asia is expected to register the world's fastest growth in energy demand in this decade.
As for the gas, there are no liquefied natural gas terminals on the West Coast of North America. Shipments from here are also expected to be largely consumed by Japan, a nation whose industries already pay twice as much for gas as those in Europe and nearly four times as much as those in the United States.
"The price of energy in Japan is probably the highest in the world," Alexander N. Panov, Russia's ambassador to Japan, said in a recent news briefing in Tokyo. "With the cheap gas from Sakhalin, there will be no reason for the high cost of energy. Otherwise, Japan's economy will lose its competitiveness."
The difference in gas prices is caused largely by pipelines. There are no international gas pipelines in Asia. Plans are being drawn up for lines linking Siberian gas deposits to China and South Korea, and for the line linking Sakhalin to Japan.
With Asian countries promoting natural gas as a cleaner alternative to domestic coal or imported oil, Tatsuo Masuda, president of the Asia Pacific Energy Research Center, a regional study group financed by the Japanese government and based in Tokyo, estimated that $100 billion worth of natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas centers would be built in Asia in the next 15 years. To cut carbon dioxide emissions, Japan has set a goal of increasing the natural gas share of Japan's energy consumption to 20 percent in 2010 from 13 percent today. And Russia has the world's largest known natural gas reserves.
For half a century, Sakhalin was as accessible to Japanese investment as the far side of the moon. In the summer of 1945, Soviet troops expelled Japanese soldiers and settlers from the island's southern half, ending four decades of Japanese occupation. To this day, there is no World War II peace treaty between Russia and Japan. Cities in the southern part of the island are dotted with monuments to Soviet heroes who fell fighting "the samurai."
But now, with economists forecasting that Sakhalin could supply 10 percent of Japan's oil and gas imports within a decade, Japan is racing to engage its northern neighbor. Japan's newest consulate is in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. On Oct. 11, the foreign ministers of Japan and Russia are to meet in Moscow to pave the way for a visit by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to Moscow this winter.
"Almost all our oil comes from the Middle East," said Akinari Segawa, correspondent for the new bureau here of NHK, the Japanese government television network. "For security, we want to diversify. Japan has to take gas and oil from Sakhalin."
This summer, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk's dilapidated Soviet-era air terminal was host to a steady stream of business-suited energy company executives from Tokyo and other Asian capitals. With flights from Hokkaido and Seoul increasingly booked, All Nippon Airways is considering starting a flight next spring between Tokyo and Sakhalin.
"We had visits over the summer from all our major buyers -- Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea," said Chris Wilshaw, an executive in Tokyo with Sakhalin Energy's marketing office. "It's like the opening of the North Sea, or the Gulf of Mexico."
Security of supply is often in visitors' minds, Mr. Wilshaw said. Japan, the world's largest importer of natural gas, was unnerved in 2001 when the Tokyo Electric Power Company was unable to import natural gas for six months from Aceh, Indonesia, because of separatist violence there.
Mr. Wilshaw declined to say if any supply contracts had been signed, saying only that he thought "the market commitment" was solid enough for company executives to decide in December to go ahead with $9 billion in planned investments.
In addition to Shell, the Sakhalin group includes Mitsui & Company and the Mitsubishi Corporation. "This project is anchored in Japan," Mr. Calitz, the group's commercial director, said.
With Exxon Mobil planning to build a pipeline capable of delivering 800 million cubic feet of gas a day to Japan, the company's local unit, Exxon Neftegas Project Services, opened a marketing unit in Tokyo in late August. In the production venture, Exxon Neftegas Ltd. is the operating partner of a group that includes a Japanese company, the Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Company, two Russian companies and an Indian company. In the pipeline venture, Exxon Mobil's partner is the Japan Sakhalin Pipeline Company, whose shareholders include the Itochu Corporation, the Marubeni Corporation and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company.
"Diversity of supply is an important issue for energy buyers world-wide, and this pipeline would introduce an abundant, reliable and competitive source of energy for Japanese gas buyers," said Jack King, who is in charge of the new gas marketing office.
With about $2 billion scheduled to be spent on development on this island every year until the end of the decade, Sakhalin's 591,000 residents are bracing for a major boom.
"Come next summer, and we are going to hit a logjam of people -- cargo, airplanes, hotels, you name it," predicted James R. Sexton, an American business consultant who has worked here for the last decade. "It's exciting times, just like Alaska was decades ago."

HEADLINE: War, Murder and Suicide: A Year's Toll Is 1.6 Million 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Violence kills more than 1.6 million people each year, and suicide claims almost as many lives as war and homicide combined, according to a new report by the World Health Organization that experts say is the first comprehensive documentation of the problem of global violence.
 The 346-page report, to be released Thursday in Brussels by Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the director general of the health organization, reviews thousands of studies to catalog homicide, suicide and armed conflict, as well as violence against women, the elderly and children. It found that violence accounts for 14 percent of all deaths among men, and 7 percent among women. 
 The study challenges health ministers to view violence as a pressing public health problem, and its release is timed to coincide with a new campaign by the World Health Organization to promote violence-prevention efforts.
"Violence leaves no continent, no country and few communities untouched," the report says. "Although it appears everywhere, violence is not an inevitable part of the human condition, nor is it an intractable problem of modern life that cannot be overcome by human determination and ingenuity."
Violence, the study found, is tied to income; the vast majority of violence-related deaths occurred in low-income countries. Like other health problems, violence is not distributed evenly; men accounted for more than three-quarters of all homicides, with the highest rates among men ages 15 to 29.
Police statistics are a poor way of estimating violence in other nations, the study found, because in many countries victims are afraid to report violence. In South Africa, for example, a survey showed that 50 to 80 percent of victims of violence received medical treatment for an injury without going to the police.
The study found that violence against women by their male partners occurs in all countries, regardless of economic class and religion. Data from Australia, the United States, Canada, Israel and South Africa show that 40 to 70 percent of female murder victims were killed by their husbands or boyfriends. 
But the situation is not the same for male murder victims. In the United States, for instance, only 4 percent of men murdered from 1976 to 1996 were killed by their wives, ex-wives or girlfriends.
Violence, particularly war, seems to beget more violence, the study found. "It's a cycle," said Dr. Etienne Krug, the lead author of the report. "We have evidence that after wars, the levels of assault and violence remain higher than before," in part because there are more guns available, and young men have been trained to fight.
The report's main premise -- that violence can be studied as a health problem and prevented in much the same way as disease -- is not new. It originated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, which in 1983 opened a violence epidemiology branch to track patterns of violence -- a move that was regarded as strange at the time.
"We were viewed as weirdos on the very fringes of public health," said Dr. Mark L. Rosenberg, a former C.D.C. official who helped lead that effort. But in the two decades since, he said, programs to prevent suicide, youth violence and child sexual abuse are now commonplace.
Though there is no definitive proof that such programs contribute to an overall decline in violence, he said, "public health measures are being applied, and a number of them have been found to be effective."
Dr. Krug said: "Violence is predictable, and therefore preventable. We can study it, just like disease, understand the causes, and act on these causes."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 3 about the decoding of the malaria parasite's genome and an unrelated graph that day comparing worldwide causes of death by violence and disease showed differing figures for annual deaths from malaria. Statistics for the disease vary widely because records are inadequate. The estimate of 2.7 million annual deaths was the upper range provided by the genome researchers. (That figure was repeated in The Week in Review on Oct. 6.) The World Health Organization gives a more conservative estimate -- 1 million dead a year, most of them children in Africa.

HEADLINE: 3 Fed Officials Say Rates Are Low Enough 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Three Federal Reserve Bank presidents said today that interest rates were low enough to keep the economy expanding through a tepid recovery.
 A 41-year low in the Fed's benchmark overnight bank rate will ensure a "plodding recovery," said Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. 
 J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, said that people should not "expect too much from monetary policy to steer the economy." And Robert T. Parry, president of the bank in San Francisco, said the current level of interest rates would give the economy the lift it needed without inflation. 
In separate speeches today, the three Fed officials, none of whom currently vote when the Federal Open Market Committee sets rates, signaled that while business spending on new equipment needed to increase, the 11 rate reductions since the start of last year needed time to work through the economy.
"The Fed has been trying to facilitate the transition from recession to recovery by aggressively cutting the Fed funds rate," Mr. Guynn told a Rotary Club in Columbus, Ga. "Even with the current accommodative stance of monetary policy, the other thing we need right now is patience."
Mr. Guynn said he did not think that lower interest rates would cure problems like the decline in investor confidence and excess capacity, which both appear to be hampering the recovery.
The Fed will be watching, he said, to see whether businesses are investing more and whether inventories are rising to meet demand. 
"I think the most likely path over the next year or so will be one of moderate growth," Mr. Guynn said. "I realize this may not sound so great, compared to the outsized gains we witnessed in the late 1990's, but it ought to be a good bit more sustainable." 
Mr. Parry said in a speech in San Francisco that there was still "a lot of uncertainty about the strength and durability of the expansion." But he added that the current level of interest rates was appropriate and likely "to promote the economy's expansion while maintaining the favorable rates of core inflation we've seen latterly." 
While Mr. Broaddus said companies were "pretty pessimistic," he pointed to a "few glimmers of light," like a second-quarter increase in investment in software and equipment.
"All this suggests that business firms may now be positioned to loosen their purse strings a little," he said, "even if the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace." He addressed the Baltimore Security Analysts Society. 
A decline in consumer confidence, Mr. Broaddus said, has not had a "strongly negative impact on household spending." 
Mr. Guynn was less upbeat, noting that consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, had "moderated considerably." "The latest numbers," he said, "suggest that consumers are adjusting to lower expectations of real income gains." 
All three policy makers said a lack of job creation, war with Iraq and a sustained decline in stocks could further undermine the economy.

HEADLINE: New Details on Deaths of 8 Japanese Seized by North Korea 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: FUKUOKA, Japan, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Japanese diplomats fresh from a visit to North Korea provided the first detailed accounting today of the deaths of eight of their compatriots kidnapped by the North Koreans beginning in the late 1970's.
 The diplomats said the North Korean government had also told them that a ninth missing Japanese woman was alive and had been married to an American military defector for two decades. 
 According to the account, the eight died of causes ranging from suicide to automobile accidents and heart disease. This went beyond the vague blanket explanation of "disasters and natural causes" that North Korea provided two weeks ago when Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was visiting. 
Four additional abducted Japanese citizens found to be still living in North Korea have reportedly expressed eagerness to see their Japanese relatives, the officials said. But several have married in North Korea and have family there, and had reservations about being separated.
The new information in the 13 cases has been greeted with widespread disbelief in Japan, and appears to have aggravated the political headaches caused for Mr. Koizumi by the diplomatic breakthrough with his long-isolated neighbor. A strong initial boost in public opinion polls after his one-day meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has since been subsumed by persistent questions about the handling of the missing persons issue.
News of the American military defector, meanwhile, provided a little more detail about a man the United States government knew to be living in North Korea.
The Japanese diplomats said North Korean officials had told them that one of the Japanese abductees, Hitomi Soga, had married Charles Robert Jenkins, of Northampton, N.C., who defected to North Korea in the 1960's. Ms. Soga was abducted from a secluded Japanese island while shopping with her mother in August 1978, and married two years later, they said. The couple have two daughters, 19 and 17, both students at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. Efforts to reach the Jenkins family in North Carolina today were unsuccessful.
As for the abductees reported dead, their relatives held widely broadcast news conferences this evening angrily denouncing the North Korean explanations as lies. 
"My first impression is that the facts were hastily made up, and that they were just piling up lies," said Takuya Yokota, the younger brother of Megumi Yokota. Ms. Yokota was kidnapped in 1977 at age 13, and the North Korean authorities said she killed herself at a Pyongyang mental hospital while undergoing treatment for depression.
"This has just reaffirmed for me how horrible a country North Korea is," added Ms. Yokota's mother, Sakie.
A teenage girl in North Korea is said to be Ms. Yokota's surviving daughter, and the diplomats returned with some of the girl's hair for DNA tests.
"I don't believe it at all," said Kayoko Arimoto, whose daughter Keiko disappeared while studying in London in 1983 when she was 23. "It just can't be that they all died in disasters and so on, with their remains washed away. It's a made-up story."
North Korean authorities said Keiko Arimoto died on the same day as another of the abductees, Toru Ishioka, whom she reportedly married in Pyongyang. The simultaneous deaths fed suspicions here that the couple had been executed.
Japanese officials said today that according to North Korean authorities, the two died in a home accident in 1988, along with their young daughter. Gas from a coal heater poisoned the three while they were sleeping, the officials said. 
The controversy has presented the Japanese government with a difficult choice: whether to favor increasingly impassioned popular sentiments about the abductees, or to pursue rapprochement with North Korea, with which it has never had diplomatic relations.
Today, despite the renewed outcry over the missing persons, Mr. Koizumi vowed to proceed with his normalization efforts. "They will start as planned," he told reporters, referring to diplomatic talks scheduled for next week. "North Korea appears to have responded sincerely to the investigative team."
Mr. Koizumi has said he is determined to proceed because he believes that Japan's diplomacy can help lower tensions in one of the most heavily armed regions of the world and that it can encourage North Korea to open its economy and reconcile with its neighbors.
North Korea acknowledged the kidnappings during Mr. Koizumi's visit last month, and issued a rare apology. According to Pyongyang, the abductions were carried out in order to train North Korean spies in Japanese customs and to use the abductees' identities.
In addition to revealing the causes of death, North Korean officials told visiting Japanese diplomats that one of their country's agents had been executed for his role in the kidnappings, and that another was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1988.

HEADLINE: Gurkenhobel: It Slices, Dices, Causes a Fuss 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The German elite may be busy talking about damaged relations with the Bush administration after the narrow election in September, but the tabloids have moved on to the case of the Gurkenhobel -- the cucumber slicer that has caused a new set of sharp insults to fly between eastern and western Germans. 
 Thirteen years after the fall of the wall and the investment of nearly $1 trillion into the east, much still divides Ossies and Wessies, and the vitriol is never more acid than between one Ossie who has made it in the west and another who hasn't. 
 Gertraud and Helmut Weyhe, easterners, live in Johanngeorgenstadt, in Saxony, but went to a health spa in the west, in the Bavarian town of Bad Fussen. There, for 25 euros ($24.50), they bought a plastic kitchen utensil with a steel blade from Horst Giessmann, 68, the manufacturer, who sold his products from a stand. 
Once home, they didn't like their Gurkenhobel, so they mailed it back to Mr. Giessmann, who wrote them a blistering letter with their refund, misspelling their surname. Whenever he gets the rare complaint, he said, it's always from the former eastern zone. In the past, easterners would have been ecstatic to buy such an extremely valuable product "under the table." 
Now, he continued, "from the Ossies who benefited exclusively from the fall of the wall, there is a kind of complaint hysteria," so much so that businesses would contribute voluntarily to the reconstruction of the wall, "preferably twice as high." 
It was Western money to pension funds that made the Weyhes' spa stay possible, Mr. Giessmann wrote. "I recommend you go back to using your former East German scrap because you cannot cope with the demands of a valuable, high-quality product." He then said that because the box was damaged, "we are deducting 50 cents for the package." 
The press went mad with the story, especially the tabloid Bild, which got a "four-star chef," Eckard Witzigmann, to test the Gurkenhobel. "The device fulfills its purpose, but not in a particularly professional way," he said. "I'd rather use a sharp knife." 
Ossies were outraged, Wessies embarrassed. 
Mr. Giessmann finally admitted that he's an Ossie, too, having moved to Gerolzhofen, in Bavaria, after the wall fell. The mayor of the little town of 7,500, Hartmut Brauer, apologized to the Weyhes and all Ossies. "I couldn't believe that an inhabitant of my town could say something like that," Mr. Brauer said. 
Mr. Giessmann, somewhat chastened by the furor, finally told ARD television: "I'd like to apologize to the people in the east. It was not my intention to attack them."

HEADLINE: More Economic Turbulence 

 BODY:
How unfortunate that Tuesday's 347-point bounce in the Dow Jones industrial average did not occur a day earlier. It might have made the third quarter slightly less painful for some investors. As it was, the quarter, which ended on Monday, was the worst for stocks since the 1987 crash, meaning that Americans will see significant declines in their retirement accounts when they receive their quarterly statements. Even with Tuesday's rebound, the Dow is still down 20 percent for the year, while the market as a whole, which resumed its losing ways yesterday, is closing in on its third consecutive year of declines. No wonder many investors are throwing in the towel. 
 A lot of uncertainty has been generated by all the talk of war, but the main reason for Wall Street's dismal performance is skepticism about the sustainability of the anemic recovery that began last year. The biggest drag is the inability of businesses to boost profits. Companies are still suffering the aftermath of the 1990's overinvestment binge. To cite one dramatic case, only 3 percent of fiber-optic cable laid by telecom companies is actually being used. Companies are now loath to spend on capital projects or workers. For his part, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, frets that excess capacity across a number of industries has deprived companies of their pricing power. 
 Until quite recently, only consumers have been upbeat. Indeed, the lowest inflation and interest rates in decades have made this a great time to be a consumer, and to some extent robust retail spending and a healthy housing market have compensated for the stagnation in the business sector. But businesses and consumers cannot indefinitely pretend to inhabit separate economies. Consumer confidence is even now beginning to fray, and is likely to continue doing so if unemployment rises further and talk of war intensifies. 
There are no easy prescriptions for jump-starting the economy, and the United States is getting little help from overseas. Europe and Japan, suffering from an even more protracted slump, continue to look to America to lead the way. This has kept the dollar relatively strong, which helps explain the nation's soaring trade deficits and adds to deflationary fears.
If it weren't for the debate over a war with Iraq, the economy would probably be the leading topic on the campaign trail. Those third-quarter retirement account statements may soon give it greater prominence.

HEADLINE: Spano Proposes 31.7% Increase In County Tax For Westchester 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, today proposed a 31.7 percent increase in the amount the county raises through property taxes, the largest increase since 1968 and the second since Mr. Spano took office. 
 Mr. Spano, a Democrat who was first elected in 1998 and once pledged to cut the county's share of the property tax, said the increase was needed to cover the sharply rising costs of Medicaid and other state-mandated programs. But some critics have pointed to Mr. Spano's own spending increases as a contributing factor. 
 The proposal, if approved by the Westchester County Board of Legislators, would be the second-largest county property-tax increase in Westchester history. It would fall just short of the 32 percent increase in 1968 to raise money for the county's share of a newly enacted Medicaid program. 
For a typical homeowner in the county, Mr. Spano's proposal would mean an increase in the county property-tax rate to $4.59 per $1,000 of property value next year, from $3.83. Officials caution that these are average rates and that actual rates vary widely by municipality. But based on these rates, a homeowner with a house valued at $500,000 could see a tax increase of about $380 a year.
The county tax is only a share of the total property taxes on a home. Depending on the municipality, county property taxes account for 15 percent to 20 percent of the average tax bill of a homeowner. The remaining taxes pay for school districts, as well as city, town and village operations.
Several county legislators, both Democrat and Republican, said today that they were unlikely to support such a large increase. "I don't see anybody really wanting to vote for a 31 percent tax increase," said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic legislator. "It's huge. It's horrific. I think we're all shocked looking at that."
George Oros, the Republican minority leader, accused Mr. Spano of creating a budget mess with chronic overspending and then trying to blame Albany for the problem. Mr. Oros said he would demand cuts in county programs and services rather than accept the 31 percent tax increase. "I think it's an outrage to even propose something like that," he said. 
Mr. Spano announced his tax proposal during a news conference in which he largely blamed state lawmakers and officials for passing on fiscal burdens that have crushed the county's budget of more than $1 billion. Westchester officials are projecting a budget gap of more than $100 million next year. 
"This is the perfect storm," Mr. Spano said. "This is 9/11, this is Albany sending mandates, this is the economy all coming together at one time and it has impacted everybody, but it has been exacerbated for county governments throughout New York."
For instance, Mr. Spano said, Westchester's share of Medicaid expenses alone will increase by $36.3 million next year to $207 million. In comparison, he said the cost of all county-run programs and services, including parks, the bus system and the Police Department, would amount to about $96 million. 
Mr. Spano, who was elected last year to a second four-year term, had pledged to achieve a 15 percent reduction in property taxes by the end of his first term. 
But in his first three years, his proposed cuts added up to only 7.3 percent; the actual cuts adopted by the County Legislature amounted to 8 percent. And last year, Mr. Spano proposed a 9.5 percent increase, which would have effectively erased those cuts. The Legislature adopted an increase just under 4 percent. 
Mr. Spano said that state-mandated programs would cost the county a total of $626.7 million next year. Of that amount, $46.3 million would come from operating funds left over from 2001, and $118.1 million from sales tax revenue for 2003. The proposed property-tax increase would raise the remaining $462.3 million. The tax increase would raise $111.2 million more than what was raised this year.
Mr. Spano also renewed his calls today for raising the sales tax rate by one percentage point -- an increase of 14.8 percent.
Westchester now has a 6.75 percent sales tax outside the cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers, which impose sales taxes ranging from 7.75 percent to 8.25 percent.
Even as Mr. Spano was blaming Albany for the budget problems, Gov. George E. Pataki was seeking to defuse similar criticism from county leaders across the state. Mr. Pataki proposed new legislation today that would provide the counties, including New York City, with about $172 million in relief. 
The bill would let counties keep state Medicaid funds advanced to them in previous years that they are required to pay back. The money was originally supposed to help counties weather cash-flow problems associated with changes made to clinics for mentally ill, mentally retarded and disabled people. 
Several county executives and the Republican leader of the Senate endorsed the plan, but it was unclear if it would be acceptable to the Democratic majority in the Assembly. Campaign aides to the Democratic candidate for governor, H. Carl McCall, have charged that the property-tax crisis can be laid partly at Mr. Pataki's feet, since much of the spiraling cost of Medicaid is caused in part by new programs he and lawmakers adopted.

HEADLINE: An Israeli's Sorrowful Rule Over a Sullen Nablus 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: NABLUS, West Bank, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The Israeli colonel, the new master of this bruised Palestinian city, ordered his jeep to the curb today and leapt out to intercept two Palestinian teenagers walking by. He wanted to know where they were coming from, what they had in their book bags, what their identification cards revealed. 
 "These are two innocent boys coming home from school," he reported, climbing back into the jeep. "How will you know if you don't check them? How will they not hate you if you check them?" 
 "This," he continued, "is the daily dilemma, not of a brigade commander, but of a soldier. There is no solution." 
Lacking a solution to that dilemma, the colonel, the commander of the infantry brigade that is now warden to this city of 200,000, summed up the high price he is demanding of all Nablus for any violence planned by some of its residents: "They will suffer until they understand," he said, arguing that the society itself was complicit in terrorism. "My job is to stop suicide bombers." 
It has been just over 100 days since Israel, after a suicide bomber killed 19 people on a Jerusalem bus, seized control of Nablus, along with most of the rest of the West Bank not already under its command. It acted under a new policy of taking back Palestinian-controlled territory "as long as terror continues." 
Israeli officials say that suicide bombers and bad Palestinian leadership have left them no choice. "When they will say 'enough,' they can live in peace and quiet," the colonel said. Palestinians say that Israel is provoking violence and seeking to destroy their governing institutions, economy, and dream of nationhood. 
Nowhere has the new military control been more stringent than here, the Palestinian financial capital, which Israeli officials now call the center of Palestinian terrorism. A dismal status quo has settled over Nablus. "Life here is miserable," the colonel said. "This is the price. They went back more than 20 years." 
In an effort to explain its mission in Nablus, the Israeli Army invited three foreign journalists, including an American, to accompany the colonel today on a tour. It asked at the end of the tour that the commander not be identified by name. 
No successful Palestinian attack has originated here in two months, the colonel said, a record he attributes to the pervasive Israeli military presence rather than to a collapse in militant motivation. He said his men had stopped more than 15 suicide bombers and uncovered five weapons laboratories.
At times, the commander, a lean 40-year-old with a shaved head and wraparound sunglasses, seemed to suggest that motivation may have increased, so far. "When you look at this through Palestinian eyes, you can understand why they hate us so much," he said, watching other schoolchildren pick their way around a tank and soldiers in battle gear.
Asked how he thought continued military pressure would change that attitude, the commander, a recent graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, spoke of long-term social shifts, of a new Palestinian generation educated for peace, not violence. 
For now, the army has cut Nablus off from the surrounding villages, and it has sliced the city itself in half, throwing up head-high berms and placing patrols of soldiers and armored vehicles across the main roads. Most days, the city is under curfew. The army enforces the curfew intermittently, unexpectedly, abruptly sending tanks storming downtown. Commerce has resumed, at an irregular trickle; schooling was conducted furtively, in home, until the army permitted most schools to reopen a few days ago. 
Palestinians call the situation worse than before the Oslo peace accords, which prompted Israel over the last decade to cede control of some areas, like Nablus, to Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Before Oslo, the Israelis also bore responsibility for education and other aspects of civil administration, tasks it now leaves to a patchwork of nonprofit organizations and staggering Palestinian institutions. 
In the Balata refugee camp in Nablus early this evening, hours after the Israeli army tour ended, dozens of men and boys rushed up to scan a list stretching across 11 pages, taped to a storefront. Posted by a United Nations relief agency, it showed who was eligible for how much relief for damage done to their homes or livelihoods by the latest Israeli incursions into the camp. The amounts were generally $50 to $60, sometimes as high as $200 -- never enough, one man grumbled.
Ghassan W. Shakah, the city's mayor, is praised by Israeli officials as a "positive" force. He said he opposed suicide bombing. But he scoffed at the idea that making life miserable would put a stop to it. 
"We have to think about the logic," he said. "The people like me, who are 50 to 60 years old, when you put pressure on them, they use their minds. But when you put pressure on 17-, 18-year-old boys, you create bitterness and anger."
"I don't believe this is pressure to calm down," he said. "This is pressure to build a bomb and commit suicide." That view was echoed by young people interviewed here today.
To the mayor, the source of Palestinian violence was Israeli occupation, embodied in the new military presence and in the settlements spreading over the nearby hills. 
Mayor Shakah, who dreamed just three years ago that his ancient home, built by Romans by the remains of a Canaanite city, would rank with Paris, London or Washington, says he now spends his time negotiating with the army to permit utility workers to move about to fix power lines or to permit trucks to pick up the tons of garbage generated here each day.
He said he was cutting taxes and utility fees by 30 percent across the board in hope that more people would pay them. "It's a disaster," he said of the Israeli operation. "Our society is destroyed."
Two 10-year-old boys were killed by Israeli gunfire in separate incidents on Monday, and an Israeli soldier was shot dead by Palestinians. Yet there has been little armed resistance to this Israeli operation, compared to the fierce gun battles that marked an incursion here this spring. Then, in about a month, 81 Palestinians died. So far in this operation, the mayor said, 10 or 11 Palestinians have been killed. 
Along garbage-strewn streets, their surfaces scored or crushed by tank treads, relentless life is finding its way back, through the chinks, to the surface. With the tanks and soldiers out of sight, shopkeepers roll up their shutters and trade resumes. Muhammad Saed, 69, a barber, said he had managed 3 haircuts today at about $3 apiece, compared with 12 to 20 before, when villagers could still reach Nablus. Several of his mirrors had been shattered or holed by gunfire.
Some taxis ply the streets, dropping passengers to walk around the berms and catch another ride on the far side. Some trucks are permitted past the checkpoint into the city, then are repeatedly stopped and checked again once inside. 
The Israeli colonel said that even as he worked to make life hard here, he was also softening the blows by letting schools and factories reopen. 
He described a four-part strategy to choke what he called terrorism's "bottlenecks": stopping money from reaching terrorist groups; blocking potential ingredients for weapons, including agricultural products like fertilizer; pressuring the families of those suspected of planning attacks by visiting them at night, arresting some members and threatening destruction of homes; and pressuring the entire society. 
"Just like any other war, this is not a clean war," he said. "This is a dirty war. You cannot judge it in humanitarian terms."
At times, the colonel sounded regretful, as when he watched a group of schoolgirls scurry away across a blasted, rubble-strewn landscape. "You see those girls -- they are frightened to death," he said. "See how they run. They can't go home because I'm standing here." He said he would not ask his troops to check them, to avoid raising the tension here, and he quickly climbed back into his jeep and moved on.
But the commander envisioned no prompt end to the struggle. "We're in the middle of a hundred-years' war," he said. "That's what I tell my soldiers."

HEADLINE: Pataki Travels Around, Promising Money 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: HAVERSTRAW, N.Y., Oct. 2 

 BODY:
No one pays much attention to this little village hard by the Hudson anymore. Once it produced all the bricks for Manhattan's brownstones. Now it is just a crumbling town on a shore of ruined piers and rusty fuel tanks, squeezed between a power plant and a quarry. The last light factory closed in 1995.
 It is just the sort of place Gov. George E. Pataki is visiting these days with a check in hand. This afternoon, with the river at his back and local politicians at his side, the governor promised to deliver state money to build the infrastructure for a huge 800-unit housing development on which the village has pinned its hopes. 
 "The state is going to help," the governor said as a small crowd of local officials erupted in applause. "We are going to be putting $3 million into the village of Haverstraw to help with this plan to revitalize and reclaim the riverfront."
The governor's visit to Haverstraw is just one of dozens of similar campaign stops he has made over the last month to announce grants, loans, tax credits and other state programs intended to spur the economy.
Many of Mr. Pataki's announcements had made routine state aid for local governments sound like something special. Most do not involve a great deal of money from the $88 billion state budget. Taken together, however, the announcements are part of a strategy by Mr. Pataki to fashion himself into something like an economic Johnny Appleseed, traveling the state and sprinkling magic coinage on barren places.
In the budget, Mr. Pataki controls hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of economic development grants and various pools of bonds for capital projects that he can allocate as he likes, one of the advantages of being the incumbent.
Today the governor visited Greenport, on Long Island, to promise local officials $1 million for the renovation of two piers and the construction of a 61-slip floating dock marina in Mitchell Park. After Haverstraw, he choppered up the river to Poughkeepsie to dole out $625,000 for a new police and fire headquarters.
In September alone, the governor made 32 similar trips to struggling towns, unveiling everything from $14 million in grants and loans to upgrade the ferry service in Rochester to $300,000 for rehabilitating a park in Sleepy Hollow. He has made commitments worth at least $167 million, from both state and federal funds.
He has also visited 11 towns where his administration has reconfigured special business zones -- known as Empire Zones -- to allow more businesses to take advantage of a lower tax burden. In each case, he has taken credit for creating scores of jobs as the businesses promised to expand in return for the tax breaks. 
Even though the Democrats who control the Assembly conceived of the Empire Zones two years ago, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has embraced them as if they were his own idea and urged their expansion in the last budget. 
The upbeat headlines in local newspapers Mr. Pataki receives each time he makes an announcement like the one in Haverstraw are among the main tools he has to fight the charges from his opponents that he has done too little for the economy during his two terms in office. He has claimed to have created more than 2,500 jobs just through rejiggering the Empire Zones in the last month.
His focus in the last month has been to upstate cities with decaying economies -- places where the Democratic nominee, H. Carl McCall, and the Independence Party candidate, Tom Golisano, might find it easier to pick up votes.
Mr. Pataki visited Rochester twice, once to announce $30 million for biomedical research at the University of Rochester Medical Center and another time to promise $14 million for the Fast Ferry Project, which will improve service to Canada.
The governor has also visited Syracuse several times in the last month with promises of aid. This week he pledged $7 million to build two parking garages in a decrepit part of downtown Syracuse as part of a bid to prevent large insurance companies from leaving. 
The governor's aides maintain he has not timed these grants to coincide with the election. He has made similar announcements throughout his tenure in office, they said.
"The governor has been fighting for every job that we can get, and that's especially important right now with the economy in the state that it's in," the governor's chief spokesman, Michael McKeon, said. "The governor believes we need to redouble our efforts."
Much of the aid Mr. Pataki has been distributing in the last month is coming out of $300 million he controls out of a $600 million bond issue in the current budget. The two legislative leaders control the rest of the bond money.
For tiny villages like Haverstraw, the governor's visits pay back big political dividends, even if the amount he promises is relatively small. Martin Ginsburg, a Westchester County developer, is planning a $250 million project that will turn Haverstraw's waterfront into a luxurious place to live, with a promenade, restaurants and a new station for the ferry to the commuter trains across the river.
Mr. Pataki is contributing just $3 million for road improvements and other minor public works. Still, he was treated like royalty in this village of 13,000 where Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1, and where the main street feels more like Puerto Rico than New England, lined with Latin American restaurants and Spanish shops.
Still, Ramon Soto, the editor of the local Spanish-language newspaper, said the governor enjoys enormous popularity in Haverstraw."The people like him," he said. "They'll vote for him."
Mayor Francis J. Wassmer, a Republican, put it more bluntly as he thanked the governor. 
"You have been the first governor who paid any attention to our community," he said.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: FALLEN STAR; 
From Enron Fast Track To Total Derailment

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Those who know Andrew S. Fastow, the man at the center of the Enron scandal, say they often got the sense that he had something to prove.
 He was the boy at New Providence High School in New Jersey who always seemed to be running for something; he successfully lobbied to be named the first high school student to sit on the state's board of education. At Tufts University, he pressed college administrators to create a major in Chinese studies so he could put something unique on his resume. 
 Before Enron collapsed last December, he was also credited with being the financial wizard who propped up the company's finances. And he created some of the off-balance-sheet partnerships that seemed to make Enron's debt magically disappear. 
For such financial derring-do, Mr. Fastow was named chief financial officer of one of the world's largest corporations before he was 37. And three years ago, he was hailed by CFO magazine as one of the nation's most innovative executives.
But this morning, the federal task force investigating Enron's collapse filed a criminal complaint here accusing Mr. Fastow of defrauding investors by persistently falsifying financial statements through the use of a series of complex partnerships.
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its own enforcement action seeking to recover millions of dollars of gains from Mr. Fastow. The agency accused Mr. Fastow, 40, of personally profiting from manipulating Enron's books and misleading investors. Mr. Fastow's lawyers said he did nothing wrong and that his actions were approved by superiors.
Congressmen and other critics, however, long ago labeled him "fast Andy" and the "Betty Crocker of cooked books." People who grew up with him judged him as extremely ambitious and recall how he quarreled with high school teachers over his grades.
Former Enron colleagues have called him prickly and a bully. They say that during angry bouts, he was known to leave profanity-laced messages on the voice mail of colleagues.
He could also be charming and generous, former colleagues said. He would reward employees with vacation travel when they met goals, for example, and defended them in Enron's competitive culture.
But in recent years, he had grown more intense about his work as he rose at Enron. Despite a close relationship to Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as the company's president and chief executive in August 2001, former colleagues said he often complained that his contributions to Enron were overlooked and that he was poorly compensated compared with other high-level executives.
"I think people respected what Andy did, he just didn't think people respected it enough," said one former executive who worked with him.
Now, Mr. Fastow is recognized for helping bring about one of the biggest bankruptcies in history.
Andrew Stuart Fastow grew up in New Providence, N.J., a tiny middle-class suburb of New York where he went to school with the children of scientists from Bell Laboratories.
Friends and neighbors remember that his parents -- Carl Fastow, a grocery store executive, and Joan, who later became a real estate broker -- were serious about educating their three boys. The middle son, Andy, was outgoing, ambitious and a "Star Wars" fan who decorated his room with Chewbacca, Obi-Wan and other characters from the movie.
Andy Fastow joined the debate team even in elementary school, friends say, and through high school his passion was politics.
"High school politics wasn't a big deal at our school but it was a big deal to him," said Mark Liss, a classmate at New Providence High who beat him in a race for class president. "I remember how depressed he was; student government meant everything to him."
A year later, Andy Fastow was elected president of the student council. He was also part of a group that lobbied the New Jersey Board of Education to name a high school student to its board, then succeeded in having himself chosen as the first person to fill the job.
Dwight Boud, who taught English at New Providence High, described Andy Fastow as a "wheeler-dealer" who even negotiated to get his grades changed.
Mr. Boud recalled: "He would say, 'Can't we do something about this? I didn't think it was a 'B.' " 
He did not graduate at the top of his class, but Andy Fastow beat out the class valedictorian in an essay contest to decide who would be the graduation speaker.
While many classmates expected him to end up on Capitol Hill, any political ambitions seemed to have disappeared at Tufts, where he majored in Chinese and economics. He took Chinese because he thought it would "help a career in business," according to Gordon Andrew, his spokesman.
At Tufts, he also met his future wife, Lea Weingarten, the heiress to a Houston real estate fortune. They were married in 1985, a year after moving to Chicago to enter a training program at Continental Bank. That same year, while Mr. Fastow was being trained in the Houston office of Continental Bank, he was reprimanded by a superior for talking to colleagues about using insider information to make a profit trading in the stock of the Coastal Corporation, one of the bank's major clients. Mr. Andrew questioned the accuracy of the reported incident.
The episode did not seem to affect his career. While at Continental, he attended night courses on his way to earning an M.B.A. at the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University. And he eventually joined the bank's corporate finance group, where he worked on bundling loans and selling them to outside investors, an innovative form of financing that Continental pioneered.
His real break came in 1990, when Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, joined Enron and began assembling a small group to create a "gas bank" to finance struggling energy producers. Mr. Fastow, contacted by an executive recruiter, was one of the first employees he hired.
At Enron, Mr. Fastow, then 29, became known as one of "Skilling's boys," a group of young energy marketers and financiers who seemed destined to lead the company.
Mr. Fastow became adept at creating complex partnerships to finance new projects. He worked on a series of partnerships -- including one called Joint Energy Development Investment Inc. and known by its acronym, Jedi, one of several partnerships named for "Star Wars" characters.
He also helped manage the company's balance sheet troubles. As early as 1995, for instance, when the credit ratings agencies complained that Enron's income was rising but cash appeared low because the company was booking long-term profits, Mr. Fastow began bundling assets and selling them to outside investors. The process, called monetizing assets, would become crucial to the company's future financing strategies.
Despite this, according to former co-workers, some of "Skilling's boys" dismissed his work, saying he did not build a business or create new markets, which is what Enron was all about.
In 1996, Mr. Fastow got the chance to build a business when he was put in charge of a new retail energy unit. But after a few months he was replaced; some former executives said he was too slow to even articulate his strategy, much less execute it.
It was the low point of his career, some colleagues said. Distraught, he asked Mr. Skilling, whom he considered a mentor, whether he had wrecked his future with the company, according to one former high-level executive. Mr. Skilling, who a year later was named president of Enron, assured Mr. Fastow that he was still in good standing and that his expertise was really in finance.
Determined to prove himself all over again, Mr. Fastow returned to the finance department in 1996 to help the company raise money and manage its balance sheet. He developed a reputation for bullying and threatening bankers, former executives said, and helped create elaborate partnerships to finance growth.
Not long after that, according to the complaint, Mr. Fastow and others "devised a scheme to defraud Enron and its shareholders" through transactions that would let the company appear to cut its debt and increase its profits in ways that violated accounting regulations. Mr. Fastow and the others also used their positions as Enron executives and partners in the partnerships "as a means secretly and unlawfully to generate millions of dollars for themselves and others."
Enron chose Mr. Fastow as its chief financial officer in 1998, but only after considering several outside candidates. Former colleagues said he thought the process suggested a lack of confidence in him.
"I remember seeing him in his office that day," said one former finance executive. "He was just staring at his desk, fixated."
Once he got the job, Mr. Fastow's deals grew larger and more complex. The company began investing in new businesses and financing new operations, domestically and abroad. Much of the money came from deals that Mr. Fastow developed with the help of bankers and accountants, former colleagues say.
"The complexity of the deals was mind-boggling," one former executive said. "During the year-end there were dramatic shortages of cash, so we'd go to the cupboard and find any asset with value and go to the banks."
In 1999, to speed the process, Mr. Fastow and other executives asked the board to approve the creation of a partnership called LJM, and approve Mr. Fastow's role as general partner. LJM would let Enron effectively operate a bank inside the company, allowing it to quickly do deals and better manage finances.
The board waived the company's conflict of interest rules after Mr. Fastow and Mr. Skilling agreed to add controls to monitor the dealings between Enron and LJM. 
There were other partnerships, too; some, like Chewco and Obi-1, with names similar to "Star Wars" characters. Enron needed cash to meet earnings targets, pay for new businesses -- and pay bonuses to executives.
Federal prosecutors, however, said in their indictment that many of the deals arranged by Mr. Fastow were "self-dealing transactions" involving family members and friends, and were intended "to enrich himself and others" directly or by pumping up Enron's stock price while they sold a large number of shares.
A member of Enron's board testified to Congress that Mr. Fastow had said he made $45 million from the LJM partnerships. Trading records also show that he sold about $23 million in stock over the last few years.
In recent years, he bought a Porsche 911 and a Mercedes-Benz 320e, and started building an 11,000-square-foot mansion. But former colleagues said Mr. Fastow often complained that others at Enron had earned far more.
Two former colleagues said that he considered some of the money he earned from the private partnerships he had formed an alternative form of compensation for all the work he had done to manage Enron's books. Because when Enron's stock was soaring in 1999 and 2000, he figured that no one had done more for Enron than Andy Fastow.
"He figured he was the one pulling the company out of the hole every quarter," one former finance executive said. "And he felt he wasn't getting credit for it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE SHOE-BOMB SUSPECT; 
Man Accused of Shoe-Bomb Plot Says He Intends to Plead Guilty

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The man accused of trying to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight with explosives hidden in his shoes filed a motion today saying he intended to plead guilty to all the charges against him.
 The man, Richard Colvin Reid, had been scheduled to go on trial on Nov. 4 to face eight counts, including attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, and prosecutors were caught by surprise by the move. Justice Department officials said Mr. Reid's motion did not involve any plea deal, meaning that he still faces a potential sentence of life in prison for his role in the harrowing incident on Dec. 22. 
 Despite Mr. Reid's request to plead guilty, his motion asked a judge to delete from the indictment the government's assertions that he received training from Al Qaeda, apparently an effort to contend he was not acting as a member of a terrorist organization. But a source close to the defense, who insisted on anonymity, said today that Mr. Reid intended to plead guilty regardless of whether a judge agreed to strike the accusations about Al Qaeda.
Mr. Reid, 29, a British citizen, is accused of trying to ignite explosives hidden in the soles of his black high-top sneakers on a Paris-to-Miami flight last Dec. 22. After a flight attendant smelled sulfur from a lighted match and noticed Mr. Reid trying to ignite the tongue of one of his shoes, passengers and crew members overpowered Mr. Reid, and two doctors on board injected him with sedatives.
The plane, American Airlines Flight 63, was diverted to Boston's Logan International Airport, escorted by two F-15 fighter jets. None of the 185 passengers were hurt, but two flight attendants suffered minor injuries.
Mr. Reid's lawyers, federal public defenders, issued a statement saying Mr. Reid "has no disagreement with the facts asserted in the charges as to his actions on Dec. 22, 2001, and wants to avoid the publicity associated with a trial and the negative impact it is likely to have upon his family," the statement said.
The indictment against Mr. Reid asserts that he received training at Qaeda terrorist camps in Afghanistan. A memorandum filed later by federal prosecutors stated that "an examination of one of the explosive devices in Reid's shoes disclosed evidence of a confederate (or confederates)," indicating that investigators had ruled out Mr. Reid as the source of a human hair found in the bomb and a palm print found on the paper used to make the detonator.
In May, Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, said that he believed "an Al Qaeda bomb maker" made the explosives in Mr. Reid's shoes.
Mr. Reid was unsuccessful in an earlier effort to remove the Qaeda language from the indictment. The source close to the defense said today that the request was being raised again because Mr. Reid and his lawyers felt that the Qaeda allegations were prejudicial to him without being necessary to prove the charges against him. While the source did not say that Mr. Reid disputed having a Qaeda connection, the source said Mr. Reid and his lawyers believed that connection had been raised purely for political purposes.
Judge William Young of Federal District Court has scheduled a hearing on Friday to consider whether to accept the plea. A Justice Department official said today that the government was prepared to prove Mr. Reid's associations with Al Qaeda in court.
The Justice Department said today that they had not entered into any plea bargain negotiations with Mr. Reid and had been preparing to present evidence on each count of the indictment.
Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a statement saying: "Richard Reid, like any defendant, is free to plead guilty to criminal charges. The Justice Department has not entered into any plea agreement with Reid."
The source close to the defense said that the government made it "pretty clear from the beginning that if Mr. Reid was not willing to cooperate they weren't going to give him anything."
The source said Mr. Reid would not give the government any information.
"He is not getting anything from them," the source said. "He is not giving anything to them."
Mr. Reid, the son of a Jamaican father and an English mother, had a string of convictions for street crimes like muggings, converted to Islam in prison and later became affiliated with radical Muslim extremists, people who knew him in London said. 
In an interview last year, Abdul Haqq Bakr, chairman of the Brixton Mosque and Islamic Cultural Center in South London, identified Mr. Reid as a man who took the name Abdel Rahim when he began worshiping there in late 1995. Mr. Bakr said he believed that Mr. Reid was a "tester," an expendable recruit used by others to see if the-bomb-in-the-shoes method would work. 
The government's memorandum in the cases said that an e-mail message Mr. Reid wrote to his mother two days before the flight provided further evidence of his guilt. Prosecutors said Mr. Reid referred to the message as a "will," and that he wrote: "I see it as a duty upon me to help remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim land and that this is the only way for us to do so as we do not have other means to fight them." 
The prosecutors' memorandum said Mr. Reid told law enforcement agents after his arrest that "he decided to choose an American target after the United States began bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan."
According to the memorandum, Mr. Reid "claimed to have chosen to attack an airplane because he believed an airplane attack, especially during the holiday season, would cause the American public to lose confidence in airline security and stop traveling, leading to a substantial loss of revenue which would, in turn, hurt the American economy."
Mr. Reid's lawyers failed in their efforts to get those statements suppressed, contending in a motion that Mr. Reid had either invoked his right to remain silent, was suffering from a form of short-term amnesia, or was unable to stop talking because of the Valium and other drugs that doctors on board the flight used to sedate him.

HEADLINE: Canada's Leader Plans More Social Spending After Years of Cuts 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
In two speeches that broadly promised increases in spending for health care, transportation and low-income housing, Prime Minister Jean Chretien signaled this week that he planned to leave office with a burst of social activism in the next 16 months.
 Mr. Chretien's first policy statements as Parliament reconvened indicated that he hoped to push the governing Liberal Party toward the left after years of spending cuts to trim budget deficits, although specific proposals and spending totals will not be disclosed until the annual budget is presented next year. 
 "The issue is not whether we will pay more as a society for health," Mr. Chretien said in the House of Commons on Tuesday. "We will. It is about the type of society we want."
The address amplified remarks made on Monday by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in what is called the Throne Speech, the equivalent of the State of the Union address, which was written by Mr. Chretien's office. "The goal of the government is nothing less than making Canada a land of ever-widening opportunity, ensuring that the benefits of the new economy touch every community and lift every family," she said. 
Taken together, the speeches offered outlines for a 10-year program to revitalize cities with new spending on public housing and city roads, expanded health and educational programs for Native Canadian families and a doubling of foreign aid. 
They also suggested that the government would move toward decriminalizing marijuana, an eventuality that has alarmed Bush administration officials.
The steps would reverse several years of decreases in federal and provincial government involvement in city affairs because of budget cuts in the early and mid-1990's. The budgets cuts and inadequate local tax bases have been responsible for less spending on public housing and an increase in homelessness in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto.
Just last week, Toronto officials dismantled a settlement of squatters near downtown that had become an eyesore to a city proud of its reputation for cleanliness and orderliness.
Government officials said new transportation proposals would soon be issued to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas and at border points with the United States. They would contribute to an overall strategy to fulfill the requirements of the Kyoto climate control treaty, which Mr. Chretien would like Parliament to approve before he leaves office.
Mr. Chretien also pledged to introduce a package of ethics proposals for government bureaucrats and members of Parliament, which will include campaign financing reforms. 
He promised that the new programs would not endanger the budget surplus, projected at $3.8 billion for the fiscal year ending in March.
A former finance minister, Paul Martin -- the leading Liberal contender to succeed Mr. Chretien, who is scheduled to step down in early 2004 after more than a decade in office -- embraced the policy directions of the speeches, making them tantamount to the governing party's preliminary platform for the expected 2004 elections against an opposition that is badly split between four parties.
Opposition leaders in Parliament said the speeches were full of recycled and vague promises.
"I don't think there is a clear agenda of any kind here," said Stephen Harper, parliamentary leader of the center-right Canadian Alliance, "other than to spend a whole bunch of money and try and find a legacy that isn't there."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MOSCOW; 
Russia, With Much at Stake, Takes Its Time Deciding

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Russia is biding its time over whether to support the Bush administration in seeking a new United Nations resolution on Iraq, with parliamentary leaders saying today that the decision hinged on economic interests, and with the Kremlin still declining to lay out its terms in public.
 Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal leader who sees President Vladimir V. Putin regularly, said in an interview that he believed Mr. Putin would ultimately allow the American resolution to pass, but was waiting to see how the Americans planned to protect Russia's interests in Iraq after Saddam Hussein goes. 
 In Moscow this afternoon, Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, hinted that Russia would be willing to consider the American proposal, saying that the United Nations Security Council "first should hold its session and then decide whether an additional resolution is needed." 
"If any additional decisions are needed for the inspectors to work efficiently, we will, of course, be prepared to consider them," he said.
But just two hours later, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov indicated that Russia still opposed the new resolution, which was outlined to officials here by Marc Grossman, the American under secretary of state, on Saturday.
"Diplomatic measures have not been exhausted," the defense minister said of Iraq. 
Russia is conflicted about a potential war in Iraq, which has been a major trading partner and which owes it more than $7 billion in Soviet-era debt. Russian oil companies have billions of dollars in contracts with Iraq. 
But there is virtually no support for the Hussein regime among Russian leaders -- a change from the policy of the Soviet Union, which nurtured relations with Baghdad. Russia, a veto-bearing member of the Security Council, risks spoiling its blossoming relations with the United States if it kills the new resolution.
Although Russia's foreign and defense ministries have been issuing a steady stream of vague statements, the ultimate decision will be made by Mr. Putin. 
Some politicians here said today that Mr. Putin had already made up his mind. Mr. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, said of Mr. Putin: "I don't think he's bargaining. He's simply waiting for some time before he gives a final answer."
"There are some important pre-conditions," Mr. Yavlinsky said. "There needs to be a clear vision of what will happen in Iraq after a regime change."
Russia's interests range from control of Iraqi oil after the Saddam Hussein government falls and what economic future Russia would have in Iraq, to the likelihood of civil war and its containment.
Mr. Yavlinsky has been received by Mr. Putin several times since the Sept. 11 terror attacks last year helped to nurture much stronger Russian-American ties. When asked if he had seen or spoken to Mr. Putin since Saturday, Mr. Yavlinsky said, "He is aware of my views."
Most political leaders here today agreed that economics were at the heart of the issue. But not all shared Mr. Yavlinsky's view on Mr. Putin. Aleksei G. Arbatov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee in the lower house of Parliament, said he did not expect Mr. Putin to support the American resolution in its current form.
"Russia will not support the current text," Mr. Arbatov said. "We can't stop the U.S. We don't have the strength for that. But if they are hoping for active cooperation from Russia, it will not come."
The American push for military action, said Mr. Arbatov, seems to focus more on removing Mr. Hussein than on trying to enforce a strict ban on weapons.
"That's a very subjective approach," he said. "They say they don't like the regime. Tomorrow there will be another they don't like. The anti-American sentiment inside Russia is growing sharply."
Russia has been doing some Middle East diplomacy of its own. The Kuwaiti defense minister held talks with senior officials in Moscow today and an Iraqi deputy oil minister is in town. On Monday, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel met with Mr. Putin, and today Abu Mazen, the secretary of the Palestine Liberation Organization, met officials here.
The defense minister, Mr. Ivanov, referred indirectly today to American lobbying on Iraq, saying: "The situation in the region is a cause of serious concern for us. There is more to it than the Iraq issue."
So far, Mr. Putin has not revealed his thoughts. In Moscow today, people were trying to read them, with the Russian daily Izvestiya concluding, "The priority -- the Marxists were right -- is economics."

HEADLINE: Oh So Quietly, Fed Ponders What FollowsGreenspan 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
It is one of the most delicate topics in Washington: how to plan for the day when Alan Greenspan, now 76 and in his 16th year as chairman of the Federal Reserve, is no longer at the economy's helm.
 But it will soon be broached -- albeit indirectly and heavily cloaked in the jargon of monetary policy -- through a proposal championed by a new Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, a former Princeton economics professor. 
 Mr. Bernanke intends to raise the issue through an otherwise arcane debate over whether the Fed should adopt a numerical target for inflation to replace its vaguely defined goal of price stability.
Mr. Bernanke is one of the foremost proponents of the approach, known as inflation targeting, and in bringing it to light he is setting the stage for what could be the first broad re-examination in years of how the Fed operates. The plan has many advantages, in the view of its supporters, including making the central bank more accountable for its performance and erasing any doubts the financial markets might have about the Fed's commitment to keeping inflation under control. 
But its most attention-grabbing selling point is that it could be perceived as a way to bottle Mr. Greenspan's magic for the ages.
"There will be a vigorous debate over inflation targeting when Alan Greenspan retires," said Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who returned after his term to Princeton's economics department, where he worked alongside Mr. Bernanke. "The United States has been on the Greenspan standard, and the Greenspan standard has been very successful. Since we can't stay on the Greenspan standard forever, you might want to think of a system that is not so dependent on the skills of one person."
The idea is that by locking the Fed into a commitment to maintain a specified low level of inflation, it would cement the gains made under Mr. Greenspan and minimize the chances that bad policy decisions by his successor could lead to a resurgence of inflation or, for that matter, an outbreak of deflation, that is, a generalized decline in prices.
The approach has drawbacks, as well. By removing much of the discretion in policy making, it could limit the Fed's ability to change its strategy as the economy evolves. During the 1990's, for example, Mr. Greenspan kept interest rates much lower than traditional economic theory suggested in the belief that the economy could grow faster than projected without generating inflation. He was right, and the benefits included millions of new jobs.
More recently, some economists have suggested that the Fed should broaden rather than narrow its inflation fighting to include the potential effects of stock market and real estate bubbles on the economy rather than simply focusing on the movements in prices of basic goods and services.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Greenspan is chief among the skeptics about inflation targeting. He is joined in that skepticism by another new Fed governor, Donald L. Kohn, who was previously Mr. Greenspan's top monetary policy adviser.
But most of the world's other big central banks have adopted some form of inflation targeting, and the idea has considerable support in academic circles and from a few Fed officials, including J. Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. While adopting such an approach would involve complexities ranging from the proper measurement of inflation to changing the Fed's legislative mandate, its proponents say the prospect of an eventual changing of the guard at the Fed makes this the time to consider the issue.
Although his reputation has been battered somewhat by the most recent recession and the bursting of the stock market bubble, Mr. Greenspan remains an almost iconic figure outside the Fed and within.
He has given no indication that he intends to leave before his current four-year term as chairman ends in June 2004. Indeed, there is considerable speculation that Mr. Greenspan would like to stay on as chairman until his separate term as a board member ends in February 2006, when he would be a month from his 80th birthday.
But there has been disquiet among economists about the apparent lack of preparation for the day when Mr. Greenspan is no longer there -- and in particular about the difficulty of replicating his instinctive ability to read the economy and his seat-of-the-pants style of adjusting interest rate policy accordingly.
"Imagine that Greenspan's successor decides to continue the monetary policy of the Greenspan era," N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist, wrote in a paper last year. "How would he do it? The policy has never been fully explained. Quite the contrary: the Fed chairman is famous for being opaque. If a successor tries to emulate the Greenspan Fed, he won't have any idea how."
Promoting inflation targeting is a tricky role for Mr. Bernanke, a 48-year-old monetary policy expert whose main experience in public service before joining the Fed in August was two terms on the board of education of tiny Montgomery Township, N.J.
On most issues, Mr. Bernanke is solidly aligned with Mr. Greenspan, and colleagues say he is astute enough not to make such a cause of inflation targeting that it isolates him within the Fed.
But Mr. Bernanke has made clear that he intends to stimulate a debate, through speeches, Congressional testimony and interviews. The Fed's seven-member board of governors, he said in a recent interview, "has a responsibility to engage the public in a dialogue about broader issues, such as the appropriate framework for monetary policy."
Mr. Bernanke said that the approach would help the Fed retain the credibility and the respect that it has built up under Mr. Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker -- making a transition to a new chairman less wrenching for the economy and the markets than it might otherwise be.
In practice, Mr. Bernanke said, he would set an inflation target of 1 to 2 percent a year, using a measure known as the core personal consumption expenditure deflator, and then move interest rates up or down to meet that goal over the medium term, perhaps a year or two. Inflation by that measure has been running within his suggested range since the mid-1990's.
"It is important to stress that inflation targeting, as I interpret it, would not represent a major departure from the current practice of U.S. monetary policy or a change in policy objectives," Mr. Bernanke said at his Senate confirmation hearing. "Its primary goal would be to build on the policy successes of the past two decades by strengthening the Federal Reserve's institutional commitment to the approach used by the Fed under Chairman Volcker and Chairman Greenspan."
He put it more bluntly at a Fed conference three years ago. If the Fed were to adopt an explicit inflation target, he said in a paper he presented with Mark Gertler, an economist at New York University, "the transition from the current chairman to the next one would create less anxiety in financial markets and for the economy than otherwise."
In trying to stimulate a debate, Mr. Bernanke is filling what has become almost a formal role at the Fed: that of the governor who has the personality and the stature as an economist to challenge Mr. Greenspan's approach to monetary policy and focus the Fed's attention on new ideas.
The role of intellectual foil was filled during the late 1990's by Laurence H. Meyer, who engaged in a low-key debate with Mr. Greenspan about the relationship between inflation and unemployment and the permanence of the "new economy" boom. Mr. Meyer's term expired at the beginning of this year.
Before that, the role was played by Mr. Blinder, who was the Fed's vice chairman in the mid-1990's and was perceived to be challenging the internal consensus that the Fed should be single-minded about inflation-fighting even at the expense of jobs and economic growth.
Mr. Meyer said Mr. Bernanke would be doing the Fed a favor by bringing up the issue, even if the debate does not lead to any immediate change.
"It's important that it's done in a way that makes clear that nothing substantive is going to happen before Greenspan's role at the Fed is over," Mr. Meyer said. "But this is the time to think -- and think out loud -- about some of the issues that will be on the table in the post-Greenspan regime."
Other economists said inflation targeting makes both economic and public policy sense by encouraging continuity at the Fed even as the top people there change.
"What you see in successful countries is that it's institutions that make them successful," said Frederic S. Mishkin, a Columbia University economist and former Fed official who collaborated with Mr. Bernanke in some of his academic writings about inflation targeting. "The reason Ben is so important in this regard is that he will get the issue on the table."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
It's time for Bushto acknowledge that the economy is sick and offer a remedy.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick, who teaches at Cooper Union, is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. His new book, "Why Economies Grow," is being published by Basic Books this month. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
IT is being said by some that President Bush has no economic policy. In fact, the administration does have one. But it is not working.
 The policy is mostly made up of tax cuts in the future, and a good deal of cheerleading in the present. It has a staunchly laissez-faire foundation: the philosophy, in a nutshell, is that the White House neither can nor should do much about the economy, except to get out of the way. 
 Even Herbert Hoover had a fonder feeling for government. He at least heroically led the American relief efforts that fed so many starving Europeans after World War I.
Considering the litany of disappointments, however, you would think that Mr. Bush would begin to have some doubts about his chosen course.
Estimates of future federal budget deficits are rising. Corporate profits keep coming in lower than expected. The leading indicators have fallen three consecutive months. Capital spending softened again in August. The stock market oscillates around lows reached after Sept. 11, 2001. 
Now retail spending, which has been the surprising prop under the economy, is starting to flag as well, even at Wal-Mart. 
A double dip? How about one long recession?
Those who say we have already climbed out of recession focus on output or gross domestic product. But Robert Hall, the conservative economist who leads the committee that dates recessions for the National Bureau of Economic Research -- a private organization that is considered the official arbiter of business cycles -- notes that employment is also a crucial criterion for determining when recessions begin and end.
The nation's gross domestic product has grown at roughly a 3 percent annual rate for a year. By contrast, employment has not come back. Total employment fell for a year beginning last spring and then merely flattened out. If overall economic activity falters, the research group may well argue, based on sagging employment, that the recession has been continuous since the spring of 2001.
For all this, there is no serious stimulus package on the table in Washington. "Congress has gone dead on this issue," said Tom Palley, an economist at the Open Society, an international philanthropy group.
A new stimulus package in the neighborhood of $100 billion, or 1 percent of G.D.P., is needed now. The Federal Reserve will probably cut rates at its next meeting, but interest rates are already so low that further cuts may not help much. 
Much of the federal money should go to workers, who need it and will spend it. The rising jobless rate has understated the jobs weakness. Discouraged workers are leaving the work force in droves and are not counted as unemployed.
By one important measure, this recession is every bit as bad as it gets. Lee Price, chief economist of the Senate Budget Office, finds that the number of people working as a proportion of the working-age population has fallen faster in this recession than the average of the last nine recessions. Moreover, it has fallen for 27 months, longer than in any other postwar recession.
The first priority of a stimulus package should be to extend unemployment benefits beyond the customary period. Unless the economy improves, two million workers will run out their unemployment insurance by the end of the year, and an additional couple of hundred thousand will lose coverage every month thereafter.
Part-time workers, now an increasing portion of the work force, should also be able to qualify if they work a certain number of hours. Benefits could also be raised. One easy way would be to stop taxing them for a year. 
Extending and expanding unemployment insurance has another benefit. When the economy strengthens, federal outlays will fall because there will be fewer unemployed. So, unlike the Bush tax cuts, this will not add to the long-term deficit.
A second priority is to compensate for the reduced spending of state and local governments, much of which still lies ahead. As they lose tax revenue, these governments are reducing spending in crucial areas, including public works and education, by tens of billions of dollars. Again, as the economy strengthens, such federal spending would slow and not remain a long-term burden.
Finally, Congress should rescind the Bush tax cuts for the rich and channel a portion of them to middle-income and poorer workers. Some economists recommend a cut in payroll taxes.
The disorganized Democrats have not been able to cobble together a convincing stimulus package, but they are at least offering a plan to extend unemployment benefits before Congress adjourns later this month.
In all fairness, however, the president holds the best cards, and he has not even shown up at the table. Even the tax cuts on capital gains he discussed just after the economic meetings in August in Waco, Tex., have been shelved for now. And they would not have helped much, anyway. Instead, we got a pep talk from administration officials like Glenn Hubbard, the White House chief economist, who insisted over the weekend that we will not sink into recession again.
Maybe not. The president stumbled inadvertently into some stimulative policies. War spending plus tax cuts arranged when the economy was prospering have turned out to be timely. But they are not enough, and such fortuitous policy accidents do not generate confidence.
Overoptimism about the so-called new economy created serious obstacles to future growth, including excess capacity, especially in high technology and telecommunications, as well as high levels of consumer debt, an overvalued dollar, and an enormous trade deficit.
And poor leadership is no doubt taking a special toll as prospects for war mount. "The war puts everything on hold," said Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
Ignoring economic reality may help the Republicans win in November, but they will then face an economy that may have slipped so far it cannot be managed, even if they finally decide they want to try.

HEADLINE: Airline Aid Advances in House; Passage in '02 Is Called Unlikely 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
A House subcommittee approved a bill today to help economically struggling airlines, but the effort may be too late to become law this year as Congress nears the end of its session and the Senate has not yet acted on a similar bill. 
 The panel, the House Transportation aviation subcommittee, endorsed a package of loan guarantees, antiterrorism insurance and new procedures to lighten security costs airlines say are hurting the industry. 
 Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the bill could save the industry $1.5 billion by extending government-sponsored terrorism insurance, fully reimbursing the costs of bulletproof cockpit doors and reauthorizing airlines to carry certain mail. 
Mr. Oberstar said the amount was almost "half of what the airlines said they need to get on a stable economic footing." The airlines have told Congress they need $4 billion in help.
Leaders of some of the largest carriers, in pressing for the aid, say they expect to lose $7 billion this year amid reduced passenger traffic and the new costs of security. 
The panel voted to extend the antiterrorism insurance policies issued by the government after the attacks of September 2001 and to limit to $100 million each airline's total liability for people injured or killed on the ground or in buildings during an act of terrorism. 
It also agreed to reopen a loan-guarantee program for financially troubled airlines if the United States goes to war with Iraq. Should Congress authorize force and oil prices rise by 25 percent, the subcommittee voted to give them loan guarantees and lines of credit to buy fuel. 
The bill is subject to approval by the full Transportation Committee and then by the House before it goes to the Senate.

HEADLINE: Egyptians See U.S. as Meddling in Their Politics 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
In his air-conditioned sanctuary atop the crumbling building of the Ministry of Youth, Ali Eddein Hilal Dessouki talked of that rare commodity in Egypt: democracy.
 But Mr. Dessouki, who is seen as the modernizer of Egypt's entrenched ruling party, was careful not to oversell. 
 Western-style democracy, he said, will not be coming to Egypt or the rest of the Arab world as an immediate consequence of the ouster of President Saddam Hussein in Iraq, as the Bush administration says it wants. 
"As the minister of foreign affairs said, 'We take lessons from nobody,' " said Mr. Dessouki, 58, whose title as minister of youth is meant to convey fresh blood in Egyptian politics.
But he said about a recent party conference: "We have introduced new faces into the political arena. We have introduced new principles."
These are tense times between Washington and Egypt, the largest Arab country and an important strategic ally.
The Bush administration regards President Hosni Mubarak as an ungrateful recipient of nearly $2 billion in annual assistance. Moreover, it views Egypt as a recalcitrant student of political and economic reform.
The conviction by a military court of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a human rights activist with an American and an Egyptian passport, and his sentence of seven years in jail heightened Washington's irritation. Among the charges that the military court found Mr. Ibrahim guilty of were receipt of foreign funds for pro-democracy activities.
On the heels of the conviction in July, President Bush sent a brusque letter to Mr. Mubarak warning that Washington might not approve additional assistance that Egypt was seeking. Now one of the chief duties of officials at the American Embassy in Cairo, including Ambassador David Welch, is to visit Mr. Ibrahim in jail, where is said to be in declining health.
For their part, Egyptians see Washington as high-handed and say it is meddling in affairs in which it has no business. Behind the scenes, they say, Washington demands a stable post-Sept. 11 Egypt.
Remarks by Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, that the Arab world would see a "march of democracy" after the fall of Mr. Hussein were dismissed by one senior official here as fantasy. "Cinderella," the official scoffed with a wave of the hand. "How nice of her," he said sarcastically. "Is she dreaming?"
Officials of the Mubarak government are also annoyed at the short shrift the Bush administration gives to their argument that settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital for the Middle East and should take precedence over an invasion of Iraq.
Western diplomats here see Mr. Dessouki, a former political science professor at Cairo University, as the best hope for trying to move the political system. He is a political mentor of Gamal Mubarak, the son of President Mubarak, who is increasingly viewed as a likely heir.
At last month's congress of the National Democratic Party, Gamal Mubarak, 39, was the "new face" to emerge. He was promoted to the senior executive council and handed the post of steering the influential political committee.
A banker by training and a graduate of the American University in Cairo, Gamal Mubarak appears to understand the need to open up the political space in Egypt, say people who have met him.
But how deep his knowledge of economics runs is not clear, though he devoted a recent speech to the virtues of the capitalist thought of Adam Smith.
So far the goals set by the government for political reform appear very limited. Nobody is talking of multiparty democracy. Rather, commentators say, the leaders seem to be probing for ways to groom a a new elite among a younger generation.
Mr. Dessouki sketched plans for trying to change the ruling party from serving as an appendage of autocratic government into a more representative group. He spoke of a "third way" for the party, to work as a bridge between the old-style party and the Islamic radicals, who have been ruthlessly shut out of the system by arrests and imprisonment.
In an effort to try to tackle widespread corruption in the party, a new secretariat for ethics headed by a retired judge was announced at the congress last month. New rules calling for more regular elections of urban and provincial party leaders were adopted.
How quickly any of that will actually take effect was not defined. Mr. Dessouki spoke of a two-year timetable to "sell" the new party program.
Most resolutely, he argued that the United States should cease what he called a habit of lecturing about democracy. "You can't have democracy without democrats," he said. "You cannot have democracy imposed on authoritarian societies."
There is a step-by-step process, he said, explaining: "You have to change the status of women, change the schools. Politics is a reflection of society."
But while Mr. Dessouki spoke of the changes within the party, the general political atmosphere remains repressive, diplomats said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From Remarks by President and Lawmakers on Iraq Resolution

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Bush and Congressional leaders at the White House yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times. Among those with Mr. Bush were Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader; and Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona. A full transcript is online at nytimes .com/politics.

President Bush
 Today I'm joined by leaders of the House and the Senate from both political parties to show our unity and purpose in confronting a gathering threat to the security of America and to the future of peace. I want to thank in particular Speaker Hastert and Leader Gephardt, Leader Lott for the tremendous work in building bipartisan support on this vital issue. I also want to thank Senators Warner, Lieberman, McCain and Bayh for introducing this resolution, which we've agreed to, on the floor of the Senate this morning. 
 The text of our bipartisan resolution is clear and it is strong. The statement of support from the Congress will show to friend and enemy alike the resolve of the United States. 
In Baghdad the regime will know that full compliance with all U.N. security demands is the only choice and the time remaining for that choice is limited. On its present course the Iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency.
We know the treacherous history of the regime. It has waged war against its neighbors. It has sponsored and sheltered terrorists. It has developed weapons of mass death. It has used them against innocent men, women and children. 
We know the designs of the Iraqi regime. In defiance of pledges to the U.N. it has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons. It is rebuilding the facilities used to make those weapons. U.N. inspectors believe that Iraq could have produced enough biological and chemical agent to kill millions of people. The regime has the scientists and facilities to build nuclear weapons and is seeking the materials needed to do so.
We know the methods of this regime. They buy time with hollow promises. They move incriminating evidence to stay ahead of inspectors. They concede just enough to escape punishment and then violate every pledge when the attention of the world is turned away. 
We also know the nature of Iraq's dictator. On his orders, opponents have been decapitated and their heads displayed outside their homes. Women have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation. Political prisoners are made to watch their own children being tortured. The dictator is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control within his own cabinet, within his own army, even within his own family. 
We will not leave the future of peace and the security of America in the hands of this cruel and dangerous man. None of us here today desire to see military conflict because we know the awful nature of war. Our country values life and never seeks war unless it is essential to security and to justice. America's leadership and willingness to use force, confirmed by the Congress, is the best way to ensure compliance and avoid conflict.
Saddam must disarm. Period. If, however, he chooses to do otherwise, if he persists in his defiance, the use of force may become unavoidable. That course of action may bring many sacrifices, yet delay, indecision and inaction could lead to a massive and sudden horror. 
By timely and resolute action, we can defend ourselves and shape a peaceful future. Together with the Congress, I will do everything necessary to protect and defend our country. 
In accepting this responsibility, we also serve the interests and the hopes of the Iraqi people. They are a great and gifted people with an ancient and admirable culture, and they would not choose to be ruled by violence and terror. The people of Iraq are the daily victims of Saddam Hussein's oppression. They will be the first to benefit when the world's demands are met.
Americans believe all men and women deserve to be free. And as we saw in the fall of the Taliban, men and women celebrate freedom's arrival. 
The United States will work with other nations to bring Saddam to account. We will work with other nations to help the Iraqi people form a just government in a unified country. And should force be required, the United States will help rebuild a liberated Iraq. 
Countering Iraq's threat is also a central commitment on the war on terror. We know Saddam Hussein has longstanding and ongoing ties to international terrorists. With the support and shelter of a regime, terror groups become far more lethal. Aided by a terrorist network, an outlaw regime can launch attacks while concealing its involvement. 
Even a dictator is not suicidal. But he can make use of men who are. We must confront both terror cells and terror states because they are different faces of the same evil. 
I brought this issue to the attention of the world and many, many countries share our determination to confront this threat. We're not alone. 
The issue is now before the United States Congress. This debate will be closely watched by the American people. And this debate will be remembered in history. 
We didn't ask for this challenge as a country. But we will face it, and we will face it together. As the vote nears, I urge all members of Congress to consider this resolution with the greatest of care. The choice before them could not be more consequential. 
I'm confident that members of both parties will choose wisely.

Representative Hastert
This is a bipartisan agreement. The White House deserves credit for working with Republicans and Democrats to achieve this historic resolution. The resolution does not tie the president's hands. It gives him flexibility he needs to get the job done. 
This resolution does not require the president to get United Nations approval before proceeding. It supports the president's effort to work with the United Nations. But it doesn't require him to seek U.N. approval first. If the president determines that he has to act unilaterally to protect the American people, he can. And he has the ability to do that. 
I think the bottom line for all of us here is we've been through this process. We've been through Sept. 11. We've visited ground zero. We've been at the Pentagon the day after. And we don't want that type of tragedy to happen in this country again. And we will do everything in our power to prevent it from happening again.

Representative Gephardt
Let me begin by saying that the most important issue the president and the Congress ever address is that of life and death. The first responsibility of our government is to protect the security of our nation and our citizens. In our view, Iraq's use and continuing development of weapons of mass destruction, combined with efforts of terrorists to acquire such weapons, pose a unique and dangerous threat to our national security.
Many of us believe that we need to deal with this threat diplomatically if we can, militarily if we must. Every member of Congress must make their own decision on the level of threat posed by Iraq and what to do to respond to that threat. I've said many times to my caucus that each member should be guided by his or her own conscience, free from others trying to politicize the issue or questioning others' motives. 
In response to the president's desire for Congressional support and in keeping with our constitutional responsibilities, I have worked a draft resolution that reflects the views of a large bipartisan segment of Congress. My underlying goal in this process has been to ensure that Iraq is disarmed and to lessen the likelihood that weapons of mass destruction can be passed to terrorists. 
Over the past several days I have solicited views from all the members of my caucus and have negotiated with the administration to secure a number of important improvements that reflect these views. These improvements include support for and prioritization of U.S. diplomatic efforts at the United Nations, limitations on the scope of the authorization, presidential determinations to Congress before our armed forces may be used against Iraq. These include assurances by the president that he has exhausted diplomatic means to address this threat and that any military action against Iraq will not undermine our ongoing efforts in the war against terrorism. Regular consultations with and reporting to Congress on the administration's efforts to address this threat and post conflict contingencies in Iraq. 
You all know that we have a lot of differences on many issues. We disagree on many domestic issues. But this is the most important thing that we do. This should not be about politics. We have to do what is right for the security of our nation and the safety of all Americans. 
We're about to begin a great debate in the United States Congress. Part of the majesty of our democratic achievement of a democratic governance is that on issues of war and peace, life and death, we have entrusted those decisions not just to the president but to the Congress as a co-equal branch of this government. We now take that solemn obligation. And I believe that when the debate is finished we will have discharged that responsibility in the highest tradition of this country and our great people.

Senator Lieberman
There is no more fateful, important or difficult responsibility that the Constitution gives members of Congress than to decide when, whether and how to authorize the president as commander in chief to go to war. 
Mr. President, in your eloquent, powerful and convincing statement this morning you have reminded us and, I believe, the American people about why this is such a circumstance. I have felt for more than a decade now that every additional day that Saddam Hussein is in power in Iraq is an additional day of danger for the Iraqi people, for his neighbors in the region, particularly for the people and military of the United States of America and, indeed, for the people of the world. 
And that is why I am grateful for the opportunity to stand with my colleagues from both parties and both houses and with you, Mr. President, in offering this resolution to authorize you to take military action to protect the region and the world from Iraq under Saddam Hussein and to enforce the resolutions that are relevant of the United Nations.
There are those who say that this represents hurried or precipitous action, that we should give Saddam and the Iraqi government another chance. The record shows that for the last 10 years we have tried, the world has tried, in just about every way -- diplomatic, economic and otherwise -- except military, in the end, to convince Saddam Hussein to live by the rules of international law and civilization. They've not worked. The moment of truth has arrived. For Saddam Hussein this is his last chance and the best chance for the international community to come together behind the rule of law and to show that resolutions of the United Nations are worth more than the paper that they are written on. . . .
I am convinced as impressive as this group is here today, though there will be a serious debate ahead in both houses of Congress and amendments will certainly be offered in the Senate, as is the right and responsibility of those who disagree with this amendment, that in the end -- those who disagree with this resolution -- in the end this resolution will pass in the Senate with a very large bipartisan majority. And that today is the best hope for a stronger America and for a life for the American people that is safer.

Senator McCain
I'd like to thank the president for his leadership in addressing a challenge that many of us believe should have been addressed at least four years ago. I'd like to thank Speaker Hastert, Leader Gephardt, Senator Lott for their leadership and the efforts they've made to bring this issue to the Congress and to the American people. I'd like to also thank my friends Senator Lieberman, Senator Warner and Senator Bayh. Because of their efforts there is now identical resolutions in both houses of Congress. They will be debated, they will be discussed, and I believe the American people and the Congress will be enlightened, educated and better off for having a debate that I know will be respectful of the views of all members of Congress.
The Constitution of the United States designates the president of the United States as commander in chief. The Congress of the United States plays a role, and I believe that this process we are about to embark on is the appropriate role that Congress should carry out its responsibilities. But at the end of the day the final, most serious responsibility of sending young American men and women into harm's way rests with the president of the United States. And I am convinced that an overwhelming, significant majority of both houses of Congress speaking for their constituents will provide the president of the United States with the endorsement and the support that he needs, if necessary as a last resort, to preserve America's security by a regime change in Iraq. I thank him for his leadership.

HEADLINE: Gore Criticizes Bush on Creating Crisis Over Economic Leadership but Offers Few Suggestions 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Ten days after criticizing President Bush's handling of Iraq, Al Gore offered a scathing assessment today of Mr. Bush's stewardship of the American economy. Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's policies had created a "crisis of confidence in U.S. economic leadership throughout the world."
 Mr. Gore, the former vice president, urged Mr. Bush to convene Congressional leaders to pass a "serious midterm adjustment" before Nov. 5. 
 "It's urgent that we have presidential leadership to completely reassess and change our current economic policy," Mr. Gore said. "How can it be essential that we go to war prior to the election but absolutely fine to wait until after the election before we take any action to deal with the economy?"
Mr. Gore, who ran against Mr. Bush in 2000 and is considering whether to run in 2004, offered few details about which policies he thought had failed or what Mr. Bush and Congress should do.
He repeatedly declined to say whether he supported the call by many Democrats to postpone or suspend Mr. Bush's tax cuts that many Democrats argue have contributed to the nation's economic woes. In a 35-minute speech on Mr. Bush's economics program, Mr. Gore did not use the word "taxes" once, nor did he discuss the merits of the cuts that anchor Mr. Bush's plan.
Asked afterward whether he would support suspending the next phase of the cuts, Mr. Gore responded, "I think that he ought to put his economic plan on the table and engage the bipartisan leadership in a complete reassessment of all of his existing policies."
Mr. Gore then left for a plane home to Tennessee.
He spoke at the Brookings Institution here in coordination with the Democratic National Committee, which has been orchestrating an effort to push domestic issues to the forefront as the nation moves to the final weeks of the midterm elections. Democratic officials said they had asked Mr. Gore to avoid explicitly attacking the tax cuts, out of fear that it might hurt Democratic candidates in close races.
As it turned out, within an hour after Mr. Gore spoke trying to help Democrats turn the subject from international issues to the economy, two other Democrats who might run for president turned up at a White House news conference, announcing a deal with Mr. Bush on a resolution to authorize the United States to act against Iraq. The two, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate, praised Mr. Bush's Iraq policy.
Mr. Gore's attack on Mr. Bush's policies drew a scornful reaction from the Republican National Committee chairman, Marc Racicot.
"I think that's patent nonsense, frankly," Mr. Racicot said on CNN. "He didn't offer any proposals at all. He simply mentioned the economy."
Notwithstanding the subject and the setting, there was a fair bit of levity for Mr. Gore's second major address with White House overtones this month. After dwelling on the stock market decline, he said he decided after 2000 to spend two years "to try to get some financial security for our family" before deciding whether to run again.
"Great timing!" Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, shouted from the front row.
At the end of the speech, a reporter asked Mr. Gore why he was not wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Gore's face turned scarlet as he confided that he had "gained so much weight" that once he had taken off the ring "I couldn't get it back on again."
In his speech, Mr. Gore described the evaporation of the surplus as a "budget catastrophe" and said the nation could not wait until next year to change course on the economy. He pointed to a barrage of bad economic news that he said suggested that the national and international economies were in danger. Mr. Gore used a variety of metaphors -- a driver needing to stop at a service station for directions and a football couch at halftime -- as he argued that Mr. Bush needed to shift gears.
"The president needs to accept responsibility for the fact that his own fiscal policies are indeed the largest factor responsible for the $5 trillion evaporation of our surplus," Mr. Gore said. "The president needs to take responsibility for the failure of his economic team to respond in a swift and coordinated fashion."
Mr. Gore spoke disparagingly of Mr. Bush and his White House, saying he thought that some of the president's economic advisers should be replaced, though he would not say which ones. Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush and "his political team labored mightily to create the impression that our economic problems are primarily due to the terrorist attacks." 
"Now, according to President Bush and his economic team, none of this was supposed to happen," Mr. Gore said. "Even though much of it was in fact predicted by opponents of the president's economic plan -- some of them here -- all of it has apparently come as a shocking surprise to the president and to his economic team."

HEADLINE: Campaign Season 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
Hispanic Frustration
 Because of population growth, Texas has two new Congressional seats in this year's election, and California has one. In both states, the population increases that led to the additional representation was largely Latino -- 60 percent of the growth in Texas and 80 percent of the growth in California. 
 But the new district lines in the states do not reflect the greater Latino population, and that infuriates some Hispanic leaders.
"What they have done is split the Latino community to protect incumbents, and we think there are serious problems with that," said Thomas A. Saenz, vice president for litigation of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund in Los Angeles. 
In Texas, where a federal court drew the redistricting map, both districts are white, suburban and solidly Republican. One-third of the Texas population is Latino, but just six Latinos are highly likely to fill the state's 32 seats in the new Congress.
In California, the new seat is heavily Democratic and Latino and will almost certainly be won by Linda Sanchez, a union official. She will probably be the seventh Hispanic member in the 53-member California delegation. The state's population is also one-third Hispanic. 
In the 1990's, Latinos became the majority in two other districts now represented by Anglo Democrats, Bob Filner of San Diego and Howard L. Berman of the San Fernando Valley. Gov. Gray Davis and the Democratic Legislature, who controlled redistricting, redrew the lines of those districts to include fewer Latinos and, thus, protect Mr. Filner and Mr. Berman from the threat of a Latino primary challenge. 
Although Hispanic voters are not receiving the representation in Congress that they may think they deserve, their votes are aggressively solicited. A researcher at the Johns Hopkins University, Adam Segal, found that a record sum was being spent on Spanish-language political commercials this year. The advertisements, Mr. Segal said, are running not just on Spanish-language stations but also in some instances on channels in English.

Missing at Ole Miss
Dozens of student leaders from 40 years ago returned this week to the University of Mississippi, invited by the university president, Robert C. Khayat, to participate in the dedication of the site for a civil rights memorial on campus and other events to commemorate James H. Meredith's integration of Ole Miss. One student who was prominent then, Trent Lott, now the Senate minority leader, will not be there.
A spokeswoman for the university, Patsy Brumfield, said Mr. Lott was invited and never responded. A spokesman for the senator said he could not attend because of Senate business.
Mr. Khayat organized the events, he said, to liberate the university from its shameful past. When Mr. Meredith arrived on the campus on Sept. 30, 1962, thousands of white students rioted, two men died, and hundreds of people were injured. President John F. Kennedy sent 30,000 troops to quell the violence.
At the time, Mr. Lott was a senior who was president of Sigma Nu fraternity and the interfraternity council, a cheerleader and a member of a popular barbershop quartet, the Chancellors. He had just lost the election for student body president by 60 votes. 
There is no suggestion that Mr. Lott participated in the riot. But he does not like to talk publicly about that time in his life. In fact, he almost never comments about his state's history of segregation and racial conflict. 
Last year, Mississippi voters rejected a ballot proposition to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state's flag. Asked after Election Day how he had voted, Mr. Lott said that was nobody's business.

Swing Vote in House
The arithmetic is simple. The House has 223 Republicans, 208 Democrats, 1 independent who votes with the Democrats and 3 vacant seats, all previously held by Democrats and widely considered Democratic seats. That gives the Republicans an 11-seat advantage and means a net of 6 seats has to change hands for Democrats to win control of the House.
But wait. Apparently, the Democrats must actually pick up 7 seats. That is because Representative Ralph M. Hall, at left, a Democrat from eastern Texas who usually sides with Republicans on legislative issues, has been saying since late last year that if his vote is the decisive one in organizing the House, he will vote for the more conservative candidate for speaker. Doubtless, that will be the Republican, J. Dennis Hastert. Mr. Hall's chief of staff, Janet Poppleton, said this week that he had not changed his mind.
Mr. Hall first made a suggestion that he would vote for a Republican for speaker if his vote was needed last year, after President Bush had intervened to prevent a Republican from running against him this year.

Early Bird
Anyone who doubts that the Bush White House wakes up early need only to have been at Gate C7 at Dulles International Airport on Friday morning. At 6:10, there was Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, pacing restlessly back and forth as he spoke vigorously into his cellphone.
Who, one wondered, could he be talking to at that hour? And with such intensity?
The president? A child? A spouse? Or perhaps a hapless political worker in Denver, where Mr. Rove was headed to meet up with a three-stop presidential fund-raising trip?
A call to Mr. Rove's office yesterday turned up the answer. Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, who was already at his West Wing desk. No word on what the two talked about, but Mr. Rove finished up in time for his 6:50 flight on United, where instead of his usual seat on Air Force One, he sat like a proper government servant in economy class.

Text of House Resolution Authorizing the Use of U.S. Force Against Iraq

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq agreed upon yesterday by President Bush and House leaders. The full texts of the House resolution, the administration's initial proposal and the Biden-Lugar proposal in the Senate are online at nytimes.com/politics.
 WHEREAS in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its people in order to defend the national security of the United States and enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq, 
 WHEREAS after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them and to end its support for international terrorism,
WHEREAS the efforts of international weapons inspectors, United States intelligence agencies and Iraqi defectors led to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large-scale biological weapons program, and that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated, 
WHEREAS Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on Oct. 31, 1998,
WHEREAS in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United States interests and international peace and security, declared Iraq to be in "material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations" and urged the president "to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations" (Public Law 105-235),
WHEREAS Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations,
WHEREAS Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region by refusing to release, repatriate or account for non-Iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by Iraq from Kuwait,
WHEREAS the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people,
WHEREAS the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing hostility toward and willingness to attack the United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,
WHEREAS members of Al Qaida, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq,
WHEREAS Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American citizens,
WHEREAS the attacks on the United States of Sept. 11, 2001, underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist organizations,
WHEREAS Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine to justify action by the United States to defend itself,
WHEREAS United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain activities that threaten international peace and security, including the development of weapons of mass destruction and refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, repression of its civilian population in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 949,
WHEREAS Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has authorized the president "to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677,"
WHEREAS in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that it "supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1)," that Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and "constitutes a continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf region," and that Congress, "supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688",
WHEREAS the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime,
WHEREAS on Sept. 12, 2002, President Bush committed the United States to "work with the United Nations Security Council to meet our common challenge" posed by Iraq and to "work for the necessary resolutions," while also making clear that "the Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be unavoidable,"
WHEREAS the United States is determined to prosecute the war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council resolutions make clear that it is in the national security interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of force if necessary,
WHEREAS Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding requested by the president to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or organizations,
WHEREAS the president and Congress are determined to continue to take all appropriate actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or organizations,
WHEREAS the president has authority under the Constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States, as Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), and
WHEREAS it is in the national security of the United States to restore international peace and security to the Persian Gulf region;
Now, therefore, be it

HEADLINE: Reimbursement Sought for Sept. 11 Tax Losses 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Members of New York City's Congressional delegation introduced legislation in Washington yesterday that would enable the federal government to reimburse the city for some of the tax revenues it lost because of the World Trade Center attack.
 Although President Bush pledged $20 billion to the city in the days after the attack, and most tallies have the city getting at least that much money, that federal aid would do little to help New York City balance its battered budget. Most of it is earmarked for rebuilding projects, reimbursements for the money the city spent because of the attack, and economic development projects. 
 The city's tax revenues are expected to be far below what is needed to cover operating expenses, leaving a projected budget gap of more than $5 billion for next year. The deficit has already led city officials to begin discussing possible tax increases and steep service cuts, two options that could complicate the city's recovery.
The bill that was introduced yesterday would change the law to allow the federal government to reimburse the city for some of those lost tax revenues by lifting a cap on federal loans used for such purposes. Doing so would be unusual, but not unprecedented. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, who sponsored the bill in the House, noted that until 2000, the federal government used to grant large loans to places hit by hurricanes and other disasters, and sometimes forgave repayment of them.
The bill she sponsored in the House, which Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer introduced in the Senate, would allow the government to do so again. It would lift the current $5 million cap on such loans and allow them to be made to states as well as to local governments.
"I think people would agree that New York City services for schools, libraries, police, even water and highways should not suffer because of Osama bin Laden," Ms. Maloney said in a statement. 
The bill does not request any dollar amounts; rather it provides a way for any locality to seek reimbursement for its losses.
But the bill will probably face an uphill battle. The federal government is struggling with its own fiscal problems, and many in Congress appear to feel that New York City is already getting enough federal aid.
A report released in July by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated that the attack cost the city $1.6 billion in lost revenues last year and projected that it would cost $1.4 billion this year. The amount lost to New York State was even higher.
The Bloomberg administration, cautious that it not be perceived as unrealistically asking for huge amounts of aid, is limiting its main request to $650 million from the federal government. That is for expenses the city incurred as a result of Sept. 11 that were not considered reimbursable under federal guidelines, including the base salaries of the emergency workers who worked on the rescue and then recovery operations.
"We're certainly grateful to the delegation for seeking additional moneys to help the city get reimbursed for 9/11," said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, who recently went to Washington to speak in favor of the bill, praised it in a statement yesterday, saying that it would allow New York "to recoup at least some of the revenue lost."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION; 
BUSH STRIKES DEAL FOR HOUSE BACKING ON ACTION IN IRAQ

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush reached an agreement today with House leaders on a proposal authorizing him to use force against Iraq, a deal that Democrats acknowledged cleared the way for approval of a joint Congressional resolution supporting action against Saddam Hussein.
 "We will not leave the future of peace and the security of America in the hands of this cruel and dangerous man," Mr. Bush said in announcing the deal in the White House Rose Garden. 
 The president was surrounded as he spoke by a bipartisan group of House members and some senators who agreed with him, a tableau that the White House used to underscore the breadth of support for the president. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader who has expressed discomfort at the scope of the resolution, was noticeably absent. 
Despite the agreement with House leaders, all was not smooth today as the White House pressed its case on Iraq. The Senate is expected to have a long and grueling debate when it takes up the resolution on Thursday. The Bush administration faced even bigger challenges in the United Nations, where the White House was still hoping for a tough new resolution against Mr. Hussein. Mr. Bush had to compromise to make his deal with the House.
Specifically, Mr. Bush bent to Democratic wishes and vowed to report to Congress within 48 hours of launching any military action about why diplomatic means were no longer sufficient to protect the United States or enforce United Nations resolutions. He must also continue to report to Congress every 60 days that military action continues, and on planning for rebuilding and peace-keeping after military action. Excerpts, Page A14. 
In announcing the agreement, Mr. Bush used some of his most graphic language in describing the threat of Mr. Hussein.
"On his orders, opponents have been decapitated and their heads displayed outside their homes," Mr. Bush said. "Women have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation. Political prisoners are made to watch their own children being tortured. The dictator is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control within his own cabinet, within his own army, even within his own family."
At the United Nations, the United States and Britain made little headway today on their resolution to toughen arms inspections. 
"The baby is still in the belly," said Ambassador Martin Belinga Eboutou of Cameroon, who took over as council president for this month, acknowledging the delicate task before him in trying to keep the Iraq resolution from splitting the council. 
French diplomats lobbied hard to gain support for their two-stage approach. France favors an initial resolution that would tighten the weapons inspections regime but would require another Security Council measure to authorize force if Iraq does not allow complete inspections. An informal proposal outlining France's position circulated at the United Nations today.
The Security Council scheduled a closed briefing for Thursday morning with Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations weapons inspectors team, to hear firsthand his report on his two-day meeting this week in Vienna with Iraqi officials. 
Mr. Bush is urging Congress to approve a tough resolution to pressure the Security Council to back his hard-line position on Iraq. But the President found that he had to make concessions on his original language to reach agreement with the House. 
The agreement, which kept White House officials in the West Wing late Tuesday night lobbying members of Congress, once again showcased the divided Democrats. The House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, stood firmly behind the resolution, and gave it a great deal of momentum. But Mr. Daschle, who last week accused Mr. Bush of politicizing the Iraq debate, canceled a morning news conference.
This afternoon, in a written statement, Mr. Daschle said that the House resolution has "improvements" over the original proposal that the White House sent to Capitol Hill nearly two weeks ago. But he made clear that he still prefers an alternative version of the use-of-force resolution drafted by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana.
"I continue to believe," Mr. Daschle said, "that the final resolution should include greater emphasis on eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a stronger statement that operations against Iraq will not undermine the ongoing international effort against Al Qaeda, and a clearer assessment of the administration's plans for the political and economic reconstruction of a post-Saddam Iraq."
The major difference between the two resolutions is that the version agreed upon by the House and the president today authorizes Mr. Bush to use force to enforce "all relevant" United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq, leaving the White House free to determine what is relevant. In contrast, the Biden-Lugar language specifies that force is authorized to secure the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and its ballistic missile program or to defend the United States and its allies against those programs.
Mr. Biden said he would still seek a vote on his version, but conceded that the day's developments would peel away Republican support for his measure and make him unlikely to succeed. "I'm a realist," he said. Later in the day, supporters of the Biden-Lugar approach said they were unlikely to offer their version as a separate resolution and would instead try to change the language in a final resolution.
Mr. Gephardt's agreement with Mr. Bush, which angered some in his party, was pivotal to the deal announced today in the Rose Garden and put holdouts in the Senate Democratic caucus in a corner.
Two centrist Democrats -- Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Evan Bayh of Indiana -- quickly joined forces with Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and John Warner of Virginia and introduced in the Senate the version of the resolution that the House and White House had agreed to.
"This should not be about politics," Mr. Gephardt said as he stood next to Mr. Bush in the Rose Garden. "We have to do what is right for the security of the nation."
Mr. Warner then recalled in his time at the podium that Congress gave Mr. Bush's father authority to wage war against Mr. Hussein in the Persian Gulf war. "Mr. President, we delivered for your father," Mr. Warner said. "We will deliver for you."
In Iraq, allied aircraft launched an air strike in the southern no-fly zone after Iraqi aircraft penetrated the restricted area, defense officials said today, bringing to 45 the number of strikes reported this year by the United States and the United Kingdom coalition put together to patrol zones set up to protect Iraqi minorities, after the 1991 Gulf War.
"They placed a mobile radar south of the 33rd parallel," the boundary for the southern zone, said Cmdr. Frank Merriman of the Navy, spokesman for Central Command in Tampa, Fla. "And they flew military aircraft into the zone."
He declined to say how many Iraqi aircraft.
Coalition planes responded, targeting precision-guided weapons at the radar at Al Kut, some 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, at 5 p.m. Eastern daylight time on Tuesday, a statement from the command said. It was the sixth time in a month that coalition aircraft have struck at Al Kut, targeting it also on Aug. 29 and 30 and Sept. 5, 7 and 9. Pentagon officials said Iraqis keep moving mobile radar equipment to the area.
Another Defense Department official said today that a top Qaeda operative was in Baghdad about two months ago, causing United States officials to suspect that his presence was known to Mr. Hussein.
Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian, is believed to have left Iraq, the official said. United States counterterrorism officials have called Mr. Zarqawi, also known as Ahmad Fadeel al-Khalaylah, one of Al Qaeda's top two dozen leaders. 
His activities and contacts in Iraq are not known, but his presence in Baghdad apparently was a factor in the Bush administration's recent volley of accusations with the Iraqi government.
As the United States threatens war against Iraq, the administration has sought to play up reports of those contacts to further vilify Mr. Hussein.

HEADLINE: Industry Asks Bush to End Port Shutdown; Talks Are Set 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 2 

 BODY:
Industry groups representing hundreds of businesses called on President Bush today to use his emergency powers to reopen 29 West Coast ports closed in a contract dispute, as the longshoremen's union and port operators agreed to meet with a mediator on Thursday.
 The West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents companies that rely on imports, including Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Toyota and Panasonic, sent Mr. Bush a letter calling for immediate action to open the ports, which handle $300 billion in cargo a year. "We implore you to take whatever steps are necessary to reopen the nation's West Coast ports," the coalition wrote. "While we have always favored mediation, we believe some action must be taken before the economy suffers further damage. We strongly urge you not to delay in your actions, as each day imposes hardships and costs on a wide range of American industry, their customers, their employees and their shareholders." 
 Under the Taft-Hartley Act, the president can order work to resume in an 80-day cooling-off period in labor disruptions that endanger "the national health or safety." 
With the ports shut since last weekend, many businesses say they are already hurting. Chiquita is worried about a boatload of bananas that has not been unloaded, while political leaders in Hawaii are voicing fears about obtaining basic supplies from the mainland. Officials at an auto assembly plant run jointly by General Motors and Toyota in the San Francisco Bay area said it would shut down on Thursday, idling 5,100 workers.
A federation of trucking groups also wrote to Mr. Bush today, urging him to reopen the ports, a day after the National Retail Federation made the same request. Officials with the American Farm Bureau Federation said they were asking other farm groups to sign a draft letter, to be sent to the White House that urges the president "to pursue all options available to you to reopen the ports and force a resumption of shipping." 
Several studies estimate that the shutdown is costing the nation's economy $1 billion a day. 
But escalating calls for federal intervention could create political difficulties for Mr. Bush. Organized labor strongly opposes White House intervention to reopen the ports at a time when the president and Congressional Republicans are vigorously courting several large labor unions. 
At a news briefing, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, was repeatedly asked about Mr. Bush invoking the Taft-Hartley law and responded that the administration was considering all its options. 
As President Bush did on Tuesday, Mr. Fleischer urged the two sides to work with a federal mediator to resolve their differences. 
"What's important is that this does have the risk of impacting and hurting the economy," Mr. Fleischer said. 
After port operators urged the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to use a mediator, the union agreed today to use a mediator when talks resume on Thursday. 
The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, closed the ports and locked out 10,500 longshoremen on Sunday night after complaining that the workers were engaged in a slowdown. The longshoremen said they were working more slowly because they were taking precautions for safety after five longshoremen died this year.
Both sides agree that the major issues are management's effort to introduce new technology to speed cargo handling and the union's demand to retain many jobs under its jurisdiction.
The nation's top labor leaders vigorously urged the president not to invoke Taft-Hartley. James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the union that Republicans are courting most vigorously, said, "We strongly oppose any decision to impose Taft-Hartley in this situation or the use of federal troops to replace the locked-out workers. Such actions would be viewed as open union-busting by the Teamsters and all of labor."
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, said that the labor federation "is opposed to government intervention in the lockout at the West Coast ports." 
A factor complicating White House deliberations is that even if Mr. Bush orders the ports reopened, it would be hard for him to ensure that the longshoremen do not resume a slowdown. A leading California Democrat with close ties to organized labor asked Mr. Bush to order a cooling-off period because of growing concern over economic damage to their state. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said that if the two sides failed to agree to reopen the ports by the end of the week, Mr. Bush should invoke Taft-Hartley. "With our nation in the economic doldrums and at the brink of war, we cannot afford to have this dispute cause further damage to our economy," she said.
James Spinosa, president of the longshoremen's union, denounced the idea of a cooling-off period, saying it would be a union-busting technique. Unions traditionally oppose back-to-work injunctions because they have been used to weaken labor's hand.
Tom Edwards, the Northern California director of the Maritime Association, said his group was not calling for a cooling-off period. "Our desire is to negotiate an agreement with the union that would not require the use of such an injunction," he said.

CHRYSLER EXPANDS INCENTIVES ON 2003 MODELS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler is expanding the availability of some no-interest loans and lowering interest rates on other 2003 models as it adjusts its strategy of offering fewer sales incentives than General Motors and Ford Motor, its rivals in the United States. Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, will offer five-year no-interest loans on minivans and 2.9 percent 60-month loans on all 2003 cars that had carried 4.9 percent financing, said a spokesman, Marc Henretta. Cash rebates rose as high as $2,500 from $1,500, he said.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A Passion for Collecting And Sharing the Bounty

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Art collecting, as someone said, is a form of enlightened opportunism. It's also an addiction. Unless you happen to be Peter the Great, with a taxable empire at your command, you have to strategize pretty carefully -- meaning, use your brains -- about what you pick up, how much you pay and where your shopping is taking you. 
 For economy's sake you may find it useful to focus on unexplored or unfashionable terrain. You'll want to chat up expert advisers: dealers, historians, people like that. And you'll need to develop a temperate faith in your own instincts, to help you make or resist that hair-raising big buy, but also to alert you to that weird little nothing you almost ignored that's giving off jackpot vibes. 
 The American collectors Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, have been doing all of this, and doing it with flair, for years. They had a running start, it's true. Mr. Thaw is a retired art dealer; he knows what networking is and can find his way around an auction room. But it's the mix of qualities they've brought to the game that gives them an edge: intelligent eyes, an ungovernable acquisitive habit and an unusually wide range of interests. 
These qualities are evident in two concurrent New York showcases of their acquisitions. One is at the Morgan Library, the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; both represent major and very different gifts to the respective institutions. 
The selection of more than 100 European drawings and oil sketches at the Morgan is the latest update on a personal collection of drawings the Thaws have been depositing at the Morgan in increments since 1975. The last show of such work in 1994 left viewers a bit lightheaded it was so good. This one has a lot going for it, too.
The Met exhibition of Eurasian metal objects is comparably spectacular, though more esoteric. The 200 or so miniature sculptures -- many small enough to dangle from a key chain -- are associated with nomadic peoples who traveled the vast plains from northern China to the Black Sea in the first millennium B.C. Although they transformed every culture they touched, almost nothing is known of their lives. And their art is almost as much of a novelty to most art historians as it was to the Thaws when they started to buy it. 
"The Thaw Collection: Master Drawings and Oil Sketches, Acquisitions Since 1994" at the Morgan is the fourth exhibition of its kind. At the time of the last one, the Thaws announced that they would be buying no more drawings. That was it. Finito. Books closed. It turns out they've been buying like mad for the past eight years, and here's a whole show of new things. Overall it may be not quite as thrilling as its predecessor, but its best entries are every bit as good. 
Top among them is a pen-and-ink drawing by Rembrandt titled "The Bulwark De Rose and the Windmill De Smeerpot in Amsterdam," apparently dashed off outdoors in a neighborhood on the edge of town. The homely vista includes city walls, dumpy sheds and a funky old mill known as "the Grease Pot." Most passers-by probably never looked twice at any of this. Rembrandt looked at least once, with comprehensive attention, and got it down.
Among other outstanding entries in an exhibition organized by William M. Griswold, a former curator at the Morgan, and Cara Dufour Denison, the library's curator of drawings and prints, I'll mention just a few. One is a graphite drawing of a derelict cottage by Jacob van Ruisdael. Rembrandt apart, the Thaw collection is short on Dutch works, but this gem makes up for a lot. 
Another is a chalk study by Degas for his sculpture "Little Dancer." Here, as in so much of this hot-cold artist's art, the human form looks simultaneously robotic and evanescent. There's a chatty letter from van Gogh to Gauguin on display, which includes a sketch of the famous "Bedroom at Arles." It's a treat. So is a charming pencil portrait of Seurat by Henri Edmond Cross, with a dusky Seurat crayon landscape, seemingly composed of fine black hairs, beside it. 
A cluster of German and Scandinavian pieces exudes a piney, Romantic air. A village scene by Joseph Anton Koch is basically a set for "Der Freischutz." An Adolphe von Menzel portrait of a sleeping pupil is punctilious and humane. An immaculate drawing of an infant by Philipp Otto Runge is a souvenir of this sweet, short-lived artist's "Small Morning," a supremely odd allegorical painting that is a highlight of any trip to Hamburg. 
The news, I guess, is the presence of some 40 oil sketches, mostly plein-air landscapes, a medium the Thaws haven't acquired in depth before. Examples by Constable and Corot offer familiar satisfactions, but the most memorable work comes from a Dane (Johan Thomas Lundbye), a Norwegian (Johan Christian Clausen Dahl), and the Antwerp-born Simon-Joseph-Alexander-Clement Denis, who paints the Italian campagna as a mystical region of rainbows and apocalyptic light.
Most entries, though, make a tepid impression: high-skill performances unenlivened by imagination. Personally I'd trade every one of them for "Oak Tree and Beech, Lullingstone Park," by Samuel Palmer. For about a decade in his late teens and 20's, he was one of the great 19th-century visionaries, a worthy child of Blake, whom he knew. In the Thaw piece, which blends drawing and painting, trees twist with an almost pathological energy, and colors seethe along the horizon like flames. At some point, I'm not sure why, Palmer lost his spark and never recovered it. But when he had it, as he does here, he's on fire. 
Does the Morgan show have anything at all in common with "Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes: The Eugene V. Thaw and Other New York Collections" at the Met? One thing, perhaps: an intense interest in the natural world. 
Nearly every one of the bronze, silver and gold objects on display depicts an animal of some sort, real or fantastic, a subject that makes sense for a nomadic people who relied on horses and camels for mobility and on wild game for nourishment and shelter. That said, there is little more we know for sure about them or their art. 
As the show's curator, James C. Y. Watt, chairman of the Met's department of Asian art, points out, historians and anthropologists have paid scant attention to the Eurasian steppe cultures, most of which have been lumped together under generic labels like "Scythian" or, not all that long ago, barbarian.
Why so? These people had a huge impact on the civilizations of Classical Greece, Achaemenid Iranian and what we now identify as dynastic China. In fact, by introducing horseback riding, lost-wax casting, and possibly stringed instruments and depictions of landscape to China, nomads may have helped create art traditionally identified and promoted as quintessentially "Chinese." 
Neither Mr. Watt, nor Emma C. Bunker, the author of the exhibition catalog, attempts to break scholarly ground with the show or to address the tempests that rage within a contentious, if underpopulated academic field. For better or worse, they present the Thaw material unscientifically by function and type -- harness fittings, weapons, personal ornaments -- thus throwing the emphasis on its aesthetic appeal to a contemporary audience. 
The attraction is powerful. Naturalistic depiction is closely observed and superbly rendered, whether in a snarling bronze cat, which served as a harness ornament in the sixth-fourth century B.C., or a crouching camel on a gilded belt plaque made hundreds of years later. And stylization is audacious, in extent and degree. A deer-shaped garment plaque, with one huge round eye and writhing bird-headed antlers, is a hallucinatory vision of a mythical beast. It is also an image found in near-identical form all across the steppes for centuries, though its meanings are uncertain. 
Particularly fascinating are the many objects that point to direct and complex interactions between nomadic peoples and China. The image of a composite horselike creature on a belt buckle from the third century B.C. represents a motif brought from the Black Sea to the northern border of China and then into China itself, where it has been found decorating a typical Chinese lacquer box in Hunan province far to the south.
A gilded belt plaque dated to the first century B.C. carries still more dramatic implications. With its scene of camels and wild boars set in a mountain landscape, it may be Chinese-made but modeled on a nomadic prototype. Was the plaque intended for a Chinese or a nomadic clientele? Is the landscape depicted Chinese in origin or inspired by some other source? And either way, did a tradition of landscape depiction in Asian art begin approximately here?
None of these questions can be answered at present. But the Thaw collection, by significantly fleshing out the Met's existing holdings -- the belt buckle with the horselike creature arrived at the museum in 1918 -- is sure to push scholarship forward.
It automatically does other things, too. It punches further holes in the old imperial myth of China's cultural purity. It challenges departments within the Met that have until fairly recently maintained some distance from one another to fully acknowledge how intimately linked they are. And it helps formulate a nuanced picture of an ancient world that, while operating at a different speed of transmission, is very much like our own: at once globally connected and resolutely heterogeneous. 
In short, the Met and Morgan exhibitions are proof of a superlative yield for the Thaw's investment of time, money and passion. Mr. Thaw has modestly described his collecting as "therapy for an obsession I could not control." We are all beneficiaries of his dependency.

"The Thaw Collection: Master Drawings and Oil Sketches, Acquisitions Since 1994" is at the Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, through Jan. 19. "Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes: The Eugene V. Thaw and Other New York Collections" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 5.

It's the Forsytes, Reduxing Again

BYLINE:  By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
Oh, the English and their wacky sense of humor! Mark Thompson, the chief executive of Channel 4 in Britain, recently gave a lecture about the state of television and said, "When you're looking for ambitious, complex and above all modern TV, you find yourself watching not British, but American pieces." To American viewers that idea rings with a Monty Pythonesque absurdity that could keep us howling with laughter all season. If American television represents the avant-garde, we're all in very deep trouble (even though Mr. Thompson was right in citing the anomalous "Six Feet Under" and "24" as models of innovation).
 His provocative remark is especially resonant as a new version of "The Forsyte Saga" arrives, revealing how global and how topsy-turvy the television world has become. In the dark ages before cable, about 30 years ago, British television was routinely, if wrongly, considered the standard Americans could scarcely hope to achieve. All that started with the once-and-future "Forsyte Saga." 
 With its new eight-hour version of the Forsytes (beginning with a two-hour episode Sunday and continuing for the next six weeks), "Masterpiece Theater" on PBS literally goes back to its roots. In 1969 a 26-part black-and-white series imported from the BBC was such a smash that it led directly to the creation of "Masterpiece Theater," which carried on the tradition "The Forsyte Saga" had inaugurated: that of the refined soap opera, in which British class and money give an intellectual veneer to costume dramas about lives run amok. Now "Masterpiece Theater" is a catchphrase, both scorned and beloved, for reliable, entertaining escapes into a cozy, prettily designed past, the middle-brow version of a guilty pleasure.
Today's "Forsyte Saga" (jointly produced by Granada TV of England and WGBH in Boston; the BBC had nothing to do with it) fits comfortably in that tradition, sometimes too comfortably for its own good. Based on "The Man of Property" and "In Chancery," the first two books of John Galsworthy's "Forsyte Saga" trilogy, it has the soothing appeal of sinking into a distant world, this one about an upper-middle-class family fraught with infighting and facing social changes as Victorian England gives way to the modern age.
Those familiar themes seem fresh, thanks to three stunning performances. Damian Lewis is Soames Forsyte, a man of property and of excruciating propriety; with his red hair, cool blue eyes and pinched mouth, the actor's very presence suggests the complex, deeply buried passion that destroys Soames. Rupert Graves is his bohemian cousin, an artist known in the family as Young Jolyon; Mr. Graves gives life and substance to a character who, as written, could easily have become a caricature. And Corin Redgrave, wearing huge mutton chops, is endearing as Young Jolyon's father, Old Jolyon, who at first cuts off his disreputable son but in old age becomes open-minded enough to embrace him.
There is a major casting problem in the center, though. As Irene (pronounced eye-REE-nee), the woman who entrances all three of these Forsyte men, Gina McKee's enervated performance makes the character's supposedly irresistible allure hard to accept.
The streamlined, lucid script introduces the complicated Forsyte family at an engagement party in 1874. Soames's sister, Winifred, is about to marry Montague Dartie, who will prove himself a ne'er-do-well many times during the quarter-century the story covers. As the steadfast and sometimes mischievous Winifred, Amanda Root is one of many actors who charmingly fill the secondary roles of aunts, uncles and cousins.
"Soames, you're such a stick!" Winifred tells her oh-so-proper brother, an irrefutable comment that makes Soames an unlikely character to hold a series together. And the tension between the old and new social orders, which had so obvious a contemporary echo in 1969, seems more remote today. But Mr. Lewis (who was also powerfully subdued as Dick Winters, the laconic hero of "Band of Brothers") overcomes these obstacles, suggesting a passion so profound and repressed that Soames himself cannot fathom it. When he meets Irene, who is living in genteel near-poverty with her stepmother, he goes after her with the single-minded determination of a man who assumes his wealth can buy him anything. Irene gives in, but by Episode 2 the entire family knows she has a separate bedroom.
As Irene, Ms. McKee (best known as Hugh Grant's wheelchair-bound friend in "Notting Hill") is dramatic looking, with pale skin, dark hair and strong features. But she relies on those looks almost exclusively. "I am not a cold person," Irene says in a monotone when her mother-in-law, Emily (Barbara Flynn), stops by for tea and to offer advice on wifely duties. We're meant to find Irene sympathetic, but she seems as big a stick as her husband.
Soames and Irene's misbegotten marriage provides some of the most dynamic scenes, as Soames's frustration eventually explodes and he rapes his wife, an act that is full of drunken violence but is also informed by his legalistic sense of what was considered his right in Victorian England. Soames is a self-righteous prig, but in Mr. Lewis's nuanced performance he is also incredibly sad. When Soames despairingly takes to his bed and his mother says, "You feel things too much, you always have," we know she is right, though no one else in the world would guess it.
Young Jolyon follows a different path from the start, when he leaves his wife and young daughter, June, because he is in love with his daughter's governess. Cut off by his family, he trades in his slicked-back hair for longer bohemian locks and a hardscrabble life as a painter. He also begins wearing a wide-brimmed hat, just in case we didn't notice the difference between the freely loving Jolyon and his rigid, top-hatted cousin Soames.
The script and direction, generally so fluid, at times become excruciating in their bluntness, setting up the simple-minded equation that artists are good and passionate, while the money men are bad and cold. As a young woman, June (Gillian Kearney) falls for a penniless but brilliant architect, Philip Bosinney (Ioan Gruffudd, the star of the "Horatio Hornblower" series). When Bosinney designs a country house for Soames and Irene (he's such a genius that he anticipates Frank Lloyd Wright by years), he falls in love with Irene, in scenes that telegraph their desire with every blatant glance.
The other actors handle their romances with Irene more believably. Mr. Redgrave is especially deft in revealing how Old Jolyon's heart softens as he ages. His scenes with Irene are deeply moving as he displays the enduring life and passion in an old man's infatuation with a younger woman, rather than its potential foolishness. By the end of the series, the social rules have changed, the country is mourning Queen Victoria and the youngest generation of Forsytes marches off to be soldiers and nurses in the Boer War.
This story goes on and on, though. A second series, based on the final book in the "Forsyte Saga" trilogy, has just begun filming. And a third, based on Galsworthy's subsequent novels about the family, has been planned. Together, these three series will eventually cover the same ground as the old BBC version. And that old version itself, rarely seen now, will be released on DVD early next year.
Although the new "Forsyte Saga" cannot recreate the story's historic role in television, its revitalized characters offer a delightful escape. And if there is little innovation involved, at least part of the blame belongs to the homogenized, global reach of television. When Mr. Thompson of Channel 4 discusses the economic model that makes British television so fearful of taking risks, he could just as well be talking about American networks. We share the same discouraging prospects; no wonder it's soothing to turn to the past.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Retrospective Salutes an Indian Actress and Activist

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
After watching a few films starring the Indian actress and political activist Shabana Azmi, you quickly learn to identify how she uses her eyes -- especially since she often plays characters who don't get to express their intelligence.
 "The Actor as Activist: Celebrating Shabana Azmi," a retrospective of her work programmed by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, runs through Oct. 10. It is an offshoot of the New York Film Festival that's also a collaboration with the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival. The program, at the Walter Reade Theater, salutes her work in support of AIDS research, women's rights and civil rights. 
 In the handful of Azmi films I've seen, the actress somehow conveys an eagerness to be heard, no small feat, since the put-upon characters she portrays often cope with punishing chauvinism and class awareness -- conditions that undoubtedly have informed her own consciousness and compelled her to work for change. One of her best performances that I have seen is in the pulpy and entrancing 1997 "Death Sentence," which plays today and again on Sunday.
"Sentence" features Ms. Azmi as the suffering wife of a schemer with a bad hairpiece; he plots the murder of a holy man and assumes the dead man's role, abandoning his wife for his new existence. "Don't make me a widow," she pleads, and the years of hurt stored up in her thoughtful face may make you share her tears. There's as much intrigue and whoppingly engrossing personal drama in "Sentence" as you'd find in several Dickens novels. It starts with a pregnant woman being hounded by an angry mob. She tumbles into a pool of muddy red water, crumpling into the fetal position, and then is flung over a bridge. A magistrate charges into the village, announcing that the crime will not go unpunished. And that's only the first 10 minutes of the picture.
Though there are musical numbers in "Death Sentence," Ms. Azmi doesn't perform them. She does sing in "Congregation," which will be shown next Tuesday and Wednesday, but her mellow yet forceful voice doesn't have the airy, Kewpie-doll pertness we've come to associate with Bollywood. Given that she works mostly in India and has appeared in over 60 films, it's probably axiomatic that she croon her way though at least one movie. But Ms. Azmi has maintained a long-running acting career in more serious films.
In her 1973 debut film, "The Seedling," which will be presented on Sunday, the actress communicates a torn anxiety with minimal exertion. She's a young woman whose widowed mother married her off to a deaf-mute potter when she was a young girl. Still quite young, she's a lotus in bloom and damp with yearning; in the opening of the picture she's praying for a child, something her husband, who's now unemployed and a drunk, can't give her. She's seduced into a relationship with the married owner of the farm where she works. Even the farmer's father calls him "spoilt," but the director, Shyam Benegal, is interested in something richer than potboiler melodrama. The farmer wants to be more than his father, an ambition that included resisting an affair. (His father carried on for years, shaming his mother.) But he's drawn into a relationship with her anyway. When a streak of cowardice is finally revealed, Ms. Azmi gets to perform a monologue of sorrow and rage that's as powerful as any acted by Jane Fonda or Glenda Jackson -- actress-activists with whom she has been compared. Her charismatic and contradictory willowy toughness is evident, and there's more of it in the other pictures in the "Actor as Activist" series.
"The Actor as Activist: Celebrating Shabana Azmi" is at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center through Oct. 10. Tickets: $9.50; $7 for students and $5 for Film Society members. Discounts for 65+ for screenings Mondays through Fridays before 6 p.m. Information and screening schedule: (212) 875-5600.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "RICHARD AVEDON: PORTRAITS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 5). Just eight years after the last Richard Avedon show, here's a survey of portraits. The fashion analogy is obvious: the repackaged product, a clever campaign to market the same old goods. But the show is gorgeous: a pitch-perfect mix of modest-size, big and unbelievably big prints, each an exquisitely made object. Whatever else the works might be, they are unforgettable. Celebrity only partly accounts for their status. Mr. Avedon brings other factors to bear: a sense of spectacle, clinical precision, energy, movement even in static head shots (the figures often seem so tense they look ready to jump out of the pictures) and an irrepressible attraction to power. His career dovetails with the era of the paparazzi, the tell-all media, the obligatory scandals and secret sufferings of the rich and fashionable. You might say he raised this cultural fixation to a neurotic art. The trade-off with him is always between style and substance. It's the conflict of our culture. No wonder his pictures are so embedded in our imagination. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* JUDY CHICAGO: "THE DINNER PARTY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 9). This exhibition welcomes back Ms. Chicago's extravagant installation banquet of ceramic plates and handmade table runners dedicated to 39 women. A feminist landmark, it is joining the permanent collection 22 years after its first appearance at the museum. It is amazing to see. Made with the help of hundreds of volunteers from 1975 to 1979, "The Dinner Party" sums up the first stage of feminist art, reflects the late 70's rematerialization of the art object and is startlingly prescient of the art of the late 80's and 90's in its ambition to be both aggressively visual and politically charged. Despite being almost as much a part of American culture as Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, W.P.A. murals and the AIDS quilt, it still retains much of its original revolutionary fervor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES: REFLECTIONS OF NATURE IN CHINESE PAINTING WITH SELECTIONS FROM THE COLLECTION OF MARIE-HELENE AND GUY WEILL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 9). This show is basically a rotation of the permanent collection, of the kind required to protect light-sensitive silk scrolls and ink-painted album pages. But the Met has a flair for turning necessity into a virtue by reintroducing work along thematic lines and introducing fresh material to lend a sense of event. Such is the case here. At the center of the reinstallation is a group of splendid Ming and Qing dynasty paintings recently given or promised to the museum by the New York collectors Marie-Helene and Guy Weill. They are a genuine attraction in themselves and a logical link in the continuum that this museum's remarkable Chinese holdings span from beginning to end. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).

* EXPOSED: THE VICTORIAN NUDE, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 5). For the latest overview of British naughtiness, you may once again go to (where else?) Brooklyn, for this show of not very prudish Victorian art. "Exposed" has even more naked women without their pubic hair than the last Vanessa Beecroft show at the Gagosian Gallery. The naked young maidens here, shackled to a rock or draped over the oars of a ship (the boatmen bravely stare straight ahead) or riding horses or just standing there with an anaconda wrapped around their bodies are Andromeda, the Sirens, Godiva and Harmonia. The artists include Sargent, Frederic Leighton and Herbert Schmalz, whose "Faithful Unto Death" presents half a dozen or so naked damsels, loosely bound to herms, awaiting lions in the Circus Maximus. Lawrence Alma-Tadema imagines apple-flushed Victorian women soaking in a Roman plunge bath. Fortunately, the show does not stint on genuine porn. Perfume and underwear advertisers today clearly have nothing on the feisty Victorians. The show ends with works by Walter Sickert and Gwen John, artists at the turn of the last century who dispensed with the kinky fantasies of antigravitational breasts and painted what they really saw. From Alma-Tadema to Ms. Beecroft and cold cream commercials. From John and Sickert to Lucian Freud, who could never be confused with Herbert Schmalz. Hours and admissions: See above (Kimmelman)

* "FACING THE MASK" and "RECENT ACQUISITIONS: SELECTIONS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION," Museum for African Art, third floor, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through March 2). The Museum for African Art, formerly of SoHo, makes the leap to a new home in Long Island City, with a very beautiful if surveyish show, "Facing the Mask," which happens to be all about moving. Some of the moving is physical, some psychological and spiritual, and it is embodied in more than 70 stunning masks, no two alike, from across sub-Saharan Africa. Some were used for popular entertainment; others were moral forces incarnate. Their purpose was transport, and they are supplemented by films of masquerades in action. Also on view is a selection of work from the museum's still small but growing permanent collection. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Dec. 1). Over the centuries the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the world's oldest surviving art school (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection of works to instruct its students in the discipline of drawing, which it considered paramount to their training. Among the holdings, those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 on display here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when Classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The show's emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Wicked doings in the Bible, sex in mythology, the ordered schematics of French architecture and the pomp and circumstance of the French court are some of the subjects covered by these drawings, which should send any aficionado to the Frick on the run. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $5 (Grace Glueck).

* "BILL VIOLA: GOING FORTH BY DAY," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). An ambitious meditation on the epic themes of human existence, this frescolike video installation consists of five panels, shot using the latest technology and projected simultaneously on the walls of one huge gallery. Each of the panels deals with a specific theme: rebirth, journey through life, disaster, death and resurrection. Inspired by the works of Renaissance painters like Giotto and Luca Signorelli, it relates as much to still painting as it does to the moving images of cinema and television. For one, except for a few scenes, the action is almost in slow motion, suggesting the stasis of looking at paintings and allowing the viewer to shift attention from panel to panel without losing focus. The liveliest scene is "The Deluge," in which a series of ordinary street events occurs before the facade of a Classical-looking house. They are interrupted by a tumultuous flood pouring out of the building's apertures that sends people running for their lives. The work was mostly shot before the Sept. 11 disaster, but is amazingly prophetic of it. If some of the imagery is corny, it is still a deeply felt and provocative piece of work. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "WINOGRAND 1964," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Dec. 1). In 1964 the photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed America in a slow, black 1957 two-door Ford Fairlaine, taking nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. Here are around 150 of them, most of them never shown before. Some are not terrific. Winogrand was a hit-and-miss artist, and the show could have been edited. But others are great, and together they make a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. A poor skeptic, Winogrand clearly saw the fragility and the preciousness of what binds people together. Many of the pictures seem fragile, too: they're fleeting stories sometimes so provisional as to be barely coherent, irreducible, like life, to a simple message. They record the effects of new places -- airports, malls, suburbia -- that Winogrand recognized before other photographers, along with the peculiar new rituals they inspired. Winogrand captured how America once again transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

GEORGE BASELITZ, "Paintings and Drawings From the 1960's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 2). Before this German Neo-Expressionist started turning his canvases upside down, he made earthy, saturnine paintings and drawings right side up. His gnarly, muddy pictures from the 60's of people and animals have an evocative, primordial quality and sometimes, as in a small ink portrait of a bare-chested Antonin Artaud, a strange delicacy. His new, sketchy and thinly painted upside-down canvases based on Soviet Social Realist images from the 1930's, through tomorrow at PaceWildenstein (534 West 25th Street, Chelsea) are more interesting conceptually than visually (Ken Johnson).

MARKUS LUPERTZ, "Semiramis," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Nov. 16). Titled after the Babylonian Queen Semiramis, creator of the legendary Hanging Gardens, Mr. Lupertz's paintings, in which rectangles of florid, clotted Abstract Expressionist painting are set off within internal borders, might be a meditation on beauty and decadence. Superficially, these medium-size canvases by the head of the Dusseldorf Academy of Art resemble the paintings of Howard Hodgkin, but they are animated more by oblique irony than by lyrical hedonism (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

TOLAND GRINNELL, "A Mobile Home and Other Necessities," Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through Oct. 19). This artist goes to even greater lengths than usual to state the obvious, handmaking a 31-piece suite of luggage that has all the comforts of the most luxurious Upper East Side co-op apartment to remind us that we live in an era of material excess. The works have an empty-headed muscle-bound perfection in which message is overwhelmed by medium. But the impeccable pale yellow caning with forest green leather trim should be optioned by Vuitton or Hermes pronto (Smith).

* "THE HEAVENLY TREE GROWS DOWNWARD: SELECTED WORKS BY HARRY SMITH, PHILIP TAAFFE AND FRED TOMASELLI," James Cohan Gallery, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through Oct. 19). Smith (1923-1991) is best known for his archival recording project "Anthology of American Folk Music." But he was also a filmmaker and an inventive painter. Some of his paintings and early films are shown here, and they reflect his many interests, from alchemy and psychoactive drugs to jazz and modernist art. He is joined in this show by two fine contemporary painters, Mr. Taaffe and Mr. Tomaselli, who admire his work and, in different ways, share his sensibility. Mr. Taaffe's contribution adds up to a laboratory of new ideas; Mr. Tomaselli shows some of his best collage-paintings to date (Cotter).

SOL LeWITT, "New Wall Drawings," PaceWildenstein Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through Oct. 12). For Mr. LeWitt, a white wall is a challenge, like a bare stage to a choreographer. At PaceWildenstein he has attacked the pristine walls with bold onslaughts of color, orchestrating red, yellow, blue, purple, orange and green into six continuous geometric drawings that form a spectacular color environment. The most dazzling runs more than 58 feet and is 12 feet high. It consists of bars of different lengths and colors played off against one another lengthwise, crosswise and diagonally on a ground of vivid red. A contrapuntal romp (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

* KAFFE FASSETT, "Pattern as Obsession," Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through Oct. 26) Notwithstanding the exhibition's title, this London artist is less obsessed than delightfully inventive in using the domestic arts of knitting, needlepoint, rug hooking and sewing to produce colorful, optically absorbing essays in patternmaking. A funky, folk-art-like quality is belied by the sophisticated play with harmony and dissonance (Johnson).

* 25TH ANNIVERSARY BENEFIT SELECTIONS EXHIBITION, the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Oct. 26). Nearly 400 drawings by artists who have previously exhibited at this valuable institution over the last 25 years create an initial impression of wondrous creative fertility. With extended looking, one starts to feel a certain leveling decorousness, but there are intriguing oddities, like Stavit Allweis's picture of a wild-eyed girl in a pool of water, a kind of surrealistic fairy painting (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

WILLIE COLE, "Before and After," Alexander & Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through Oct. 12). Mr. Cole continues to toy subversively with icons of Western culture: the Virgin as a suicide bomber; the Last Supper as a gathering of gun-toting terrorists; photographs of old irons that resemble African masks; bicycles reconstructed to resemble Cubist spins on African antelope sculptures; a pool table reduced to the cruciform intersection of green-felt gutters (Johnson)

WILL COTTON, Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929 (through Oct. 19). With a dry, thin touch, Mr. Cotton continues to paint giant images of supersweet desserts, like flans in a lake of syrup, that are more repulsive than mouth-watering. His project might be a comment on a culture of instantaneous gratification. Now he has added to the mix nubile young women, naked or in underwear. Dusted with sugar, drenched in chocolate or smeared with frosting, these misty dream girls loll about in hypoglycemic dazes (Johnson).

* FERUS, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111 (through Oct. 19). A tribute to the life, times and art of Ferus, the farsighted gallery that was arguably the point of origin of the Los Angeles art scene but that also reflected its artistic moment -- the fertile decade from 1957 to 1967 -- as fully as any New York gallery. Major works by Ed Ruscha, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Larry Bell and Jay DeFeo and others make the show a museum-caliber treat (Smith).

* MICHAEL HURSON, Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105 (through Oct. 12). At the heart of this show are seven drawings done from a reproduction of Seurat's painting "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." They reiterate the painting's gliding figures and majestic recession of space, while replacing its seamless surface with the quirky, slightly anxious, multitextured intimacy that Mr. Hurson has developed over the years and puts to excellent use here (Smith).

* ROBERT MELEE, "You Me and Her," Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through Oct. 12). Picasso had his wives and lovers. William Wegman has his Weimaraners. Mr. Melee has his mother. She is the muse of his current show and, as always, an arresting presence: past middle age, partial to Phyllis Diller wigs, Alice Cooper eyeliner and alcohol, she is the subject of photographs and videos notable for their mingling of affection and aggression. They exist in some transcendently abject universe where inhibitions and animosities fall where they may, where perversity is pleasure and decay a kind of innocence. You may not want to live there, but you won't forget your visit in a hurry (Cotter).

"THE MICROWAVE," Cristinerose/Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Oct. 19). "Words have become the disease of the information era," announces the oracular publicity release for this intriguing 11-artist group exhibition. Be that as it may, most of the participants play at transforming the textual into the visual. The ghosts of film subtitles haunt Stefana McClure's minimalist color fields; Stephen Sollins whites out words from television schedules; Marco Maggi constructs miniature architectural models by cutting into reams of typing paper; and Jacob El Hanani draws allover fields of eye-strainingly fine abstract calligraphy (Johnson).

JOAN MITCHELL, HORACE BRISTOL, Robert Miller Gallery, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through Oct. 12). A selection of works from four decades by the estimable Abstract Expressionist Joan Mitchell includes some especially fine, sensuously gnarly examples from the late 1950's and early 60's. Bristol, an early Life magazine staff photographer, made photographs for the Navy in the 1940's. His clean, romantic, sepia images of planes parked on aircraft carriers or flying in formation and group portraits of sailors on and off the job look more like film stills than journalistic documents. They have an odd resonance now in a time of war anxiety and patriotic agitation (Johnson).

YOSHIYUKI MIURA, Von Lintel Gallery, 555 West 25th Street, (212) 242-0599 (through Oct. 12). Using industrial materials, Mr. Miura makes sculptures as visually gripping as they are physically seductive. The centerpiece here is a circular work consisting of hundreds of vertical steel rods, each with a golden bronze tip, which grow taller as they progress concentrically from the center. The geometric order gives way to shifting, optically pulsating patterns of radiating, glinting gold dots and vibrating black verticals (Johnson).

ANTONIO PETRACCA, "Forecast: Sunny and Clear, High in the Low 80's," Kim Foster, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 229-0044 (through Oct. 12). Rendering cropped, snapshot images of the twin towers, construction cranes and ground zero workers with a fine eye for light and a soft yet exacting touch, this Battery Park City painter has produced a low-key meditation on 9/11 (Johnson).

ELLIOTT PUCKETTE, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through Oct. 12). Ms. Puckette continues to work with her trademark device of crisp, tapering white lines that suggest improvisations by an 18th-century engraver. The whiplash calligraphy is cut with a razor into blotchy, watery fields of gray or a single color painted on wooden panels, but it gives the impression of floating in front of atmospheric space as though it were painted on glass. The play between surface and depth is appealing, in part because it seems so ripe for further complication and development (Johnson).

* JULIA SCHER, "Security by Julia XLV: Security Landscapes"; RICKY SWALLOW, "Tomorrow in Common," Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through Oct. 12). Ms. Scher's latest installation is like a prison camp in a zany parallel universe. Within a spiral, cyclone fence structure, lights flash, overhead fans spin, computer-driven monitors track viewer movements and speakers broadcast peculiar announcements in a woman's voice: "Your sensate probes are being measured now." Mr. Swallow's remarkable carved wood sculptures -- a tire, a down sleeping bag -- look like actual objects that were turned to wood by a sorcerer (Johnson).

Other Galleries

KAREN BARTH, Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424 (through Oct. 12). Ms. Barth squeegees, smears, puddles and otherwise manipulates paint into lush, layered abstractions. At once spacey and sensuously material, they call to mind Gerhard Richter's abstract paintings but they are unambiguously romantic (Johnson).

* "BETWEEN WORD AND IMAGE: MODERN IRANIAN VISUAL CULTURE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Dec. 7). This no-frills exhibition is about the dynamics of cultural borrowing, the inseparability of art and politics, and the interplay of modernism and Islamicism. It begins with painting and sculptures from the 1960's in which Western styles and Iranian themes merge. It continues with riveting photographs documenting the arrival of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And it concludes with art that the revolution produced: political posters inspired by both the Western counterculture and militant Islamic ideology. Depending on the amount of synthetic thinking you're willing to do, the results can seem richly layered, or disjointed and undercooked. But the materials and the ideas on display are fascinating (Cotter).

Last Chance

ANN CRAVEN, Klemens Gasser & Tanja Grunert Inc., 524 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-9494 (through tomorrow). At first glance you might think Ms. Craven's paintings take off rather prettily on real creatures. But no, these deer and birds are fakey simulacra, the kinds of wildlife found on greeting cards and kitschy calendars. The deer, or dear, as Ms. Craven prefers to call them, pose fetchingly in green grass; the birds, of mixed ancestry and shrill plumage, perch on branches against blurry floral backgrounds. But this sprightly, deliberately slick artificial aviary goes on too long. After all, there isn't much new in the story of kitsch befouling nature (Glueck).

* MATT MARELLO, "The Pollock Project," Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144 (through Monday). This wry yet mythically resonant meditation on the cult of the Dionysian artist features video projections in which the artist has digitally inserted himself into clips of Jackson Pollock painting, the Led Zepplin percussionist John Bonham drumming and the action-movie star Bruce Lee performing with nunchakus. A fourth shows the view from a car driving at night. Actual drumsticks, nunchaku sticks and a paintbrush, all carved from wood found near the site of Pollock's fatal car crash, are displayed in a vitrine like sacred relics (Johnson).

ALIX PEARLSTEIN, "Episode," Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444 (through tomorrow). The basic tensions of family life are the subject of a breakthrough video installation, enacted with comic flair yet emotional accuracy by four able actors who never say a word. With the help of a constantly roving, tilting camera and all-white background, the work has a loopy spatial quality that can even set in motion the viewer who wants to keep up with the action, which is projected on opposite walls (Smith).

"POP PATRIOTISM," Momenta Art, 72 Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058 (through Sunday). This group show satirizes commercial exploitation of post 9/11 patriotism. Thomas Sherrod's lovingly painted teddy bear paints stars and stripes on a dollar sign in the sky; David Opdyke's "Suburbanistan" remaps Afghanistan as a suburban tract; Christy Rupp offers "Taliban Barbie," the real doll in a burka; Heidi Schlatter's video compiles a montage of narcissistic pop stars singing patriotic anthems; and the show's curator, Peter Scott, displays his collection of red-white-and-blue kitsch, including keychains, magazine covers and flip-flop sandals (Johnson).

SCOTT RICHTER, Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-9666 (through tomorrow). Mr. Richter piles up pigment on tables or wall plaques in luscious, thick, gooey layers that make the viewer long for a lick. The works need no other justification for their existence than the pure pleasure of paint, yet they do have references, to Pop Art, to Minimalism, to the Hudson River School, to the palettes of different painters admired by Mr. Richter, even to world events. The piece de resistance is a table, "Big Sky," dedicated to Frederic E. Church. It celebrates the romantic tints of the Hudson River School, whose canvases made the American wilderness into gorgeous stage sets. A smooth, shiny, hardened wall of paint sweeps up from the back edge of the table, its nuanced sunset colors shimmering over a flat yellowish-orange ground that ends at the table's front edge in thick encrustations and gobbets of paint. It evokes those sublime landscapes, yet gives new dimensions to paint as its own subject (Glueck).

"SACRED MATTER: KAREN DOLMANISTH AND DEBORAH MASTERS," Smack Mellon Studios, 56 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761 (through Sunday). Installation art is well suited to the accumulative and performance-based modes of creation seen in this joint show of two artists at mid-career. Ms. Masters, best known for her figurative sculpture, presents an assemblage-style environment in which she tells the story of her life through thousands upon thousands of hoarded objects arranged in a series of altars. Ms. Dolmanisth's installation is a circular enclosure made from upright branches; dresses and nightshirts hang from the ceiling above it like an airborne audience to a ritual (Cotter)

* MISSY STEVENS, "A Year of Change"; PRUE VENABLES, "Objects," Nancy Margolis Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 343-9523 (through tomorrow). Using needle, thread and beads, Ms. Stevens makes tiny, tightly knit tapestries of riveting optical and material richness. Her images may seem whimsically simple-minded, but as in the poetry of Emily Dickinson, formal ingenuity and heartfelt moods ranging from ecstasy to grief give the work a depth that belies the seemingly naive surface. Ms. Venables's classical serene domestic ceramics nicely complement Ms. Stevens's busy quirkiness (Johnson)

IVAN WITENSTEIN AND DAN FISCHER, Derek Eller Gallery, 526-530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411 (through tomorrow). Each of the seven fiberglass and cast-resin sculptures in Mr. Witenstein's impressive New York solo debut, titled "Here Comes the Son, Here Comes the Knight," is like a psychedelic version of American-style Social Realism, with references to war, racism, popular culture, 19th-century literature and 20th-century history molded together with a visionary zeal. Mr. Fischer revisits photo-realism in detail-perfect graphite drawings based on magazine illustrations of art world stars past and present. These images look every bit as weird as the figures in Mr. Witenstein's sculptures, and are no less virtuosically made (Cotter).

The Rhythm of Utah's Highway 12: Climb, Turn, Gasp

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW BROWN 

 BODY:
UTAH took nearly four decades to build all 122 miles of its Highway 12. Sporadically from the 1940's to the 1980's, construction crews blasted, cut and paved their way through rugged hills and cliffs. Initially, the road was built to move cattle, supplies and mail for the people in five small towns in the southern part of the state -- even now, their total population is less than 2,000. But when the last stretch, over the massive and heavily forested Boulder Mountain, was finally paved in 1985, it didn't take travelers (and tourism promoters) long to discover that this two-lane farm-to-market road was also the best tour of Utah's red-rock desert that can be taken in a short trip, a weekend or even a single day.
 It's a path through some of the most diverse and stunning scenery on the Colorado Plateau, linking Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef National Parks, and many who take it aren't making their first visit. On each trip, there's something new to discover -- a side road or trail leading to an overlook or a waterfall, the colors and smells of a new season, a new place to eat. The road is passable year-round, and the gold leaves of aspen trees on Boulder Mountain were added last week to the palette of greens, reds, browns and tans in the rocks and vegetation along the route. 
 Even people who live here can't easily resist the attraction of the landscape. "Every day it still affects me," said Louise Liston, a former commissioner of Garfield County, Utah, who lives in Escalante, the largest (with 1,063 people) of the towns along the highway. She moved to Escalante from Milwaukee as a teenager 50 years ago, but, she said, she still feels renewed each morning when she looks out her picture windows at the green junipers and vermilion cliffs of the Escalante Mountains to the north, or at the long dark silhouette of the Kaiparowits Plateau on the southern horizon.
Highway 12 is roughly semicircular, connecting U.S. 89 and State Highway 24. Starting from U.S. 89, the highway ascends to Red Canyon, named for the surrounding hills and cliffs, colored by iodized iron in limestone rock. Two short tunnels hewn out of the limestone suggest what the road builders were up against.
At the 13-mile mark is the turnoff to Bryce Canyon, where throngs of tourists gaze at the brilliant red-orange spires, bridges and other rock formations sculptured by water and wind. A short trip could become a long one if you enter this justly beloved park.
Past the Bryce turnoff, the road descends into Bryce Valley and the town of Tropic, named by settlers in 1892 for its seemingly mild climate. Like most towns along Highway 12, Tropic has a Mormon church and a cluster of houses; it's not uncommon to spot people gathered to celebrate a holiday, birthday or family reunion.
Like the others, too, it has a facade of recently built convenience stores, restaurants and motels. The rental cars, sport utility vehicles and motorcycles zooming along with the occasional farmers' pickups have had their effect. The area's economy has expanded from cattle ranching and alfalfa fields to accommodate a growing tourist trade.
Heading southeast, the next town is Cannonville, one of two gateways to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, extending across 1.9 million acres of federally owned land. The area was designated a national monument by the Clinton administration in 1996 to protect the Kaiparowits Plateau from coal mining.
At the monument's visitors' center in Cannonville, Dave Mecham, a member of the staff, warned against turning onto any of the many tempting dirt roads off Route 12 if there is any chance of rain. Some of these roads lead to wilderness where one can hike into sandstone slot canyons narrower than an arm or overlook hollows so deep it's difficult to see the bottom. But a cloudburst on a dirt road in this country can strand the beefiest four-wheel-drive vehicle in a slick, slimy mess. "Locals say, 'All you have to do is spit on the road and you'll get stuck,' " Mr. Mecham said.
From November to March, despite the early impressions of the founders of Tropic, there is also the possibility of snow to consider.
By this point the rhythm of Route 12 has established itself. It's not just the obvious cycle of a car groaning up the hills and coasting down the other side. It's a recurring pattern of building anticipation before a blast of eye-popping scenery, and then a brief lull before the buildup starts again.
The rich geological history of the area accounts for the variation in scenery. Cannonville is surrounded by huge smooth mounds and cliffs of dark reddish brown slickrock, indicating a time of high temperatures and dry conditions during the Jurassic period, when nature laid down this layer of earth. Alan Titus, a paleontologist for the Grand Staircase monument, said the arid climate allowed the iron in the sandstone to oxidize, giving the rock its color.
A few miles later, as the road climbs to Henrieville, it passes through a later stratum, formed when the area was under water and home to more organic life and less oxygen. The result is not so scenic -- a drab gray and brown landscape -- but it is rich in fossils and dinosaur remains. "The area has one of the best records of life on land during the closing days of the age of dinosaurs," Mr. Titus said. He is reluctant to say where these fossils are for fear of looters' ransacking the area before experts can take an inventory of the ancient history embedded in the rock.
Color appears in rocks again as the road heads east into Escalante, where there is a second office for the monument. Slow down to avoid the speed trap and take in the view to the south of alfalfa fields and farmhouses against the background silhouettes of the Fifty-Mile and Navajo Mountains.
The anticipation builds again in the climb out of Escalante, and then peaks as the road winds through a landscape of tan-colored petrified sand dunes, once part of a windblown desert that stretched from Wyoming to southern Nevada. The horizontal lines crisscrossing the ancient dunes indicate the direction the wind blew the sand, which is now rock-hard and dotted with pinyon trees.
The highway bottoms out at the Escalante River, choked with lush green vegetation, and then climbs the side of a rust-colored sandstone cliff and plateaus atop a ridge. That's where a startling vista of the Escalante Canyons, a labyrinth of deep channels breaking up the expanse of petrified dunes, appears. Pull off at a turnout to take in the view. There are no guardrails along this section of Highway 12, which local residents have named the Hogsback, or Little Burma Road, and it snakes along a ridge with fatal dropoffs on either side.
The next town is Boulder, and depending on how much time you've taken to stop and look, you may have made it here in as little as two and a half hours. If it's time for refreshment, Boulder is the spot. The best food along Highway 12 is served there, at either Hell's Backbone Grill (dinner with a glass of wine, $35) or the Burr Trail Grill (pancake breakfast with coffee, $5.90).
Boulder is primarily a ranching community, and its scenes of horses grazing in green pastures surrounded by buff-colored rock hills make it the most picturesque town on the drive. Residents had their mail delivered by horseback until 1935, when the first road from Escalante, Hell's Backbone Road, was completed by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
The final stretch of Highway 12 climbs to an elevation of 9,200 feet over the east side of Boulder Mountain, which sits atop the Aquarius Plateau, before its long descent into the town of Torrey, the gateway to Capitol Reef National Park.
Boulder Mountain is covered with a dense forest of pine and aspen trees. To the east and south of the mountain, in contrast to the alpine setting, is a panorama of pink, red and tan plateaus and cliffs. The silhouettes of the Henry Mountains (the last range to be mapped in the lower 48 states), Navajo Mountain and the Kaiparowits Plateau are in the distance.
At a scenic overlook, a plaque describing the features of the colorful expanse stretching south below the mountain says the area within view is larger than the state of Connecticut. That's plenty of space for those who love the desert for its scenery and solitude.

WHERE TO GO
Hoodoos, Pictographs and a Photogenic Park
Part of the challenge of a drive on Route 12 is deciding which of several beautiful side trips to take. There won't be time for all of them unless you have many days. Here are four of the best.

BRYCE CANYON NATIONAL PARK
Fifty miles of trails take visitors into amphitheaters of unusual orange and pink spires and pinnacles, called hoodoos, shaped primarily by water erosion. The park covers 56 square miles and can be explored by car as well as on foot or horseback. The turnoff for the park is about 13 miles southeast of Highway 12's junction with U.S. 89 and is well marked. The entrance fee is $20 per car.

KODACHROME BASIN STATE PARK
National Geographic photographers named this landscape after the film they used to shoot its towering sand pipes, jutting up to 170 feet in the air. Ancient springs filled up with sediment, solidified and outlasted the softer sandstone, which has eroded away. Turn off the highway at Cannonville. Take the main road south through town for about 10 miles to the park entrance. The fee is $5 per car.

CALF CREEK FALLS
Observant hikers can spot ancient American Indian cliff structures and pictographs along the 2.75-mile walk to the falls, which cascade 126 feet over moss-covered sandstone. The water is cold but refreshing, especially in summer heat. For drinking, take plenty of your own water. The Calf Creek Recreation Area is west of Route 12, and the sign for the turnoff is about a mile north of where the highway crosses the Escalante River.

BURR TRAIL
This former cattle trail was widened and paved by Garfield County, over environmentalists' protests, in the 1980's and 90's. It passes through the tall red sandstone cliffs of Long Canyon and descends switchbacks cut into the domes, fins and undulating rock shapes of Waterpocket Fold before ending up at Lake Powell along the Colorado River. Some stretches are gravel, but a passenger car can handle the entire drive. Turn east off Highway 12 near the Burr Trail Grill, at the south end of Boulder. MATTHEW BROWN

Fattening Up the Feathered, Not the Furred

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE HAMLIN 

 BODY:
OCTOBER is bird month, at least for humans. It's when the need to nurture kicks in, when people, as well as birds, flock to feeders, seed and suet.
 "Fall is definitely our busiest time of year, as soon as it starts to get a little chilly," said Sharon Dunn, a co-owner of Duncraft, a 50-year-old bird supply company in Concord, N.H. 
 The urge to feed the birds isn't diminished by the fact that they don't really need us. "They're well equipped to get all their nourishment in the wild, even in the dead of winter," said Robert Cataldo, the owner of Bird Watcher's Country Store in High Falls, N.Y., a virtual nest of bird paraphernalia. 
Bird feeding is simply the primal pleasure of having a direct sightline to, say, a beautiful red cardinal against a snowy landscape. Or, in the summer, watching a mother bird bring her fledglings to a backyard feeder to teach them to eat (and to bathe, if there's a birdbath nearby).
Birds are the most gracious of guests, well mannered, appreciative and lively, unlike squirrels, those rowdy members of the Sciuridae family, notorious gate crashers who show up to ransack and pillage, invited or not.
Bird suppliers report that squirrel-repellent bird feeders are their biggest sellers. Sure, squirrels can be cute, especially when they gather together in acrobatic brigades. But they have no compunctions whatsoever about muscling in on a bird-feeding station, even when they are capable of collecting their own snacks.
Chili powder, sprinkled around a bird feeder, sometimes works to repel squirrels (they hate it, although birds are fine with it). But, because of rain or wind, ground hot red pepper flakes often need to be replenished every day, not an option for those who feed birds only at their weekend homes. 
Mr. Cataldo estimates that at least half of his customers are city residents who spend weekends in the country and are soliciting avian guests for the first time.
"They get started with a simple feeder and then they get hooked," he said. "They start coming in once or twice a week, upgrading and refining. Then, if they get really hooked, they want a bird feeder for their city fire escape or terrace, one that is pigeon-proof. The squirrel-proof feeders fend off pigeons, too."

Tops in the Bird Market
Virtually everything to do with birds is stocked by two stores in the Northeast that ship all over the country. Duncraft has an outlet store in Concord and over the last half century has evolved into a prominent bird-related catalog and online store and a manufacturer of its own line of bird feeders. It also offers a newsletter that answers bird-feeding questions. For information: www.duncraft.com or (800) 593-5656.
The Bird Watcher's Country Store sells, according to Mr. Cataldo, "absolutely everything to do with nurturing birds, as well as bird tchotchkes and bird art." For information: www.birdwatcherscountrystore.com or (800) 947-2347.

Foiling the Unwanted Guest
Duncraft's Squirrel-Proof Feeding Station Selective, a hanging bird feeder, consists of a 20-inch-long clear plastic tube with four portholes for feeding surrounded by a protective wire grid, with space for two suet cakes. At $69.95, this feeder is ideal for small birds (cardinals can't quite squeeze through the grid). The Absolute II, $79.95, can hang from a tree limb or sit atop a pole (included). It's an all-steel green hopper accessible to all birds but not to squirrels: when a heavy paw hits one of the two spring-weighted perches, a shield drops down, shutting off the seed supply. And the Yankee Flipper feeder is just about as bad as it gets for squirrels. A video clip on the Duncraft Web site shows what happens when a squirrel lands on the bottom perch of the 21-inch clear plastic tube feeder: the perch spins, and the squirrel is flipped off. The feeder runs on a nickel-cadmium battery, is not harmful to birds or squirrels, and costs $99.95.

A Nutritious Spread
A great birdseed smorgasbord will encourage birds to become regular visitors. Big bags of supermarket birdseed may seem economical but can be wasteful, because they often contain filler that birds just scatter on the ground. Duncraft sells its own custom blends, for all seasons and all regions starting at $12.50 for 10 pounds. At the Bird Watcher's Country Store, an equally varied choice of nutritious seeds, made by Lyric, starts at $3.89 for four pounds.

Nesting Together at Night
As adorable as it is, Duncraft's Winter Roost, $39.95, also serves a very practical function -- on icy nights it provides a cozy bedroom for small birds that fly into the white pine house though a hole and huddle together for warmth. Meant to be hung on a fence or a tree, it's 9 by 7 1/2 by 19 1/2 inches.

HEADLINE: Seeking Investment, Egypt Tries Patent Laws 

BYLINE:  By ABEER ALLAM 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
As a high-level Egyptian delegation visits Washington this week to discuss increasing American direct investment in Egypt and bolstering the modest $3.1 billion in American-Egyptian trade, a battle is raging here over a new intellectual property rights law, which the United States had said was a prerequisite for a free-trade agreement.
 At the center of the battle are an American pharmaceuticals giant with a blockbuster drug and a powerful domestic pharmaceuticals industry trying to protect its $5.5 billion turf. 
 The law, which took effect in June, is in line with standards outlined in the World Trade Organization's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, which Egypt signed in 1995. For the first time here, trade secrets and industrial design are protected. The new law also affords patent protection to drugs, not just the manufacturing process, as has been the case. 
That was music to the ears of many multinationals here, including Pfizer-Egypt, the local unit of Pfizer Inc., which finally succeeded in its four-year quest to obtain permission from the Egyptian government to manufacture and sell its popular impotence drug, Viagra, in Egypt.
But local pharmaceutical companies raised a storm after the exclusive rights were issued to Pfizer in June, accusing the ministry of health of helping multinational drug companies to exploit Egypt's poor.
Egypt has the largest, most established pharmaceutical industry in the Middle East. The country is also the largest drug consumer in the region, and its exports constitute 30 percent of the Middle East drug market.
So despite the new law, Pfizer-Egypt's Viagra was on the market just two months when the Ministry of Health announced it would authorize 12 local companies to produce a generic version of the drug to sell at one-twentieth of Pfizer's market price of about $5.20 for each 50-milligram pill.
(A generic version of Viagra smuggled from Syria and India has been widely available in Egypt for years, for as much as $40 a pill. It dropped to $1 after Pfizer's drug became available.)
"We will definitely grant market authorization for all Egyptian companies that applied to produce Viagra," said Dr. Mostafa Ibrahim, president of the Ministry of Health department that administers pharmaceuticals. "We have to think of the interests of the poor people."
Besides, Dr. Ibrahim said, the ministry's decision does not violate the new law, since pharmaceuticals are given a grace period until 2005 in developing countries like Egypt.
But many legal and diplomatic experts dispute this, saying the protections are already in place. The drug, they say, is covered by the data protection provisions in a 2000 ministerial decree as well as by the patent provisions in the new law.
"Viagra is entitled to data exclusivity protection under Egyptian law for five years after its market authorization," said Karim el-Helaly, an intellectual property lawyer here, so local companies should not be allowed to start to produce generic versions until 2007.
The fight over Viagra is a prime example of the problems Egypt faces abroad as well as domestically as it positions itself in the global economy.
Diluting the protection of such a prominent drug right after the law was signed, some experts say, will hurt Egypt's efforts to lure foreign investment and expand trade opportunities.
Pfizer, of course, is furious. "It is against the law that was just approved," said Dr. Ahmed el-Hakim, the company's director of external affairs and health policy in the Middle East. "It is important to protect companies investing here."
The Egyptian economy, after growing steadily in the 1990's, is now stagnant, and the unemployment rate keeps rising. American direct investment fell to $390 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30 from $1.6 billion in the period two years earlier. Exports for the current year remain around $7 billion, or less than 10 percent of gross domestic product, despite the government's decade-long efforts to bolster trade.
Egypt is also facing dwindling American aid. It wants to get quota-free and customs-free access to the American market, especially to its garment industry.
And the country hopes to attract foreign investment to build up its information technology industry, so it can become a regional hub.
But Egyptian pharmaceutical companies, which had been freely producing generic drugs under permission called licensing -- obtained from the Ministry of Health and not involving any patent holders -- fear losing business to foreign companies.
To further their cause, they argue that exceptions to the new law need to be made that take poverty into account. And though they lost their initial battle against the patenting of pharmaceuticals, they have friends, not to mention colleagues, in high places.
"Respecting international agreements does not mean selling medicine in Egypt at the same price as New York," said Dr. Sarwat S. Bassily, chairman of the big generic drug maker Amoun Pharmaceutical Industries -- one of the 12 that recently received the government's permission to produce the generic Viagra -- and the chairman of the Health Committee in the upper house of Parliament
Still, the drug spat is only one piece of the intellectual property puzzle.
Egypt is considered to have one of the poorest records in the Middle East in protecting intellectual property rights. It tops the United States trade representative's priority watch list on protection matters. 
In a country of almost 70 million people, most of them poor, imposing a culture of respecting intellectual property rights is tough going. People mainly depend on cheap knockoffs -- whether they be generic drugs or computer software copied by people selling door to door. An estimated 90 percent of American academic books available in Egypt are pirated copies, sold at low prices, often from kiosks operating inside the universities. Nearly all American music available in the Egyptian marketplace is pirated.
The American software industry lost about $12 million from piracy here in the year ended in June, according to the Business Software Alliance, a nonprofit group of big American and Egyptian software makers that monitors piracy. But Ghada Khalifa, spokeswoman for the alliance, says the situation has improved in recent years as the Egyptian culture ministry has raided many companies using illegal software and put them out of business.
"Five years ago the piracy rate was up to 85 percent, now it's 58 percent," Ms. Khalifa said. "The government itself is almost 100 percent compliant, but the private sector is a problem."
Apart from software, American companies estimated they lost $82 million from piracy in Egypt in 2001.
Mindful of the need to honor international agreements and appease foreign companies, intellectual property rights advocates here have gone so far as to seek the intervention of religious scholars to tell their fellow Egyptians that it is un-Islamic to copy other's work.
Egypt's highest religious authority, the Mufti, issued a religious decree against piracy earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Dubai Journal; 
Living High and Aiming Higher, Come War or Peace

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
This thriving city-state on the crossroads between Asia and the Middle East likes to shock. In fact, it has made something of a business of shocking people.
 Once just another Arabian entrepot that lived off duty-free goods and trade, Dubai has reinvented itself, transforming its skyline with innovative -- some would say bizarre -- architecture and promoting itself as a financial and transportation hub for the region. 
 In contrast to the urban decay in Egypt and nervousness in Jordan, Dubai is thriving, focusing its energies not so much on politics as on the making and spending of money. 
While elsewhere in the Middle East the talk is of an Iraq war that nobody wants, Dubai is quietly preparing to cash in on whatever might happen in Iraq. "Either you look at life from a positive aspect or a negative aspect," said Mohamed Abdullah al-Gergawi, the American-educated chairman of Dubai's Financial and Investment Authority.
If there is a war in Iraq, Dubai will remain a neutral safe haven, he said. In the aftermath, the city would benefit from Iraq's reconstruction. "We don't want war, but every time there is war in the area, Dubai has benefited," he said.
If a peaceful solution is found and economic sanctions on Iraq are lifted, Dubai will also gain. 
Meanwhile, projects move ahead. The latest is a man-made island shaped to resemble a palm tree, with trunk, 17 fronds and an encircling crescent. 
The distinctive shapes have begun rising from the sea, and with a twin island planned for next year, the $3 billion project is considered the most ambitious land-reclamation effort since the Hong Kong Airport. 
"Our problem was that Dubai had run out of beach," Mr. Gergawi said. "We were brainstorming one day. Someone said, 'Why don't we make an island.' " 
But just one blob in the sea was insufficient. The plan for a series of finger islands arranged in the shape of palm trees evolved as the best way to maximize the amount of beach front, he said. The two clusters of islands will yield 80 miles of beach for housing and hotel development.
Environmental concerns? Mr. Gergawi said they had been taken into account. Even if every detail of how so many people and structures would exist on slender slivers of sand is not quite clear, it is the attitude that matters. 
In a move intended to show Dubai's economic strength after Sept. 11, Emirates Airlines, the national carrier, placed a $15 billion order for aircraft from Boeing and Airbus, including the latest 550-seat superjumbo model. 
Emirates has since emerged as one of the world's few profitable airlines, posting an 18 percent increase in passengers last spring, many of them tourists from neighboring Arab countries and Western Europe.
The aircraft purchase was also intended to help offset an image of Dubai as a backwater of shady deals. Loose financial laws allowed Al Qaeda to move money in and out of here with ease. 
Dubai has cooperated with American officials in efforts to tighten the financial laws, Western diplomats said. "They are working with us to clean up the system," one said.
The cooperation comes from necessity. The United Arab Emirates is a federation, and the seven separate emirates do not share oil revenues. Dubai has only small oil reserves, and those are diminishing fast. This is in contrast to the far richer Abu Dhabi, which sits on an oil pool large enough, according to OPEC, to make the United Arab Emirates the world's third-largest holder of oil reserves. 
The most talked-about building in Dubai remains an over-the-top luxury hotel, the Burj Al Arab, where Russian gangsters with suitcases of cash and Saudi sheiks vie to occupy palatial suites with gold-plated taps, gold-leaf banisters and screaming color schemes of crimson, citrus and carrot.
The exterior of the Burj Al Arab is shaped like a full-blown spinnaker, and its outside walls are covered with a milky Teflon-coated fabric as protection from the searing sun. Built by the ruler of Dubai, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the hotel consists of 202 duplex suites. The two royal suites, which rent for $8,000 a night, are occupied only occasionally. The basement seafood restaurant, enveloped by walls of an aquarium and reached by an elevator designed as a faux submarine, is not always full either. 
But who cares? The hotel, with its revolving bed in the royal suite, is more talking point than hostelry. Nelson Mandela is said to have been dismayed by the opulence. But Bill Clinton, twice a guest, talks up Dubai as an exemplar of the possible marriage between Islam and the modern world.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Landlubber Whose Mind Is on the Harbor

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
SORRY ferry fans. Alan Olmsted, the man at the helm of New York City's effort to revive river commuting, is not a ferryboat kind of guy. 
 He does not love them; he does not wax nostalgic about the glory days of grand old ferries gliding around the New York Harbor. Mr. Olmsted doesn't even have much time to frequent ferryboats, except for the "few times a month" when he is not drowning in meeting after meeting after meeting. 
 "I grew up riding the subway," confesses Mr. Olmsted somewhat apologetically. "I wasn't into boats." 
Yet in his 10 years as executive director of what he likes to call "the city's little ferry think tank" (officially the Office of Private Ferries), Mr. Olmsted, 39, has come to know everything there is to know about ferryboats in New York. 
Name a pier and he'll give you history, chapter and verse, tell you to the minute how many boats are coming and going. 
"Most people," he says, "don't realize the New York Harbor is the busiest ferry harbor on this continent." 
Ticking off nautical tidbits is the job, Mr. Olmsted says, not boasting about his successes as the go-to guy in steering the return of ferryboats to city-owned piers. Only under prodding, intense prodding, does he mention, quickly, how he -- and his staff, he insists -- made real Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's dream of building a Yankee Stadium ferry landing. 
But ferry systems were never part of the path Mr. Olmsted plotted for himself. This is his story: bright kid from Queens walks out of Princeton in the late 1980's with a master's degree in public affairs and urban planning, his head filled with dreams of becoming a big-time urban planner. Big like his dad, a senior planner for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or maybe, one day, even as big as that other Olmsted, Frederick Law, of Central Park design fame. (They are ninth cousins, five times removed, he says.) 
On his way, Mr. Olmsted says he took a "respectable" job as a project planner for the city's Department of Transportation. It was to be a temporary detour, until he and another bright young star cooked up a little idea that quickly grew big. 
Huddled at their desks, Mr. Olmsted and his pal, Peter Hallock, secretly applied, on the city's behalf, for a $3 million federal grant to reduce traffic congestion by upgrading an old rotting pier at the foot of Wall Street. Redo the pier, they reasoned, and you'll help ferryboat operators give commuters a reason to get out off the road. 
The idea had one problem. 
"It wasn't even a D.O.T pier then," Mr. Olmsted was explaining recently, standing along the edge of what is now Pier 11, his voice straining to be heard above the growl of an incoming ferry and the drone of a helicopter overhead. "But we didn't care. We knew it needed a capital project. The agency responsible for Pier 11, they didn't even know we were applying. We said, 'Let's get the money and figure out the jurisdiction later.' "
They got the money. Ferryboat fans got a redone Pier 11, now one of the busiest in the New York Harbor, what with 400 commuter boats docking each day. And Mr. Olmsted found a reason to forget all about his plan to move on to "something more glamorous."
These are at least thrilling, and sometimes unending, work days for Mr. Olmsted's outfit. (This might explain why he's still a bachelor.) 
The number of private ferryboat companies (six) floating around the harbor and the number of people (70,000) riding them each weekday are soaring, at least compared to what he calls the "cowboy days, when no one took ferries seriously." 
Mixed in with the success, he says, is a bit of sadness. Many of the new riders found their way to the water after Sept. 11, when ferries suddenly became the only easy commute into Lower Manhattan for thousands of New Jersey PATH train riders. "I look forward to the day when that railroad is back, and people can choose the commute that is best for them, not just taking ferries because they have to, though I believe a lot of the new riders will stay." 
BUT he predicts other riders will benefit from a budding feud between New York Water Taxi, a reborn ferry service owned by the real estate mogul Douglas Durst, and New York Waterway, the nation's largest private ferry company, continues to heat up. There is also buzz among people in the ferry business, Mr. Olmsted says, on the city's efforts to expand East River ferry service, with new or improved landings at places like the Battery Maritime Building on South Street, at East 34th Street and at East 90th Street. 
Explaining his role in all of this, Mr. Olmsted says only that he has "a hand in the little things." Little things like persuading the M.T.A. to put the East 34th Street ferry landing on a bus route, and "walking New York Water Taxi through the bureaucratic obstacle course of setting up at Pier 11." 
Those little things, he concedes, have helped bring about a wave of change in private ferry service. "You don't have to be any sort of ferry fanatic to see that ferry service in New York makes sense," he says. "Ferries have a role to play again. Maybe they're headed into a different kind of glory day."

In 1995, Mr. Marlantes was named president and chief executive of Rockefeller Group International. In that position he sought to widen the company's involvement in commercial real estate beyond the Midtown complex that was built in the 1930's.
He oversaw its national growth as a developer as well as the operations of its worldwide subsidiary, Cushman & Wakefield. He was also on the board of the Rockefeller Group, of which the Mitsubishi Estate Company, one of the world's largest real estate companies, became the majority shareholder in 1989.
Lorian Louis Marlantes grew up in Oregon and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in economics from the University of Washington in 1965. After a year in India as a Fulbright scholar, he earned a master's in economics at Stanford University. He received a Ph.D. in business economics from Stanford in 1971.
Mr. Marlantes is survived by his wife of 34 years, Carol Weida Marlantes; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Washington, and Catherine, of Manhattan; his parents, Leo and Elna, of Seaside, Ore., and a brother, Karl, of Seattle.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Voters Hard to Profile, Poll Finds 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Though Hispanic voters identify more with Democrats than they do with Republicans, they have little party loyalty and defy easy categorization on issues like taxes and abortion, according to a new poll by the Pew Hispanic Center.
 This ideological ambivalence, coupled with a surging population of younger voters, makes Hispanics an attractive voting bloc that could swing from one party to another, the survey showed. 
 So far, the opportunity to capitalize on their growing numbers has largely been squandered. While more and more Hispanics have registered to vote, fewer have actually cast ballots. 
Hispanics have always been a hard group to characterize politically because their opinions typically vary by nationality, the region where they live and whether they were born in or outside the United States.
"There is a mixture of beliefs and attitudes that are very hard to pigeonhole," said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, which conducted the survey along with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. "Latinos are not necessarily a Democratic lock."
More than half the Latino Republicans questioned said they would rather pay higher taxes for more government services than pay lower taxes for fewer services, while 17 percent of non-Hispanic white Republicans stated that preference. 
On social issues, Latino Democrats expressed more conservative values than their non-Latino white counterparts. Thirty-four percent of Hispanic Democrats said they believed that divorce was unacceptable, compared with 13 percent for non-Hispanic white Democrats. Twelve percent of Latino Democrats said they thought abortion should be legal in all cases, compared with 26 percent of non-Latino white Democrats who expressed the same belief.
"Latinos born outside the United States, as a group, have particularly more intense and socially conservative views than those born within the country," said Mollyann Brodie, vice president and director of public opinion and media research for the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The poll of 1,329 registered Hispanic voters, 838 non-Hispanic whites and 136 non-Hispanic African-Americans was conducted by telephone from April to June and has a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. It is part of a broader survey of Latinos in the United States that will be released in December.
Among those interviewed, 45 percent said they were United States citizens who were registered to vote. Of those, nearly half called themselves Democrats, one-fifth said they were Republicans and another fifth labeled themselves independent.
Democrats, for the most part, have been more aggressive in reaching out to Hispanic voters.
"Republicans don't have an institutional network to get Hispanics out to vote," said Rodolfo de la Garza, a political science professor at Columbia University who conducted a separate study of Latino voting patterns for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a research organization on Hispanic issues.
His analysis, of Harris County, Tex., and Los Angeles from 1992 to 1998, found that despite a spike in the number of Hispanics registered to vote, their turnout was usually poor.
But President Bush, who received 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas, has helped narrow the gap between the two parties. Though only 27 percent of Latinos in the survey said they had more confidence in Republicans than Democrats on economic issues, the numbers changed sharply when Latinos were asked to choose between Democrats in Congress and President Bush. Forty-two percent said they had more confidence in Mr. Bush.
They also demonstrated party ambivalence in other ways. When asked which of the two major political parties is more concerned about Hispanics, 45 percent said the Democrats, but 40 percent said they sensed no difference between the two sides.
Education was cited as the most important issue by 58 percent of registered Latino voters, and it was especially important to Latinos who were born outside the United States. The economy was the next priority, followed by health care and Medicare.
Immigration was also an important topic. About half of the Hispanics surveyed said they thought too many immigrants were living in the United States. But about three-fourths said the United States should continue allowing the same number of Latin Americans into the country as it has been, or should allow more.
About half of Latino voters said they get their news on television in English. Twenty-seven percent said they watch English and Spanish news, and 19 percent tune in to Spanish newscasts most of the time.

HEADLINE: Robotics Slumps, but Recovery Is Predicted 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

 BODY:
Investment in industrial robots plummeted in Japan and the United States in 2001, but a recovery is expected over the next three years, according to an annual survey by the United Nations Economic Commission.
 The overall rate of investments in robotics around the world fell by 3 percent last year. 
 The rate of growth was steady in Europe, helping to offset a decline of 40 percent in Japan and a decrease of 17 percent in the United States.
By 2005, the number of robots is expected to exceed 960,000, growing at an annual rate of 7.5 percent, according to the results of the yearly survey. 
The commission's survey, totaling 380 pages this year, was done in conjunction with the International Federation of Robotics.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Gateway, Lands' End and Avaya, with budgets totaling $225 million, drop their agencies.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE fourth quarter, typically a make-or-break time for advertisers, is under way with three large marketers deciding to break up with their agencies.
 The marketers -- Gateway, Lands' End and Avaya -- are estimated to spend more than $225 million on advertising annually. Their decisions are indicative of the increasingly volatile relationships between advertisers and agencies as signs emerge of a slowdown in spending by consumers, who have been providing whatever growth the economy has been able to muster. 
 Gateway, the struggling maker of personal computers, has become notorious for frequently changing agencies. This time the company dismissed Siltanen/Keehn in El Segundo, Calif., which has served as the creative agency on its account only since January; spending is estimated at more than $180 million. 
In another surprise, Gateway said it would shift most of the duties for creating campaigns to the Arnell Group in New York, owned by the Omnicom Group. Gateway has been working with Arnell, but on graphic-design assignments, not advertising.
Greg Lund, a spokesman for Gateway in Poway, Calif., confirmed a report of the dismissal of Siltanen/Keehn that appeared yesterday in the online edition of the trade publication Adweek.
Mr. Lund said the decision came after Gateway worked for eight months with Arnell on a brand project that included redesigning the corporate "cow spot" logo and Gateway's retail stores. Only four days ago, Gateway distributed a news release describing the project that included information about two commercials created by Siltanen/Keehn.
"Arnell has a deep understanding and appreciation for our brand and what it could do," Mr. Lund said, adding that new commercials from Arnell would start running "in time for the holiday season." The fourth quarter will bring a battle among computer makers like Gateway, Dell and Hewlett-Packard to stimulate what has been moribund demand.
"Mooooooove over, computer industry," Peter Arnell, chairman and chief executive at Arnell, said, laughing, during a brief interview. Arnell is best known for campaigns for brands like Banana Republic, Donna Karan, Reebok and Samsung.
Gateway is the most recent in a string of assignments landed by Arnell since it was acquired by Omnicom in June 2001. Others include the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler; the Masterfoods USA division of Mars; and the Kmart Corporation, to design prototypes of stores that Kmart is testing in Chicago and Detroit, which feature a lime-green logo in place of the red "K."
Under Siltanen/Keehn, Gateway pitches have ranged from humorous brand campaigns featuring Ted Waitt, the chief executive, with a "talking" cow, to stylish product-focused ads selling a new line of laptop computers. Before being selected as the creative agency for Gateway, Siltanen/Keehn had worked on projects for four months, inheriting its duties from a team at Gateway. Before that, Gateway had tried to hire Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, as its creative agency after parting ways with McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"Prior to us doing Gateway's advertising, nobody had ever said, 'Hey, that Gateway ad is great,' " said Rob Siltanen, chairman at Siltanen/Keehn. "We prompted that response on a variety of occasions." He declined further comment.
Turning to Lands' End, the catalog and Internet apparel retailer in Dodgeville, Wis., the company yesterday named McKinney & Silver in Raleigh, N.C., part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, as agency of record. Spending was estimated at $20 million.
The Lands' End account had been handled briefly by Element 79 Partners in Chicago, an agency recently opened by Omnicom. Element 79 inherited the account in May from an Omnicom sibling, the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, when Lands' End was acquired by Sears, Roebuck & Company. The shift was intended to alleviate a conflict at DDB Chicago because the agency works for a Sears rival, J. C. Penney.
McKinney & Silver, which will create national television and print campaigns for Lands' End, was chosen after a three-month review that had been narrowed to that agency and two others: Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of the Partnership unit of Interpublic, and the Richards Group in Dallas.
The account is the first major assignment landed by McKinney & Silver since the arrival in February of Brad W. Brinegar as president and chief executive from Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, where he had been chief executive.
"We put our hearts and souls into this pitch," said Janet Northen, a spokeswoman for McKinney & Silver, "and our blood, sweat and tears."
This is the second instance in two days of a division of Arnold Worldwide Partners landing an account from another agency. Boston Market, the restaurant chain owned by the McDonald's Corporation, announced on Wednesday that it would shift its account, with spending estimated at $35 million, to Arnold Worldwide in Boston from Suissa Miller in Los Angeles, owned by Interpublic.
As for Avaya, the provider of communications systems and equipment that was spun off from Lucent Technologies, the company named McCann-Erickson in New York as its agency of record. Spending was estimated at $25 million.
Avaya, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., had worked for more than two years with the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone & Belding, part of the FCB Group division of Interpublic. McCann-Erickson is also the agency for Lucent, though that troubled company has drastically reduced its ad spending.
The decision by Avaya came after a six-week review that included McCann; DWP/Bates Technology in Atlanta, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group; Doremus in New York, part of Omnicom; and Mullen in Wenham, Mass., part of the Partnership division of Interpublic.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
72 Condo Lofts Set for New Rochelle

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., Sept. 30 

 BODY:
A former Bloomingdale's branch, empty for 25 years in a once-bustling downtown neighborhood here, is being converted to 72 condominium lofts. City officials and lenders see the project as pivotal to a larger effort to restore economic vitality to the area.
 The developers are spending close to $15 million to convert the five-story building to market-rate lofts that are being marketed to artists, computer graphics designers and other professionals as places where they can live and work. 
 Scheduled for completion late next spring, Davenport -- Lofts on Main, as the 100,000-square-foot building is called, is to offer apartments with 13- to 15-foot-high ceilings, oversize windows and interior spaces of 900 to 1,800 square feet. Prices for the condos are expected to range from $185,000 to $400,000, said the developers, 554-560 Main Street Associates. 
Because the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of banks and insurance companies based in Manhattan, expects the project to spur a revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood, it plans to lend money not only to 554-560 Main Street Associates but also to surrounding property owners.
"The Bloomingdale's project is a pivotal one," said Sadie McKeown, a senior vice president for the consortium. "If you walk up and down the street, you can see a number of other buildings also hungry for this kind of renovation." 
The Community Preservation Corporation gave the Davenport's developers an $11.1 million construction loan, the largest ever issued by its Hudson Valley branch, in Hawthorne, Ms. McKeown said. It expects to issue $15 million more in 30-year loans to upgrade some of the smaller mixed-use properties in the neighborhood, which the city designated a business improvement district three years ago.
Ralph DiBart, executive director of the New Rochelle Downtown Business Improvement District, said the city also recently rezoned the spaces above the stores in the area from commercial to residential so owners could convert empty office space to housing.
So far, the lending consortium has received five more preliminary applications from property owners in the business improvement district, with most of them wanting to build apartments above their stores. One, a restaurateur, hopes to expand his business.
The principals of 554-560 Main Street Associates, Mona Gora-Friedman, Joseph Klaynberg and Stuart Polinsky, bought the former Bloomingdale's last spring for $3.5 million from Grand Metropolitan Development, which had owned it for several years.
Richard S.Granoff, the project's architect, said the major challenge facing the developers was converting the brick and limestone structure, which was designed for retail use, to a residential use while trying to preserve as much of the building's original character as possible.
"We've had to work around existing steel columns and windows with sills that were six feet above the floor," Mr. Granoff said. The windowsills were lowered, making the existing tall windows even larger, and several hundred new windows were cut into the west side of the building, where there were none. The windows on the south side of the building look out on Long Island Sound, Davenport Bay and surrounding park areas.
The interiors will feature upscale kitchens with wood cabinets, slate counters and stainless steel appliances as well as marble bathrooms. The 900-square-foot loft unit's living room will be 18 feet by 18 feet; the bedroom will be 11 feet by 15 feet. The unit will also include a bathroom, a kitchen and an entry hall.
A typical 1,700-square-foot unit will have a 20-foot-by-20-foot living area, a separate 18-foot-by-40-foot area, a 16-foot-by-12-foot bedroom, one and a half baths, a kitchen and an entry hall. A 20,000-square-foot sixth floor is being added to the 80-year-old building for 13 penthouse units with terraces. 
Each loft is designed to enable residents to conduct business from home, and wiring for high-speed telecommunication services is being installed.
Four blocks away, New Rochelle's $17 million Intermodal Transportation Center, which will be a hub for Amtrak and Metro-North train service, is expected to be completed next spring, at about the same time the condos are ready to occupy.

HEADLINE: New Claims for Jobless Benefits Resume Rising 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits rose last week, according to a report released today, underlining the difficulties that workers and companies are facing as the economy struggles to return to full force. 
 In the week ended Sept. 28, new applications for unemployment insurance edged up by a seasonally adjusted 5,000, to 417,000, the Labor Department said. The increase was slightly larger than analysts had predicted and came after a drop of 18,000 the previous week. 
 The claims data "point to a marked deterioration in job conditions in late summer," said Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS Warburg, "but the deterioration so far is not cascading as it would do in a recession." 
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that orders to American factories were flat in August, after increasing 4.4 percent in July. While the performance was better than the decline analysts had forecast, a more forward-looking report earlier this week suggested that manufacturing was stalling. 
A third report today showed that activity in the services sector grew faster than expected in September. The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index rose to 53.9 in September from 50.9 in August. Analysts had expected a reading of 52. (A reading higher than 50 signifies growth; under 50 indicates a contraction.) 
"The solid bounce," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers, "provides some hope that the economy really is not turning south." 
Nonetheless, the overall labor picture looks weak. The four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a more stable gauge that smooths out weekly fluctuations, rose last week to 423,000, the highest level since early May. The number of unemployed still collecting benefits increased to 3.68 million for the week ended Sept. 21, the highest level since mid-June. 
Economists reiterated that companies, facing weak profits, have been reluctant to make big commitments in capital spending and hiring -- factors restraining a full recovery. Other uncertainties, notably worries about a war with Iraq and the resulting drain on resources, are weighing heavily on businesses. 
The government is to release the employment report for September, a closely watched economic gauge, on Friday morning.

HEADLINE: Texas Home Insurance Crisis Roils Residents and Top Race 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of homeowners in Texas are expected to lose their insurance coverage in the next year while others are seeing huge increases in premiums in a crisis that could harm the state's economy. It has already become a central issue in the governors' race.
 Experts say the situation in Texas is the most extreme in the nation, at a time when homeowners' insurance has become harder to attain and more costly in every state, with insurers saying it is a marginally profitable part of the business at best. As a whole, the insurance industry is in a difficult period, as companies have suffered huge losses from the stock market collapse and from the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The problems in Texas with homeowners' insurance, though, derive mostly from unique circumstances that have left policyholders paying the highest premiums in the nation even as insurers complain that they have lost billions of dollars on homeowner policies in the state. Not only is Texas a magnet for bad weather, like Tropical Storm Allison last year, but analysts say its regulatory structure has managed to hurt both insurers and consumers. 
"The Texas homeowners insurance market is the most dysfunctional in the United States today," said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-financed research organization. "A confluence of a lot of events has brought the market to the brink of collapse."
The event that has caused the most public anxiety occurred on Sept. 24 when Farmers Insurance announced plans to end its coverage for its 700,000 homeowner customers in Texas, beginning in November. The company is the second biggest insurer in Texas and will cancel about 58,000 policies each month as they come due over the coming year. 
The decision also comes after the state's leading insurer, State Farm, had stopped selling new homeowner policies in Texas and several other states because of losses. The two companies accounted for more than 50 percent of the Texas homeowner insurance market, and many policyholders fear they will not be able to find coverage. 
Claire Crane, 42, who lives with her husband, a disabled veteran, in a Houston suburb, said they are considering selling their home, partly because of the pullout by Farmers. Mrs. Crane has been fighting with the company over a claim for water damage and had already seen her yearly premium jump to $1,900 from $1,300.
Then, on Saturday, she received notice that as part of the pullout, her policy would not be renewed when it ends next year. 
Even before the notice, Mrs. Crane said she tried to buy insurance from another company, but it did not return her calls. She says she believes she is being blackballed because of her outstanding claim. 
"It's been a total nightmare, a total horror story," Mrs. Crane said.
It is still too early to assess the impact of the situation, but signs of disruption have already appeared in the real estate market, one of a dwindling number of economic bright spots in Texas. A recent survey of more than 2,300 real estate agents in Texas found that 51 percent of them reported having at least one client who had been unable to secure coverage, while 70 percent had had a house sale delayed by insurance problems.
"It has definitely had an impact on the residential home market," said John Gormley, communications director for the Texas Association of Realtors, which conducted the poll.
The average cost of home insurance in Texas was $861 in 1999, the last year available, according to the Insurance Information Institute. By comparison, it was $533 in New York the same year. 
Industry analysts say the crux of the problem in Texas is the state's flawed regulatory structure, which, for very different reasons, displeases both insurers and consumer advocates. Insurers note that the other 49 states use national standards in setting homeowner policies. But Texas, by contrast, has state-written standards. Insurers complain that these standards require them to provide broader coverage that enables policyholders to file claims for water damage that would not be covered in other states.
As a result, tens of thousands of claims for mold damage have been filed over the last two years in Texas. Mr. Hartwig, the economist, said these claims are crushing the industry. He said a typical homeowner claim costs $2,800, while a typical mold claim that often requires extensive cleaning and rebuilding costs $35,000. Insurers also say losses have been aggravated by a spate of mold-related lawsuits.
But advocacy groups like Consumer's Union and Texas Watch, while agreeing that insurers have lost money on mold claims, also say the companies have exploited a loophole. For more than a decade, insurers in Texas have been allowed to form unregulated subsidiaries, initially intended as a way of providing homeowner coverage to riskier policyholders. This allowed companies to charge higher premiums to compensate for their additional risk.
Gradually, though, insurers have shifted regular homeowner policies to these subsidiaries. Now, 95 percent of homeowners have their policies in this unregulated market. Consumer advocates say this has allowed insurers to raise premiums without government oversight and has left homeowners with little control over the costs of their policies.
"The bottom line is it's an essential product, and you've got to have it," said Rob Schneider, a senior attorney with Consumer's Union in Austin. "If rates double overnight, too bad -- you've got to pay it."
Public frustration and anger is palpable, and insurance has become a radioactive political issue that recently has dominated the governor's race. The Democratic challenger, Tony Sanchez, has pounded Gov. Rick Perry for accepting more than $1 million in campaign contributions from insurance companies (including health care coverage) and blamed the Perry administration for allowing premiums to rise. A heavily aired Sanchez television commercial labels the higher insurance costs as "the Perry premium."
Mr. Perry, the former lieutenant governor who inherited the top job when George W. Bush became president, has attacked Mr. Sanchez as part of the problem. Mr. Perry has run campaign commercials reminding voters that an insurance company owned by a bank controlled by Mr. Sanchez sells unregulated policies. 
But today, The Dallas Morning News reported that Mr. Perry was once an advisory director of an insurance company that was sued over unregulated policies. Mr. Perry's campaign said he served without pay and resigned after a year. 
Each candidate has called for changes in insurance laws. The issue is expected to dominate the legislative session that opens in January. 
Mr. Sanchez also puts the blame for the Farmers' pullout on Mr. Perry. Earlier this year, Mr. Perry's administration ordered an investigation into Farmers. As a result, the Texas Department of Insurance accused the company of price gouging and ordered it to change its practices and pay a fine that could have exceeded $1 billion. 
Officials with Farmers accuse Mr. Perry of playing election year politics by unfairly attacking the company as a way of appealing to voters on the insurance issue.
Bill Miller, an Austin lobbyist representing the company, said Farmers had not broken any laws. Mr. Miller said the company had lost money in Texas in 8 of the past 10 years and had seen the number of mold claims rise to 12,000 in the first six months of this year from 12 in 1999. "We've considered this whole matter from the very start to be politically driven," Mr. Miller said.
State officials, though, believe Farmers announced its pullout as a negotiating tactic. "They are trying to cause an artificial crisis," said Robert Black, a spokesman for the Department of Insurance. "They are trying to use their market share and their agents to put pressure on us to turn a blind eye to what they are doing."
For policyholders with Farmers, the options are not hopeful. They can try to get coverage elsewhere, but few companies are writing policies in Texas, particularly in coastal cities like Houston, which was saturated with flooding by Allison last year. If a person cannot secure coverage, by law his mortgage company is required to do so. But often this means that the premium is far higher and can imperil a person's ability to meet the monthly note.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Friday about trouble in the homeowners insurance industry, which has become an issue in the campaign for governor in Texas, included an erroneous reference from The Dallas Morning News to Gov. Rick Perry's relationship with an insurance company and referred incompletely to the policies the company sold. Mr. Perry left as an unpaid advisory board member of the company, Citizens Inc., in April 1996, but was not a director when a class-action suit alleges the company committed fraud, after August 1996. And the company sold life insurance, not home insurance.

HEADLINE: My Economic Plan 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Although other news has been drowned out by the barking of the dogs of war, something ominous is happening on the economic front. It's not dramatic, but month by month the numbers keep coming in worse than expected. Let's put politics completely aside for once, and review where we are and what should be done.
 The key point is that this isn't your father's recession -- it's your grandfather's recession. That is, it isn't your standard postwar recession, engineered by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation, and easily reversed when the Fed loosens the reins. It's a classic overinvestment slump, of a kind that was normal before World War II. And such slumps have always been hard to fight simply by cutting interest rates. 
 Now there's no question that the Fed's rapid rate reductions last year helped avert a much bigger slump. But a hard look at monetary policy suggests that the Fed hasn't done enough -- and possibly can't do enough. Although the Fed funds rate, the usual measure of monetary policy, is at its lowest level in generations, the real Fed funds rate -- the interest rate minus the inflation rate, which is what matters for investment decisions -- is actually about the same as it was at the bottom of the last recession, in the early 1990's, because inflation is considerably lower. 
And the drop in the Fed funds rate engineered by Alan Greenspan & Company, though faster than that in the last recession, has so far been considerably smaller. Last time it fell by 6.75 points; this time it fell by only 4.75. Even if the Fed funds rate falls all the way to zero, that will be a smaller interest rate reduction than the last time around. If you think the excesses of the 1990's were larger than those of the 1980's, that the economy needs more stimulus to pull itself out, then it seems likely that the Fed hasn't done enough, and quite possible that even going all the way to zero still won't be enough. 
And this situation may last for a while. The overhang of excess capacity, especially in telecommunications, will be worked off only slowly. It's all too possible that we may be looking at a sluggish economy into 2004, maybe beyond. The Fed should cut rates further -- it may not be enough, but it will help. What else should we do?
The answer is that we should have a sensible plan for fiscal stimulus -- one that encourages spending now, to bridge the gap until business investment revives. Some of the elements of such a plan are obvious, and were described by Jeff Madrick in yesterday's Times. First, extend unemployment benefits, which are considerably less generous now than in the last recession; this will do double duty, helping some of the neediest while putting money into the hands of people who are likely to spend it. Second, provide aid to the states, which are in increasingly desperate fiscal straits. This will also do double duty, preventing harsh cuts in public services, with medical care for the poor the most likely target, at the same time that it boosts demand.
If these elements don't add up to a large enough sum -- I agree with Mr. Madrick that $100 billion over the next year is a good target -- why not have another rebate, this time going to everyone who pays payroll taxes?
And how will we pay for all of this? You know the answer to that: Cancel tax cuts scheduled for the future. The economy needs stimulus now; it doesn't need tax cuts for the very affluent five years from now.
This isn't rocket science. It's straightforward textbook economics, applied to our actual situation. It's also, I'm well aware, politically out of the question. But I think we're entitled to ask why.
In a column on Sept. 17, I wrote about evidence that Thomas White, the secretary of the Army, was well aware that the Enron division of which he was vice chairman before taking that position, Enron Energy Services, was deliberately and improperly concealing large financial losses. In that column I cited a February 2001 e-mail message that I said was written by Mr. White. Since then Mr. White has said that he does not recall writing such a message, and the authenticity of the message has been questioned. As long as the authenticity of the message remains in doubt, it should be considered unsubstantiated. I erred by citing it in my column.

HEADLINE: Forbes Set To Cease Publication Of ASAP 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
In what has become a familiar story, a magazine formed to cover the rise of the digital economy has been done in by its decline. The Forbes family, which owns Forbes magazine, announced today that it was closing Forbes ASAP, a magazine founded in 1992 to cover the digital economy. 
 "There is no market for a dedicated new-economy publication," said Monie Begley, spokeswoman for Forbes. 
 The closing of the magazine, which was one of the first to cover the Internet seriously, is yet another sign of stress at Forbes Inc., the family's business magazine company. Earlier this year, the company engaged in a rare round of layoffs and ceased matching the 401K contributions of employees. Forbes magazine, which led the business magazine category for much of the 1990's, has lost almost half its advertising pages in the last two years and has fallen to third in ad pages behind Fortune and Business Week.
In remarks in August, Steve Forbes, president and editor in chief, said that the company was responding to "a fall-off that hasn't been seen since the '30's."
Members of the Forbes family were unavailable for comment yesterday, but the company issued a statement.
"In making this decision, the company is responding to the continuing difficulties in this technology sector," the statement read.
For most of its 10-year life, Forbes ASAP was delivered six times a year, bundled with the regular Forbes magazine. A year ago, it substituted four times a year for Forbes, which is published twice a month. 
Ms. Begley said about eight people will lose their jobs.
The Publishers Information Bureau does not track ASAP separately, but the parent magazine has suffered a big drop in ad pages so far this year, down almost 30 percent compared with the period last year. And last year was a brutal one: Forbes was off more than 38 percent in 2001 in ad pages compared with the boom year that preceded it.
Forbes ASAP is not the first magazine victim of the slump in spending on technology. Ziff Davis Media, a publisher of technologically oriented magazines, underwent a financial restructuring in August after closing several technology-oriented titles. In August 2001, The Industry Standard closed amid a huge contraction of Silicon Valley ad spending.
John Battelle, former chief of Standard Media International, publisher of The Industry Standard, said the boom in technology magazines was only temporarily over. 
"These magazines are gone until they come back, although they will probably come back in different clothing," he said. "There will be another boom in the business cycle, and there will be a new crop of magazines to cover it."

HEADLINE: Companies Gave to Pataki; State Aid Came Their Way 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
In the fall of 1997, five executives from Corning, the upstate New York manufacturer, made $17,000 in contributions to Gov. George E. Pataki's 1998 re-election campaign.
 At the same time, the state was sending money to Corning: $3 million, then $1.5 million, then $500,000 and $200,000 -- ultimately, $10 million in economic development grants or loans went to the company. The first batch was approved within a month of Corning's series of contributions to Mr. Pataki. 
 No one is directly accusing the state of exchanging aid for contributions; state and company officials dismissed that suggestion yesterday. But political watchdogs contend that the mere appearance of a connection undermines the public trust. And some have suggested barring any political contributions from companies that do business with the state.
A review of 49 different state economic assistance packages worth $1 million or more offered by the Empire State Development Corporation during the last five years shows that the Corning case is one of more than a dozen in which contributions were made by companies that got state aid. The figures were assembled by Citizen Action of New York, a nonprofit, partisan research group that released the study of state aid and political donations yesterday. 
"The timing is coincidental," said Paul Rogoski, director of corporate communications at Corning, referring to the 1997 donations. "Our executives made contributions prior to that and have continued to make contributions since then."
Political donations by major corporations are routine. Linking a donation to a desire to get state aid is next to impossible solely by examining state records. Giant corporations, like International Paper, General Motors, General Electric, Ford and Philip Morris, received aid from the state about the same time they or their executives gave political donations, according to the report.
Given the broad political agenda of such enterprises, it would be hard to suggest, for example, that a $1,000 donation in 1997 by a director of General Electric is related to $1.4 million in state aid allocated about the same time to G.E., as the Citizen Action report questions.
But Richard Kirsch, the executive director of Citizen Action of New York, said that even the appearance of a "pay to play" arrangement soils the process. "It creates the appearance of a conflict of interest," said Mr. Kirsch, whose organization has endorsed Mr. Pataki's opponent, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller. "It makes taxpayers question whether state funds are being used for the public good or to help the re-election of a state official."
But donations by smaller companies made about the time the state was considering or approving aid could suggest that the companies felt compelled to donate, said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington campaign finance study group. 
"There is often the suspicion or fear or concern that a political contribution is expected and the lack of one may hurt your chances," he said.
Questions about a possible link between development aid and politics have been frequent in New York in recent years, in part because Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of Empire State Development, was Mr. Pataki's chief political fund-raiser when he ran for governor in 1994.
Officials at Empire State said yesterday that merit was the only consideration in a grant or loan. "There is absolutely no connection between any campaign contribution and any action by this agency," said Michael Marr, its spokesman. "We make certain that the economic development professionals making these decisions have no involvement in the campaign fund-raising."
Officials at companies that gave donations before or after state aid announcements objected to any suggestion of a connection.
Plug Power, an Albany area company that makes low-pollution fuel cells, donated a total of $3,500 to Mr. Pataki in 2000 and 2001 after getting $2.2 million in state aid to help start up and then expand the company.
Roger Saillant, its president, said the governor's strong advocacy for the environment was the reason for the donations. The loans to Plug Power came five weeks after Louis R. Tomson, a longtime Pataki associate and a former member of his administration, took a job as a vice president for development at the company. Mr. Tomson is now president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
Alstom Inc., a French rail company, donated $30,500 from 1999 to 2001 to the state's Republican Party, during the same time that it received aid packages totaling about $800,000, state records show. Bill McDaniel, an Alstom spokesman, said there was no relation. "There is never, ever, ever, any quid pro quo," he said.
He said that the state aid had helped produce jobs. Employment at Alstom's rail car plant in Hornell, N.Y., has gone up to 900 from 60 in 1997, before the company bought it. 
In July 1999, the state gave $1.7 million in grants and loans to help finance an expansion at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. George S. Kaufman, the studio's owner, has donated $57,000 to Mr. Pataki since 1997. Hal G. Rosenbluth, its president, said there was no connection.
Mr. Kaufman has supported different politicians, including Democrats like the former City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and even Comptroller McCall, in 1998.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INCIDENT IN NEW YORK; 
Postal Worker Is Arrested After Shots At the U.N.

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON with WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
A postal worker protesting human rights abuses in North Korea jumped over the fence in front of the United Nations today and fired seven shots in the air and at the main tower before he was arrested by guards.
 Law enforcement officials identified the man as Steve S. Kim, 57, of Des Plaines, Ill. He is a naturalized United States citizen who immigrated to the United States about 20 years ago from South Korea, the officials said, based on Mr. Kim's statements. 
 Mr. Kim climbed the fence at a point near 43rd Street between United Nations security guard posts and walked into the driveway in front of the secretariat building. He tossed out several sheets of paper from a bag he carried and fired the shots from a .357 Smith & Wesson handgun, emptying all of its rounds. 
He then dropped the gun and turned to walk back toward the fence. Mr. Kim put up little resistance when he was seized, first by Secret Service agents, State Department security agents and New York police detectives who happened to be nearby, and then by United Nations security guards. 
No one was injured in the shooting, but at least two bullets went through windows on the 18th and 20th floors of the secretariat building, "narrowly missing several employees," said Michael McCann, the chief of United Nations security. Several people who were near where the bullets struck were treated by United Nations medical personnel for "nonphysical" problems, he said.
It was the first time that small arms gunshots had ever been fired at the United Nations headquarters complex, on First Avenue in Manhattan, Mr. McCann said. 
Despite repeated threats over nearly a decade against United Nations headquarters and heightened precautions since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significant weaknesses remain in the security for the complex, he acknowledged. 
The United Nations hoped to increase protection at the front fence, which is about six feet high, in a huge rehabilitation project it is proposing, he said. That project is only in the planning stages. 
In the papers he carried with him, Mr. Kim, in cramped but careful handwriting and imperfect English, wrote that North Korea "is groaning under the weight of starvation and dictatorial suppression." 
"They don't have even the most basic of human rights," he wrote.
Mr. Kim, an employee of the United States Postal Service since 1988, is a mail-processing clerk at a plant in Palatine, Ill., officials said. 
He was at work as recently as Sept. 30, law enforcement officials said, but had several scheduled days off and had asked for vacation time.
Mr. Kim apparently made no effort to conceal his identity. He was carrying a wallet full of identification cards with him, Mr. McCann said. 
Mr. McCann and other law enforcement officials suggested that Mr. Kim might have been mentally unstable. "We don't see any logic to that, bringing attention to his cause in that manner," the United Nations security chief said.
Mr. Kim's tract was a coherent if furious criticism of life in North Korea under the Communist government of President Kim Jong Il, whose severe political restrictions and failing state-run economy have led to mass starvation in recent years, according to international aid agencies. 
"Didn't you see the children who laid down on the floor like a skeleton?" Mr. Kim asked.
Mr. Kim was placed in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will spend the night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He will go before a United States magistrate on Friday morning and the United States attorney for the Southern District will file criminal charges.

HEADLINE: New Role for U.S. in Colombia: Protecting a Vital Oil Pipeline 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: SARAVENA, Colombia, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Casting a wary eye for rebel snipers, Lt. Felipe Zuniga and his counterinsurgency troops slog through the wet fields and patches of jungle here. Their mission has nothing to do with drugs -- until now, the defining issue in Colombia for American policy makers -- but instead with protecting a pipeline that carries crude to an oil-hungry America.
 The 500-mile pipeline, which snakes through eastern Colombia, transporting 100,000 barrels of oil a day for Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles, is emerging as a new front in the terror war. One of Colombia's most valuable assets, the pipeline has long been vulnerable to bombings by Colombia's guerrilla groups, which along with the country's paramilitary outfits are included on the Bush administration's list of terrorist organizations. 
 Sometime in the next month, in a significant shift in American policy, United States Special Forces will arrive in Colombia to begin laying the groundwork for the training of Lieutenant Zuniga and his 35-man squad in the finer arts of counterinsurgency. Over the next two years, 10 American helicopters will bolster the Colombian counterinsurgency efforts, and some 4,000 more troops will receive American training, which will begin in earnest in January, Bush administration and American military officials said in interviews in recent days. 
The policy shift dovetails with the Bush administration's new, global emphasis on expanding and diversifying the sources of America's oil imports, with an eye to reducing dependence on Middle Eastern oil. That new approach, outlined in the administration's energy report issued last year, is gaining ever more importance with the threat to Persian Gulf oil supplies from the looming war with Iraq.
The $94 million counterinsurgency program is also an important element in the offensive by Colombia's new government against two rebel groups and a paramilitary force that dominate much of the country.
Pipeline bombings by the guerrillas cost the government nearly $500 million last year -- a blow in a country where oil accounts for 25 percent of revenues. The two main rebel groups, which view Occidental as a symbol of American imperialism, have bombed the pipeline 948 times since the 1980's, while extorting oil royalty payments from local government officials.
The Colombian military has increased security recently, deploying five of the six battalions in the 6,000-man 18th Brigade to pipeline protection, up from just two battalions last year. As a result, the number of bombings has fallen to 30 this year, from 170 the year before, Colombian military officials say. But the goal is to eliminate the bombings altogether, they say, and to accomplish that they need help.
"We have been fighting here, but there are still so many things the Americans can teach us," said Lieutenant Zuniga as he led a reporter on patrol along the pipeline. "I think it is going to make us much better."
The final product, officials say, will be an offensive-minded unit of Colombian counterinsurgency analysts who will interpret intelligence data gathered from high-tech equipment and informers and then deploy rapid-response forces stationed at strategic points along the pipeline to thwart rebel attacks.
"The idea is to prepare troops for the war we are living," said Gen. Carlos Lemus, commander of the 18th Brigade, which will receive much of the training here in Arauca Province. "We will be able to do so much more, with better intelligence and helicopters. The idea is to find out when something is going to happen and react."
The training could not take place in a more dangerous area. Though the army base here -- with its neatly pruned hedges, modern barracks and billboard featuring the fighting words of Gen. George S. Patton -- gives an air of familiarity American soldiers might find comforting, Saravena itself sits in a war zone.
"What they can expect is lead," boasted a local commander for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest and most belligerent rebel group. "What else? That and cadavers."
Indeed, the rebels have flexed their muscles all year in Saravena, launching dozens of homemade rockets that have destroyed the airport terminal, the city hall, the town council chambers and the prosecutor's office. Policemen on patrol are frequently fired upon, and military officials say that despite the new deployment of Colombian troops the pipeline is still exposed to attack.
"With these bandits," said Lt. Col. Emilio Torres, a local army commander, "if you leave the pipeline alone even 24 hours, they can blow the tube."
Alert to the dangers, American military officials said the trainers, Special Forces soldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C., will be limited to 20 to 60 and will be housed in specially fortified barracks.
Colombia's new president, Alvaro Uribe, also declared Arauca one of two security zones where military commanders can conduct searches without warrants, impose curfews and usurp some powers from local government -- measures the United Nations says will erode civil rights.
Bush administration officials have said the reliable production of oil is imperative if Colombia is to have the resources to combat the guerrillas and paramilitaries. But oil is also critical to the national security planning of the United States, which by 2020 will count on imported oil for 62 percent of its oil needs, up from half today. 
Much of that new oil will come from the Americas, which already supply the United States with nearly 50 percent of its imported oil. Along with Venezuela and Ecuador, the Andes now provides the United States with more than two million barrels a day, about 20 percent of its imports.
Colombia will never be the sole solution to America's voracious appetite for oil. But the country is known for high-quality oil that is cheap to produce and easy to refine, and is thought to have significant potential reserves that could be rapidly exploited if the guerrillas and paramilitaries could be brought under control.
"We're becoming increasingly dependent on imported oil, therefore the strategic goal of diversification has become more and more important," said Michael Klare, author of "Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict." "The Clinton administration and now the Bush administration have explicitly stated that that one of the regions they have wanted to rely on in the future is the Western Hemisphere."
Many oil analysts say reliance on this region could greatly increase if the major producer, Venezuela, increased its production capacity and if Colombia -- which shares many of the same geological features as Venezuela -- achieved enough stability to allow widespread exploration. 
"We don't really know what's there," said Ed Corr, a former American diplomat in Latin America and an expert on the strategic aspects of petroleum. "But we certainly would be wise in getting the country in such a situation where we can find out." 
Washington's shift to counterinsurgency was made possible in July, when Congress rolled back restrictions that had limited American aid toantidrug programs. The drug war continues unabated, but the phasing out of those prohibition has been warmly welcomed by energy companies, which have been pressing for a wider role for the United States to improve the business climate. 
"You'll see more interest on the part of more companies," Larry Meriage, spokesman for Occidental, said in an interview. "Given the fact that there is a significant amount of oil there, and the sheer mass of oil that remains under-explored, there is considerable optimism."
Occidental, well-versed in Colombia's troubles by virtue of its two decades here, is close to the Bush administration and has long lobbied for the United States to be more involved in the conflict.
According to the Center for Public Integrity in Washington, the company contributed $1.5 million to presidential and Congressional campaigns between 1995 and 2000. Occidental also spent nearly $8.7 million lobbying American officials on Latin America policy, largely regarding Colombia, from 1996 to 2000, according to disclosure forms filed with Congress.
Other oil and energy companies also spent handsomely to influence Colombia policy, with Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP Amoco, the Unocal Corporation, Texaco and Phillips Petroleum spending about $13 million among them on Colombia in the same period.
"We see the oil companies leveraging their influence in Washington to move the United States toward a counterinsurgency policy," said Ted Lewis of Global Exchange, a San Francisco human rights group that closely follows business issues here.
Mr. Meriage counters that not taking strong action here could further weaken Colombia and its neighbors, which are economically dependent on oil. "We have long highlighted these problems," he said. "You see the potential danger of an entire Andean region being destabilized by the problems in Colombia. That's why this is important."
A tour of the Occidental facilities here in Cano Limon oil fields underscores the links between the company and Colombia's military. The 300 or so troops stationed here wear patches featuring an oil drilling rig. New motorcycle patrols zip down a network of roads, while antiguerrilla patrols work their way through the jungle. Light tanks and heavily fortified bunkers are strategically positioned along the pipeline to deter attacks.
Two military aircraft -- a helicopter and a Cessna -- patrol the pipeline with gasoline paid for by Occidental, and military helicopters carrying troops on operations often swing by here to fill their fuel tanks. Even the brigade commander, General Lemus, drinks coffee from a mug bearing the Oxy logo.
"This is an island of security that we have here, thanks to the army," said one Occidental official.
The company is now producing nearly twice as much oil as last year at its 212 wells. It has also signed contracts recently with the state oil company to explore three additional blocs covering 9,325 square miles.
"This is the Colombians' war to win, and they have to step up to the fight," said Brig. Gen. Galen Jackman, director of operations for American forces in Latin America. "And they have to put their country on a footing to be able to do that."

HEADLINE: 2 Farm Acres Lost per Minute, Study Says 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
The United States is losing two acres of mostly prime farmland every minute to development, the fastest such decline in the country's history, a new study has found.
 That loss has been on the edge of the outer suburbs, where some of the country's best fruit farms are being replaced by houses on large lots, linked by new roads, highways and malls, the study, by the American Farmland Trust, said. 
 Sprawl, not development itself, is the problem, the report said.
"We are consuming more land per person than at any time, in the most wasteful way," said Ralph Grossi, president of the trust, a nonprofit organization. 
The National Association of Homebuilders supported that conclusion.
"We completely agree that 10-acre lots are an inappropriate use of land," said Clayton Traylor, senior vice president of the association. "We both want higher-density development and smart growth."
Using census data as well as Agriculture Department information about crops and soil, the study found that more than half of the lost farmland is being carved into 10-acre lots.
Arkansas, New York, Illinois, Alabama and Mississippi top the list of states that have lost the greatest percentage of their best farmland in the last five years.
The problem has been growing for two decades. While the nation's population grew 17 percent from 1982 to 1997, the amount of land turned into urban areas increased 47 percent.
Yet the new outer suburban developments have not eased the pressure for affordable housing, the trust and the homebuilders association said.
"There is a parallel between the growing concern about losing farmland and the growing divide between shelter for the rich and poor in the United States," said Rolf Pendall, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University.
Keith Collins, the chief economist for the Agriculture Department, said that the loss of farmland has been a concern for years because it destroys open spaces and local food production.
"It's a quality-of-life issue," Mr. Collins said. "Properly managed farms protect the urban watersheds, provide the visual amenity of open space and protect the farmers who bring their locally grown fruits and vegetables to farmers markets."
The Agriculture Department and the new farm bill have tried to protect farms and pastureland, including a program that provides about $100 million in matching funds every year to state and local groups and governments that buy easements for farmland to protect it permanently from urban development.
But a vast majority of the $180 billion farm bill underwrites subsidies for farmers to grow cotton, rice, wheat, corn and soybeans.
The publication of the Farmland Trust report encouraged environmentalists who have been arguing that spending federal money to protect vulnerable farmland makes more sense than subsidizing crops.
"Urban sprawl is the toughest problem we face -- with its energy cost, pollution cost for the air and water and for the loss suffered by farmers and wildlife," said Ken Cook, president of Environmental Working Group. "Why not pay to keep farmland from becoming mansions and malls rather than give farmers money to raise cotton and rice that we don't need."
The report recommends more easements for farms and strong national standards for development. Vermont, California and Pennsylvania are cited as three states that have balanced development with farmland preservation.
While agreeing on the scope of the problem of sprawling development, representatives of the building industry disagree that the solution is more federal money for preserving farmland. They want higher-density development in outer suburban areas that want to attract only wealthier homeowners.
"Our point is there is a pervasive shortage of housing that has to be every bit a priority as the protection of farmland," said Mr. Traylor of the homebuilders association. "A big part of the game we're fighting is the 'not here' syndrome. We need affordable housing while using up the least amount of undeveloped territory."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Schumer Enters the Fray

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
 H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic nominee for governor, on Wednesday released this 30-second advertisement, his first for the general election to feature Senator Charles E. Schumer. It is running on New York City stations. A second ad with Mr. Schumer, promising Mr. McCall would improve the economy and cut property taxes, began being broadcast upstate yesterday.

PRODUCER: GMMB

ON THE SCREEN: Mr. Schumer speaking into the camera with text highlighting praise of Mr. McCall from newspapers.

THE SCRIPT: When campaigns have nothing good to say, they resort to negative attacks. And that's what they're doing to Carl McCall. Attacks the press said are not true. When Carl was school board president, Albany cut the education budget, but still Carl got results. Test scores went up, and dropout rates went down. The New York Times praised his leadership as sensible and responsible. I couldn't agree more. Carl McCall has a positive plan to really improve education. He's been a great comptroller, and I know he'll be a great governor.

ACCURACY: Mr. Pataki's campaign has released a series of negative ads against Mr. McCall. News reports have questioned some of Mr. Pataki's claims, but they have not called all the attacks patently untrue. When Mr. McCall was president of the New York City Board of Education in the early 1990's during a recession, state aid decreased. The record on test scores was mixed; not all scores went up in all grades. The dropout rate declined but remained high; some experts attributed the improvement to factors like a sluggish economy, which tends to keep students in school. The Times's praise of Mr. McCall's leadership on the board came from a 1993 editorial supporting his nomination for comptroller. The notion that Mr. McCall "got results" may be overstating the case. The schools chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez at the time, is far more accountable than the school board president when it comes to academic performance.

SCORECARD: This is the second ad Mr. McCall has broadcast seeking to rebut Mr. Pataki's charges about his record on education, an issue Mr. McCall has sought to make his own. He reaches for one of his most prominent and influential supporters to back him up. This ad and the previous one, in which Mr. McCall speaks into the camera, portray him as a victim, in a strategy that may help generate sympathy among his base of voters in the city, where polls suggest that Mr. Pataki is running unusually strong. The ad -- without addressing the issue -- may also help soften the blow of several days of bad press Mr. McCall has received over his referring relatives for jobs at companies with business before the state pension fund he oversees.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts of Speeches Made on Senate Floor Regarding Resolution on Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches yesterday by Senators Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, and Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, about the use of force against Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. Their remarks were addressed to the president pro tem of the Senate.

Senator Byrd
Titus Livius, one of the greatest of Roman historians, said all things will be clear and distinct to the man who does not hurry. Haste is blind and improvident. Blind and improvident, Mr. President, blind and improvident. 
 Congress would be wise to heed those words today. For as sure as the sun rises in the east, this country is embarking on a course of action with regard to Iraq that in its haste is both blind and improvident. We are rushing into war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly considering the consequences, or without making any attempt to explore what steps we might take to avert a conflict. 
 The newly bellicose mood that permeates this White House is unfortunate, all the more so because it is clearly motivated by campaign politics. Republicans are already running attack ads against Democrats on Iraq. Democrats favor fast approval of a resolution so they can change the subject to domestic economic problems. 
Before risking the lives, I say to you the people out there who are watching through those electronic lenses, before risking the lives of your sons and daughters, American fighting men and women, all members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, must overcome the siren song of political polls and focus strictly on the merits, not the politics, of this most grave, this most serious undertaking, this most grave, this most serious issue that is before us. 
Mr. President, the resolution S.J. Resolution 46, which will be before this Senate, is not only a product of haste, it is also a product of presidential hubris. This resolution is breathtaking, breathtaking in its scope. It redefines the nature of defense. It reinterprets the Constitution to suit the will of the executive branch. This Constitution, which I hold in my hand, is amended without going through the constitutional process of amending this Constitution. 
S.J. Resolution 46 would give the president blanket authority to launch a unilateral, pre-emptive attack on a sovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the United States. A unilateral, pre-emptive attack on a sovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the United States. This is an unprecedented and unfounded interpretation of the president's authority under the Constitution of the United States, not to mention the fact that it stands the Charter of the United Nations on its head. 
Representative Abraham Lincoln in a letter to William H. Herndon stated: "Allow the president to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose. When you allow him to make war at pleasure, study to see if you can fix any limit to his power and disrespect. After you have given him so much as you propose, if today he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him I see no probability of the British invading us. But he would say to you be silent. I see it if you don't." 
The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated as I understand it, said Abraham Lincoln, by the following reason: kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars pretending generally if not always that the good of the people was the object. This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions. And they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter and places our president where kings have always stood.
Mr. President, if he could speak to us today, what would Abraham Lincoln say of the Bush doctrine concerning pre-emptive strikes? In a Sept. 18 report the Congressional Research Service had this to say about the pre-emptive use of military force: the historical record indicates that the United States has never to date engaged in a pre-emptive military attack against another nation. Nor has the United States ever attacked another nation militarily prior to its first having been attacked or prior to U.S. citizens or interests first having been attacked, with the singular exception of the Spanish-American War. The Spanish-American War is unique in that the principle goal of United States military action was to compel Spain to grant Cuba its political independence.
The Congressional Research Service also noted that the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 represents a threat situation, which some may argue had elements more parallel to those presented by Iraq today, but it was resolved without a pre-emptive military attack by the United States. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war and to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. 
Nowhere, nowhere in this Constitution which I hold in my hand, nowhere in the Constitution is it written that the president has the authority to call forth the militia to pre-empt a perceived threat. And yet the resolution which will be before the Senate avers that the president "has authority under the Constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States as Congress recognized in the joint resolution, on authorization for use of military force following the Sept. 11 terrorist attack." What a cynical twisting of words. What a cynical twisting of words. 
The reality is that Congress, exercising the authority granted to it under the Constitution, granted the president specific and limited authority to use force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attack. Nowhere, nowhere was an implied recognition of inherent authority under the Constitution to deter and prevent future acts of terrorism. It's not in there. It's not in that Constitution. There's no inference of it. There's no implication of it for that purpose.
Think for a moment of a precedent that this resolution will set not just for this president -- hear me now, you on the other side of the aisle -- not just for this president, but for future presidents. From the day forward American presidents will be able to invoke Senate Joint Resolution 46 as justification for launching pre-emptive military strikes against any sovereign nations that they perceive to be a threat. 
You'd better pay attention. You're not always going to have a president of your party in the White House. How will you feel about it then? How will it be then? 
Other nations will be able to hold up the United States, hold up the U.S.A. as the model to justify their military adventures. Do you not think, Mr. President, that India and Pakistan, China and Taiwan, Russia and Georgia are closely watching the outcome of this debate? Do you not think that future adversaries will look to this moment to rationalize the use of military force to achieve who knows what ends? 
Perhaps a case can be made that Iraq poses such a clear, immediate danger to the United States that pre-emptive military action is the only way to deal with that threat. To be sure, weapons of mass destruction are a 20th century and 21st century horror that the framers of the Constitution had no way of foreseeing. But they did foresee the frailty of human nature. And they saw the inherent danger of concentrating too much power in one individual. They saw that. That is why the framers bestowed on Congress not the president the power to declare war. 
As James Madison wrote in 1793, in no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confines the question of war or peace to the legislature and not to the executive department. Beside the objection to such a mixture of heterogeneous powers the trust and the temptation, the trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man. That was James Madison. The trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man. 
Mr. President, Congress has a responsibility to exercise with extreme care the power to declare war. A war against Iraq will affect thousands if not tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of lives and perhaps alter the course of history. It will surely affect the balance of power in the Middle East. It is not a decision to be taken in haste as we are being pushed today, as we are being stampeded today to act in haste. Put it behind us they say before the election. It will surely affect the balance of power in the Middle East. 
It is not a decision to be taken in haste under the glare of election-year politics and the pressure of artificial deadlines. And yet any observers can see that that is exactly, that is precisely what the Senate is proposing to do, the Senate and the House. What a shame. Fie upon the Congress. Fie upon some of the so-called leaders of the Congress for falling into this pit. 
Mr. President, the Senate is rushing to vote on whether to declare war on Iraq without pausing to ask why. We don't have time to ask why. We don't have time to get the answers to that question why. Why is war being dealt with not as a last resort but as a first resort? Why is Congress being pressured to act now? As of today, I believe 33 days before a general election when a third of the United States Senate and the entire House of Representatives are in the final highly politicized weeks of election campaign. 
Why, as recently as Tuesday, Oct. 1, this past Tuesday, the president said he had not yet made up his mind. As late as last Tuesday he had not yet made up his mind about whether to go to war with Iraq. And yet Congress is being exhorted, is being importuned, is being adjured to give the president open-ended authority now. Give it to him now to exercise whenever he pleases in the event that he decides to invade Iraq. Where are we? Where are our senses? 
Why is Congress elbowing past the president to authorize a military campaign that the president may or may not even decide to pursue? Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves? The last U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability. 
It is now October of this year of our Lord 2002. Four years have gone by in which neither this administration nor the previous one felt compelled to invade Iraq to protect against the imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction until today, until now, until 33 days before Election Day. Now we're being asked, now we're being told that we must act immediately. We must put this issue behind us. We must put this question behind us. We must act immediately we are told before adjournment and before the elections. Why the rush? Why the rush? 
Is it our precious blood which will spew forth from our feeble veins? No. Those of you who have children, those of you who have grandchildren, those of you who have great-grandchildren should be thinking. It's the precious blood of the men and women who wear the uniform of these United States, that blood may flow in the streets of Iraq. 
Yes, we had Sept. 11. But we must not make the mistake of looking at the resolution before us as just another offshoot of the war on terror. We know who was behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. We know it was Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network. We have dealt with Al Qaeda and with the Taliban government that sheltered it. We have routed them from Afghanistan. We are continuing to pursue them in hiding. So where does Iraq enter into the equation? Where? 
No one in the administration has been able to produce any solid evidence linking Iraq to the Sept. 11 attack. Iraq had biological and chemical weapons long before Sept. 11. We knew it then. We helped to give Iraq the building blocks for biological weapons. We know it now. Iraq has been an enemy of the United States for more than a decade. If Saddam Hussein is such an imminent threat to the United States why hasn't he attacked us already? 
The fact that Osama bin Laden attacked the United States does not de facto mean that Saddam Hussein is now in a lock and load position and is readying an attack on these United States. Slow down. Think. Ask questions. Debate. 
In truth, there is nothing in the deluge of administration rhetoric over Iraq that is of such moment that it would preclude the Senate from setting its own timetable and taking the time, taking the time for a thorough and informed discussion of this crucial issue.

Senator Brownback
As we look and move forward on the issue of Iraq and war with Iraq and the potential of providing the president with military authorization, I hope the body and the members and people across the country and across the world look at the potential of a post-Saddam Iraq.
Senator Kerry of Nebraska, former Senator Kerry of Nebraska and I have worked when he was in the Senate with a group called the Iraqi National Congress, it's an umbrella group of opposition leaders, to try to bring to the forefront opposition groups, bring them together and move forward with the track that once Saddam is out, moving forward with the democracy, with human rights, with individual liberties for the people of Iraq. 
And I think a lot of times we get caught too much in the, well, it's not whether we can get Saddam out, it's what are going to be the problems with doing this, and not seeing the upside potential. There's clear downside potential in taking on Saddam Hussein. There's no question about that -- potential loss of lives, of our troops, our people, terrorist threats, potential loss of lives in the region, loss of life in Iraq. All of that is unquestionable and undeniable.
It is also unquestionable and undeniable that Saddam Hussein has killed a number of people already. He's gassed his own people. He's attacked Iran. He's gassed Iranian people. He continues to rule by fear. He's killed people within his own cabinet. He's killed people within his own family. This is a man familiar with evil and has exercised it greatly. . . .
As Secretary Henry Kissinger said at a hearing that we had last week, former Secretary Kissinger said, he views that if we go in and deal with Iraq it's going to have a very positive salutary effect on the war on terrorism. It's going to say to a number of countries that we're serious on dealing with terrorists, we're serious that countries that house and support terrorists are our enemies -- you're either with us or against us in the war on terrorism. 
And if we don't go at Iraq, that our effort in the war on terrorism dwindles down into an intelligence operation. We go at Iraq and it says to countries that support terrorists, there remain six in the world that are as our definition state sponsors of terrorists, you say to those countries: We are serious about terrorism, we're serious about you not supporting terrorism on your own soil.
This is going to be a big statement that we will make. It is with a great deal of difficulty and it's with a great deal of cost. But the option of doing nothing is far worse than the option of doing something and acting now. And the upside potential of our acting and helping allow the Iraqi people their freedom to be able to move forward with a democracy is significant upside potential within that region for liberty and freedom to expand throughout that area.
So while we have this debate on granting military authority to the president, which is going to be a significant debate in this body, and hopefully we'll look at all of the issues, and I think we will. Particularly things like is Saddam Hussein going to be able to get weapons of mass destruction to terrorists and out of the country to attack other people during this period of time.
I hope we'll also look at the downside of not doing something and the upside of helping people pursue freedom and liberty like what is the potential of taking place in Iraq and the democracy there.
I also want to point out to people, a number I don't know that are familiar with this, but Saddam Hussein does not control the whole country. He doesn't control the north of Iraq. He doesn't control the Kurdish region. It was reported a number of Kurdish troops that are there that are outside of his control. He has sporadic control in the south of the country -- controls it during the day and then other times he doesn't. 
His main control is in the center, in the Baghdad region of the country. This is not a homogenous population, nor is it completely under his authoritarian rule. We're going to be able to work with populations in both the north and the south to pressure and to build pressure in on him in the center of this country when we move forward in addressing and dealing with Saddam Hussein.
It is a big issue. It's a big issue for the country. It's a big issue for the world. It's a big issue for liberty. It's a big issue on dealing with a very militant strain of, a militant politicized strain of Islam in that region and particularly in Iraq that Saddam Hussein seeks to exploit -- even though he himself would not be viewing himself as associated with it, he's certainly working to exploit that at this point in time. This is an important argument and discussion for this country and for the world.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEW YORK REGION; 
Democrats Are Divided in Debate on Force Against Iraq

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
The debate in Congress over authorizing President Bush to use force against Iraq is deeply dividing Democratic lawmakers from the New York City region, reflecting the dilemma the party faces nationally over what to do about Saddam Hussein. 
 The debate took on greater urgency today after an agreement that President Bush and leaders of both political parties in the House reached on Wednesday detailing a resolution that would authorize him to use force against Iraq. 
 Democrats here acknowledged that the agreement set the stage for approval of a joint Congressional resolution supporting action against Saddam Hussein. 
Even as one Republican after another from the New York region supported the proposal, many of the region's Democrats expressed deep misgivings about how they would ultimately stand on an issue that may be the most important they confront. 
In an interview today, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York appeared to reflect the reservations many of his colleagues have about the proposal reached this week to give the president broad authority to decide when and under what conditions to wage war against Iraq.
Mr. Schumer, for example, said he would be more inclined to support a military strike against Iraq to disarm Saddam Hussein rather than to overthrow him, as the Bush administration has argued. "Most everyone realizes you have to do something about Saddam Hussein," he said. "The debate among Democrats is how and when." 
Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from New Haven who is the assistant minority leader, was also undecided about the proposed resolution, saying that she wanted to be sure "we are seeking to work with U.N. sanction, that we are working to gain allied support, that the cost afterward will be broadly shared, and that we do not neglect the wider war on terrorism."
There are a handful of leading Democrats from the region, most notably Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who support the deal struck between Mr. Bush and the House. In fact, Mr. Lieberman joined with two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John W. Warner of Virginia, in introducing in the Senate a version of the resolution that the House and White House had agreed upon.
The loudest protests to giving the president wide latitude to wage war are coming from many black and liberal lawmakers from the region.
Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn, who said he would vote against the proposal, questioned the timing of the debate over Iraq. He noted that it comes as lawmakers are heading into the November elections, when control of the House and Senate is at stake.
Mr. Owens also said that the Bush administration was fueling talk of war to divert the public's attention from concerns at home, like the sluggish economy. "I think the administration is trying to drive the country hysterical into a situation that will make us forget our domestic problems," he said. "It's very political."
There is even misgiving among Democrats who finally decided to vote for the resolution agreed upon by the White House and the House leadership. Representative Gary L. Ackerman of Queens expressed concern that the Bush administration would not pursue all diplomatic channels available before waging war.
"It's a very difficult decision," Mr. Ackerman said. "The political concerns are huge. I would have been more comfortable putting this in the hands of an administration that had fewer cowboys and more diplomats."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE DEMOCRATS; 
United Voice on Iraq Eludes Majority Leader

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Like his party, Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, seems to be struggling to find his voice as the Senate begins its debate on Iraq.
 As a crucial election approaches that will determine whether Democrats maintain control of the Senate and he keeps his job as majority leader, Mr. Daschle is facing an uncomfortable reality: The Iraq debate is so dominating the political landscape that it is hard for his party's candidates to be heard on the bread-and-butter issues that work to their advantage. 
 Further complicating the situation, Mr. Daschle's party in the Senate is divided. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the 2000 vice-presidential nominee, and many other prominent Democratic senators are supporting President Bush without reservation. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, still the party's liberal standard-bearer, argues that the president has not made the case for a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. And Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, perhaps the Democrats' most respected intellect in the Senate, holds that military intervention in Iraq should not be authorized until the United Nations approves it. 
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and thus the Democrats' ex officio spokesman in the Senate on foreign policy, stands somewhere between the hawks and the doves. 
Mr. Biden and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, are offering a proposal that would authorize military action, but only against Iraq and not any other country, and only to rid Iraq of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Mr. Daschle came under increased pressure on Wednesday when the president and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, announced they had reached agreement on a resolution that would give Mr. Bush wide latitude to decide when and under what circumstances to begin a war.
Normally a sure-footed politician, Mr. Daschle seemed off-balance on Wednesday. He was conspicuously absent when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gephardt announced their agreement at the White House. He canceled a scheduled news conference and avoided questions all day about Iraq.
But this morning, Mr. Daschle seemed back in stride. At a news conference, he said he had reservations about the agreement Mr. Bush and Mr. Gephardt had cut, but he emphasized that he was "confident that at the end of the day, we're going to be able to develop a broad bipartisan consensus."
Mr. Daschle said his view was that the president should be authorized to launch a strike unilaterally only after all efforts to work through the United Nations had been exhausted. He also said the only ground for a pre-emptive strike should be to disarm Iraq -- not, for instance, to overthrow Saddam Hussein or protect oil fields.
In that vein, Mr. Daschle said he would vote for the Biden-Lugar proposal. But that measure is sure to be rejected. Mr. Daschle said he did not know whether he would then support the Bush resolution, which the House is expected to approve next week. If he concludes "there is no way additional improvements are possible," Mr. Daschle said, "I'll have to reassess the circumstances"
In any event, Mr. Daschle said the votes on Iraq were not a matter on which Democratic senators were expected to exercise party loyalty. "Every senator has to make his or her own judgment," he said.
The divisions among Democratic senators today are not unlike those during the Vietnam War. 
Then, there were prominent hawks like John C. Stennis and Henry M. Jackson and equally prominent doves like J. W. Fulbright and George S. McGovern. Another similarity is that several Democratic senators (including Mr. Jackson and Mr. McGovern) were considering running for president.
The majority leader at the time, Mike Mansfield, was solidly on the side of the doves. But unlike Mr. Daschle, Mr. Mansfield was an authority on foreign affairs with a freedom to speak his mind that Mr. Daschle does not enjoy.
Ever since Vietnam, Republicans have made political hay by portraying Democrats as soft on defense, and polls usually show that the public has more confidence in Republicans to handle foreign and military policy. With that in mind, many Democrats, especially those in tough election campaigns, have been wary about being seen as against war.
Many Democrats say the divisions in the party could work against them in the election next month. But one prominent Democratic lawmaker said the events this week could be advantageous. In his view, Mr. Gephardt, by supporting the president, has inoculated Democrats against the charge that they are antiwar and obstructionist. And Mr. Daschle is responding to the sense of many Americans that questions still need to be asked about policy on Iraq.
Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt expressed admiration for each other today and said their disagreement on Iraq did not reflect a fundamental split in the party's leadership.
At his own news conference, Mr. Gephardt said he was conflicted in a way politicians rarely acknowledge after they have taken a stand. "I wish I knew enough to know the absolute right thing to do," he said. "Does anyone know the right thing to do or the successful thing that will work here? I doubt it."
With Mr. Gephardt's endorsement, the Bush resolution is sure to pass the House with strong Democratic support. But one who will not vote for it is Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic whip. "I do not believe we have exhausted all diplomatic remedies," she declared.

HEADLINE: Maine Race Is Focused On Region, Not on Iraq 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: BREWER, Me., Sept. 28 

 BODY:
For all the talk in Washington about war with Iraq, some Congressional races out in the country are focused on local issues and the economy. One is here in Northern Maine's Second District, where it did not take the latest recession to put people out of work.
 State Senator Michael H. Michaud, the Democratic candidate, boasted of his 28 years' membership in the paper workers' union in East Millinocket (and 22 in the Legislature in Augusta), as he warmed up union workers who were about to go knocking on doors Saturday. He called for an increase in the minimum wage and prescription drug benefits under Medicare and denounced trade agreements like Nafta. 
 Mr. Michaud said that the claims made by his Republican opponent, Kevin L. Raye, to the independence Maine cherishes were phony, because he takes "a million dollars in Republican money for TV ads."
Mr. Raye, a longtime aide to Senator Olympia J. Snowe here and in Washington, welcomed the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business in Bangor on Friday. He said that aggressive foreign marketing of Maine products, improved transportation and getting a bigger share of the federal pie would create and keep good jobs.
He blamed high state taxes for the loss of jobs, and said that Mr. Michaud, president of the State Senate, had always voted with labor and helped create a bad business climate.
Democrats and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. say the district has lost 20,000 jobs since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994.
Iraq seems to be an issue only when a reporter asks about it. Voters hardly ever raise it.
Mr. Michaud told a news conference in Lewiston on Thursday that President Bush had not made an adequate case for war, and added, "President Bush has been using the Iraq issue to build momentum for Republican candidates."
Mr. Raye is less decisive, saying in an interview, "There is a great sense among the people that this is not an ideal situation -- to go it alone." He said Mr. Bush's father "set a good example" by assembling an alliance before the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
Abortion is a more visible issue. Mr. Michaud generally opposes abortion, while Mr. Raye generally supports abortion rights, as did the district's last three representatives: John Baldacci, the Democratic incumbent who is vacating the seat to run for governor; Senator Snowe; and her Republican predecessor William S. Cohen. "A pro-life candidate has never won here," Mr. Raye said.
But while each candidate has received contributions from abortion interest groups, neither sounds like a true believer to a cause.
Mr. Raye favors a ban on all abortions after a fetus could live outside the womb if an exception is made for the physical health of the mother. Mr. Michaud says he opposes a constitutional amendment overturning Roe v. Wade and the anti-abortion limitations the Bush administration has put on family planning programs here and abroad. But in 1998 he answered a Maine Right to Life Committee questionnaire to say he favored "legislation that would prevent abortion, except to prevent the death of the mother."
Several local polls have shown Mr. Michaud with a lead, though one no larger than the surveys' margins of sampling error. The Raye camp does not dispute the polls, but maintains they result from the Democrat's greater name recognition, and insist the gap will close. Until he won the nomination in May, Mr. Raye said, "I was virtually invisible."
With Representatives J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, and Richard A. Gephardt, the minority leader, each scheduled for a campaign stop, the national political parties are heavily invested in this campaign. So is the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
For all the advantages of incumbency, open seats like this one are where most party changes take place, as they did in 1994 when Ms. Snowe ran for the Senate and Mr. Baldacci succeeded her. So, if the Republicans can overcome Mr. Michaud's lead and retake the seat, it would help them prevent a Democratic takeover of the House.
Christian P. Potholm, professor of government at Bowdoin College just outside the district, said the race between two appealing candidates was very much in doubt. Neither had worked hard enough, he said, to broaden his appeal. 
The "national liberal Democratic agenda" would get Mr. Michaud only 45 percent of the vote, Dr. Potholm said, but he needed to reach beyond it. He said that Mr. Michaud's record at Augusta, including sponsorship of prescription drug legislation, assured him of union support and that he now had to reach beyond it.
Dr. Potholm said that Senator Snowe's backing was important for Mr. Raye, whose slogan is "Ready on Day One" because of his experience as her chief of staff. But he said Mr. Raye still had to "get out of that chrysalis of a staffer" and show himself as a leader in his own right.
Social Security is not the issue here that it is elsewhere. While Mr. Michaud lumps his opponent with Republicans in Washington who have favored putting some Social Security payments into private accounts, Republicans are running a commercial accusing Mr. Michaud of seeking to tax its benefits. His proposal, which was vetoed by Gov. Angus King, would have subjected high-income taxpayers to Maine income taxes on Social Security benefits, just as they are taxed by the federal government.
Mr. Raye argues that his experience as a local aide in Bangor and then in Washington is the ideal mix for a congressman. Mr. Michaud scoffed: "He has no record at all. Staffers don't have to make the tough decisions when it comes to vote -- or to compromise."

HEADLINE: Warren Buffett Moves to Help Group Trying to Reduce Nuclear and Biological Threats 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
In a small but significant philanthropic gesture, Warren E. Buffett is opening his huge wallet to help support a group founded by Ted Turner and former Senator Sam Nunn whose aim is to reduce the threat of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
 Calling the threat posed by nuclear and other unconventional weapons "the ultimate problem" confronting mankind, Mr. Buffett said yesterday that he had decided to give the group, the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative, $2.5 million over five years and become an adviser to its board. His commitment to the group is to be announced on Friday. 
 "It's not that much money," said Mr. Buffett, American's second wealthiest man, who runs the investment company Berkshire Hathaway. But he said he hoped it would "encourage other businessmen to get involved" in confronting a challenge that "boggles the mind."
"The genie was let out of the bottle in the 1940's," he said, referring to the creation of the atomic bomb. While there was no "putting it back into the bottle," Mr. Buffett said, the "best answer is what Sam Nunn is doing."
The initiative was founded almost two years ago with a pledge of stock that Mr. Turner held in AOL Time Warner that was then worth about $250 million. Since January 2001, the group has spent roughly $37 million on projects such as helping secure nuclear material stored in Russia, helping create a revolving fund to respond quickly to infectious disease outbreaksand, most recently, removing highly enriched uranium from a poorly secured reactor in Belgrade to a safer site. 
But the group has been hard pressed by the 77.9 percent decline in the price of AOL Time Warner stock. Mr. Turner has told the foundation that he would "do what he can to meet the $250 million commitment." But Mr. Nunn said in an interview, "There is no binding commitment beyond the number of shares." As a result, Mr. Nunn said, although the group was not cutting its staff of 32 and still planned to spend $30 million on projects this year and $25 million in 2003, it would be unable to undertake any expensive new projects. He said he would raise more money.
Given the fragile state of the stock market, Mr. Nunn said, "Warren Buffett's commitment is even more important than it would normally be at this stage." 
Mr. Buffett said he had long been concerned about the danger posed by weapons of mass destruction but had not gotten involved because he did not initially believe the danger could be mitigated by money. As he came to know of the tive's work through his friendship with Mr. Nunn on the Coca-Cola board, he said he became convinced that the group's projects could make a difference.
"You don't want an Einstein or a Russian biological warrior to be starving," Mr. Buffett said, referring to American and international efforts to ensure that scientists with such deadly expertise are gainfully and peacefully employed. Investments in keeping such people and material out of harm's way, he said, "may increase the probability of getting through the next 50 years."
Mr. Buffett also supported President Bush's stance on Iraq, arguing that limiting the threat of Saddam Hussein's unconventional weapons might limit the danger he posed. 
"If I thought the probability was high that a nation of some resources was developing really potent weapons to use against me, and that there was a high probability that he would use them, I think you have to act pre-emptively," Mr. Buffett said.
He declined to discuss what impact a war against Iraq would have on the economy. "People think I know what I'm talking about," he said. "So I have to be careful." 
He said he looked forward to being consulted by Mr. Nunn and Mr. Turner as they saw fit. Mr. Nunn said Mr. Buffett's involvement with the initiative would be particularly valuable not only in fund-raising, but also in persuading pharmaceutical companies and other biotech concerns that it is worth investing in research and development efforts that rely on skills of former Soviet scientists.
Mr. Turner called Mr. Buffett to thank him for his gift to the initiative. "Ted comes in technicolor," Mr. Buffett said, adding that he admired him for thinking in terms of "big causes" and committing large sums to them.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: EMC Plans To Lay Off 1,350 

BYLINE:  By Barnaby J. Feder (NYT) 

 BODY:
 EMC, the leading vendor of data storage systems, said late yesterday that sales had dropped off at the end of the third quarter, making it unlikely that the company could return to profitability this year, and that it would lay off 1,350 employees, or 7 percent of its work force. EMC estimated that it had revenue of $1.25 billion in the quarter, at least 10 percent less than Wall Street had expected. "The harsh reality of reduced budgets and the uncertainty of the economic and geopolitical climate are weighing heavily on business confidence," said Joseph M. Tucci, chief executive of EMC, which is based in Hopkinton, Mass. EMC's shares, which closed at $5.01 in trading during the day, fell as much as $4.32 in after-hours trading. Shares of other data storage companies, including Emulex, Brocade Communications Systems, Network Appliance and McData also fell after EMC's report.

HEADLINE: Defining Evil in The Wake Of 9/11 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
IT seems all too familiar: on a fall morning in a major city, civilization is disrupted. In less than a half-hour, buildings are destroyed, thousands are killed, the sky turns dark with dust. Philosophers and religious leaders invoke the concept of evil. Some blame the sinful behavior of the citizenry and cite divine retribution; others believe that civil society will soon restore itself.
 But this is Lisbon, not New York; Nov. 1, not Sept. 11; 1755, not 2001; and the event is not a terrorist attack but an earthquake followed by raging fires and tidal floods. The philosopher Susan Neiman compares these events in her new book, "Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy" (Princeton University Press), and the contrasts are more telling than the similarities. Ms. Neiman, a Kantian scholar and director of the Einstein Forum, an interdisciplinary research institution in Potsdam, Germany, treats the Lisbon earthquake as a turning point in European intellectual history. It redefined the way evil was thought about -- something, she suggests, that is not likely to happen as a result of 9/11. 
 But the subject of evil is now becoming the focus of unusual attention. New books are out about fundamentalism and evil, like "When Religion Becomes Evil," by Charles Kimball (Harper San Francisco), and about the psychology of evil, as in "Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing," by James Waller (Oxford University Press). In "Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation" (Polity Press), Richard J. Bernstein, a philosopher at the New School University, begins by quoting Hannah Arendt, who declared in 1945, "The problem of evil will be the fundamental question of postwar intellectual life in Europe." 
But Arendt's prediction was right for only a short time. Despite all the horrors of the 20th century, including the Gulag, the Cambodian killing fields and the "ethnic cleansing" in the Balkans, the "problem of evil" began to seem somewhat quaint. Mr. Bernstein writes, "It is almost as if the language of evil has been dropped from contemporary moral and ethical discourse." 
In fact, when the word evil was used by President Bush to describe the terrorist attacks, it was partly because it was an anachronistic term, premodern in its force. He seemed deliberately to seek an antique religious aura, asserting the existence of moral absolutes in an era that doubted them.
Ms. Neiman is too subtle a reader of Kant to believe that evil is that simple, but it is also, she argues, so important that much of Western philosophy is an attempt to comprehend it. We apply the concept, after all, when we cannot make sense of a horrific event. Evil is not just an ethical violation; it is an "epistemological" violation, she writes; it disrupts and challenges our interpretations of the world. 
In the premodern era, Ms. Neiman explains, evil referred as much to natural catastrophes as to willful acts. One of the tasks of philosophy and religion was to interpret such cataclysms. So suffering became a result of original sin. A catastrophe was divine punishment. Then, in the 17th century, Leibniz invented the term theodicy to describe his defense of a God accused of creating an evil world; the word later came to mean an attempt to account for evil itself. Leibniz argued that we really live in the best of all possible worlds. Bad things seem to happen to good people because we lack God's omniscience.
But in Ms. Neiman's account, the earthquake in Lisbon disrupted all that. The world was becoming more scientifically intelligible, and a modern economy was developing. So when disaster struck, the old theodicy was inadequate. The earthquake caused philosophical trauma. Kant wrote about it. Voltaire and Rousseau argued over it. Gradually, Ms. Neiman says, the idea of a catastrophe being a "natural evil" disappeared; its divorce from the notion of "moral evil" became "part of the meaning of modernity." 
Explaining moral evil in a world of autonomous actors while still maintaining faith in Providence was no easy task, and Ms. Neiman eloquently outlines the attempts. In the 18th century, Rousseau "replaced theology with history," she argues, by suggesting that evil and suffering were the results not of original sin but of error and misguided civilization. Later, Hegel turned history into theodicy by explaining all suffering and evil as unavoidable elements of an evolutionary process. Marx responded with an economic theodicy -- an account of societies and their evils -- complete with prescriptions for healing suffering. Freud turned inward, tracing evil and suffering to thwarted infantile desires and to civilization's inevitable discontents.
These varied theodicies tried to account for evil, to make it comprehensible, at times even to dismiss it. Ms. Neiman seems to suggest that by the first part of the 20th century, "moral evil," like "natural evil" before it, had come to seem almost a banal idea, little more than another element of the natural world or a reflection of psychology or economics. 
But then came yet another trauma, one that was as disruptive to the 20th century as Lisbon was to the 18th: Auschwitz. Only this time, Ms. Neiman argues, it undermined the very possibility of constructing a theodicy. "The problem of evil began by trying to penetrate God's intentions," she writes. "Now it appears we cannot make sense of our own."
More than 50 years later, where are we? Oddly, when Ms. Neiman comes to the events of 9/11, she seems ill at ease. She says that they leave a "sense of conceptual helplessness." In her discussion, two notions of evil seem to confront each other: the post-Auschwitz and the pre-Lisbon. This is a small part of the book, but it may be more important than Ms. Neiman realizes. 
She argues that the attacks did not reflect new forms of evil; in fact they were "old fashioned" in their elemental power. They harked back to the Lisbon earthquake, seeming like a "natural evil" in their swift horror. "Crude forms of theodicy" even developed as a result, including at least one assertion that the attacks were the consequences of American sin. 
Yet despite her recognition of pre-Lisbon evil, she is astonishingly condescending to those who immediately called the acts evil; she ascribes to those unnamed figures a "simple and demonic" view of evil, one encouraged by watching "old westerns." 
On the other side, she describes those with supposedly more sophisticated views, influenced "less by Hollywood than by Chile and Vietnam and Auschwitz and Cambodia."
"We have learned," she writes (for she includes herself), to see evil in the acts of governments and to see "starvation furthered by corporate interests." In other words, more sophisticated people have learned to discover evils that they feel have been perpetrated by the West.
Yet she is palpably uncomfortable with the responses of this second group, for their post-Auschwitz view of Western evil has led them to a "paralyzed moral reaction" to Sept. 11, as if they couldn't condemn one evil because they believed in another, as if by calling the attacks evil, they would be lending support to "those with fewer scruples." This view of the attacks, she writes, "appeared to relativize them" and "risked a first step toward making them justifiable." She insists that the attacks be forthrightly described as evil -- which wouldn't preclude condemning other evils as well. 
In much of this analysis, she has accurately described an intellectual debate that continues. But her condescension toward those who first condemned the acts as evil and her denigration of their scruples don't seem to fit with her conclusion: that these people were actually correct. She remains uneasy in her convictions and in the company she must keep.
But the opposing view, with its mentions of Vietnam and "corporate interests" can spur unease in other ways. These evils -- if evils they are -- are not instantly perceived but are judged evil according to particular interpretations and political theories. But aren't these theories also theodicies, some with their own "simple and demonic" views of evil? Suffering is explained by material forces latent in economics and power politics. Even 9/11 is treated as a consequence of more fundamental evils: those created by imperialism and Western power. 
There is, then, good reason for Ms. Neiman's discomfort, for in many ways the experience of Sept. 11 does resemble Lisbon. It seems to challenge regnant theodicies. Simply applying the label evil leaves the event without a modern context; it does not show how that evil is to be understood. But the supposedly more sophisticated post-Auschwitz view is also a problem. The terrorists' motivations and beliefs may not be easily reduced to familiar notions of "root causes." 
So both the pre-Lisbon and the post-Auschwitz view of evil seem unstable. Interpretations are in dispute. This is an almost classic response to the experience of evil; and in its wake, new theodicies may one day start to replace the old.

HEADLINE: Kill the Energy Bill 

 BODY:
Negotiators from the House and Senate have been struggling to reconcile two different versions of a multibillion-dollar energy bill. They would do themselves and the nation a tremendous favor by junking the whole thing and agreeing to start all over again next year. Though the Senate bill is preferable to the House's, neither version would measurably improve the nation's energy security or lessen its dependence on Mideast oil now or in the future -- which is what the whole exercise was supposed to be about. Both are also suspect on environmental grounds. 
 There are bound to be a few good things in a bill this big, and there are. Both versions include various tax breaks for greater energy efficiency and renewable, non-fossil fuels, like wind and solar power. The Senate is also pushing some potentially useful incentives to make the energy transmission markets more reliable and decentralize them. 
 Nevertheless, these and other useful ideas are buried under an avalanche of subsidies for traditional producers of fossil fuels -- oil, natural gas and especially coal. In that sense, the bill points in exactly the wrong direction, enriching industries that already have plenty of investment capital while doing relatively little to encourage newer technologies that could lead the way to a less oil-dependent energy future. 
Even some of the "renewable fuel" provisions are not what they seem. The worst example is a so-called ethanol mandate that would triple the amount of ethanol used as a fuel additive over the next 10 years. There are no persuasive environmental arguments for ethanol; clean-burning gasoline can be made without it. Nor is it attractive as an alternative fuel. Ethanol is produced from starches, mainly corn, but as of now it requires nearly as much energy to produce as it gives back. The ethanol mandate amounts to a giveaway to the big corn producers and the politicians who represent them.
The most important step this nation could take to ease its dependence on Middle Eastern oil is to tighten fuel economy standards, which have not changed since 1985. In March, however, the Senate bowed to union and industry pressure and rejected an effort to increase fuel efficiency by 50 percent over 13 years, a technologically feasible move that would have saved 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, or roughly our current imports from the Persian Gulf. The conference committee's response is a pathetic little measure that aims to save about 25 million barrels over five years (or about 10 days' worth of imports). Loopholes in the measure would cancel out even this modest saving.
The terrorist attacks and California's power crisis challenged Congress to devise a comprehensive, innovative energy strategy. It has failed to do so. The new Congress that convenes in January should make a fresh start.

HEADLINE: A Pension Fund Chief Bets on US Airways 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
In its new partner, the Retirement Systems of Alabama, US Airways is dealing with a pension fund that not only seeks out crafty investments but has another critical motivation: jobs for Alabamans.
 That's a far cry from what the airline expected when it tried to link up with the Texas Pacific Group, a group of financial managers experienced in turning around failing carriers. 
 The Alabama pension fund has no aviation track record. Rather, it has an idiosyncratic chief executive, David G. Bronner, who after hearing about the Texas Pacific offer, simply decided to top it.
The fund's bid, initially rebuffed, was accepted by US Airways last week. It calls for the fund to invest $240 million of state pension money into US Airways, in return for a 37.5 percent stake after the airline emerges from bankruptcy protection next year. The Montgomery-based pension fund is also putting up $500 million in financing and will restructure leases it holds on $340 million worth of US Airways planes. 
Mr. Bronner, in an interview, insisted he has no plans to interfere with management, but in the same breath made no secret of his agenda.
"The investment provides me with an opportunity to say, 'If you are going to expand in x, y or z, there's no reason why it can't be in Alabama,' " Mr. Bronner said by telephone from his office. That may mean more US Airways flights to Alabama's major cities or putting back-office operations in the state.
And doubtless he will not be shy about persuading executives to make those moves. Over the years, he has sunk millions of dollars from the $25 billion fund into hotels and golf courses, and bought hundreds of newspapers and dozens of television stations. Moreover, he has used those assets to attract tourists and even more business to the state, as when he offered free advertising last winter to help wrest a $1 billion Hyundai plant away from Kentucky.
While he insists that whatever US Airways decides to do must make financial sense, even broaching the state's agenda worries some public policy experts and industry analysts.
"You have to separate out what is an economic development goal from a prudent approach to investing," said Randall W. Eberts, executive director of the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich. "When you bring the two together too closely, you run the risk of putting both in jeopardy."
Raymond Neidl, who follows airlines for Blaylock & Partners in New York, was a bit more sanguine. "If it makes business sense, fine, but there should be no pressure," he said. "Putting routes in because one of your principal owners wants it will ruin the airline."
Mr. Bronner, 57, admits his bid shocked David N. Siegel, the US Airways chief executive, who was on a business trip to South America when Retirement Systems made its bid. Mr. Siegel had worked with the Texas Pacific Group to reorganize Continental Airlines in the 1990's, and had brought the turnaround specialists in to repair US Airways. Mr. Bronner wants Mr. Siegel to manage the airline just as he would have if Texas Pacific had prevailed.
"We do not run any of our operating companies," Mr. Bronner said. The reorganization plan gives the pension fund 5 of 13 seats on the board, but Mr. Bronner said he had not decided who would fill them.
Mr. Bronner's unorthodox series of investments and uncanny timing have won him comparisons to the billionaire financier Warren E. Buffett, a source of pride for Mr. Bronner, who has yet to meet Mr. Buffett. Another comparison is apt, too.
In 1989, Mr. Buffett made his own disastrous investment in US Airways, an action he later termed "temporary insanity." Mr. Bronner said Mr. Buffett's experience was one reason he will not become involved in running the airline. "That's why you have professional nuts to run it," said Mr. Bronner, who was advised in his move by Rono J. Dutta, the former United Air Lines president.
Unlike Mr. Buffett, a confessed "air-oholic," Mr. Bronner said he has had no lifelong desire to run an airline. Indeed, Mr. Bronner, born in Iowa, was rebuffed in his only earlier attempt to enter the business. The summer after his freshman year at Mankato State University in Minnesota, he tried to land a job as a baggage handler at United in Chicago.
Instead, he wound up working for the Rock Island Railroad, completed his undergraduate and master's degrees, then moved to Tuscaloosa to attend law school as well as earn a doctorate in administration at the University of Alabama. (In Alabama, he is often given the "doctor" title.) Serving at the university for a year as assistant dean, he was named chief executive of the pension fund in 1973, when it had only $500 million in assets.
His first huge risk came in 1975, when New York City was gasping financially. As he was walking the streets and looking up at skyscrapers during a trip to Manhattan, he remembered thinking: "This is the best and neatest city in the world. They're not going to turn off the lights." And soon his pension fund became the biggest investor in Consolidated Edison bonds.
Mr. Bronner came to New York's aid again during its late 1980's fiscal crisis, buying $200 million in city bonds, and investing $100 million in 55 Water Street, built by the real estate firm Olympia & York. The firm subsequently went under, taking most of the value of Mr. Bronner's investment with it. He pitched in to take control of the building, investing millions more for renovations and upkeep. Now that investment is worth $830 million. 
Asked whether his heart really lies in New York, not Alabama, Mr. Bronner replied, "I'd rather visit."
Back in Alabama, Mr. Bronner is a weighty political presence, his quips and barbs attracting frequent attention. Two years ago, he ruffled some feathers by praising former Gov. George C. Wallace as "a good politician" for listening to voters and getting ahead of their concerns. He also caused a flurry of debate last year by declaring that Alabama needed to raise taxes so residents could get better services and education. "Low taxes are good," he said, "but the lowest taxes in America are dumb."
Friends say he relishes the spotlight. "Dr. David takes no prisoners," said Theodore J. vonCannon, president of the Birmingham Metropolitan Development Board. Mr. vonCannon has no problem with Mr. Bronner's direction of the state's pension fund. "The important thing is to make money, but he can meet that goal and create jobs for the state," Mr. vonCannon said. "I think it is marvelous."
Mr. Bronner's quest to shift US Airways' operations to Alabama will be merely a sidelight once the airline comes out of bankruptcy, contends John Ash, a Washington-based aviation consultant. "US Airways is a high-risk situation, but there are a lot of high-risk situations that pension funds get into."
Mr. Bronner's action has support, too, from US Airways' unions, whose representatives will receive seats on the board. "We'll take Mr. Bronner at his word, much as we were going to take Texas Pacific Group at their word, that he's not going to meddle in the company," said Jeff Zack, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants.
Mr. Zack said the unions are not concerned about getting assistance from a right-to-work state's pension fund. "If they were to move their headquarters to Alabama," he said, "that would be another story."
Mr. Bronner has no such plans, nor will one of Alabama's airports become a US Airways hub. "That would be a stretch," he said. But Marc Pelham, director of marketing at the Mobile airport, said he would like to see direct flights to Washington and Florida, supplementing the three each day to Charlotte, N.C. Such a move might be possible, Mr. Bronner said, as US Airways adds efficient regional jets after it emerges from bankruptcy.
Mr. Bronner said the turnaround plan would ultimately make US Airways into a viable competitor to low-fare carriers, which, he contends, may beat US Airways on cost, but cannot compete in scope. "People can always talk about JetBlue," he said, "but what's he got -- 20 airplanes? That's nice. But they can't service 59 million passengers like US Airways."

HEADLINE: A Double Whammy on Long Island 

 BODY:
Faced with sluggish sales tax revenues and soaring pension, health insurance and Medicaid costs, counties in the New York metropolitan region are facing cuts in popular services and hikes in local taxes to balance their budgets. And Albany isn't helping. On Long Island, the Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, confronts a fiscal double whammy. Not only must he surmount the current economic downturn, but he must do so even as he grapples with the financial crisis left behind by his Republican predecessor, Thomas Gulotta. 
 Mr. Suozzi's 2003 budget proposal shows him moving aggressively to balance the books and overhaul creaky government operations. For example, his plan contemplates shrinking the county payroll by 1,400 workers -- a reduction of about 15 percent over the next 12 months. It also includes the 19.4 percent increase in the county portion of the property tax bill, which the Legislature's Democratic majority approved last spring. He has warned that future tax increases may be necessary if the economy does not rebound, mandated costs continue to rise or unions refuse givebacks. 
 One big-ticket item that Nassau must trim is the police budget. Including generous overtime benefits, an average Nassau County police officer now makes $101,000 a year, far more than the average New York City officer makes.
Unlike Mr. Gulotta, who posed only meek opposition to police contract demands in order to preserve the police union's endorsement, Mr. Suozzi has not been shy about criticizing the county's unduly generous police contracts. He has called on the unions to accept a three-year pay freeze, and more than $30 million a year in contract givebacks. Otherwise, Mr. Suozzi has warned, he may need to make drastic cuts in buses and parks, and programs for teenagers and the elderly.
The police should not be made scapegoats for the county's fiscal debacle. But Mr. Suozzi is right to inform the public -- and the state arbitration panel that will probably decide the longstanding contract impasse -- about some of the real trade-offs ahead. Will the county keep its senior centers open or continue to pay officers a 10 percent bonus for "night" work that begins at 11 a.m.? Posing such choices aloud may be smart negotiating strategy on Mr. Suozzi's part. But the truth is that Nassau is broke; it cannot afford both.

HEADLINE: Some Urban Areas Find Ways to Grow 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
Despite the dearth of new jobs across much of the nation, some metropolitan areas around the country are growing again by selling themselves as lower-cost alternatives to more expensive cities.
 One place where this is readily apparent is the Baltimore metropolitan area, where an estimated 40,000 people living in the city and its surrounding suburbs have gained jobs since the beginning of the year, helping cut the area's unemployment rate from 5.5 percent in January to 4.8 percent in August, according to the most recent local data available. That was well below the national average and considerably better than most other major cities. 
 Baltimore has done so partly by the spillover of people and businesses from Washington, less than 50 miles away, which has much more expensive housing and has suffered from the decline of some of its high-technology industries.
In much of the country, unemployment rates are still relatively high, averaging just under 6 percent over the summer, according to the Labor Department, roughly the same as at the beginning of the year. 
But while many regions, particularly the industrial belt around the Great Lakes, the Southwest and the high-technology centers of the West Coast, are still languishing, rays of light from several areas -- like Baltimore, and in different ways, Denver and Las Vegas -- are breaking through the clouds hanging over the economy.
"People and businesses are trading down, trying to find the cheapest places to live and work," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for the research firm Economy.com.
Boston; New York; Washington; San Jose, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle, among others, have been "paying the price," he said, as companies seeking to expand have sought cheaper areas with strong appeal to potential employees, particularly those looking for a less stressful place to live.
Unemployment in New York, for example, rose to 7.1 percent in August from 5.9 percent a year earlier; the jobless rate rose to 7 percent in Portland, from 6.3 percent, and 7.6 percent in San Jose from 5.8 percent.
With the gain in jobs in and around Baltimore has come a boom in new office space in crystalline towers and refurbished brick bastions as well.
"There has just been building after building, and everything's worked," said Raymond A. Mason, the chairman and chief executive of Legg Mason, a financial services firm based in Baltimore. "There has been no apparent diminution. The downside which some areas have seen has just never been visible."
The fallout from last September's attacks may also be helping the suburban expanse between Baltimore and Washington attract employers because of its lower visibility and the perception of greater safety compared with New York and downtown Washington. Last October was a record month for new members of the Baltimore-Washington Corridor Chamber of Commerce, which spans four suburban counties between the cities, said H. Walter Townshend, the chamber's president and chief executive.
Baltimore's efforts to cut crime and enliven its downtown also appear to have paid off. When the opportunity arose to fill a role as a less expensive substitute for Washington and other big East Coast cities like Philadelphia and New York, Baltimore was ready.
"We are making a much more conscious effort to market to Washington," said Martin O'Malley, Baltimore's mayor. "If you peel away the knocks that we had against us -- that were once founded in reality -- you find a wonderful city." 
At a home-buying fair last month organized by Live Baltimore Marketing Center, a not-for-profit organization working with the mayor's office, more than a third of the 700 people attending came from out of town. The number who ventured from the Washington area -- more than 100 prospective homeowners -- was double that of the previous fair, in May. Home prices have been rising steadily in three-quarters of Baltimore's neighborhoods, but they remain well below those in most other big East Coast cities.
Cindy Bacon, a co-owner of Obrycki's Restaurant in East Baltimore, said most of the people moving to the city appeared to be either young professionals or retirees. Those groups are the same that Persephone Meacham, property manager of the Munsey, a newly renovated luxury apartment building in downtown Baltimore, said she was seeking. Mr. Mason agreed that after recessions of recent years depleted Baltimore's industries and reduced the city's population, it became "much less of a blue-collar town."
Much of the job growth here is indeed occurring in the suburbs. In Baltimore County, which surrounds the city, some companies that held off on expansions in anticipation of the recession are now back on track, said Robert L. Hannon, the county's director of economic development.
Owings Mills, a western suburb, was the perfect place for Toyota Financial Services' new administrative nerve center, said Michael R. Groff, the company's vice president for planning and development.
"We, like a lot of companies, looked for a balance of a good place to do business, availability of affordable housing, and quality and availability of the work force," he said. More than 400 employees, about 80 percent of them hired from the local area, work in the company's new 100,000-square-foot office building.
Elsewhere in the country, Denver appears to be another beneficiary of the trading-down phenomenon. This year, despite the loss of telecom jobs, the Denver metropolitan area has gained 32,000 jobs; its unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3 percent from 6 percent.
Though job growth in greater Denver had been faster before last year's recession, and the downturn in telecommunications dealt the area some early reverses, its economy appears to be getting back on track. "We're not getting hit with huge, huge layoffs," said Patricia L. Silverstein, president of Development Research Partners in Littleton, Colo., and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce's consulting economist. "Most of our job hits recently have been in smaller numbers."
Joe Blake, the Denver Metro Chamber's chief executive, said that signs of a true recovery were not yet apparent. But he said this year's job growth could signal a continuation of a trend interrupted by the recession: young, well-educated workers choosing Denver's relaxed pace and high quality of life rather than settling in older business hubs.
"We have had a strong underlying growth in small business that's reflective of the entrepreneurial work force that we have here," Mr. Blake said.
Mr. Zandi also cited the Riverside area in Southern California as an increasingly attractive alternative to companies looking to put operations in less expensive places than Los Angeles, which is more than an hour's drive to the west, or the San Francisco Bay area.
In many other areas of the country, the pace of growth is being determined less by the current economic cycle than by longer-term effects, said William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Business. In New England, he said, stable industries like insurance and medical care have insulated the economy from the worst of the recession's aftermath. But on and near the West Coast, there is "a huge amount of capacity in technology which is now exceptionally weak."
Mr. Dunkelberg's monthly survey of small-business owners, last conducted in August, provides a stark illustration of the weakness in the Pacific states. Only 7 percent of owners there said they planned to expand their companies in the next six months, compared with 14 percent nationwide. Sixteen percent of employers said they would shrink their work forces by February, compared with 7 percent nationwide.
Oregon and Washington, both with unemployment rates of 7 percent or higher in August, are suffering from a sharp falloff in business confidence, Mr. Dunkelberg said. The situation around Seattle could get worse, Mr. Zandi added, because of slackening in Boeing's production of aircraft.
By contrast, in the Eastern corridor from northern New Jersey to Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Dunkelberg said, business confidence is as high as in New England. One factor behind that more optimistic outlook results from the fact that the region, including greater Baltimore, is home to many of the biggest military contractors, beneficiaries of the recent emphasis on heightened national security.
Mr. Mason said Maryland was benefiting from boom times at aerospace and military specialists like Lockheed Martin, whose headquarters are in Bethesda, Md., outside Washington, and Northrop Grumman, whose electronic systems division is based in Baltimore. "All of those are thriving right now."
Despite the varying trends now perceptible across the nation, Mr. Zandi said, the differences are not as wide as they were in earlier recessions. The reasons, he said, include increased mobility of workers and capital, the continued strength of the housing markets, and the ability to use information technology to knit together far-flung enterprises.
"We have more options and information, and people are willing to use it," he said. "You don't see persistently high unemployment or low unemployment to the degree you did in the past. People will move more readily now because they can sell their home. In the last recession, even if you wanted to move, you couldn't."

HEADLINE: Pataki Campaign Has 12 Times the War Chest McCall Has as the Race Winds Down 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
With 32 days until Election Day, H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor, remains at a serious financial disadvantage. His rival, Gov. George E. Pataki, has 12 times as much money to spend in the final month of the campaign, according to documents filed yesterday.
 Mr. McCall, who is trailing in the polls and has spent the last week on the defensive against accusations of impropriety, has kept his public appearances to a minimum while trying to to raise money. 
 Records filed with the State Campaign Finance Board show he raised $596,330 in the past two weeks, spent $1.48 million during that time and now has $1.1 million left for ads, mailings and get-out-the-vote drives before Nov. 5.
That is a fraction of what Mr. Pataki and a third-party candidate, Tom Golisano, have in their campaign coffers.
Mr. Golisano, the self-financed Rochester billionaire who is the Independence Party candidate, is helping drive this race toward breaking the spending record for a statewide campaign, set at $91 million in the 2000 Senate race.
All the candidates combined -- including Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democrat who quit the race the week before the primary -- have spent nearly $89 million and are on pace to break the $119 million national record for a non-presidential contest, set in the 1998 governor's race in California.
Because Mr. Pataki did not have to weather a Republican Party primary, he was not required until yesterday to update the campaign filings from his main campaign account since July. Yesterday's filing was the first glimpse of his biggest war chest in nearly three months, and it showed he raised more than $3.4 million for it since mid-July.
The Pataki campaign has spent more than $27 million overall and raised more than $40 million since Mr. Pataki's re-election funds were established, the filing shows. Nearly $10 million of that was spent in recent weeks on a blitz that has included a series of television advertisements across the state. Mr. Pataki, a Republican seeking a third term, has about $12.2 million left, about 12 times more than Mr. McCall.
Mr. Golisano, who defeated Mr. Pataki in the Independence Party primary on Sept. 10, has spent the most, however, with $8.75 million paid out in the past two weeks. That increased his total spending to about $39.7 million.
Altogether, Mr. McCall has raised more than $12 million and spent about $11 million.
His dwindling campaign account suggests he is hampered by money problems at a time when his rivals are increasing their television advertising to capture voter interest in the pivotal final few weeks of the race.
Mr. McCall has not been helped in his fund-raising efforts by the controversy over referral letters he wrote, on state comptroller stationery, for friends and relatives seeking work at companies with business before the pension fund that Mr. McCall oversees. While insisting he had not broken any laws, he apologized Thursday for any impression of impropriety.
Mr. McCall's aides said they had expected all along that he would be outspent by his rivals, and that they did not believe the controversy slowed his fund-raising.
"It can always go better," Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Mr. McCall, said. "But we have enough money to match the governor on TV and we know we will have enough to get a positive message out about Carl McCall and the truthful message about George Pataki."
He noted that Mr. McCall is expecting a surge of money from a fund-raiser on Oct. 23 with President Bill Clinton. McCall advisers have said that while it may seem late in the game, there was a possibility Mr. McCall's running mate, Dennis Mehiel, a millionaire, could loan the campaign money to tide it over. Mr. Mehiel has made such loans to the campaign in the past, but not during the latest filing period.
Mr. Golisano, who has set no limit on how much of his personal fortune he will tap, has done the most to push the race to record spending levels. He has made no apologies for his spending, instead criticizing Mr. Pataki for not counting in his spending reports appearances he makes in his role as governor in state-funded commercials promoting the state or its programs.
Spending has been further inflated by the Democratic primary, which was competitive until Mr. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, dropped out. He had raised about $12.8 million and spent about $11.3 million. Mr. Cuomo has not disclosed what he plans to do with his remaining money, though his aides have said some of it would pay off campaign debts.
Mr. Pataki spent the day upstate making announcements about economic development grants. In Rochester he doled out $1.5 million in economic aid for businesses, the latest in a series of such announcements he has made in recent weeks. Although critics have questioned the timing of the announcements, Mr. Pataki has made no apologies.
"I'm not going to stop because it happens to be October," he said.
Mr. McCall held a news conference at City Hall in New York City to attack the governor on a range of issues, saying he had not done enough to equalize wages between men and women. He also cast doubt on reports that the governor and the Republican-controlled State Senate were moving closer to an agreement on a bill, delayed for decades, that would prohibit discrimination in housing and employment on the basis of sexual orientation.
"I would think that people would see through that for what it is," Mr. McCall said. "It's an election-type ploy because they know that they don't enjoy support among communities in New York who are concerned about such legislation."

HEADLINE: For Stalled Produce, Only Bite Is at Headquarters 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif., Oct. 4 

 BODY:
Last Sunday, Tanimura & Antle Inc., one of the nation's largest vegetable growers, shipped 20 truckloads of broccoli to the Port of Oakland to be exported to Japan and Taiwan.
 But all that broccoli is still sitting there, and Charles Schreiber, director of international sales for the Salinas company, is alarmed that the broccoli, worth $320,000, will spoil if West Coast ports do not reopen soon. 
"You feel helpless," Mr. Schreiber said. "We have 20 containers sitting there, and every day the product gets older and we can't do a thing about it. That's a hard pill to swallow." 
Worse yet, he said, is that his company, which normally exports half its produce, has many acres of broccoli and celery still to harvest, and no one knows what to do with all that fast-ripening produce. Some broccoli, he said, may be left in the field to rot.
From California's endless vegetable fields, to Washington State's bountiful apple orchards to factories in the Midwest to apparel companies in Manhattan, a similar refrain is being heard -- the weeklong shutdown of 29 seaports is starting to bite, and bite hard.
The joint General Motors-Toyota auto assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., with 5,100 workers, has shut because of a lack of parts, and auto executives say more plants will close next week. Railroads have stopped shipping Midwestern grain to the West Coast because of a backup of freight cars, and toy and apparel retailers are panicking that they may not get the hottest items in time for the holiday season.
With worries mounting daily, leaders of several industry groups met with White House officials today to describe the shutdown's escalating damage and to urge President Bush to use emergency powers to reopen the 29 ports and order the coast's 10,500 longshoremen back to work.
The ports handle half the nation's imports and exports, and while many executives and economists said a brief shutdown would have little effect, they predicted that the damage would become serious if the ports stayed closed for more than a week.
"I am surprised that more people don't see this as a national emergency, both economic and security," said David Littmann, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit. "If the port shutdown were to last three to four weeks, it would essentially destroy the growth that the economy is enjoying. The damage starts at a billion dollars a day, but when you get to layoffs of truckers and the shutdown of the Toyota-G.M. plant in California and the cost increases that will turn consumers off, the damage accumulates and becomes exponential."
The economic damage is stirring a fierce political debate that has for now been overshadowed in Washington by the debate over Iraq. Business lobbyists and their Republican allies support an 80-day cooling-off period, while organized labor and many Democrats oppose it. 
In San Francisco today, the port operators and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union began a second day of talks with the top federal mediator. Port officials said progress was slow, but they said they hoped that the ports might be reopened this weekend.
After saying last Friday that they were temporarily closing the ports for 36 hours, the port operators announced an indefinite shutdown on Sunday and locked out the longshoremen, saying they were engaged in a job slowdown. Union officials said the workers were merely observing safety precautions.
With the longshoremen locked out since last Saturday, nearly 200 ships are idling in West Coast ports, waiting to be unloaded. In Hawaii, which relies heavily on imports, some stores have run out of basics, like toilet paper and canned foods. On Thursday, the Pentagon said it would begin shipping cargo to its Hawaii commissaries to make sure that the 122,000 active and retired members of the military obtain the food and other goods they need.
Alaskans, too, worried about obtaining basic goods, but the two sides agreed today to resume shipments to that state, something that is also being considered for Hawaii.
Some large retailers sought to minimize the impact of a possible port shutdown by speeding their imports last summer. But many small and medium-size companies did not have as much foresight and are being squeezed badly. Officials at Olivia Miller Inc., a fashion accessories company in Manhattan, fear that the company may be forced out of business because it has $1.2 million worth of slippers -- big sellers during the fall -- stranded on ships.
Susan Lee, Olivia Miller's chief operating officer, said: "We sell a seasonal product, and if the shutdown doesn't end soon, our products won't be able to get there in time and our customers might start canceling their orders. If this goes on a long time, we can potentially lose $1.2 million in sales."
Perhaps no businesses will be hurt more by the port closings than the thousands of farmers who grow perishable fruits and vegetables. Here in Salinas, home of John Steinbeck, some growers have delayed the harvest of their vegetables, reducing the hours of their farmworkers, hoping that the ports will reopen soon. 
For Washington's apple growers, the lockout is especially frustrating because this is one of their best crops in years. "Every day this dispute drags on represents another day of sales lost in our foreign markets, and you can't get those sales back," said Welcome Sauer, the Washington Apple Commission's president. 
Nick Kukulan, president of the Paramount Export Company, a produce exporter, estimates that $7 million in grapes, pears and other produce -- in about 350 refrigerated containers -- are stranded and inaccessible at the docks. If the ports reopen soon, he said, that aging produce may be sent quickly the domestic market and sold at a fraction of its normal value. Unless the ports reopen soon, though, he added, that produce will be good for nothing.
He said growers faced cascading problems. Not only might the stranded produce go bad, but growers might have to divert produce to the domestic market, perhaps reducing prices in a market that already pays less than export markets. Another fear is that if Asian grocers cannot stock American produce for several weeks, they may turn to growers in Europe or elsewhere, perhaps causing a long-term market loss for American agriculture. 
"This whole thing is a triple whammy for the American farmer," Mr. Kukulan said.

HEADLINE: A Proud Badge In Hartford Is Tarnished Like So Many 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
For six years, Gregory J. DePietro was not just an ordinary cop. Working the toughest neighborhoods, he was considered an example of what was right with Hartford's embattled police force, hauling in some of this city's most violent drug suspects at a time when several colleagues were being indicted, tried and sent to prison for committing outrageous felonies on the job. 
 Nowadays, Greg DePietro is still no ordinary cop, but for all the wrong reasons. 
 In admissions that have stunned police officials here, Officer DePietro said that he and other Hartford officers had stolen weapons and jewelry from suspects and crime scenes, flushed drug evidence down the toilet, filched department property and fudged departmental reports during his years on the force. 
On Thursday, after a 10-month internal investigation, he resigned rather than face the likely prospect of being fired. 
For the Hartford Police Department and Chief Bruce P. Marquis, a former F.B.I. agent brought in from Texas two years ago to turn around a force stung by one high-profile embarrassment after another, Officer DePietro's revelations, reported by The Hartford Courant on Tuesday, are a humbling reminder of the work left to be done. 
But what struck many here as downright bizarre was the way in which he confessed them: during a job interview last December with the West Hartford Police Department.
His revelations came out during his second interview, as he sat with a West Hartford detective, police officials said. Officer DePietro later told investigators from his own department that he had decided to come clean to avoid being caught lying about his past during the polygraph test that the West Hartford police administer to all job candidates.
"I'm a very sensitive person," he told Hartford police investigators, according to an internal report quoted by The Courant. "I was trying to be so specific for this interview because of the fact that I was going to be wired to a lie-detector machine."
Moreover, responding to 130 yes-or-no questions given to him by the West Hartford detective, Officer DePietro affirmatively answered numerous questions about whether he had lied or stolen, and admitted that he had kept knives and narcotics seized from criminal suspects, the report said. 
On one occasion, Officer DePietro told West Hartford officials, a partner had stolen a shotgun he had found in the back of an abandoned vehicle, the report said. Another time, the officer said, he was among a group of Hartford officers who flushed what appeared to be cocaine down a station-house toilet because they did not have time to book the three suspects they had taken the package from, the report said. 
This is not what his bosses expected from Officer DePietro, 31, who won a statewide award in 1998 for bravery. And this is not what the Hartford police were hoping to hear after years of scandal. 
"This is just devastating," said Sgt. Maura Hammick, a Hartford police spokeswoman. "You feel very betrayed. Honestly, I wondered what police department he was working for." Chief Marquis was traveling out of state and could not be reached for comment, she said. 
Since 1998, seven officers or former officers have been convicted on federal charges that they coerced city prostitutes into performing sex acts in police cars, sometimes while the officers were on duty. 
Before that, a nationally recognized expert hired by the city concluded, in a meticulous audit of the department, that it was "dysfunctional" and lacking the policies, personnel and discipline needed to serve a city this size adequately.
The department is still investigating Mr. DePietro's charges implicating more than a dozen of his former colleagues, Sergeant Hammick said. But not all officers are convinced he did everything he confessed to. "A lot of things were taken out of context and hyperbolized," said Sgt. Mike Wood, the president of the police union in Hartford. 
The West Hartford police chief, James J. Strillacci, said in an interview today that no one really knows what compelled Officer DePietro, a seasoned policeman, suddenly to admit a laundry list of potential crimes. "It was possible that he was so immersed in a culture that allowed such things, that he thought he wouldn't get caught," he said.
Asked if Mr. DePietro could ever find another job at a police department, Chief Strillacci said, "I would think the news stories about him make him pretty much unemployable in law enforcement. Some people are just too dumb to be police officers."

HEADLINE: To Find Teachers, Raise Hand High and Yell, 'Me!' 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

DATELINE: HAPEVILLE, Ga. 

 BODY:
Fulton County has gone digital in its search for teachers.
 In the spring, the county school district sent 10,000 CD-ROM's to student teachers around the country. To the sounds of techno music, the disc announces, "Welcome to your future" and "Exceptional salaries starting at over $36,500 yearly." 
 The recruiting campaign is working. This year, for the first time in a decade, most schools in the district opened with no teacher vacancies. 
The Fulton County schools are not alone in finding that aggressive recruiting, combined with higher salaries, can go a long way toward easing persistent teacher shortages. Similar tactics have been effective in Fulton's neighboring districts, as well as in New York City; Clark County, Nev.; and Kansas City, Kan. 
Shortages continue in many parts of the country, particularly in the West and the South. But in most other areas, the problem has eased. 
"Some districts' long-term efforts to recruit and improve working conditions and salaries, coupled with the economic downturn, have produced surpluses," said Tom Carroll, the executive director of National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, a research organization based at Teachers College at Columbia University. "But for every district that has enough teachers, somewhere else, there is a shortage."
In Georgia, where at least a dozen districts have said they are at full strength, the number of vacancies dropped to 1,500 this summer from 3,800 last summer.
"It feels right," said Juanita Nelson, the principal of Hapeville Elementary School here, who was forced to hire many uncertified teachers in previous years. "I didn't have to use even one substitute teacher this year."
Fulton County, with an annual education budget of $550 million and close to 5,000 teachers, has made a major commitment to education. In the last 10 years, teacher salaries have gone up 3 to 5 percent annually. County revenue has grown largely as a result of population growth.
Money is a big reason that Rhonda Bennett, a fifth-grade teacher at Love T. Nolan Elementary School, moved here from Tampa in July. A teacher for 10 years, Ms. Bennett was paid $32,000 a year in Florida and needed to work for the after-school programs to make ends meet. 
"We just didn't make enough," said Ms. Bennett, whose husband owns a small business. "We couldn't lead a comfortable existence."
In Fulton, Ms. Bennett is paid $51,000. Her Tampa colleagues are closely monitoring the success of her move and might follow suit. "I can be their guinea pig," she said.
Rick L. White, who is Fulton County's chief recruiter of teachers, has a budget of $100,000 a year, excluding salaries. He scours education newsletters and newspapers from far-flung cities for budget troubles and teacher layoffs. When he finds them, he places newspaper advertisements, schedules visits and snatches up the best of the newly jobless.
He and his colleagues drive the country roads of the Carolinas, Alabama, Florida and Tennessee and ride jets to Johannesburg, New Delhi and Sydney to sell Fulton to any teacher willing to listen. In the last school year, his team visited 130 job fairs and teacher conferences.
The soft economy has helped Mr. White and other recruiters. In Nevada, George Ann Rice, the chief recruiter for the Clark County School District, which includes Las Vegas, is finding she can be choosy. "We don't have to take you just because you are breathing," Ms. Rice said. "We can now only take those who will work well with children."
In New York City, where entry-level salaries rose to $39,000 this year from $31,910 last, what officials called the most crippling shortage in decades is effectively over.
But nationally the shortage remains. In Maryland, the Prince George's County and Baltimore School Districts had to hire uncertified teachers to fill 20 percent of their positions this year. In Montana, 1 in 10 certified teacher positions was open in late summer. North Dakota had to re-hire retired teachers at the last minute to fill classrooms.
The new federal education law calls for a "highly qualified" teacher in every classroom by 2006. Although the definition of "highly qualified" varies by state, districts nationwide are struggling to find certified teachers, said Mildred Hudson, chief executive of Recruiting New Teachers, a nonprofit organization.
A number of recruiters around the country complained that the legislation has made their job much harder by forcing them to compete for the limited supply of certified teachers.
Fulton County has a powerful weapon: it pays first-year teachers $36,500. The national average is $29,000, according to a report released in July by the American Federation of Teachers. 
Mr. White flaunts this advantage. The Fulton CD-ROM flashes the salary figures in bold letters. Fliers distributed at job fairs boast of the salary range, which reaches $75,000 for experienced teachers.
"I am very confident when I go recruiting," Mr. White said. "When I have my signs up, other recruiters don't want to sit next to me."
On the other hand, Montana teachers are leaving the state in large numbers, citing low pay as the No. 1 reason, according to a report commissioned by the Montana Board of Education. The state, which pays beginning teachers $21,700, ranks 49th in the nation in starting teacher salaries, with North Dakota 50th.
Good salesmanship can also play a role in filling vacancies. Ms. Rice, the recruiter for Clark County, Nev., knows how to court the qualified.
At the airport, she has put up a huge sign: "Elvis has left the building. We now have a vacancy. Call." In movie theaters, recruitment commercials are shown with the previews of coming attractions. On highways, trucks display the district's phone numbers and Web address. 
Ms. Rice also grows her own teachers. She appeals to stay-at-home mothers to take the district scholarships to get teaching degrees. "We cannot sit on our hands to wait for people to think of us," she said.
Here in Fulton County, a similarly aggressive approach helped Mr. White recruit Brittany Featherstone, 22, a native of Rochester, who had never intended to leave New York. 
The Fulton district has created a system where principals can view an application for a teaching position as soon as it is filed online. 
Although Ms. Featherstone majored in special education, one of the areas where there are severe teacher shortages, school districts in the Rochester area had been slow to respond to her applications. But on the same July day that Ms. Featherstone applied online for a teaching job at Fulton, Ms. Nelson, Hapeville Elementary's principal, called her to arrange interview. The next week, Ms. Featherstone moved to Fulton.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
The Trailing Upstate Economy

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
 The state Democratic Party's Coordinated Campaign Committee released four 30-second advertisements attacking Gov. George E. Pataki's economic record upstate, each one slightly tailored to address local issues in Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany. The ads are meant to help H. Carl McCall, the Democrat who is running against Mr. Pataki.

PRODUCER: Axelrod & Associates

ON THE SCREEN: A photograph of Governor Pataki and a quotation from his 1994 campaign against Mario M. Cuomo ("After eight years of broken promises, it is time for someone else") followed by images of abandoned streets, empty work lockers, construction sites and newspaper headlines charging corruption in economic development.

THE SCRIPT: Announcer, referring to the Pataki quote: "That's what George Pataki said in 1994. Well, eight years have passed. And Pataki's record? The upstate economy has trailed the nation. And Syracuse ranks near the bottom for business. Our electric rates, the second highest. All the while the state's economic development program has been mired in politics. Check Pataki's record: after eight years of broken promises, it is time for someone else."
The ad says the same for Rochester, but differs slightly for Buffalo and Albany, citing them as being last or at the bottom in job growth.

ACCURACY: Upstate New York actually had an increase in jobs under Governor Pataki, but not to the same degree as employment increased in New York City and its suburbs. The greater issue has been a shift in the economy upstate, from manufacturing to high-tech, with traditional manufacturing areas experiencing a greater loss of jobs. Electric rates are indeed among the nation's highest. Democrats have accused the governor of rewarding political supporters with economic development aid and jobs. Further, while the economy was strong, Mr. Pataki was arguably as short-sighted as the next politician in shoring up weak local economies.

SCORECARD: This ad picks up where ads by Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate who is needling Governor Pataki, left off. Like Mr. Golisano, the Democrats -- on behalf of Mr. McCall -- are making jobs and the upstate economy campaign issues. The ads are well timed: Mr. McCall has had trouble raising money for his own ads, and for a week he has been on the defensive over letters that he wrote in his own version of a jobs program in which he used his official stationery to pass on resumes for friends, acquaintances and family members.

HEADLINE: Masters of the Universe 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The prime opinion-slinging show on Russian TV these days is called "Svoboda Slova," "Freedom of Speech." It's like "Crossfire" on steroids, with antagonists exchanging muscular polemics while a fever chart of audience opinion tells you who's winning the argument. The other day the subject was Iraq, and it was a depressing glimpse of how America looks these days from outside its sanctuary of self-absorption.
 One guest disputant on the Iraq side was Baghdad's ambassador to Moscow. He studied journalism in the Soviet Union, and it shows: he tried to change the subject to Hiroshima. Another was a leader of a sleazy, quasi-Fascist party in the Russian Parliament, who warned that after the power-drunk Americans devoured Iraq they would soon be nibbling at Russia's entrails. This was not a pair that radiated credibility. 
 The pro-American side was represented by a sober duet of Dmitri Simes, a conservative, Russian-born American scholar, who defended the Bush administration's case by remote feed from Washington, and the genial former foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, who argued that Iraq had made this mess for itself by continually defying the United Nations. 
The studio audience started out 75 percent opposed to "tough measures" against Iraq, and by the time the show was over, the opposition had grown to 85 percent. You could fairly sum up the Russian consensus this way: 
* In threatening Iraq, President Bush is mainly after cheap oil, and probably some cheap votes in the next election. 
* America may pretend to be promoting lofty democratic ideals, just as the Soviet Union pretended to be exporting Socialist ideals. But America likes the tyrants who serve its interests. Saddam -- like Osama bin Laden's compatriots in Afghanistan -- was once a beneficiary of American largess, back when he was fighting Iran, and he might still be on the American dole if he hadn't tried to kill the first President Bush.
* The Bush overtures to the U.N. are laughably insincere, a belated effort to dress up an attack that is foreordained.
* Whatever happens, it will be bad for Russia (self-pity is the Russian default position) and terrible for ordinary Iraqis.
* America could care less about that.
From Russians I've talked to, that indictment seems to be pretty much the mainstream view. Many Russians now see us the way we once saw them -- expansionist bullies, disguising our appetite as humanitarian vision. The fact that much of this attitude stems from a post-Soviet inferiority complex doesn't make it any prettier to hear.
To what extent the inscrutable Vladimir Putin shares his countrymen's cynicism is hard to know. The Russian president has played the situation like the judo black belt he is. He has already invoked the new Bush Doctrine of defensive pre-emption against neighboring Georgia, where the Pankisi Gorge has been a highway for separatists bedeviling Russia in the province of Chechnya. This bluff accomplished three things: It got Washington's attention; it delighted the Russian military, which still loathes Georgia's president, Eduard Shevardnadze, for humiliations he inflicted as Mikhail Gorbachev's foreign minister; and it seems to have prodded Mr. Shevardnadze into cracking down harder on the rebels.
Mr. Putin has also rushed to shore up his commercial ties with Iran, Iraq and North Korea, the countries the White House insists on calling "the axis of evil." Hardly anyone seriously believes Mr. Putin feels any ideological kinship with those three regimes, but they just happen to be among the few countries that buy Russian manufactured goods.
If you believe (as I do) that Saddam Hussein represents an insufferable menace, and that a convincing preparation for war is a prerequisite for any serious reckoning with him, it is tempting to dismiss the nattering of the Russian elites. We can be sure that President Putin -- the calculating pragmatist -- will swallow our Iraq venture, as he has swallowed our intervention in the Balkans, the expansion of NATO, the discarding of the ABM treaty, the basing of American troops in nearby Central Asia and the various other take-it-or-leave-it Bush administration initiatives. Astute Putin-watchers, like Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center, say that although Mr. Putin may still have the democratic instincts of a former K.G.B. spymaster, he knows he has no real choice but to cast Russia's lot with the West. 
But just because we can is no reason to treat Russia as little more than a speed bump. This is not just about Saddam Hussein, or just about Russia. It is about what kind of superpower we want to be -- one that wins over potential friends, or one that simply bulldozes them. The view from Russia, shared in many other places around the globe, is that we are wearing our might with more than a little childish arrogance.
A few days after that TV debate I visited Mr. Kozyrev, the former foreign minister, in the McMansionland suburb where he now lives the life of a prosperous businessman. One of his ventures is public relations, and so I had the odd experience of being gently lectured on the basics of salesmanship by a former official of the former anti-capitalist empire. "You're like a big business that decided it doesn't need a P.R. department," he told me. "But every business needs P.R. Even a monopoly needs P.R." 
That's an argument our marketing-minded White House understands when it comes to domestic public opinion. It should consider applying it to the rest of the world. Our imperial bluster feeds our enemies and isolates our friends. We've just seen that resentment of America wins elections in Germany, and it would be a shame if it cost us the good will of a Russia that, most of the time, wants to be with us.
To be fair, the Bush administration has handled Russia with more skill than anyone had a right to expect. The relationship shows signs of a maturity that the tempestuous love affair between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin rarely achieved, and that is not just because Mr. Putin shows up sober. But even discounting for the excesses of Russian pride, it still often feels we're taking the place for granted.
If we wanted Russia to be a willing partner rather than just a grudging partner, there are several things we could do. We could treat the United Nations as more than a distraction. The place may be an infuriating tunnel of winds, but for a lot of countries it is the closest thing to feeling enfranchised in world affairs. First we refused to accept that the U.N. had a part to play, and now, after it dawned on us that the organization can be useful, we are treating it with undisguised petulance.
We could acknowledge that other counties have legitimate interests. In Russia, trade with countries America doesn't like is not just a luxury; it sustains a slow progress toward economic normalcy. It would not kill us to offer some public assurances that Russia's genuine economic stake in Iraq will be protected if Saddam is overthrown. We could also make clear that we will not use conquered Iraq to drive down the price of oil in a way that would threaten other suppliers, including Russia. (This week's Russian-American oil conference in Houston, little noticed in our country, was a good first step and has made a large and favorable impression here.)
Elsewhere along the axis, we could stop scolding Russia for the sale of nuclear power plants to Iran, and look harder for a collaborative way to make sure that these deals do not end up delivering nuclear weaponry to the ayatollahs. Russia is no more eager than we are to give Iran the ingredients of a nuclear weapon, but the Russian nuclear power industry is a very large and hungry constituency. We co-opted Russia's space industry by cooking up joint launch ventures; we could at least try to co-opt its nuclear industry.
An easier way to win a bit of good will here and in many other countries is to streamline the new post-9/11 rules for visas. There is now a backlog of 25,000 visitor applications stalled, not because they are at all suspicious but because the vetting operations are overwhelmed. Among the applicants are hundreds of Russian scientists and graduate students in sensitive subjects like biological and nuclear technology, whom we invited to the U.S. because we'd rather they not go to, say, Syria. 
And then down at the level of pure, pointless insult there is that durable relic of the cold war, the Jackson-Vanik law. This is American legislation that denies Russia the normal courtesies of international commerce because, many years ago, the Soviets prevented Jews from emigrating. Emigration is now so relaxed that much of Israel speaks with a Russian accent, and everyone from the White House on down agrees the law should have been repealed years ago -- except for a small-minded poultry-state congressman who is blocking repeal because the Russians limited the import of American chicken parts. 
A decent regard for the opinion of places like Russia would make it easier for leaders like Mr. Putin to be with us. Arrogance and pettiness isolate our friends, build resentment and ultimately undermine our campaign against terror. It is possible to get Iraq right and get the rest of the world wrong.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Turning Point 

BYLINE:  By Bradley O. Babson; Bradley O. Babson, a former World Bank representative in Vietnam, is a consultant on Asian matters for the bank and the United Nations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Today a first set of talks will conclude between James Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, and the government of North Korea. Although Chairman Kim Jong Il and his Communist regime are part of President Bush's axis of evil, Washington has opted to pursue regime transformation rather than regime change. This engagement has been a long time in coming. But North Korea has been trying for years, in its own awkward and eccentric way, to get closer to the outside world, and Washington, together with Tokyo, has finally chosen to respond.
 The challenge facing Mr. Kelly is how to pitch dialogue in ways that will result in North Korean commitments that are congruent with American aims. Fundamentally, what is needed is to create an atmosphere of hope that is based on realism. Realism must acknowledge the many difficulties that North Korea's leaders face in redirecting their security, economy and society to join a world that operates on a very different basis than theirs. Realism means that North Korea cannot expect the world to subsidize its needs for food and energy indefinitely. Realism means being skeptical about grandiose schemes and not overreacting when they fail; and it means making sure that agreements with North Korea will meet a test of both political and economic rationality. 
 North Korea is undeniably at a crossroads. Hope for rapid change dimmed after the shock of a battle at sea between the two Koreas last June. But the fact that this incident did not derail cooperation on other fronts -- and was quickly resolved at the political level -- is an indication of how inter-Korean relations have matured since the summit of 2000. Now we have news from the North of homegrown economic reforms that will give money and profit incentives a much greater role. Price and wage increases and devaluation of the currency have reduced the large gap between the official and informal economies. Moves to revive industry include imposing firm budget constraints on state enterprises, decentralizing economic planning and allowing commercial transactions between firms.
While these reforms are only a beginning, they clearly indicate the North Korean government's decision to change the economic system. Legislation recently adopted by the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang to establish a Hong Kong-style special administrative zone on North Korea's border with China also demonstrated North Korea's willingness to try bold initiatives, even grandiose ones. 
Chairman Kim has also surprised observers by admitting past wrongs in relations with Japan -- in exchange for a normalization that will bring political recognition, access to Japanese markets and an assistance package. Mr. Kim also decided, at last, to start work on the inter-Korean rail and road links that will breach the demilitarized zone. This is literally a breakthrough moment.
All of these moves by Kim Jong Il in the space of three months seem to point to the kind of major changes in behavior that President Bush is seeking. Economic pressures, the humiliation of seeing North Korean citizens fleeing over the border into China, and the changes in the international climate after Sept. 11, 2001, are factors that Kim Jong Il cannot ignore. However, the tasks that lie ahead of his regime are not easy: overcoming decades of isolation, bringing North Korean society into meaningful reconciliation with South Korea and Japan, being accepted into the international community and building an economy that works.
Neither the United States nor North Korea should expect sudden, extensive change. A patient and realistic step-by-step approach has been characteristic of the sunshine policy of South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung. It deserves to be given a chance in dialogue with the United States. As a way to meet President Bush's goal of removing North Korea from the axis of evil, it just might work.

HEADLINE: In Free-Market Slump, Brazil's Voters Look for Change 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: GOIANIA, Brazil, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
In each of Brazil's last two presidential elections, Ana Paula Borges voted for the government's candidate, swayed by promises of growth and stability. But after an eight-year experiment with free-market capitalism, the Brazilian economy has stalled, unemployment is climbing, the value of the national currency is sliding, and she is fed up.
 As a schoolteacher, mother of two and wife of a rancher, Mrs. Borges, 32, is the kind of middle-of-the-road voter whose support Jose Serra, candidate of the ruling coalition, must have if he is to win. But on Sunday, she said, she intends to cast her ballot for Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party. 
 "Enough is enough," she said as she waited to have her hair done at a salon in this tidy city of one million deep in Brazil's vast heartland. "Serra has the same vision as the crew running things now. We need a change, not four more years of the same thing, and Lula is the only one who can deliver that." 
In fact, Mr. da Silva, a 56-year-old labor leader, has modified his Socialist rhetoric for this election. Largely because he casts the last decade of market reform into question, however, and because he is now the front-runner, the vote on Sunday is regarded as a bellwether, and not just for Brazil's 175 million people. 
All over Latin America, candidates critical of the Washington Consensus, the name often used to describe the American-backed free-market model common in the region since the 1990's, are watching from the wings as governments committed to such reforms flounder. That sentiment has been fed by the collapse of the Argentine economy and by similar crises in countries ranging from Uruguay to Venezuela. 
"There is a deeply sour mood and sensibility in the region right now, a real unhappiness about international financial institutions and the United States, and a Lula victory would both epitomize and encourage that," said Michael Shifter, vice president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. "It would give people a sense that there are different ways of doing politics and economic policies." 
Mr. da Silva has never won more than a quarter of the first-round vote in three previous tries for the presidency of Latin America's largest country. But final opinion polls show him with 48 percent of the vote, just short of the majority he needs if he is to avoid a runoff on Oct. 27, most likely with Mr. Serra. 
Mr. da Silva's surge from also-ran to odds-on favorite appears to be the result of a delicate and canny balancing act. His Socialist credentials enable him to capitalize on widespread resentment of the sacrifice and lack of economic growth that have accompanied the free-market reforms so warmly encouraged by the United States. But he has also moved to calm longstanding fears that he is too radical by nudging his party's program toward the center.
"This year's Lula has rejected the leftism that was totally impregnated in the Workers Party's earlier platforms in favor of a program that is not that different from Serra's," said Edmar Bacha, a leading economic consultant. Instead of talking about "a rupture or a new model," Mr. Bacha said, he has changed his terminology and has become palatable to the more conservative voter. 
Brazilians have ample reason to be distressed with the market model. Between 1900 and 1980, the Brazilian economy expanded by 6 percent a year, regardless of whether the government was civilian or military, leftist or right-wing, or whether inflation was high or low. 
Growth flagged in the 1980's, however, so when Fernando Henrique Cardoso ran for president in 1994 and argued that opening up Brazil's closed economy would bring investment and progress, Brazilians handed him a first round victory. The promise seemed credible because Mr. Cardoso was the author of the Real Plan, which had reduced Brazil's annual inflation rate from four digits to one. During his first term, the percentage of Brazilians living in poverty dropped from more than one-third to about one-quarter, infant mortality rates declined sharply, and school enrollments zoomed. 
Amado Soares is a 35-year-old parking lot attendant who, like Mr. da Silva, was born in Pernambuco State, in the northeast, and migrated southward as a child. Mr. Soares was one of the millions of working class Brazilians who benefited from that new-found stability: he bought a television set and refrigerator, and after a decade paying rent, was even able to make a down payment on a small plot of land on which he built a house.
"I thought we really were entering a new era and I feared that if Lula were ever elected, we would surely go back to the days of high inflation," Mr. Soares said. 
In the last four years, though, crises in East Asia, Russia and neighboring Argentina have eroded the value of the currency, the real, and led to a sharp drop in foreign investment, forcing the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders, who have demanded austerity. 
"This is the first time in Brazilian history that a government has spent an entire term under an I.M.F. program," noted Gustavo Franco, a former Central Bank president who now writes a column on the economy and is an investment adviser. The reaction of the man on the street, he added, is that "we did everything right, and the compensation from the outside world is a crisis." 
Particularly outraged are the millions of civil servants, most of whom have not received a raise in eight years. They now form a pillar of support for Mr. da Silva, who has promised to ease their plight. 
A recent study published by the Brazilian Economic Institute of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, the country's principal research institution, shows most other urban residents have also been hurt, with incomes plunging 3 percent a year in real terms since the late 1990's. 
Pressed for funds for popular social programs, Mr. Cardoso's government has chosen to invest in food plans for children and in extending the social welfare system to the countryside. While that benefits long-term development, it has proven politically costly. 
"Children don't vote and rural areas don't have big concentrations of voters like the cities do," said Marcelo Neri, author of the study. 
Despite the discontent, a substantial constituency still favors the free-market approach. Recent polls show that about 40 percent of Brazilians believe that Mr. Cardoso is doing a good or acceptable job. 
"People say the population is tired of reforms," said Bolivar Lamounier, of the Institute of Economic, Social and Political Studies in Sao Paulo. "Which reforms? Is there anyone who wants to go back to the days when a telephone cost $3,000 and you had to wait two years for it to be installed?" 
Apparently recognizing that, Mr. da Silva has toned down his criticisms of Brazil's $100 billion privatization program. Instead, he has promised that "if we win, we will fight tirelessly from Day 1 to fight to increase production" to create 10 million jobs, an argument that, with unemployment having risen to 8 percent, resonates strongly with voters. 
"People still want economic stability, but they also want the job situation to improve, and if they are forced to choose between one and the other, they would rather have a job with a bit of inflation because that is their more immediate need," said Marcia Cavallari, executive director of the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion. 
Mr. da Silva has also been strengthened by the weak field running against him. Mr. Serra in particular has been criticized, even by many within his own party, as a stiff figure who has alienated voters. 
"What you are seeing in the vote for Lula is not so much an outright preference for him so much as a rejection of everyone else," said Albert Fishlow, director of the Brazilian Studies program at Columbia University. 
In fact, Mr. Serra is the governing coalition's candidate only because the charismatic politician who was viewed as Mr. Cardoso's natural successor died of cancer two years ago, and Roseana Sarney, governor of Maranhao, was forced to withdraw because of a corruption scandal. 
Hoping to make up ground, Mr. Serra this week accused Mr. da Silva and the Workers' Party of fomenting invasions of private property and political violence. The accusations do not seem to have convinced voters. 
"We've got a Constitution and a Congress in this country, and I don't believe that anything is going to change in 24 hours even if Lula wanted to do something like that," said Edu Farias, a 62-year-old teacher and evangelical Protestant minister.
A generation ago, the prospect of a Socialist admirer of Fidel Castro coming to power here would have provoked American support for a military coup. But the current American ambassador here, Donna Hrinak, the daughter of a Pittsburgh steelworker, has called Mr. da Silva the personification of the American dream.
For their part, the Brazilian Armed Forces, which left power in 1985, have shown no appetite for a coup. The military has suffered along with the rest of the population, and has responded sympathetically to Mr. da Silva's nationalistic call for incentives to Brazilian industry and a more protective state role. 
"Lula and the Workers' Party are shrewd, and they have gotten the message," Dr. Neri said. "They know that while Brazilians worry about inequality and unemployment, they do not want radical change. The result that we are seeing is Lula Lite."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INTELLIGENCE; 
C.I.A. Says Iraq Revived Forbidden Weapons Programs After the U.N. Inspectors Left

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency said today that Iraq had taken advantage of the withdrawal of United Nations weapons inspectors to resume the production of chemical arms, expand efforts to develop biological weapons and revive its program to make nuclear arms. 
 Much of the C.I.A. report echoes the British government's recent assessment of Iraq's weapons programs. Still, the agency's report is the most up-to-date American assessment of Iraq's efforts to make weapons of mass destruction and comes at a critical juncture in the Congressional debate over the possible use of force to overthrow the government of Saddam Hussein. 
 "Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort, energized its missile program and invested more heavily in biological weapons," the C.I.A. report said. "Most analysts assess Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program." 
In building its case for a possible military campaign, the Bush administration has cited Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons and threatened to use force to overthrow the Baghdad government if Mr. Hussein does not agree to unrestricted and highly intrusive inspections.
The C.I.A. report says Iraq would probably not be able to make a nuclear weapon until the last half of the decade unless it acquired fissile material through the black market. If fissile material was smuggled into Iraq, the government could make a nuclear weapon within a year, according to the agency's assessment. 
"Although Saddam probably does not yet have nuclear weapons or sufficient material to make any, he remains intent on acquiring them," the report said.
British intelligence has concluded that Iraq could make a nuclear weapon within two years, if it acquired fissile material, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies has said Iraq might be able to use the material to make a bomb in a matter of months.
One sign of Iraq's nuclear intentions was Baghdad's effort to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes, the report said. It also said that American intelligence experts agreed that Iraq was seeking to make nuclear arms and that the tubes could be used to make centrifuges to enrich uranium.
"Most intelligence specialists assess this to be the intended use, but some believe that these tubes are probably intended for conventional weapons programs," it added. 
A classified National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's programs to make weapons of mass destruction was provided to Congress early this week. The unclassified report released today generally reflects the conclusions of the classified review and is posted on the agency's Web site (www.cia.gov).
The agency's account of Iraq's chemical and biological arms provides an indication of the sort of threats American forces may face if President Bush orders an invasion of Iraq. Congress had asked for the agency's official intelligence estimate before a decision to authorize any military action was made. 
Iraq, the report said, has rebuilt weapons plants destroyed in American air raids. "Baghdad has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin and VX," the C.I.A. said. The agency estimates that Iraq has several hundred metric tons of chemical agents that it could put in bombs, artillery shells and missile warheads. 
As for biological arms, the agency said that "all key aspects" of Iraq's offensive biological weapons program were active and that "most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf war." 
Iraq, it said, has mobile germ laboratories that are easy to hide. It is also suspected to be working on germ weapons at three sites: the Dawrah Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility, the Amiriyah Serum and Vaccine Institute and the Fallujah III Castrol Oil Production Plant.
Regarding missiles, Iraq maintains a covert force of several dozen Scud missiles, the C.I.A. said. The British have estimated that Iraq has up to 20 Scuds.
Iraq has also carried out missile work that is prohibited by the United Nations. After the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United Nations said Iraq's surface-to-surface missiles could not have range greater than 90 miles. But the new report said Iraq had used its work on permitted systems as a cover for the development of longer-range missiles. 
The report noted, for instance, that Iraq has rebuilt the Mutasim Solid Rocket Motor and Test Facility. The site is used to make solid fuel motors for the permitted Ababil-100 missile, but the scale of the sites, the agency says, indicates that Iraq is planning to develop longer-range systems.
The C.I.A. also asserts that Iraq has sought to covert L-29 trainer aircraft into unmanned drones that can disperse poison gas and biological agents.
The report does not say whether inspections could succeed in disarming Iraq. It said Iraq sought to hide its weapon program when United Nations monitors had access to Iraq and has stepped up its weapons research and development since they were withdrawn in 1998. 
"In the absence of inspectors, Baghdad's already considerable ability to work on prohibited programs without risk of discovery has increased," the report said. It added that "Baghdad's vigorous concealment efforts" had left information on many aspects of its weapons on mass destruction programs uncovered.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Excerpts From Senate Debate on Authorization to Use Force Against Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate yesterday on Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times. The speakers included Senators Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky; Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan; George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio; Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts; and Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.

Senator Bunning
 The case against Saddam Hussein is clear. We can no longer tolerate him and the threat that he poses not only to us, but to his neighbors, the Middle East and the entire world. 
 To do anything else would be to repeat the mistakes of the past and to bury our heads in the sand.
After Sept. 11, we cannot afford to simply sit on our hands. Now is the time to take bold and decisive action in our own self-defense. . . . 
All in all, Iraq has failed to abide by 16 U.N. Security Council resolutions.
Saddam has broken his word at every opportunity.
There is an old saying: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
I don't see how we can let Saddam fool us again. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein cannot be trusted.
The time for inspections, diplomacy and delay has passed. It is time for us to act.
Many in Congress believe we should not use force against terrorist nations such as Iraq without approval from the United Nations or our allies. I believe this resolution takes the right approach and addresses their concerns.
It says that we should do all we can to work with our friends and the U.N. to address the menace of Saddam Hussein. But it does not tie our hands and preserves our right to act in self-defense.
Mr. President, in trying to resolve tensions with Iraq, America has gone the extra mile. And I believe that our allies and the U.N. have done so, as well.
We have done all that we can to ensure a peaceful resolution of disputes with Saddam.
And I support Secretary Powell's continuing efforts to reach out to the Security Council and the rest of the world to find a way to bring peace to the Middle East without using violence.
But I do not believe that in the end you can negotiate with a madman.
Sooner or later, we are going to have to act, and we should pass this resolution to give the president every tool at his disposal to prevail in this struggle with evil.
I know that some of my colleagues and many in the world community worry that America is acting without provocation and that we should not pre-emptively attack another nation.
I have to disagree with them on two grounds.
First, we have already been attacked.
Last Sept. 11 was the bloodiest day in our history. We have already lost 3,000 of our friends and neighbors.
Many of those involved in planning and carrying out those attacks are now living in Iraq. In fact, Saddam Hussein has openly praised their actions.
We are not acting pre-emptively. We are reacting to an assault on our nation and our people.
Second, in the case of Saddam Hussein, he has made clear many, many times already that he will attack us as soon as he feels he can effectively do so.
His past actions against his neighbors and even his own people prove he is a man of his word.
To say now that we should wait and not act first is foolhardy and naive.
In the wake of Sept. 11, we have a choice. We can either act or we can wait and react.
I do not think we should sit like children on the beach and simply wait for the tide to come in and wash us away.

Senator Levin
Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of an alternative resolution, which I will be introducing, and to explain why I believe it is the right way to go and is a better alternative than the White House approach.
At the outset, whatever differences there may be among us, the one thing on which we can all agree upon is that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the Middle East. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iran. He has launched invasions of Iran and Kuwait. And for the last 11 years, he has defied the will of the entire world, as expressed in United Nations Security Council resolutions, by refusing to destroy his weapons of mass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles.
Another point upon which I believe there's a consensus among members of the Senate is the fact that confronting the threat posed by Saddam Hussein could ultimately lead to committing U.S. military forces, including ground forces, into combat, and that the vote we take on a resolution relating to Iraq may be the most important vote that we make this year.
Whether we commit our forces to attack Iraq as part of a United Nations-authorized coalition or whether we go it alone could have immense consequences for our security and for future peace and stability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and beyond. And that's why I will be introducing an alternative resolution.
The resolution that was agreed to between the White House and House leadership fails to address the two main problems with the original White House discussion draft. And those problems are the following:
The White House approach still specifically authorizes at this time the use of force on a unilateral go-it-alone basis, that is, without Security Council authorization.
Second, the White House approach authorizes the use of force beyond dealing with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
The resolution that I will be introducing is consistent with how I think most Americans want us to proceed. It emphasizes the importance of dealing with Iraq on a multilateral basis. And it withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether the United States should go it alone, should go unilaterally against Iraq should the United Nations fail to act.
Now, what my alternative resolution does is the following:
First, it urges the United Nations Security Council to adopt promptly a resolution that demands unconditional access for U.N. inspectors, so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles may be destroyed. And that same U.N. resolution authorizes the use of necessary and appropriate force by U.N. member states to enforce such resolution in the event Iraq refuses to comply.
My alternative resolution will also specifically authorize the use of United States Armed Forces pursuant to that U.N. Security Council resolution. If Iraq fails to comply with its terms, it provides that the president would then inform the Congress of his determination that the United States has used appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with such U.N. resolution.
My resolution affirms that under international law and the U.N. Charter, the United States has at all times the inherent right to use military force in self-defense, affirming the fact that there is no U.N. veto over U.S. military action. And the alternative resolution, which I'll be introducing, affirms that Congress will not adjourn sine die so that Congress can return to session to consider promptly proposals relative to Iraq if, in the judgment of the president, the U.N. Security Council does not adopt the resolution that I've described above.
It provides further that the president report to Congress every 60 days on the status of efforts to have the U.N. Security Council adopt such a resolution, and if such a resolution is adopted, to obtain compliance by Iraq with the resolution.

Senator Voinovich
We all recognize that the world is a different place than it was before Sept. 11. In spite of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, the attack on our embassies in Africa, the threat of terrorism was not taken seriously enough by our country and the rest of the world.
The tragic events of that day, our 21st-century Pearl Harbor, changed the way that we and the rest of the world perceive terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 
For America, the loss of more than 3,000 lives demanded this change. And as I said on 9/11, demanded that we identify those who committed these acts as well as those who encouraged them through actions of silence and make them fully pay for their crimes. 
Saddam Hussein poses a clear threat to peace in the world, to America, our interests, to regional stability and to his own people. After briefings by the secretary of defense, the president's national security adviser, the director of the C.I.A. and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I am convinced that the threat is real. 
He has an arsenal of sophisticated chemical and biological weapons and continues to refine and manufacture them and develop ways to deliver them. He is working as if his life depended on it to acquire nuclear weapons and deliver them. He supports terrorist groups and encourages violence against Israel with cash payments to the families of suicide bombers in Israel. 
And although we have not connected the acts of Al Qaeda and 9/11 directly with Iraq, we know that Al Qaeda is present there, as are representatives of other terrorist groups. 
After 9/11, do we doubt that terrorist groups would turn down the opportunity to get their hands on Saddam's weapons and use them against us? 
It's well documented that Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons against his own people and his neighbors. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during the Iraq-Iran war Saddam used chemical weapons on numerous occasions, including several that involved over 10,000. For example, in February of '86 against the Iranians, 8,000 to 10,000 casualties -- 8,000 to 10,000 casualties as a result of the use of chemical weaponry. 
And no one needs to be reminded that he has invaded a peaceful neighbor and committed countless atrocities against the people of Kuwait, until the world community acted in concert to drive him out. 
Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at the international community for a decade by ignoring U.N. Security Council resolutions, resolutions that required him to disclose his weapons stockpiles, to disarm and to cut ties with terrorist groups. He has lied repeatedly and has proven beyond any possible doubt that he cannot be trusted. 
Moreover, by example, Iraq encourages other rogue nations and groups to follow its lead with a simple message. Go ahead and do what you want. The world community does not have the backbone to stop you. 
That example cannot be allowed to stand. Saddam Hussein is the neighborhood bully. And only when neighbors come together and say enough is enough can he be stopped.

Senator Kennedy
America should not go to war against Iraq unless and until all other reasonable alternatives are exhausted. 
Just a year ago, the American people and the Congress rallied behind the president and our armed forces as we went to war in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda posed a clear present and continuing danger. The need to destroy Al Qaeda was urgent and undeniable. And in the months that followed Sept. 11, the Bush administration marshaled an impressive international coalition. Today, 90 countries are listed in the effort from providing troops to providing law enforcement, intelligence and other critical support. 
I am concerned that going to war against Iraq before other means are tried will jeopardize the war against terrorism. One year into the battle against Al Qaeda, the administration is shifting the focus, the resources and the energy to Iraq. The change in priority is coming before we have eliminated the threat from Al Qaeda, before we know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive and before we know whether the fragile post-Taliban government in Afghanistan will succeed. 
No one disputes that America has lasting and important interests in the Persian Gulf or that Iraq poses a significant challenge to U.S. interests. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant. And that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.
Our goal is to achieve this objective in a way that minimizes the risk to our country. We cannot ignore the danger to our young men and women in uniform, to our ally Israel, to regional stability, to the international community and victory against terrorism. 
There is clearly a threat from Iraq. And there is clearly a danger. But the administration has not made a convincing case that we face such an imminent threat to our national security that a unilateral pre-emptive American strike and an immediate war are necessary. Nor has the administration laid out the cost in blood and treasure of this operation. . . . 
There are realistic alternatives between doing nothing and declaring unilateral or immediate war. War should be a last resort, not the first response.
The Bush administration says America can fight a war in Iraq without undermining our most pressing national security priority, the war against Al Qaeda. But I believe it is inevitable that a war in Iraq will, without serious international support, will weaken our effort to ensure that the Al Qaeda terrorists can never, never, never threaten American lives again.
Unfortunately, the threat from Al Qaeda is still imminent. The nation's armed forces and law enforcement are on constant high alert. America may have broken up the Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan and scattered its operatives across many lands. But we have not broken its will to kill Americans. We know that Al Qaeda is still there and still here in America and will do all it can to strike at America's heart and heartland again. But we don't know when, where and how this may happen.
On March 12, C.I.A. Director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Al Qaeda remains the most immediate and serious threat to our country, despite the progress that we've made in Afghanistan and in disrupting the network elsewhere.

Senator Murkowski
Mr. President, I want to call my colleagues' attention to a situation associated with our increasing dependence on Iraq. And let me share with you a picture here of Saddam Hussein, who is no stranger to this body. The title is "Oil as a Weapon." 
And I think that as we address the disposition of the resolution which the president has sent up to this body for action we should recognize a few hard realities. And that is oil is funding terrorism. Oil is funding the economy of Iraq in spite of the efforts of the United Nations to try and control that funding. And the inconsistency of our policy where we are increasing our dependence on Iraqi oil even at a time when we are contemplating going to war with Iraq is indeed an inconsistency of a magnitude that I think more members should relate to. . . . 
The point is the U.S. is spending each day about $12.5 million by buying Iraqi oil. Total U.S. dollars on oil from Iraq, well, that's 2.3 billion. And those reflect on the average price of a little over $20. That's the Energy Information Administration source. The occupant of the chair and I have some knowledge of finance, and you cut off a cash flow of a country or an individual and you kind of bring them to their knees. When you continue to buy their product, why obviously they continue to prosper. 
Now there's another chart here that shows basically how American families are counting on energy from Saddam Hussein. And here's a list, if you will, of the Persian Gulf countries that are producing oil. And Iraq's production is a little over one million barrels a day. But it's the fastest growing source, at least it has been up until a short time ago, the source of U.S. oil imports.

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
Executive Is First Member To Back Women at Augusta

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Cracking the code of silence among members of the Augusta National Golf Club, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, offered his guarded support yesterday to the women's group that is pushing the club to admit women.
 Mr. Weill is the first corporate executive to respond openly to the group's complaints, but several club members who requested anonymity said that other executives were pushing the issue to the forefront of the club's agenda. 
 "There are maybe 20 members who feel that way, and a lot of them are highly motivated chief executives," one longtime Augusta member said. 
An Augusta member who once ran a major corporation said that Mr. Weill's voice might bring out some others. "He is clearly a leader, and I think it is a thoughtful position," the member said.
The Citigroup statement, sent last night to the National Council of Women's Organizations, was signed by Leah C. Johnson, Citigroup's director of public affairs. It said that Mr. Weill had "expressed his views to the Augusta National Golf Club and will continue to engage in what he hopes will be a constructive dialogue on this issue, toward an objective that he believes we share with your organization."
"However, he respectfully intends to keep this dialogue private," the statement said.
Officials of the club declined to comment late last night on Mr. Weill's remarks. The men who have quietly expressed the most opposition to admitting women could not be reached for comment. 
Augusta has about 300 members, including chief executives of some of the country's best-known companies: William B. Harrison Jr. of J.P. Morgan Chase; Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express; and Christopher B. Galvin of Motorola. Mr. Weill is a member and closely associated with the club because Citigroup has been a sponsor of the Masters tournament, played at Augusta every April.
The club's chairman, William Johnson, known as Hootie, announced in late August that the tournament was dropping Citigroup and the two other television sponsors, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola, so that they would not come under pressure from the women's groups.
Several men who belong to the club, whose members agree not to talk publicly about its matters, spoke about the shift behind the scenes on the condition that they not be identified.
The corporate executives do not like the publicity and are under pressure, said one prominent member who does not run a public company. "They are selling products, and they don't want to take a position that this is a men's club," he said.
But those executives have stopped short of withdrawing from the club. "They use the club for business," the member noted. If they left, they would also lose any voice in the matter. 
The member who described Mr. Weill's position as thoughtful said that chief executives may be under pressure from neighbors and family members, but mostly they want the matter to end "because they want to stop reading about it in the paper."
Augusta does not have corporate memberships, but some companies reimburse their executives for the cost of belonging. It appears unlikely that their boards will curtail such perks or pressure them to stop paying the cost themselves; after all, directors have many pressing business issues in a time of economic uncertainty.
But the corporate scandals and the disclosures about lavish pay packages and generous perks have given executives reason to take care in guarding their public images.
General Electric reimbursed its former chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., for his dues at Augusta. But his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, has decided to pay his own fees there, just as he has put up for sale the Manhattan apartment owned by G.E.
Mr. Immelt declined to comment on his decision to pay the dues or on the future of women at the club. Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman, said of Augusta: "We are not paying for Jeffrey Immelt. It was his decision." 
Any pressure that is building on executives to broaden membership at Augusta is motivated by business concerns, the members said. Some members not in public roles spoke derisively of those concerns last week.
"You can't make up your mind about what's good for Augusta because it affects the sales of your product," said a member, hinting at how divisive the issue was likely to be.
The women's council has been challenging the club this year, leading it to drop its corporate sponsors for fear of a backlash. Women are allowed to play the course, but there are no women who are members. The women's council recently criticized a number of corporate chiefs as "publicly flaunting its practice of sex discrimination."
The group asked the members for statements that reconcile their corporate or public positions for workplace diversity with the club's policy. The council noted that several members, including Mr. Harrison of J.P. Morgan Chase and Mr. Galvin of Motorola, were to be honored by the Business Women's Network for their work fostering diversity.
The matter may not resonate with businesses, said one Augusta member who is the retired head of a Fortune 500 company. "I don't think most corporations will do anything," he said. "I don't think anybody believes that this is one of the great life-or-death issues of America. I think the attitude is that this is a private club."
The member who said that executives of public companies were motivated to bring in women said he saw plenty of reason to bar women.
"It's a men's club," he said. "It's a congregation of men who enjoy being around each other. Suppose they let three women in. What would the difference be? Nothing would change. That leads me to think: Why do it?"
When asked why the club decided to relax its rules and admit blacks in the 1990's, he replied that, in his mind, black men belonged at the club. The question, he said, is whether there should be men's clubs or not.
Despite such opposition, the former chief executive who is a member considers change inevitable. Women will be admitted, he said, but it is more likely to happen when the spotlight fades.
Among the names he suggested as a candidate was Sandra Day O'Connor, the United States Supreme Court justice. 
Betty Spence, president of the National Association of Female Executives, also has a list of prospects, including Patricia F. Russo, chief executive of Lucent Technologies. "She ranked 91st on Golf Digest's recent list of the best golfing C.E.O.'s in the country with a 12.4 handicap, putting her ahead of Augusta members like Ken Chenault and Sanford Weill," she said.
"Augusta is anachronistic," she added. "It's a dinosaur. Corporations benefit by hearing the business insights of women."
Some women privately express anger about the exclusionary world of corporate golf and a few are more openly critical. Phyllis Grann, the former president of Penguin Putnam, said, "It is morally wrong to run a large company that employs women and support a club, even privately, that excludes a large portion of both your workplace and society."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Germany: Bayer Sees Lower Operating Profit 

BYLINE:  AFX 

 BODY:
 The chairman of Bayer, Werner Wenning, warned that the company's operating profit would be lower this year compared with 2001, but reiterated net profits would be higher thanks to divestments of some 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion). In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that appeared yesterday, Mr. 
Wenning said it was now correct to assume Bayer would not make up for its lower first-half operating profit in the second half. He added though that Bayer was sticking by its forecast of higher net profit this year, despite the "volatility in the markets and the risks that exist at the moment for the world economy." In other news, it announced the sale of its rubber and plastics specialist supplier Rhein Chemie to a group of investors advised by Advent International of the United States for 215 million euros.

HEADLINE: City of Schemes 

BYLINE:  By Kurt Andersen; Kurt Andersen is the author of the novel "Turn of the Century" and the host of the Public Radio International program "Studio 360."

 BODY:
Aren't all these awful crooked C.E.O.'s and C.F.O.'s out in the sticks just . . . awful? How did this spirit of shameless greed come to infuse the corporate cultures of the heartland? Enron: Houston. Arthur Andersen: Chicago. WorldCom: Clinton, Miss. Adelphia: Coudersport, Pa. Tyco: Exeter, N.H., and Boca Raton, Fla. Here in New York City, we've spent the last year selflessly working together toward physical and psychic recovery, all of us engaged in a painful but glorious existential civic introspection. Meanwhile, out there, beyond the Hudson, in the vast unfathomable America of discount superstores and chain restaurants and sun-baked suburban business parks, a decadent amorality had worked its way like some malignant rot through the nation's fiber. Consumed with the struggle to rebuild, we New Yorkers were feeling fully American as we hadn't in decades -- and now, suddenly, the "real" America is revealed as a manic, festering hive of greed and corruption. It turns out all the Bedford Fallses are actually Pottersvilles. Which makes us, as we observe the mess from the Upper West Side and TriBeCa, feel all the more victimized and righteous. And by the way? For the record? We always had our doubts about the Internet and its associated financial madnesses. 
 Would that it were so, that New York could now revel in its innocence. In fact, if you have to choose the primary breeding ground for the various business misdeeds now consuming national attention, New York, I'm afraid, is the place. I'm not even thinking mainly of Sam Waksal and Martha Stewart and her socialite stockbroker, or of the Upper East Side convicts Alfred Taubman and Dede Brooks. I'm talking about all the ugly corporate implosions all across the country. No matter where they are, lines of blame for the companies' current circumstances lead straight back to our city. And it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise. 
 New York's (false) sense of distance from all this malfeasance derives in no small part from a coincidence of timing. The first seriously negative news article about Enron in this newspaper happened to appear Sept. 9, 2001. The subsequent revelations, which shriveled Enron's share price from $35 to 29 cents in eight weeks, started appearing in mid-October, when New Yorkers had more immediate concerns than the accounting practices of Houston-based energy-trading companies. Months passed before we heard about the other big corporate scandals -- WorldCom, Adelphia, Tyco -- and by then we had already acquired the habit of lordly obliviousness. Financial monkey business in places like Clinton, Miss., and Coudersport, Pa., was not really our affair.
But if infectious greed is the virus, New York is the center of the outbreak. We may prefer to think of it as the American cultural capital, or as a breathtaking physical creation, or as simply the place where a plurality of the country's most interesting people live. But New York is also, inarguably, the money center of America and the world, the capital of capitalism. 
The two global superbanks, Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, are here. The New York Stock Exchange is, of course, here. And most important for this discussion, the big investment banks -- Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers, Bear, Stearns, J. P. Morgan and Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney -- are all here, too. It was New York investment bankers who drove the mergers-and-acquisitions deal culture of the 80's and 90's and who most aggressively oversold the myth of synergy that justified it. It was New York investment bankers and their Wall Street brothers who trained a generation of obedient American C.E.O.'s (by means of stock-option-based compensation) to worry more about jacking up their share prices in the short term than about running their companies well for the long haul. It was they who permitted the digital-technology giddiness of the late 90's to spread beyond Silicon Valley; Palo Alto venture capitalists may have doled out most of the initial dot-com money, but it was New York investment bankers who took all those companies public for billions of dollars, thus enabling the national festival of greed. It was they who created an inherently corrupt equities research establishment. It was they -- with their lawyers at the big New York firms -- who invented the novel financial architectures of Enron and WorldCom, just as it was the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company that provided Enron with its egregiously go-go, ultra-fast-company ideology. 
Moreover, it was the example of New York investment bankers, earning gigantic salaries for doing essentially nothing -- knowing the right people, talking smoothly, showing up at closings -- that encouraged businesspeople out in the rest of America to feel entitled to smoke-and-mirrors cash bonanzas of their own.
New Yorkers didn't create the digital-technology mania of the 90's. But while nearly all of the real achievements of the Wired Decade -- laptops, flat screens, faster chips, cheap and huge memories, P.D.A.'s, WiFi, instant messaging, browsers, the Web itself, all the actual stuff -- were accomplished by people elsewhere, it was New Yorkers who made the scramble for instant wealth the endeavors' overriding purpose. The dreamers and tinkerers of Silicon Valley were not innocents, but they were, at worst, Drs. Faustus willingly seduced by the slick Mephistophelean agents of New York's blue-chip money culture.
At least one of the emigres from the Northeast was more like Conrad's Kurtz, seducing the natives as he went extravagantly native himself. Frank Quattrone, the Manhattan banker turned Palo Alto-based technology consultant for Morgan Stanley, "was the first guy in the New York investment banking world to take Silicon Valley seriously," the technology investor Roger McNamee told the magazine Business 2.0 last year.
Irrational exuberance bloomed around San Francisco in 1995, but most of Quattrone's New York peers remained skeptical until around 1997, and the national news media -- the overwhelmingly Manhattan-based national news media -- held out until at least 1998. Yet like eager latecomers in all situations, when the Manhattan establishment finally did sign on to the digital revolution, they came as born-again enthusiasts. In just a year or so, the local conventional wisdom changed from supercilious bemusement to stunned resentment to bedazzlement and longing. In 1998, Conde Nast bought the San Francisco-based Wired magazine. In 1999, Gerald Levin, a smitten New Yorker, began courting Steve Case and AOL on behalf of Time Warner. (That crush, of course, has already become a very unhappy marriage.) Even later in the game, the fall of 2000, six months after the bubble had started to burst, the New York media company Primedia bought the Web site About.com for $690 million, or almost three times Primedia's current market value.
And just last year Primedia, for which I worked in the mid-90's as editor of New York magazine, acquired Inside.com, the online news service that I helped start in 1999. Inside had its offices in the Starrett-Lehigh Building, the chic, brutalist Moderne block of lofts in west Chelsea that was packed with dot-com enterprises (including, still, Martha Stewart's). One day in the late winter of 2000, an investment banker from Bear, Stearns knocked on our door. Were we financed? Did we need capital? Incredibly, she was going up and down the grungy halls, making cold calls. This, we half-joked, must be a sign of the top of the market. In fact, the actual market top came a few weeks later -- and a few weeks after that was "Black Friday," April 14, the day Nasdaq stocks declined by an average of nearly 10 percent. Inside.com closed its financing -- from Chase, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, among others -- the following week.
Probably the most significant media inflation of the bubble came from CNBC, the New York-based cable channel, which by 1998 had become the ESPN for Americans' new national pastime -- that is, sitting alone for hours, monitoring the growth of your 401(k) and I.R.A. wealth, a kind of merry Scrooge McDuck greed that before the mid-90's was socially acceptable only in Manhattan. A 24/7 financial cable service required a steady flow of credible stock-pickers; as a result of their relentless exposure on CNBC and on CNN's "Moneyline" (also broadcast from New York) and CNNfn (ditto), equities analysts left their cubicles to become quasi-glamorous minor media celebrities in a way that can happen only in New York. And the best way for these analysts to maintain their new, lucrative celebrity was by continuously increasing their exuberance -- by insisting that the Manhattan-based ice-cream-and-video-delivery service Kozmo.com would transform retailing, that Amazon's share price would hit $400, that the merger of Time Warner with AOL portended the dawn of a new era of civilization. The three most important, bullish tech-stock analysts of the era were all New Yorkers: Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley, Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch and Jack Grubman at Salomon Smith Barney.
Moreover, the analysts -- ostensibly objective judges of companies' prospects, the reality check to investor-relations hype -- had become active participants in the white-hot sales efforts of New York investment banks and brokerages. No one was more responsible for that new complicity than Frank Quattrone, who in 1998 persuaded his employer, Credit Suisse First Boston, to give him direct authority over the firm's technology-stock research staff. He was therefore in an unprecedented position to enforce his analysts' optimism about the stocks of companies that C.S.F.B. took public. And it worked: in short order, Quattrone turned C.S.F.B. from a minor I.P.O. player into the second-largest underwriter in the business. Quattrone worked in California, but the company's world headquarters is on Madison Square in Manhattan. 
At Salomon, meanwhile, Grubman was also very lucratively combining the roles of analyst and investment banker. It was he and his Salomon colleagues who engineered the improbable acquisition of M.C.I. by scrappy little WorldCom in 1997; without him, both companies, and all their investors, might be doing just fine today. Since 1997, Citigroup and Salomon have underwritten telecommunications I.P.O.'s worth $17 billion, including those of Global Crossing (whose board Grubman privately advised) and Teligent; both companies are now bankrupt. Grubman attended WorldCom board meetings and schemed with Salomon Smith Barney bankers to funnel shares of hot I.P.O.'s to WorldCom executives and directors. And who was the scrappy Mississippi company's biggest customer? AOL Time Warner, the huge New York company, which paid $900 million a year to run its Internet traffic on WorldCom's network -- and which in return demanded hundreds of millions' worth of dubious WorldCom advertising in AOL Time Warner media.
And did the putatively tough New York-based press scrutinize all this profligate fast-and-looseness? Ummm . . . no. Only now, months and years after the fact, are we hearing about the roles New York financial institutions played in maintaining the illusion of Enron's health -- indeed, that it was gangs of ingenious New Yorkers who choreographed nearly all of the most outlandish financial and legal acrobatics. J. P. Morgan Chase supposedly packaged Enron debt as "credit derivatives" and sold it off to investors, and it also helped devise Enron's questionable "prepays" -- that is, loans disguised as commodity trades intended to make the company's huge debt look more manageable. Citigroup supposedly provided loans that were misleadingly recorded on Enron's books as cash flow from oil-trading operations. In 1999, Merrill Lynch decided to buy several Nigerian barges from its client, Enron, seemingly increasing Enron's annual profit. The next year, Merrill decided it didn't need them and sold them back -- at a profit for itself. And although Enron's headquarters are in Houston, its two financial evil geniuses -- the former C.F.O. Andrew Fastow and his former No. 2 Michael Kopper (who has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering), both grew up in the suburbs of New York, 45 minutes from Wall Street. 
As for the accounting industry that gave its imprimatur to these shenanigans, it does not have a geographical locus (partly because the big firms try to project an image of both ubiquity and localism), but the headquarters of two of the Big Five -- PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young -- are in Manhattan, and a third, Deloitte & Touche, is in suburban Connecticut. If anywhere on earth can be considered the accountancy capital, it's New York.
Jack Grubman, like all analysts really just a glorified business beat reporter, was paid tens of millions of dollars by Salomon during the last half-decade. From Salomon's perspective, there was, of course, a real (albeit unethical) economic rationale for such compensation, but from Grubman's perspective, there was one additional factor: he lives and worked in Manhattan. The culture of Manhattan generates in normal successful people (and by "normal," I mean people who do not perform music or act professionally or lead their league in scoring) a hunger for insane as opposed to merely neurotic amounts of wealth. And those pathological Manhattan norms helped fuel the C.E.O. crime wave. 
The C.E.O. crooks all yearned to be playas, and playas have to have at least a foot in New York. They needed to wake up in the city that never sleeps, to find they were kings of the hill, tops of the heap. Dennis Kozlowski, his little town blues just melting away, made Tyco buy him a New York apartment, and he rationalized it as a legitimate business convenience. But the scale and opulence of his convenience were all about living the only-in-Manhattan, M.B.A. Cribs lifestyle: an $18 million duplex on 5th Avenue dressed up with perhaps $7.5 million in decorations (including a $6,000 shower curtain) and another $4 million worth of supposedly sales-tax-free art. Such is the order of magnitude required to impress the Manhattan money culture.
The pharmaceutical entrepreneur Sam Waksal, now under indictment for forgery and insider trading, is routinely identified in terms of his deluxe Manhattan real estate -- the "art-filled SoHo loft," where he was arrested at dawn one Wednesday this summer. The cable TV company Adelphia is based in unglamorous western Pennsylvania, but its founder, former chairman and supposed looter, John Rigas, was arrested (also at dawn on a summer Wednesday) in his corporate apartment on East 75th Street -- one of Adelphia's two fancy Manhattan apartments occupied by Rigases. Jean-Marie Messier, the former C.E.O. of Vivendi, is not a crook -- but when he decided last year he was going all-out to become a global media presence, he had his company provide him a $17.5 million duplex apartment on Park Avenue. To his enemies back in France, this New York ostentation reportedly was proof that he'd been co-opted. And although he had famously derided other executives' "golden parachutes," now that he has been fired himself, he reportedly would like to keep the duplex. In New York, the greed really is infectious, like glee.
Now that the Enrons and WorldComs have imploded, the endgames, too, are playing out between the Battery and 59th Street. Having been effectively concocted by Salomon five years ago, WorldCom is today relying on different New York investment bankers, the Blackstone Group and Goldman Sachs, to broker its deacessions and possible dissolution. And the best $600-an-hour New York criminal and bankruptcy lawyers are as furiously busy now as the best $600-an-hour New York securities and corporate lawyers were during the late 90's. WorldCom has retained the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Sam Waksal is represented by Paul, Weiss. Dennis Kozlowski's criminal counsel is the Park Avenue lawyer Stephen Kaufman. Another Park Avenue criminal lawyer, Peter Fleming of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, represents John Rigas of Adelphia, as well as Michael Odom, who had been one of Arthur Andersen's chief Enron-minders in Houston. Fleming, who defended Drexel Burnham Lambert in the late 80's, as well as John Mitchell and Don King, recently told this newspaper, "I've never had a client I thought was guilty," thus demonstrating another very New York trait -- well-compensated, self-righteous chutzpah -- that runs like a Day-Glo red wire through all these cases. 
On the other hand, New Yorkers are also leading the efforts to nail the wrongdoers. Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, struck a settlement earlier this year with Merrill Lynch concerning the independence of its stock analysts; he's now investigating how Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney became the lead underwriter on the AT&T Wireless I.P.O. in 2000, earning Salomon a $45 million fee, after Sanford Weill, the Citigroup chairman and AT&T board member, encouraged his star analyst -- Grubman -- to rethink his negative rating of AT&T. The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is prosecuting the Rigases of Adelphia as well as the former financial executives of WorldCom. The Manhattan district attorney is prosecuting Kozlowski, and investigating the Enron "prepay" schemes contrived by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase. And the New York financial cable channels and newspapers and business magazines, of course, are now zealously on the case. The downside is not as exciting to report as the upside was, but it's a story.
However, except for a few unlucky, overreaching dweebs like Jack Grubman, forced out of Salomon in August, the New Yorkers who enabled the excesses of late-90's-style American business are still running the show. And Frank Quattrone, for instance, was rewarded last November with an appointment to C.S.F.B.'s executive board -- which presumably means he'll be spending more time at headquarters here in New York.
In other words, it's all about us -- still, and again. A big reason people in this city were initially reluctant to drink the New Economy Kool-Aid was the sense that the digital revolution threatened our primacy in the national economy and culture. And indeed it did. So when the revolution was declared a failure two years ago, New Yorkers could, gloatingly, revert to their complacent status quo. And now? Now that we understand it was New Yorkers who pulled (and are pulling) the important strings behind the Enrons and WorldComs, that a Manhattanoid psychology fed the despotic grandiosity of C.E.O.'s all over America? Will we mumble apologies, lie low, try to atone? No: it will only make us more insufferably smug. New Yorkers by definition want to think of their city as the great imperial metropolis, the national locus of power and excitement, whatever forms the power and excitement assume. In addition to their official pride (in skyscrapers and art and baseball teams and firefighters and the glorious human mosaic), New Yorkers have always been happy to take perverse pride in this city: in high-end gangsterism, in the secret shadow zones, in the sharpers who seem to get away with it just because they're New Yorkers. For better and for worse, New York rules.

HEADLINE: The Dursts Have Odd Properties 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, is working on a book about the history of Times Square.

 BODY:
Over the course of the last decade, a new Times Square has grown up in the place of the old -- a global entertainment-finance-media nexus of glass towers, with themed restaurants and megastores on their ground floors offering a wholesome and, on the whole, ingeniously engineered version of the famously carnivalesque atmosphere of the seedy Times Square of generations past. It is, by now, an almost wholly self-consistent world -- "totalized," as the academics say. But the bubble has not yet fully closed; a few oddities still flourish. Immediately to the east of the immense, glittering bulk of the Conde Nast Building, which is on the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, is a peculiar little arts complex situated in a string of dingy buildings. Until a few months ago, the sign above the little structure next door to the Conde Nast Building featured a version of the American flag, an outline of a hand clutching a can of spray paint and the slogan, "Declare Independence From Corporate Rule" -- a furious protest at all that Times Square has become. 
 It was, at the same time, a familiar enough script in New York: intransigent holdout mocks the ambitions of overweening developer. But the actual script turned out to be far stranger, for Chashama, as the arts center is called, is in fact the creation of Anita Durst, whose father, Douglas, is the developer who owns the Conde Nast Building. And Douglas is, in turn, the son of Seymour Durst, who amassed the family's vast holdings in the West 40's. Times Square is a place that every generation reimagines and reshapes. And though there is an overwhelming sense of finality about this Times Square -- the glass-tower-theme-park one -- perhaps the truth is that Times Square is always open-ended, provisional, transitory. Maybe every Durst gets a Times Square of his own. 
 I first met Anita Durst in late March. She was sitting in her cubbyhole office on the second floor of 135 West 42nd, the Chashama office, lightly bouncing on one of those big blue balls said to be therapeutic. She was, when she stood up, tall and slender, with a ferociously cropped skullcap of black hair and the almond eyes of a Modigliani set in a narrow, triangular face. She is, at 34, the kind of woman who could war with her beauty and still look beautiful. We proceeded to have an oddly disjointed conversation; her speech was so stilted and hesitant that she appeared to be struggling with the medium of language. I later learned that as a child she had been severely dyslexic, and that she still had trouble memorizing lines for a part. Though trained as an actress, Anita was drawn to the kind of avant-garde work that often didn't require much in the way of speech. Two years ago, she played a mute and sullen secretary in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's "Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant"; a critic in this newspaper described her as "spectacularly creepy."
Anita is something of a den mother for the antiglobalist left; earlier this year, in fact, Chashama was host of the Intergalactic Convention of Anarchists. But Anita herself does not appear to be against anything -- certainly not her family. The Durst Organization owns or leases virtually the entire block from Conde Nast east to Sixth Avenue, and her father has allowed her to use four or five storefronts, which alternate with the Peep-O-Rama, Tad's Steaks and a Duane Reade. She had been very close to her grandfather Seymour, who died seven years ago, and, though it sounds strange, she sees Chashama as a fulfillment of her curmudgeonly grandfather's own view of the world. "My grandfather hated Disney," she said. "He always said Times Square was meant to be built up by the community. That was one of his bottom lines."
"Bottom lines?" 
Anita explained that that was his term for those two-line personal ads that The Times sells at the foot of the front page. And I suddenly remembered where I had first encountered the name "Durst": The oddball who penned those cranky messages-in-a-bottle that ended "Durst-Advt." -- that was Seymour! 
The Durst Organization keeps its offices on one of the least desirable floors of a black glass building it owns at 1155 Sixth Avenue, between 44th and 45th Streets. The conference room is decorated with old family photographs and building models, as well as a "contract partnership," dated Oct. 20, 1905, between Joseph Durst and Hyman Rubin. Along with the Tishmans, the Rudins and a few others, the Dursts constitute the ancient tribal order of New York real estate -- the Jewish families who began buying buildings at the dawn of the 20th century. Joe Durst invested in commercial and residential real estate in Midtown Manhattan; his distaste for rent-control laws eventually drove him out of the residential market. Joe anointed Seymour, one of his four sons, as his successor. Seymour had two enormous gifts as a developer. He saw the potential of underdeveloped neighborhoods before others did, and he had the massive patience required to assemble plots one by one until he had a parcel large enough to build on. In the 1950's, Seymour built along Third Avenue, then a commercial wilderness area. During the ensuing decade, he shifted to Sixth Avenue in the low 40's. And in the late 60's, he began buying property west of these holdings toward Broadway. Not a single new building had been built in Times Square since the early 30's, and the area was beginning to take on the pathological character celebrated in movies like "Midnight Cowboy." 
But Seymour was a gambler, and he was convinced that Times Square's moment had come. In a real-world version of Monopoly, he made wholesale swaps of his East Side properties for parcels owned by others along Broadway. The plan was to amass all the land from 42nd to 47th Streets, and from Sixth to Broadway, and then build a single complex of black glass slabs -- just as the Rockefellers had built their center between Fifth and Sixth a few blocks farther north. Had he succeeded, Seymour might have single-handedly drained 70 years of funky, ungovernable life out of Times Square. In fact, he was forced to abandon the idea when the real-estate market cratered in the mid-70's. "Maybe," says Douglas, who has a parched version of his father's famously dry wit, "it's just as well it never happened."
The Dursts held on to much, though not all, of their property. When, in the 1980's, the city and state tried to attract developers to 42nd Street with enormous subsidies, Seymour did everything he could to scuttle the plan, both because he considered it a wasteful boondoggle and because the subsidized office towers would damage the value of his own holdings. The Durst Organization filed lawsuits that, whatever their intention, had the effect of delaying the project until the real-estate market had (again) collapsed. And when the project's developer was forced to sell out, in 1995, it was Douglas Durst who bought the most valuable parcel, and who reaped the enormous benefits of the tax subsidies that the family had professed to despise. The deal he signed was widely considered a stroke of chutzpah audacious even by local standards. Douglas Durst, a man of exceedingly few words, concedes that the outcome was "ironic." 
There is a widespread view that a rogue gene is on the loose in the Durst family tree; as one long-time friend of the family says, "They're all wired a little funny." Most notorious is Douglas's older brother, Robert, who was arrested last year and charged with murdering a man whose torso washed up in Galveston Bay. Robert may well have been psychotic. One journalistic account of his last months in Galveston, Tex., described him as wearing "large-frame eyeglasses that were completely covered with tape except for a small triangular opening over one lens." He was picked up after a nationwide manhunt when he stole a chicken-salad sandwich from a supermarket in Bethlehem, Pa. No trial date has been set; Robert may also be charged with murdering his first wife, Kathleen, who disappeared in 1982 and was never found.
The rest of the Durst clan is eccentric, but peaceable. Seymour was soft-spoken, courtly and as mysterious as the Sphinx -- an oddity in the extroverted, backslapping world of New York real estate. He was a man who gave his hobbyhorses a serious ride, most famously in the case of the Debt Clock he mounted on Sixth Avenue in 1989 to tick off the growing federal debt. Toward the end of his life, he found editorial fulfillment as the housing columnist of Street News, a newspaper published by the homeless. At the same time, those who knew him well considered Seymour a charming and immensely knowledgeable conversationalist. Tama Starr, who is herself the third-generation owner of Artkraft Strauss, the firm that built Times Square's greatest signs, says: "He had tucked all over his person these folded-up documents -- things he was working on, things he had just published, essays, little quotes. As the conversation turned around civic affairs, he would reach into an inside pocket and he would just happen to have something on the subject."
Seymour and his wife, Bernice, had four children. In 1950, when Douglas was 5 and Robert 6, Bernice fell or jumped to her death from the roof of the family home in Scarsdale. Seymour never remarried, and both boys grew up rebellious, as well as withdrawn. Douglas is a wary person, ill at ease with strangers. "It takes him a while to warm up," as his sister, Wendy, puts it. Durst does not socialize with his peers, does not have lunch at the Four Seasons and does not join the prominent museum or hospital boards that his peers populate. Jerry Speyer, a developer who does all those things, says, "I'm probably one of the few people in the industry Douglas has ever had dinner with."
Douglas Durst has an almost olive complexion, with short, dark, curly hair and a middle-aged man's developing paunch, but he showed me a picture of himself as a young man when he was a Jerry Garcia look-alike; little Anita is wearing a peace symbol. Durst graduated from Berkeley in 1966, smack dab in the middle of the revolution, a budding economist who hoped to work in third-world countries. Then, he says, he married, had children, went to work for his father, proved to be "a failure at business," fled to Newfoundland, where he had "a serious accident" when a wood-fired water heater blew up, was rescued by Seymour and brought back to the hospital in New York and rejoined the family business -- this time for good. Robert followed virtually the identical trajectory, opening a health-food store in Vermont, returning to New York, marrying and then, unhappily, joining the family firm. It was, in both cases, a rather sad story -- a story of thwarted hopes. I said, "Real estate isn't the easiest profession in which to use your moral passion." Douglas pondered this statement at great length and finally said, "No." I waited for more; there was no more.
Durst and his wife, Susanne, had three children. Anita, the oldest, was precociously ungovernable, appropriating a family car and driving it into trees at age 13. When I asked Anita about school, she said, with some trepidation, "You want to hear the whole story?" Anita's story is not much happier than her father's: shipped off to prep school in ninth grade after proving a hopeless failure in public school, she was kicked out for smoking pot, took a one-year sabbatical to shack up with a biker and was then enrolled by obviously desperate parents in the kind of vocational school that was meant to be the last stop before the streets. Anita earned her high school diploma by tending bar at a pizzeria. After she graduated, in 1989, her parents asked her to move out. And Seymour invited her to move in.
Seymour was the kind of eccentric character who can seem highly appealing to a rebellious teenager. He resolutely refused to do certain things practiced in polite society: Buy clothes, wear an overcoat, take a taxi or for that matter a train or a plane. He had odd opinions and odd habits; and above all, he had odd books. Twenty years earlier, he began a collection of books and documents about New York, and the collection swiftly engulfed whatever parts of his life were not devoted to work or propagandizing about rent control. In 1985, Seymour reluctantly moved out of a brownstone whose supports were about to collapse from the weight of books and into a 19-room mansion on East 61st Street. One room after another was incorporated into this ever-expanding Borgesian library. There were books in the fridge and books in the bathroom. Anita lived upstairs, in the Fiction Room. There was an Infrastructure Room, a Biography Room, a Press Room, the Architects' Closet, each with a decor arranged by Seymour to evoke the subject. Seymour's bedroom (rare books) faced the Times Square Room, which featured a collection of Playbills starting at the turn of the century, books on theater, a nickelodeon with nudie pictures, posters for the live sex shows. (The library has since been reinstalled, with a tidiness Anita finds slightly dismaying, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.)
Seymour probably knew as much as anyone alive about New York's buildings and built environment; and Anita learned more from listening to him talk, which came naturally to her, than from reading the books, which did not. Anita says that she and her grandfather lived in perfect harmony. They went out for breakfast every morning at Burger Heaven, which Seymour also used to recruit his librarians, since he claimed that professional librarians kept trying to improve on his "quintessimal" cataloguing system. Anita remained upstairs until two years after her grandfather died, at age 81, in 1995.
Like many shy people, Anita fell in love with acting. Unlike most of the others, she had a father who owned Broadway theaters. In July 1989, the Durst Organization bought the lease for seven of the rundown movie theaters on 42nd Street, with the hope of returning them to legitimate use and thus proving that private developers could revitalize the block -- or, as their critics charged, of realizing a windfall when they were taken over in the impending condemnation process. Douglas became Anita's chief patron. He allowed her to use the semidefunct Diplomat Hotel, on West 43rd Street, for a play called "The Law of Remains," in which, Anita says, "Andy Warhol and Jeffrey Dahmer meet in Heaven." The hotel had a series of splendid, haunted-looking ballrooms. "The big ballroom was Heaven," Anita says, "and God was a Puerto Rican drag queen." Douglas says that Seymour would leave after the first few scenes of these shows, and report, "I didn't understand it, but Anita was very good."
Anita was a disciple of and collaborator with Reza Abdoh, a celebrated Iranian multimedia artist who died of AIDS in 1995. She then formed a company of her own, naming it Chashama after combing through books in her grandfather's library. (The word is not far from the Persian terms for both "spring" and "eye" -- both of which meanings Anita says she intended.) In 1997, as he had begun building Conde Nast headquarters at 4 Times Square, Douglas gave Chashama the adjacent building, which had housed Herman's Sporting Goods. And as the leases of neighboring storefronts expired, he gave those to Chashama too, though he has said that doing so has cost him up to $2 million in foregone revenue. Anita suddenly had an abundance of space, at least for an avant-garde theater company, and she has since made both the stages and the storefronts themselves available to virtually any dance company, theater troupe or installation artist who wandered by. In May, Anita herself directed "The World of the P-Cult," a production featuring a group of dominatrixes and neo-go-go girls she had rounded up from downtown as well as a young man with flipperlike arms. Few who saw it will soon forget the scene of the naked flipper-boy, his genitals in a little bag, borne on to the stage in preparation for ritual sacrifice, singing in his unearthly, androgynous voice a tune that mixed the first movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Madonna's "Material Girl." Douglas sees virtually everything that Anita does, but Anita says that she advised her father to take a pass on the "P-Cult." 
Not long ago, I asked Douglas if I could take him to lunch some time. "No," he said. "I don't eat lunch." Since I had seen a box of pizza on his desk the week before, I understood that he meant that he didn't have lunch out. Nevertheless, a few days later, he called to say that he and Anita would, in fact, join me for lunch at the restaurant I had suggested -- the Howard Johnson's on 46th and Broadway, a perennially deserted and rather dingy reminder of the bygone Times Square of the 1960's. I met them there on a brutally hot day in June. Anita, her feet drawn up on the orange Naugahyde, looked catlike in her pink jersey sweatshirt, while Douglas, the two top buttons of his white dress shirt undone, was mopping his brow. The two seemed very comfortable in each other's company, even if neither seemed very comfortable in their own. 
Howard Johnson's represents the Times Square that Douglas actually felt emotionally drawn to. As a boy, he said, he had hung out at the Ripley's museum across the street, and the old movie palaces, and even some of the scuzzier arcades. I asked him what he thought of the glittering, globalized new Times Square that he had helped bring into being. He thought intently for several very long moments, and then said, "I think it could do without all the development, except, of course, 4 Times Square."
Anita remained mostly silent, working her way through a grilled cheese sandwich and then a humongo banana split. But when I asked Douglas how long he would keep subsidizing Chashama, she interjected, "You said until December."
"Until December," Douglas agreed.
"And then we're going to wait to see what happens in December?"
"That is correct," Douglas said. At that point, he said, he would either tear the buildings down in favor of another office tower -- in which case, goodbye Chashama -- or, if the market didn't seem ready for another million square feet of office space, return most of the stores to rental. Anita would keep 135 West 42nd -- a tiny beachhead of family-subsidized eccentricity in the shadows of Times Square.

HEADLINE: Hip-ification 

BYLINE:  By Jim Nelson; Jim Nelson is an executive editor at GQ.

 BODY:
There are countless reasons that certain neighborhoods become hip -- why Fort Greene, say, or NoLIta suddenly buzzes with a new energy. And in the constant flux of the city, it's difficult to pinpoint the moment any newly revived neighborhood turns that vital corner. But something happened on Clinton Street three and a half years ago, something small and unexpected, that would transform that fusty old part of the Lower East Side for years to come. This is what happened: Dewey Dufresne went walking. 
 It was April 1999, and he was turning a corner himself, puttering up Clinton from Rivington, where he lived. Dufresne, a middle-aged man, sometime chef and general handyman ("I do odd jobs" is how he puts it) is a staple in the neighborhood, having moved there in 1993 when many considered it rough. He was walking that day with his old friend Janet Nelson, who used to work with him at a restaurant and who lived in his building. As they strolled up Clinton, they talked about opening a new restaurant. But the economy was booming; landlords in lowly Hell's Kitchen were asking upward of $10,000 in rent, and the East Village was even more expensive. That's when Dufresne saw it: the abandoned restaurant at 71 Clinton, a building he had passed a thousand times. It looked pathetic -- the greasy, gutted remains of Ray's Chirpin' Chicken. But the space was empty, a blank slate. 
 They looked into it. The rent was a bargain: $2,000 a month. When Dennis Cooleen, one of their eventual partners in the restaurant that would become 71 Clinton Fresh Food, heard about the deal, he couldn't get over the price. "It was cheaper than my apartment," he says. There was only one problem: nobody he knew had ever heard of Clinton Street. (Clinton sits on the eastern cusp of the Lower East Side, near the Williamsburg Bridge. It runs north from South Street to Houston, after which it turns into Avenue B.) But he, too, had searched unsuccessfully for affordable spaces, and he concluded, "The only way to go is down."
At the time, Clinton Street was a world apart from the East Village. The area, once a haven for Jews and other early American immigrants, had in recent decades been populated mostly by working-class Hispanics, first Puerto Ricans and then Dominicans. Until the fall of 1999, the businesses on Clinton all catered to them: Spanish-language video stores, salsa record shops, international telephone calling stations and food stands serving cuchifritos and comidas criollas. Chinese and Koreans had slipped in, bringing nail salons and $3 manicures. But rather than seeming like a vibrant oasis of local commerce and ethnic pride, the street had a down-and-out feel -- tamped down, cowed. Many of the shops were struggling to stay afloat against a relentless stream of drug traffic. During the Giuliani administration, the police chased away some of the crime. But in '99, heroin and crack dealers still worked the pay phones all along the street. Rent was cheap if you wanted it: some of the old businesses were paying less than $800 a month, residents about $1,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.
Yet there was change quietly brewing. A trickle of young people, many of them musicians and artists unable to find affordable downtown rents in the boom of the 90's, had begun to move in. (The cleanup of Tompkins Square Park in 1992, in particular, made the East Village more attractive and more expensive, pushing people south.) Some musicians and artists had been living in the Clinton Street area for years, but this was an uptick. The locals noticed it and started calling the new arrivals los blanquitos. The "little white ones" gravitated toward a lone coffee shop, Lotus Club, on the corner of Clinton and Stanton -- a drab but endearing bohemian hangout, with lattes and used books, which opened in 1997. Otherwise, the blanquitos tended to go west, to places like the Mercury Lounge up on Houston or the already settled streets of Orchard and Ludlow.
These latter streets -- particularly Ludlow -- had already undergone a quick evolution, seeming to get hip and then unhip in record time. The street raged hard in the early 90's with new bars and music venues, but the scene quickly became loud and overrun. Yet the Ludlow phenomenon had proved something: outsiders would venture to previously neglected corners of the East Side if they felt there was something abuzz.
The people who turn neighborhoods hip these days -- the more pioneering restaurateurs and boutique operators -- tend to smell change in the air simultaneously. They walk the same forgotten blocks of the city at the same time, sensing something actionable. Sure enough, just as the 71 Clinton crew were designing their space, many of the key players who would shape Clinton Street were already moving in and around the neighborhood.
These players -- you might call them early scouters -- were a relatively small lot. In the months before the fall of 1999, a handful or so of people were looking at the neighborhood in a unique way, appraising its potential, sometimes without even knowing they were doing so. The scouters had a few things in common: many had run a shop or restaurant before in other, once-forsaken parts of the city. They liked being on the edge of things, being the first on the block and having others follow them. And, on a more subtle level, they were able to sense something -- an emergent energy. It was almost subarticulate. "If you'd heard about the Lower East Side, you might think: Oh, no, not there," says Juan Carlos Rodriguez, a Spaniard who began construction on his tapas bar, 1492 Food, just as the people across the street were building 71 Clinton. "But as soon as you went walking, you felt something. The street was very particular."
Buket Hasman, a young Turkish woman, felt the same way, and she opened a women's clothing boutique, Mina, a month after 71 Clinton opened. She and the other new merchants who wound up moving to Clinton mention the same small but significant draws: the appeal of the trees when they first saw them -- the Callery pear trees that were planted on the north end in the 1990's and explode each spring like cherry blossoms. And, curiously, absolutely everyone mentions the gentle pace the street had in the morning and afternoon, before the drug runners came out at night. The light traffic made the street a pleasant place to be.
This might seem a trifling matter, but until 1994, the direction of traffic on Clinton moved north. This meant that the street was used as a bustling pathway for motorists getting off the Williamsburg Bridge and connecting, via Houston, to the F.D.R. Drive. The constant stream of commuters gave the street the sense that it was always under siege. But in 1994, because of construction on the bridge, the Department of Transportation reordered things. Traffic on Clinton, between Houston and Delancey, started moving south. The pace instantly slackened, giving the street that "feeling" newcomers talk about. It also opened up Clinton Street to taxis and bike-riders, encouraging a downtown flow from the East Village and elsewhere. Some say it also helped to stanch, or at least redirect, the drug traffic that was coming off the Williamsburg Bridge and looping back around into Brooklyn.
But it wasn't until 71 Clinton Fresh Food made its debut in October 1999 that the changes on the street became visible. "We didn't go into it with the idea that we would start a scene," Janet Nelson says. "We thought we would be opening a restaurant that would be moderately priced, have a nice, local atmosphere." But in the end, there was nothing local about it -- certainly not the design, which was sleek and aggressively modern (exposed brick, vinyl banquettes, tangerine and green walls). The cool exterior, with its wall of aluminum and glass fronting on Clinton, acted as a kind of signifier of a new way of being on the street.
It was the food, however, that spoke most loudly. Originally, Dewey Dufresne was supposed to be the cook, but then he had the bright idea of bringing his chef-son, Wylie, out from Las Vegas, where he had earned a reputation as a rising star at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime. The extravagant menu he devised took everyone by surprise. These were dishes the Lower East Side had never seen: edamame-and- rye-bread-crusted sea bass, duck with a bok- choy-and-confit baton. And though most of the people who lived in the neighborhood could not afford $20 entrees, the prices were markedly lower than those of uptown restaurants.
The critics swooned, and soon the house was packed every night with destination diners. They'd line up outside, hoping to nab one of the 30 seats, chattering on their cellphones and hanging out near the bodega next door, looking at first a little lost and scared. 
Witnessing the scene at 71 Clinton -- the line of cars; the willingness of people to "go slumming" in the Lower East Side -- others swung into action. Within months, local real-estate agents were sending out commercial flyers advertising available spaces in the neighborhood and encouraging new businesses to piggyback on the success of 71 Clinton. 
"The place became an adventure area to trek to from other areas," says Dewey Dufresne, whose kindly voice seems incapable of relaying the sarcasm he sometimes intends. Uptowners found the place a little edgy. "They saw homeboys on the street and thought they might be dangerous." And so, he says, "a little mystique was born."
Is it mystique that made Clinton Street hip? Partly. But it is also true that what we think of as hip has changed over the years. Hipness, as a concept, grew out of the Beats and later the hippies, artists and intellectuals of the 60's. Back then, hipness was closely attached to bohemia. To be hip was to lead a free, creative and open life. People who were hip to things were politically engaged, knew art, knew culture. But cultural values have moved on, become more consumerist. Today, bohemia is seen as unproductive. What is hipness? Hipness means keeping up with music and fashion, going to the newest shops, restaurants and wine bars, knowing the menu deeply or the chef personally. Media matters in this regard, and the food Web sites and travel guides were a crucial factor in sealing Clinton Street's fate as a hip destination. And while 71 Clinton began as a destination, it wound up reacting with its local elements and, unexpectedly, shaped the neighborhood to come. 
These days, Dewey Dufresne wears a tool belt most of the time -- he and his son have left 71 Clinton to build WD-50, a new restaurant at 50 Clinton. But to watch him interact with the other business owners and residents on the streets is to see a true believer subtly infecting others. Almost every new store on Clinton has a story about how Dewey helped it get started. "The father, he helped me from the beginning," says Rodriguez of 1492. It wasn't just that Dufresne would dispatch his overflow customers to 1492. He also loved to go over and talk shop with the owner, parsing the subtleties of restaurants, how the size of your window or the pitch of your door could affect business, almost tutoring Rodriguez.
Neil Kleinberg had a similar experience. He pounced on the space that would become Clinton Street Baking Company in April 2001, after carefully watching the block, witnessing the rise of 71 Clinton and the new businesses that followed. By then, landlords had started to pine for the big money they felt they could be making. Some were now asking $4,000 and $5,000 for commercial spaces. Kleinberg found a space for $3,200, cheap by some standards but significantly more than 71 Clinton's rent. Soon after, Dewey persuaded him to expand his operations from breakfast-only. "He told me, 'You guys should start doing soups in the wintertime.' They've been really successful. And that segued into lunch crowds."
But what you really see in Dewey Dufresne is the walking reality that some people think deeply about neighborhoods -- about every aspect of how, say, a street or a corner or light or pavement might interact with human commerce. He can talk, almost romantically, about how some streets have soul and some don't but then dismiss as sentimental claptrap the notion that the revival of Clinton was inevitable. ("People think this is the magic street -- until they fail.") He does believe that the northern two blocks of Clinton are charmed, but that third block? No soul. There are no trees; the sidewalks are more cramped; it's too close to Delancey -- a huge beast of a street with bridge traffic. "You need a block to get over Delancey." But he also explains that the guiding principle of the neighborhood was a determined opposition: "Everyone was driven by the idea that this should not be another Ludlow." 
Clinton Street would never have become hip if there weren't a collision of some sorts -- one world brushing up against another, conjuring issues of race and class, of what came before and what may come. Many of the new arrivals in the neighborhood and even some of the older residents say that they love the multiethnic vibe right now, the infusion of young people, and that this feels hip and exciting. But it also feels as if it may threaten the neighborhood. Hipness thrives off the energy of change, and that change often ends, ineluctably, in gentrification. (Meanwhile, hipness moves on: to be hip is to ride the wave before it.) Gentrification brings tensions, as the new neighbors see the place differently from their predecessors. 
Take that "multiethnic vibe." Dennis Cooleen of 71 Clinton says he has seen "a 25 percent increase in 30-something white people" in the neighborhood in the last few years. His landlord at Alias, the 71 Clinton offshoot on the corner of Rivington, is Henry Hallivis, a Cuban-American who has been living in the area since 1960. Hallivis says that until recently the neighborhood was "maybe 80 percent Spanish, 5 or 10 percent black and the rest, white Americans." Now, he says, "it's 80 percent white." Huh? The figure seems too high. "Well, I'm talking about walking on the streets. Maybe living around here, it's still the same percentage." In effect, this is the new neighborhood: a mix of long-term locals and new arrivals, usually white, who have money to drop and who drop it on different things from the old residents.
Restaurants hold a special sway. When the 71 Clinton team expanded to Alias (they kept the facade of the old Dominican restaurant they replaced), they managed to secure a rent lower than those of other new businesses, because of their track record on the street. Yet Hallivis charges residents upstairs higher rents than he charges the restaurant. "I'll tell you why," he says. "You need the new restaurants, and you need them to survive. You charge too much, they're going to flee, and then where is the neighborhood?" Hallivis also owns and runs the faded old jewelry store next door to Alias, with its foreboding walls of bulletproof glass -- relics from the bad drug days, when his mother was shot in there (she survived). He says the era of his sort of business is over. "Me, I'm a jeweler," he says. "I'm outdated." A few months ago, he asked the owners of 71 Clinton if they wanted to come in here and revamp the place, make it into another restaurant. "They said they'd think about it," he says. "That would be nice."
Yes, Clinton is hip for the moment, but it is as if two parallel worlds were co-existing. If you stand in the Z-Speed shoe store run by Josie Alvarez and her dad, Orlando, who are Dominicans, all the foot traffic sauntering slowly into the store is Hispanic. Shoes sell for $19.99 to $29.99. "I think maybe I should upgrade my merchandise," she says uncertainly.
Even the issue of traffic is a loaded one. When the direction changed in '94, many of the old shops protested. They felt the "quiet" imposed on them decimated their businesses. They were used to a different type of traffic, not the Town Cars from Manhattan but the buses from Brooklyn, and they lobbied for a change. In June, after bridge construction was finished, the traffic returned to its old pattern. Most of the Dominican merchants say that, though it is too early to tell, they haven't felt a difference, but everyone agrees the street is louder again.
To some degree, the changes on Clinton simply follow a larger narrative -- the historical flow of Manhattan's restless energy. Neighborhoods become hip for a while, then the energy moves on. And historically, that flow has drifted ever south and east. The path isn't unwavering -- the meatpacking district didn't revive until recently, and there are always various neighborhoods throughout the city undergoing rebirths (Smith Street, Williamsburg and so on) -- but Clinton was perfectly situated to meet the southern flow from the East Village and the eastward flow from SoHo. Still, that doesn't explain the full extent of Clinton Street's "discovery." Some of the new faces on the street are tourists who have read about the scene on Clinton -- the modern ritual of neighborhoods as tourist destinations. Dennis Cooleen sees a lot of them eating at 71 Clinton. He says it makes him feel that "New York has become almost like a resort town."
And if the Lower East Side has become a tourist destination, how long will Clinton Street last? Will it burn out like Ludlow? There are signs it may be on its way. There is talk that a W Hotel may be built on Rivington, just blocks from 71 Clinton. (Bring in the tourists!) Lotus Club has transformed in five years from a boho coffee shop to a loud bar/nightclub, replete with D.J.'s. Or, more subtly, consider the case of the buzzer: when Buket Hasman opened Mina in November 1999, she installed a buzzer to let customers in, she says, "for security reasons." The neighborhood was still a little scary, and she was often working alone. In September 2001, when Alife Rivington Club, a discreet designer sneaker store, opened a block and a half away, it installed a buzzer to instill an air of exclusivity. "We wanted it to be a destination store," says Sara Fisher, an associate. "And a lot of that is word of mouth. And the buzzer says that." Here you have the cycle of hipness: less than two years for a security device to become a fetish object.
But there are contrary signs that Clinton Street will continue to flourish. Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at N.Y.U., says he thinks Clinton Street and the rest of the Lower East Side "is going to continue for a very long time." He contrasts it to the model of SoHo, which he says is a victim of its own successes. "SoHo is the real tourist destination because they don't sell anything unique. It's a showcase for products that are available everywhere." Clinton, he says, will keep its edge "because of one thing: the character of the buildings. Since the buildings are all small, the businesses are always going to be driven by individual entrepreneurs. People will always seek that out." 
You can always ask the unofficial professor of the street, Dewey Dufresne. He notes that the activity on Clinton is bouncing toward Ludlow, starting on the side streets of Stanton and Rivington and moving west. "Yes, the revival is drifting back, making corrective measures," he says -- bringing more than just loud bars Ludlow's way. "Soon it'll all connect and be one great neighborhood."
So you listen to him when he tells you what he thinks the next new neighborhood might be. "The revival will move further south," he says, "making the great leap over Delancey Street that has always seemed impossible." And then he picks a winner. "I like Allen Street. South of Delancey, it's really got soul. These great old, underutilized buildings, open spaces. Allen's like a European street, with that great, green divider down the middle. You watch: people are going to start opening up new places down there. It's Chinatown, but it's not really," he says. "It's a blank slate."

HEADLINE: The Kid And His Council 

BYLINE:  By John Colapinto; John Colapinto, a contributing editor to Rolling Stone, is the author of "As Nature Made Him" and the novel "About the Author."

 BODY:
It's easy to underestimate Gifford Miller, the 32-year-old speaker of the New York City Council. Riding the elevator on a visit to Con Ed headquarters on Irving Place, Miller stands dwarfed between the two security agents who escort him everywhere. On the short side, with a baby face framed by jug ears, he looks like a boy on a school field trip -- an impression hardly softened by his account of an Abba concert he attended the night before on Coney Island. "It was, like, not really Abba," he says. "It was some of the original supporting band members and then, like, look-alikes -- which was better actually."
 The elevator doors open, and Miller is led to a boardroom with windows looking onto a large chamber known, since Sept. 11, when it became the focus of efforts to restore power to Lower Manhattan, as the War Room. Technicians tap at keyboards beneath large blinking maps and computer screens. 
 "Wow," Miller says. "Cool." 
As he is shaking hands with Lou Rana, vice president of Manhattan Electric Operations, the Con Ed department that oversees electricity distribution to the borough, something catches his attention in the War Room. 
"That's my district," Miller says, gesturing toward a map of the Upper East Side. "Something just happened on Roosevelt Island."
There's a sudden edge in his voice, an authority that erases all trace of the kid in him. Rana studies the map, then turns back to Miller. 
"They lost power for a second," Rana says. "Probably an overload in a circuit. Another one picked up the slack. That was totally transparent." 
Miller decodes the jargon instantly. "Meaning customers didn't notice?" 
"Exactly."
For the next hour, Miller repeatedly interrupts Rana's carefully taught Power Grid 101 seminar, peppering him with questions. He wants to know how quickly electricity moves through wires and how transformers step down 138,000 volts of electricity to the 120 volts that power a clock radio. You can see Miller's mind working to identify any wastefulness in the system. By the time he saunters back to the elevator with his security detail, you have the feeling that he has managed, in 60 minutes, to master the entire network that brings power to every home and business in the City of New York. 
But then, an understanding of the dynamics of power -- specifically political power -- has long been a special gift of Miller's. It's one factor in his amazingly swift rise to Council speaker, where as leader of the government's legislative branch, he is widely regarded as the second-most powerful elected official in New York, just below the mayor. The other factor has been Miller's singular talent for never appearing too hungry, too ambitious or too driven. Five years ago, as a rookie Democratic council member, he tended to be portrayed as an affable, if ineffectual, son of privilege -- basically a joke," in Miller's own phrase. But today, his colleagues in government are beginning to reassess practically everything about him. 
"I think he's keenly savvy politically," says James S. Oddo, a Republican councilman from Staten Island and the Council's minority leader. "I think he's relentless. And I think many an opponent will meet his or her Waterloo by underestimating Gifford Miller." Asked if the speaker is aware of the political advantage to being underestimated, Oddo chuckles. "He's too smart not to be aware of it."
That Miller has ambitions beyond the speakership is clear, given that he has already amassed more than $400,000 toward an "unspecified" political campaign he plans to undertake in 2005 -- which just happens to be when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg comes up for re-election. At first, Miller plays coy when asked about his desire to become mayor. "I'm a laid-back guy," he insists. But when pressed on the point, Miller finally drops his perennial boyishness and shows a little of the steeliness that lies beneath. "Look," he says, impatiently. "I believe in being prepared. I'm 32 years old. This is not the end of my career. I certainly intend to find exciting ways to contribute to a city I love. It's tough to go up from speaker. But I guess it's doable."
Miller grew up on Fifth Avenue and 98th Street, where the Upper East Side blends into East Harlem. The Miller family was steeped in politics. His father, Leigh, was a state department official in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. His mother, Lynden, is a widely respected designer of public gardens, having spearheaded an early-1980's restoration of the Conservatory Garden on Fifth Avenue and then gone on to design Wagner Park, Bryant Park and parts of the New York Botanical Garden. Both his parents served on Community Board 11 in East Harlem when Miller was growing up, and he credits his parents' intense community involvement with having instilled in him a spirit of enthusiasm about public service and a deep love for New York City. 
But if Miller harbored an early yen for elected office, he kept it well hidden. At his prep school, St. Bernard's, on the Upper East Side, he evinced little interest in current events. "I didn't read the paper cover to cover as a kid," he says. "I read the sports pages." He did, however, make a foray into politics at Middlesex, the elite boarding school that he attended in Concord, Mass., with his younger brother, Marshall, who is now an assistant United States attorney. "He did run for president of the school," Marshall says. "But he lost miserably."
Miller studied political science at Princeton, but by all accounts he was not drawn to student government. In his senior year, he began dating Pamela Addison (who would later become his wife and the mother of their two children, Addison, who is 22 months old, and Marshall, who is 5 months old). She says that at Princeton, Miller had no clear plans beyond graduation -- and certainly none for elected office. "There are always those people in college who you're pretty sure are already running for president of the United States," she says. "That absolutely wasn't Gifford." 
Indeed, upon his graduation in 1992, Miller demonstrated every symptom of a young man adrift. He traveled briefly, then his mother helped get him a job with the Parks Department. But that fall, Bill Clinton was elected president, ending the Republican reign that had begun with Ronald Reagan's election 12 years earlier. Miller's leanings were always liberal, and coming of age in the 1980's had been, Miller says, frustrating. "I was no fan of Ronald Reagan," he says. "There is a certain politics of greed that I reject." Miller was galvanized by Clinton's victory. "One of the things I admire about him was that he made a real effort to try to lift people up with things like the earned-income tax credit. And when he won, I thought I'd go to Washington and try to work for him, get a job doing whatever." 
He drove down to Washington to hunt up a job. He failed to find one, but shortly after his return to New York, Miller was hired as an aide to Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat newly elected to Congress. Formerly a city councilwoman from the Millers' district, Maloney was close with Miller's parents: she had appointed them to the local community board, and they had contributed money to her Congressional campaign. Hired to answer mail and phones for Maloney, he rose swiftly to become her chief of staff. 
"As soon as he got involved in politics," his wife says, "he quickly became enamored with it. Gifford got me so excited about Clinton's first budget reconciliation that I just assumed it was national news, that everyone in the country was sitting on the edge of their seats wondering what would happen. We stayed up until 3 in the morning watching the vote, and I called my mother the next day and she had no idea what I was talking about. So he was very infectious even at that stage." 
Miller served for three years with Maloney, then decided to make his own first foray into electoral politics. Charles Millard, the Republican city councilman for an Upper East Side district, had left in the middle of his term to take a job in the Giuliani administration, thus opening up his seat for a special midterm election. Miller decided to try for it. It was 1995, and he was just 26. 
Miller threw himself into his first election campaign like a man on a tight deadline to succeed. That December, despite record snowfalls that paralyzed the city, Miller and a small army of volunteers campaigned in the streets for 12 straight days, collecting some 7,000 signatures, more than seven times the number necessary to get on the ballot. "He'd get up at 7 a.m. and work till midnight," says Eva Moskowitz, a former college professor who acted as Miller's field coordinator for that election and who is today a councilwoman and Miller's appointee as chairwoman of the Education Committee. Pamela Miller saw a side of her husband that she never suspected existed. "Here's this guy whom most people at Princeton might describe as kind of shy, certainly somewhat insular, who turns out to be literally the most effective street campaigner," she says. "It's the strangest thing. He absolutely loves it, will spend 12 hours a day on the street. It was just weird." 
Miller's combination of brains, relentless campaigning and easy charm paid off: he beat his Republican opponent, Judith Marcus (a veteran of East Side politics), thus becoming the youngest member of the city's Legislature elected up to that time. Ten months later he handily defended his Council seat in a November 1996 election. 
If Miller owes his meteoric rise, in part, to tireless hard work, he has also had generous doses of pure luck. In 1993, a citywide referendum established term limits for council members, holding them to two consecutive four-year terms. As a result of this, 38 of Miller's fellow council members were slated to be swept from office in 2001 -- including Speaker Peter F. Vallone. Improbable as it seemed, this would leave Miller, at 32 and with only six years of experience in the Council, as the legislature's senior elected official and its most seasoned member, and thus a not wholly unlikely front-running candidate for speaker in 2002. 
Typically, many council members and pundits didn't give Miller much of a chance. "Gifford works extremely hard, but he's got a lot to learn," one council member told the Times in 1997. "I can't quite imagine him as speaker." For his own part, Miller treated the talk of his becoming speaker as a joke. "Believe it or not," he said at the time, "I have a strong sense of my own irrelevance." Privately, however, he was hatching a strategy to seize his once-in-a-lifetime chance to snag the Council's top spot. Today, he admits that his eyes were on the speakership all along. "Why would you run for City Council and not want to be the speaker?" he says. 
Recognizing that the leader of the city's legislative body should have some legal training, Miller quickly enrolled in Fordham University's night law school. Then he got to work trying to minimize the biggest perceived liability he faced in his plan to become speaker: his background of privilege on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The Council speaker is elected not by the public but by fellow council members -- many of whom hail from districts with a healthy skepticism toward Ivy League prepsters from the Silk Stocking district. 
"Everybody was saying, 'A white guy from Manhattan can never win,"' recalls Moskowitz, who also worked on Miller's speakership bid. "It's not going to happen."' But Miller had a plan. He would, he decided, in the two years leading up to the vote, travel to all of the other 50 districts. He would meet and get to know the Council candidates in each district; he would decide which one looked like a winner; and then he would offer his services as a campaigner, money-raiser and supporter to get that person elected. Nothing like it had ever been tried before. "For every one person who said, 'This is a great idea,"' recalls Christine Quinn, a councilwoman from Manhattan and one of Miller's closest allies, "25 said: 'This is a terrible idea. It's unorthodox; you're going to make people mad by going into their district. For however many winners you support, you'll support losers."' But Miller stuck to the plan, and in 1999 he embarked on two years of ceaseless campaigning in every corner of the city, in all weather, at all times of day. The strategy proved almost diabolical in its multileveled effectiveness: Miller got to know the whole city; he proved that he was not a politician confined, geographically and ideologically, to the Upper East Side; and he also made those council members whom he helped elect subtly indebted to him. In early 2002, the newly elected Council voted for a new speaker. Several members initially ran for the job but ultimately wound up supporting Miller, who won in a unanimous vote, 51 to 0. 
Little wonder that today, when you ask Miller's fellow council members for their chief impression of him, their answers invariably echo that of Charles Barron, the former Black Panther who is today a councilman from Brooklyn and one of those for whom Miller campaigned. "He is a very clever politician," Barron says. 
As speaker, Gifford Miller's first duty is to lead the 51-member Council, each member of which represents the interests of constituents spread out over the city's five unruly boroughs. "New York City is a jungle of interest groups," says Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant who is working on H. Carl McCall's gubernatorial campaign. "Miller has to mediate all this. How does he do it? Well, you need a psychoanalytically healthy guy and an iron-willed political leader." So far, Sheinkopf says, Miller has shown himself to be up to the task on both counts. "He's somebody who understands power, and he has exercised it well." 
Albert Vann, a councilman from Brooklyn who ran against Miller for the speakership, says: "I get the impression that he tries to lead with as much consensus as is possible. I think members have an opportunity on the major, critical, controversial issues to be heard and to shape what the Council position will be in large measure. The speaker always has power and discretion, but this speaker, in comparison to Vallone before him, is much more open and responsive to the concerns and positions of the members." Councilman Bill Perkins, who represents a district in Central Harlem, also ran against Miller for speaker, and he has made no secret of his wish that the speakership be held by a person of color; he has nevertheless become a supporter of Miller. "Reaching out to people, speaking to them, assuring them that you're the kind of person that can fulfill their needs: he did that," Perkins says. That Miller has been so effective at winning the loyalty and support of members who differ so markedly in background from him has made for Miller an unexpectedly frictionless ride in his first eight months as speaker. But charming and cajoling council members is not Miller's sole challenge as speaker. He also has to deal with the mayor, and there things have been running a little less smoothly. 
As leader of the Legislature, the speaker heads the body that counterbalances the mayor's powers. It's the Council, not the mayor, that passes new laws; it's the Council, not the mayor, that has final say over the city budget. Even mayoral vetoes of Council initiatives can be overridden by the Council if the speaker can muster a two-thirds majority. It's a structure that virtually guarantees that the speaker and mayor will eventually find themselves at loggerheads. Tensions have already begun to show up in Miller and Bloomberg's relationship -- largely because of what some perceive as the mayor's tendency to discount Miller's importance in the governing of the city. In the annual Inner Circle press lampoon of city politics, Miller was played onstage by the prepubescent son of one of the mayor's staff members -- a joke that some saw as a true dis. "He's not the little kid prancing around the stage as portrayed by the mayor," the veteran political consultant George Arzt says. "His pleasant exterior belies the fact that he's a tenacious campaigner and a real fighter."
More concrete evidence of the mayor's apparent lack of respect for Miller occurred in August when Bloomberg, usurping the Council's role as lawmaker, announced his own antismoking bill that would outlaw tobacco use in any public place, including bars. Bloomberg deeply discomforted Miller when he later told reporters that he had extracted a private promise from the speaker to pass the legislation without delay -- a characterization that made Miller sound like little more than the mayor's puppet; it was a gambit all the more galling for Miller, since he insists that no such private deal was ever struck. 
Just days after the smoking fracas, the strain between Miller and Bloomberg was ratcheted up when Bloomberg vetoed the Council's proposed fix to the term-limits law -- an adjustment that does not change the underlying law but rather addresses a quirk that holds some members (Miller among them) to only six years in office instead of the mandated eight. Even those inclined to see the new legislation as a self-serving initiative have conceded that the existing law was flawed. Nevertheless, the mayor vetoed the bill, despite Miller's having the necessary two-thirds majority of council members needed to override it. Many saw the mayor's act as a needless provocation of Miller and the Council. "By doing that," Ed Koch, the former mayor, says, "Bloomberg risks losing the close cooperation that he's had from the Council to date. It's in a mayor's interest to work with the speaker. I went out of my way to work with Speaker Peter Vallone and, before him, Tom Cuite, to include them and give them credit for my initiatives."
For his part, Miller, ever the savvy politician, refuses to stoke the fires of controversy over the mayor's actions, insisting in the mildest of tones that he gets along well with "Mike" and that a continued spirit of cooperation is crucial to solving the many crises faced by the city. Inherent, however, in Miller's unruffled response is the sense that with his finely tuned political instincts, Miller had sussed out that churning anti-Bloomberg sentiment was unnecessary. Sure enough, within days, newspapers were announcing that Bloomberg's political "honeymoon" was over, citing the frictions he created with the City Council. Miller contented himself with just one small comment, an observation about Bloomberg that is artful not only in its understatement but also in its turning of the tables. Saying that he forgives Bloomberg his gaffes on the smoking bill and term-limits veto, Miller adds: "He's just not that experienced yet. He's not a pro."
Yet despite the strain between them, Miller and Bloomberg display far greater affinities with each other than they do differences. Both are classic technocrats: Bloomberg is a man who changed political parties in order to win the mayoralty; Miller is a man who describes himself ideologically as smack-dab in the acceptable middle. Miller has consistently championed such progressive causes as gay and lesbian rights. (He recently introduced a bill requiring the city to recognize out-of-state same-sex unions as domestic partnerships.) At the same time, he has done nothing to frighten or disenfranchise the all-important business elite. Times were that an ambitious New York City politician could not get away with quite so Clintonian a political triangulation and hope to prosper. But Miller says that the days of fierce left- and right-wing struggles for the hearts of New Yorkers are gone. "In New York City these days," he says, "a lot of the old debates are not as useful in breaking down the current situation." 
When Miller set out on his campaign for the speakership in 1999, it was during a period of unprecedented economic growth, and one that conferred on New York City an extraordinary period of stability and prosperity. In the wake of the World Trade Center attack, and with the ongoing national recession tipping New York's economy into a crisis reminiscent of the 1970's, the city's outlook has changed drastically. Having run for one job, Miller has ended up with quite another. 
"I thought I'd be going to more ribbon-cuttings than I'll be going to," as he dryly puts it. "It's a different challenge, but for me it's a greater challenge. You go into public service because you want to make a contribution. At least, I did. And I think the opportunity to make a contribution now is greater than ever. Think back to Felix Rohatyn and some of the architects who got us through the last crisis. Governor Carey. I'm going to have a chance to be remembered as somebody who helped, or" -- he laughs -- "somebody who hurt." The joke is typical of Miller, who relies on self-deprecation and irony as favorite tactics for not sounding like a wooden politician. But beneath the constant good cheer, Miller does his share of worrying about piloting the Council through such perilous times. "I know he's churning underneath," says his wife, Pamela. "He's gone down two waist sizes since taking on the job."
Miller admits: "In the middle of the night, when I think about the fact that we have a $5billion budget gap and that we're going to have to raise taxes and cut spending in ways that I really don't think people have gotten their minds around yet, it seems really frightening." By all accounts, Miller has every reason to be frightened. In the increasingly Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest climate that many (including Miller) are predicting for New York, his job as speaker can only grow more difficult. The current collegial mood within the City Council could grow frayed as members fight to protect funds and services for their respective districts. "It's going to be tough," Hank Sheinkopf says. "His job is to protect his council members who provide services to people -- and those will be cut." Sheinkopf further predicts that in such an event, the already strained relationship between Miller and Bloomberg could sharply deteriorate as speaker and mayor use each other as political scapegoats. "They have to have an enemy to explain why the services aren't there." 
Given these looming problems, it's far too early to handicap Miller's chances for becoming mayor in 2005. Nevertheless, Miller seems to have a good shot at becoming, at 36, the second-youngest mayor in the city's history. "The people who dismiss him and think that that's not a reality," Councilman Oddo says, "I think they're playing into the man's hands." But others remain skeptical that Miller can negotiate the difficult journey from the Council speaker's office in the East Wing of City Hall to the mayor's office in the West Wing. Councilman Barron points out that that trip, though short physically, is strewn with booby traps and land mines -- even for as skilled a politician as Gifford Miller. 
"He's moving real fast," Barron says. "But in New York City politics, there are so many forces that pull on you. You've got county leaders, you've got a mayor, you've got real-estate interests, you've got the banking interests. I think up till now he has been playing it fairly well, but at some point, he's going to reach a critical juncture where it's not going to be about playing all the sides. It's going to be about taking some tough stances. And then we'll see what Gifford Miller is really made of."

HEADLINE: The De Facto Capital 

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich; Frank Rich is a Times columnist and a senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
They got it right the first time. New York was the capital of the nation at its birth. The first presidential inauguration, in 1789, wasn't far from ground zero, and the first presidential residence, at 3 Cherry Street, was on a spot now occupied by one of the supports for the Brooklyn Bridge. George Washington slept there, but not for long. In a political deal purportedly made on a downtown sidewalk, Alexander Hamilton traded away the location of the capital to Thomas Jefferson to entice the South to give the federal government power to assume state debts. A year later, Congress and the president decamped to Philadelphia, and a decade after that, they settled into a new federal city next to which the City of Brotherly Love seems like Shangri-La. As Jack Lait and Lee Mortimer, two New York tabloid reporters of a later day, would assess the fateful final choice of a national capital in their 1951 best seller, "Washington Confidential": "The founding fathers, whose infinite wisdom gave us a Constitution and form of government well nigh perfect, located the seat of that government in a stinking, steaming swamp." 
 The country's seat may still be mired in that swamp, but its heart, soul and brains are more evident than ever in its first capital, 200 miles to the north. While New York has long been the nation's center of culture, finance, fashion and media, the city in the aftermath of Sept. 11 cohered into something more than the sum of its perennially celebrated parts. After its highest towers were taken down, New York rose from its initial shock to illustrate in real time what America actually is, a huge and resilient democracy animated by citizens of every conceivable stripe, pursuit and ethic (from those who gave their lives for others at the World Trade Center to those who looted its shopping mall). Instead of seeming, as it often had, like an eccentric island adrift from the rest of the country, the city found itself valued instead as a concentrated representation of the whole. That outsiders would regard it as the true American capital was proof that Americans now define themselves far more by their cultural choices, most of which are tweaked and marketed by the information factories of Manhattan, than by their choice (if any) of political party. Not that New York is shy about offering political leadership if it spots a vacuum. When the White House's occupant was nowhere to be found on the day the country needed him most, New York went so far as to offer up its own chief executive as the nation's paterfamilias. America is still grateful. 
 Even at the literal level, New York is more representative of American political values than the official capital. Washington, where I grew up and where my family has lived since the Civil War, is still a colony where the voters are denied the full rights of self-determination. Its citizens and public officials alike remain in thrall to a federal government over which they have virtually no say, in the shadow of a president who serves as the de facto prince regent of the tourist precincts, the only part of the city most Americans see. Washington is less an exemplar of democracy than an agglomeration of marble facades paying unctuous tribute to that aspiration. George W. Bush, and he is hardly the first president to do so, treats it as a politically obligatory diorama that he can flee any and every chance he gets.
New York doesn't think of itself as competing with Washington -- the same cannot be said of the reverse -- but periodically it does so, if only to let the world know who's really boss. After World War II, suburban Virginia tried to lure the fledgling United Nations to metropolitan Washington, until someone belatedly realized that an international citizenry would not take kindly to segregated schools. In 1959, the Washington Board of Trade mounted an elaborate campaign to make the "Capital of the Free World" the site of the 1964 World's Fair. According to one account, the D.C. advocates' hard sell leaned heavily on the annual cherry-blossom festivals, the "colorful parades constantly held when distinguished foreign guests visit the city" and "the elaborate and dignified presidential inauguration celebrations." That was all it took to persuade the World's Fair Commission to reach unanimity in awarding the plum to Robert Moses's posse from New York. 
This year brought the Olympics bake-off. To increase its odds as a site for the 2012 summer games, Washington entered into a shotgun marriage with the more plausibly urban Baltimore. The capital's confidence was such that it took for granted a Washington Post report in July that D.C. and San Francisco were "the apparent front-runners," beating out New York and Houston. The next month brought the shocking news that it was Washington that had been eliminated along with Houston (the only other city that can match both its toxic summer weather and complement of former Enron executives). After this defeat, there was much local muttering that "politics" was the culprit and that Washington might have been punished because of the unpopularity abroad of the incipient war on Iraq. 
How much easier for Washingtonians to blame Saddam than to take a hard look at their own city. D.C. may have talked a good game about sports to the U.S. Olympic Committee, but for three decades it has lacked a major-league team in the most American sport of them all. It purports to be as up to date as the new economy, but the signature digital-era companies to put down roots there, AOL and MicroStrategy, are synonymous with the dot-com bust. The capital's Maryland and Virginia suburban enclaves are famous for having some of the country's most over-the-top houses as measured by square footage but none of the most imaginative architecture.
Such is Washington's appeal to tourists that it did not make the list of the Top 10 North American cities in this year's Travel and Leisure magazine readers' poll. (New York came in first.) The capital's restaurants can't compete with those of Vegas, let alone New York, Chicago and the Seattle-to-Los Angeles culinary axis of the West. Its taxicabs have a suspect fee structure as gerrymandered as the map of Congressional voting districts. While New York has contributed to the American language such joyous words as "whoopee" and "hot dog," Washington has coined "inside the Beltway" and "Department of Homeland Security." America's songwriters and poets have repeatedly celebrated Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too -- not to mention San Francisco, Chicago and St. Louis -- but where is that romantic lyric about the capital? "Hail to the Redskins" will have to do. 
First appearances can be deceptive to new visitors to D.C. Edmund Wilson once observed that Washington, "after other American cities, seems at first such a relief, so agreeable," but "turns out, when one has stayed there any length of time, to have little personality of its own and to come to taste rather flat." Or as Cindy Adams wrote this year: "Even folks who live in Washington don't want to be there. The high point for a visitor? Catching a glimpse of Trent Lott in Person? I mean, please."
By contrast, you have to pry people away from New York. The gaping wound only deepened the citizenry's already intimate connection to their city. In the poignant opening episode of the post-9/11 season of "Sex and the City," Carrie went so far as to choose the city over sex, spurning the advances of a Fleet Week sailor after he committed the sin of knocking her town. It was the patriotic thing to do. 
New Yorkers who were out of town on 9/11 felt desperate to return. Since then, we seem inexorably drawn to the watering holes and restaurants and merchants downtown, as if to fill in the shadow of death with the lubricious glow and laughter of irrepressible life. We are more aware of our neighbors than before: not just the firemen and the cops and the family that lost someone, but the guy who lost his business in the undertow, the guy who is trying to rebuild, the all-American Sikh cabbie who bedecks his windshield with flags lest he be victimized (as in New York he has generally not been) by guilt-by-turban. The fate of ground zero is, inevitably, a noisy political and aesthetic debate, but whatever acrimony may attend it, it is also a classic American project: a battle between money and values, between commerce and art, between powerful interests and upstart citizenry, between past and future, all staged on an open 16-acre expanse that is urban America's largest frontier. 
Not only were the dire predictions of a mass exodus wrong, but the reverse may be happening. A New York Times/CBS News poll in August found that the number of inhabitants who think that New York will be a better place to live in 10 or 15 years is the same as it was the month before the attack. Manhattan's residential real-estate values were clocked this summer at 15 percent higher than they had been pre-Sept. 11; signed contracts on apartments were up this July over last, too, reflecting the possibility that more people are arriving than leaving, even during an economic downturn. Neighborhoods reinvent themselves faster than anyone can keep count, from Harlem to the Lower East Side. Queens, generally an also-ran in any five-borough hipness sweepstakes, shows signs of becoming the new Brooklyn (though it still lacks its own Zagat). The Museum of Modern Art lives in Queens now, and so do a disproportionate number of artists, writers, dancers and musicians -- including the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, who is only the latest in a long list of Washington-spawned talents (from Duke Ellington to Paul Taylor) who fled the capital's culturally parched environment to reach full bloom in the enriching concrete of New York.
In Washington, there is far more culture than there used to be, but spectacle, in keeping with the town's own bombastic aesthetics, tends to be the hottest ticket -- blockbuster shows at the National Gallery, Disney musicals and the Bolshoi on tour. Cities as small as Minneapolis and Seattle have a more lively indigenous arts scene than Washington. The plight of culture in the capital is symbolized by the Kennedy Center, an afterthought not even deemed worthy of its own stop on the city's part-time Metro system. A world-class impresario, Michael Kaiser, has at last been imported to revive the place, and this summer he performed a Heimlich maneuver in the form of the well-received Sondheim Celebration. But half the weekend audience was New Yorkers, to whom Kaiser may have to continue to cater. The low-slung performing arts barn on the Potomac has for so long been isolated from the best American culture, high, middle and pop, that its annual low-rated televised honors have of late been reduced to bestowing some of their medallions on Brits rather than native genius. (This year's Kennedy Center knight, Paul McCartney, has taken a rain check.) Such is President Bush's respect for the capital's temple of culture that among his first appointments to its board was Bo Derek. 
With the exception of the B-list Hollywood names who get all dressed up (once, anyway) for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, artists turn up in the city en masse only when Congress is posturing about the arts and humanities endowments. As for what American pop culture thinks of Washington as a city, as opposed to a government, one need only look at "Minority Report," in which the capital's defining trait, even years in the future, is its historically high crime rate. The movie's point seems to be that nothing short of the ability to arrest suspects before they commit a crime would have enabled D.C.'s benighted police force to crack a case like Chandra Levy's. 
New York is hardly without crime, but it also has the positive side of urban friction: the manifest humanity that results when millions of people of all kinds are packed together to make a go of it. The fundamental DNA of the city has never changed. It has always been a gateway for immigrants as well as an arena for big money. Its crowds have been large and raucous from the start. That "culture of congestion," in the phrase of the architect Rem Koolhaas, leads to a nonstop chain reaction of serendipitous human fusion, creative and sexual and economic, that is as American as you can get. The byproducts include hyphenated talents, melting-pot families, a constant, bubbling hands-on laboratory for social, political and cultural change in which the experiments alternately succeed big and fail catastrophically, in full public view. 
At some point, Washington had its own dreams of being a sizzling capital. In "Political Terrain," Carl Abbott writes of how in the late 19th century it was still hoped that D.C. "could aspire to be the Rome of America in the arts, the Berlin of America in education and the Paris of America as a city of beauty and pleasure." But the city stood still while those roles were respectively claimed by New York, Boston and San Francisco. (Though George Washington had offered to help endow a major university for the new capital, few of its grandees seconded his enthusiasm.) Despite early hopes that the federal district might be an economic hub, it was as hard for capitalism to take root as culture. As Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace write in "Gotham," it became apparent early in the 19th century that the United States "would have two centers, one governmental, the other economic." It was a "separation of powers as emphatic as anything in the Constitution" with "no parallel in the Western world." The American capital that emerged was, in John Kennedy's famous formulation, a city of "southern efficiency and northern charm" -- a rare point of agreement between him and Richard Nixon, who pronounced Washington "a city without identity" and voted with his feet to spend most of his political exile in New York prior to his 1968 comeback. 
If Washington has an indistinct identity, it does have its own DNA -- that of a town of transients. When legislative sessions were far briefer than they are now, Congress and the Supreme Court took residence in temporary quarters, then fled to better climes (as they still do when in recess). "The greatest and most respectable business that is done in Washington is keeping boarding houses," said an 1829 handbook for new arrivals. It wasn't until well into the 20th century, as the federal government expanded during the New Deal (with its hefty infusion of F.D.R. New Yorkers) and World War II, that the city's population did as well. By then it had long since missed out on the great wave of turn-of-the-century immigration that gave New York and every other East Coast metropolis their human and cultural variety. Even now, the capital lacks the ethnic spectrum of other major American cities. In the 2000 census, the Asian population of New York -- almost 10 percent of the city's eight million inhabitants -- was substantially larger than the entire population of D.C., where the Asian population is only 2.6 percent. Though the number of Hispanics is rising in Washington as elsewhere, in 2000 they still made up, at most, 9 percent of the city, as opposed to a quarter of New York. 
When the W.P.A. assembled its guidebook to the capital during the Depression, the authors seemed almost desperate to imbue their subject with distinction. One wistful accolade paid tribute to the city's "profusion of shade trees." When the book was revised in 1942, the district's most distinctive aspect was played down -- the references to the second-class citizenship of its black residents, who like all Washingtonians had no right to vote, even in presidential elections, but who also continued to suffer many of the deprivations of slavery, from discrimination to poor public health and schools. In a 1983 reissue, a new editor set the record straight, but noted as compensation that "it is easier to find one's bearings in Washington than in other American cities." (So true, and so what?)
Though opponents of full home rule for the District then and now can give all sorts of highfalutin constitutional arguments for their position, the perennial sub rosa reason for its substatus remains the same as it was before anyone had heard of Marion Barry's coke bust or of the hapless current mayor, Anthony Williams, whose fraudulent nominating petitions contained "signatures" from New York celebrities like Martha Stewart and Billy Joel. In 1965, Washington became the first major American city in which blacks outnumbered whites by more than 10 percent. Given the Republican Party's inability to attract large numbers of black voters, it has hardly been in any rush to empower more of them at the price of likely handing the Democrats two voting seats in the Senate and one in the House.
The only time the capital's residents had true self-rule was during a short-lived biracial governance experiment during Reconstruction, soon ended by white resistance. Though Washingtonians can now vote for president (since 1961), they have but a single nonvoting member of Congress. Under their limited form of home rule, in place only since the early 1970's, the City Council, the mayor, the budget and even citizen-passed ballot initiatives can all be overruled by congressmen from states whose constituents' firsthand knowledge of the capital may be limited to the compulsory school trip. It could be argued that nowhere in the country is the plantation mentality still more embedded in civic life than in an African-American city whose citizens lack the full rights of citizenship, even as their Army National Guard units are called on active duty for the war on terrorism. This antediluvian, or at least antebellum, state of affairs makes D.C. a strikingly anachronistic capital of America in the 21st century, whatever its validity as a capital before the passage of the 13th Amendment. Indeed, America's capital has less democratic autonomy than President Bush this year demanded of the Palestinians.
Whatever Washington lacks in actual democracy, it makes up, of course, in monuments. But what represents the spirit of modern America more than the Statue of Liberty? The view of Lait and Mortimer, Washington's churlish chroniclers of the 1950's, still holds. They likened the city's tourist appeal to that of Hollywood's Forest Lawn cemetery, where busloads of Americans come to visit the movie stars' graves. "Its gleaming public buildings of white marble are like so many mausoleums," they wrote. "Where it doesn't look like a cemetery it resembles a movie set. It has a feel of unreality." But if politics is show business for ugly people, as the old joke has it, you can't push the Hollywood analogy too far. "Washington is dominated by elected and appointed functionaries who are schooled to believe they must never be caught having fun," Lait and Mortimer wrote. "Therefore, after dark, it is more like Paducah than Paris." Unlike New York, which has winked at mayoral girlfriends from Jimmy Walker's to Rudolph Giuliani's (and doesn't care where its current bachelor mayor spends his weekends), Washington was the last to discover John Kennedy's sex life and is still as open-mouthed as an Edvard Munch screamer when contemplating Bill Clinton's. 
Washington's idea of a Hollywood sex symbol is a cast member in "The West Wing" -- no matter whom -- because what could be more erotic than a powerful government bureaucrat? The city's idea of an intellectual is a Sunday-morning talking head; its literary apotheosis is the trade journal. Its loudest academic posturing emanates from the so-called university without students, the think tank, invented by the Brookings Institution in 1927 and a major Washington growth industry since the 1970's. The think tanks' tenured "professors," with grandiose titles that might have been lifted from the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup," are often out-of-office ideologues with more position papers than books to their credit. Only in this heady environment could William Bennett be mistaken for Harold Bloom and CNN's "Capital Gang" for the Algonquin Round Table. Unlike decision makers in other capitals, Washington's power elite don't routinely commingle with top-rung scholars, scientists, novelists, artists and musicians who might broaden their thinking beyond the parameters set by the city's army of lobbyists and single-issue advocates. 
Though Washington suffered its own grievous wound on Sept. 11, it remains as insular as it was before the attack. As the country's official capital, it is to New York as Ankara is to Istanbul, Canberra is to Sydney, Brasilia is to Rio. Strolling through downtown and past the alabaster public buildings on a beautiful afternoon, you find that the sparse pedestrian traffic is often limited to government workers in cookie-cutter garb and cadres of tourists hoping to find some semblance of urban brio after having had their fill of the National Air and Space Museum. (They'd be better advised to hightail it to the city's black or gay enclaves or even the suburbs.) 
Take a similar walk through the central commercial districts of New York, whatever the borough, and you'll find not just animated sidewalks packed with locals but also signs of a city in perpetual renewal, pursuing creation and demolition with equal abandon, always testing the limits. That hope, that drive, that hunger to keep moving no matter what, is America at its highest throttle. Should the Olympians come to the true capital, they won't automatically own the town, as they would if they had landed in Washington. In New York, they'll find that no sooner do the games begin than they are locked into the even tougher competition of winning the city's favor, just like every other newcomer who has ever come here with dreams of going for the gold.

HEADLINE: A Lesson in Unintended Consequences 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, has written often about education.

 BODY:
For much of 1968, J.H.S. 271, a junior high school in the impoverished central Brooklyn neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, served as the command center for one of the great, agonizing racial psychodramas in New York history. It was from here that a "planning council" of activists and parents ran the local schools in an experiment, financed by the Ford Foundation, in "community control." The premise of community control was that ghetto children were failing in school, not because of the terrible problems of inner-city life but because of neglect, even hostility, from the system's overwhelmingly white teachers and administrators. Community control, or, as it came to be known, decentralization, would empower those who cared most about the children -- parents, elders, neighborhood leaders -- to guide their education.
 It was not an absurd premise, but it was probably inevitable, at that turbulent moment, that community control played itself out in strictly racial terms. The planning council -- that is, the newly established local school board -- sent dismissal letters to 19 teachers and administrators, all but one of them white and Jewish. The teachers' union responded by going out on strike; a judge forced the local board to take back the teachers; and soon young men wearing Black Panther berets and bandoliers were terrorizing the teachers on the steps of J.H.S. 271 while police officers and demonstrators were fighting pitched battles in front of the school on Herkimer Street. 
 Black activists and their supporters demanded community control for the entire system, citywide. And with the threat of riots hanging over the city, their demands could not be resisted. In 1969, the New York State Legislature rewrote the law governing the city's schools, granting virtually total control over elementary and middle schools to local school boards. (High schools were kept under central administration.) Overnight, the New York City education system was turned upside down. 
Today, the school, which is now called I.S. 271, still stands on Herkimer Street -- a long, low, grim building protected from the street by hurricane fencing, though whether the fencing is designed to keep students in or intruders out isn't clear. A poster in the main hallway features photos of students with the all-too-telling caption, "Graduates Who Rose Above the Ruins." It is the ruins that the visitor is likely to notice. In 2001, 13.5 percent of the school's eighth graders passed the state math test. This past summer, the building was filled with children assigned to summer school after having failed classes during the year. The school's interim principal until the fall term, JoAnne Finkel, admitted that many of her eighth graders will be forced to repeat the grade, though she observed with no little relief that most of the overage kids will be sent somewhere else. 
It is safe to say that whatever effect decentralization had on the school and on Ocean Hill-Brownsville, and on poor communities throughout New York, was negative. Among all the experiments forced on a reluctant city by the turmoil of the 60's, community control was arguably the most harmful. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried, and failed, to eliminate decentralization. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg tried again -- and succeeded. Earlier this year, the State Legislature undid community control, placed the independent citywide Board of Education, which ran the system, under the mayor's control and scheduled the demise of the local boards for the end of the current school year. This is widely considered the greatest legislative achievement of Bloomberg's first year in office.
Until next June, however, the local board of Ocean Hill-Brownsville -- District 23, in the system's parlance -- is still meeting and still making life difficult for Dr. Kathleen Cashin, the talented and dedicated woman who serves as the district superintendent. In short, it's a little premature for an autopsy. Nevertheless, as this 30-odd-year experiment breathes its last, it is worth understanding how community control operated in practice in the place where it was born, whether its failure was preordained and exactly what the role of local communities is in education. And as New York finally makes straight the labyrinthine ways of its school system, it is worth asking whether governance has anything at all to do with the real problems of the schools in places like Ocean Hill-Brownsville. 
"Community" was a word to conjure with in the 1960's. As far back as 1963, the Kennedy administration began toying with the idea of "community action" in hard-hit areas, and L.B.J. soon made it the centerpiece of the War on Poverty. Entire programs, notably including Head Start, were designed to be run by the beneficiaries themselves. As Nicholas Lemann writes in "The Promised Land," a history of the black migration to the North, "community action's rhetoric of empowerment fit perfectly with the idea that ghetto society was not in any way weak or flawed or in need of middle-class outsiders to take it by the hand." The "community" needed only political power to effect its own transformation. And this was precisely the rhetoric of both the local activists in the decentralization struggle and the Ford Foundation, which represented the world of elite opinion. The problem "is not with the learner," the Ford Foundation official who supervised the community-control experiment wrote at the time. "It is with the institution." 
The general distrust of bureaucracies and the belief in the self-sufficiency of communities merged with a larger crisis of faith in education. Many of the educational critics of the 1960's, including Herbert Kohl and John Holt, were less interested in the schools' effectiveness than in the power structure that they felt the schools reflected and reinforced; perhaps "effectiveness" was itself an instrument of middle-class authority. And so while it may seem obvious in retrospect that decentralization was a political solution to an educational problem, the debate took place at a time when all great issues were understood as being fundamentally political in nature. 
And then politics took its revenge. In "The Great School Wars," the educational historian Diane Ravitch quotes an expert in school management as testifying at the time that the plan "has built-in political patronage, it has built-in inefficiency and squandering of public funds in procurement of construction, it has built-in destruction of a merit system." The decentralization law gave local boards throughout the city control over tens of millions of dollars (a figure that has reached more than $100 million today); and it gave them control over the hiring and firing of principals, assistant principals, innumerable low-level employees and the district's own superintendent. Especially in poor communities, with high rates of unemployment, this was a jackpot of incalculable size. And so, inevitably, local politicians came to see the school board in exactly the same way that the sachems of Tammany Hall viewed municipal government in the days before the Civil Service exam -- as a giant patronage mill.
The struggle over community control had attracted at least as many dedicated idealists to Ocean Hill-Brownsville as it had troublemakers. But the reality principle asserted itself as soon as the new law came into force. The first local board president was Assemblyman Sam Wright, the neighborhood strongman. Wright controlled the board in a loose alliance with the teachers' union, which had fought decentralization every step of the way. The Rev. John Powis, the "worker priest" who helped lead the fight for community control, watched in dismay as Wright's forces brought in as the first superintendent Nellie Duncan, whom Powis recalls as "a nice woman from Bed-Stuy" -- the adjoining black neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant -- but not a great educator." Wright was kicked off the board when he was convicted of soliciting $5,000 from an educational-materials company, but his allies remained in control.
The pattern was set: local satraps fought for control of the board -- usually through proxies running on "slates" -- and then used majority power to distribute patronage and install a compliant superintendent. In 1978, a slate loyal to Representative Major Owens captured the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board. One of the winners was Martha Rodriguez-Torres, a young teacher whose mother had been a local activist and Owens supporter. Torres is now the principal of one of District 23's most successful schools, but at the time she was, she acknowledges, an operative. "You commit to a particular platform," Torres explains, "and sometimes you don't even ask questions." I asked what her slate's platform had been. "The major item was getting rid of the superintendent," Torres recalled blandly. And what was wrong with Nellie Duncan? "She was politically connected to the opposing group." Out went Duncan, in came an Owens loyalist, Carlos Edwards. When I asked Torres if Edwards improved the schools, she said, "No." Nothing disturbed the district's place at or near the bottom of the city on test scores. 
The people who really cared about the schools in the neighborhood simply gave up on the board. For one thing, an incredibly complicated voting system, devised to ensure minority representation, had the perverse effect of making it virtually impossible for an individual running alone to win a seat on the board; you had to join a slate, and slates were devised in the clubhouses. And it was obvious that the boards had nothing to do with education. As Wilma Carthan, director of community affairs for a local health center and a highly respected force in the neighborhood, points out, "you don't have to know about curriculum development" to be a board member. A 1987 study found that only one-quarter of board members citywide had children in their district's schools. The study also found that 37 percent of board members conceded that patronage was a problem in their district, while an additional 22 percent said that patronage occurred but was "not a problem." They had been Tammanyized.
Starting in the late 1980's, New Yorkers began to hear a cascade of tales about school board corruption -- the Bronx board president who took bribes (including a white cashmere coat), the Brooklyn rabbi who siphoned off millions. But the financial damage has paled next to the educational damage that comes of several generations of mediocre or outright incompetent superintendents and principals installed by boards. When I went to see Monsignor Powis, now pastor of St. Barbara's, in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn bordering Ocean Hill-Brownsville, he told me that District 23 was lucky. His superintendent in Bushwick, he said, "failed as an assistant principal, failed as a principal, and now he's superintendent." 
Powis, once decentralization's most fiery white advocate, added, "I would be satisfied with the new chancellor if in his first year he gets rid of at least 10 or 12 superintendents." Harold O. Levy, who stepped down in August as the last chancellor under the old dispensation, told me that he would have fired far more superintendents than he had, but he was afraid that the local boards would have insisted on someone even worse. 
The local boards, however, were only the most awful symptom of a systemwide ailment. The structure devised by the State Legislature in 1969 made the New York City schools chancellor answerable to a citywide central board whose nine members were appointed by the mayor and the borough presidents. What this meant, in effect, was that the superintendents put in place by the local boards were not responsible to the chancellor; the chancellor was not responsible to the mayor; and the central board was not responsible to anyone. As Joseph Viteritti, a professor at New York University and at one time the special assistant for management policy to Schools Chancellor Frank Macchiarola, says: "The chancellor had to spend an extraordinary amount of time bringing together five members" -- a working majority -- "of a disparate board in order to get anything done. Once you did adopt policy, you needed to implement it -- and then you needed the cooperation of local school boards, over which you had no power. And if they didn't agree, you wouldn't be able to implement policy." 
Decentralization essentially turned the district superintendents into minichancellors. Levy told me a story that his predecessor, Rudy Crew, told him: when Crew took over in 1995, he called a meeting of the 32 superintendents, and a number didn't even deign to show up. "It was a matter of principle for them not to respond to any central authority," Levy says. Crew was so infuriated that he immediately began lobbying state legislators to strip boards of their power over personnel decisions; in 1996, he succeeded. The new law stipulated that the chancellor would confirm recommendations for superintendent made by newly established local, independent committees; the local boards would then simply rubber-stamp the chancellor's choice. This was the beginning of the end for community control.
As it happened, in 1996 a new majority had unseated the old in District 23. The reconfigured local board immediately sought to replace the superintendent, Michael Vega, who had ruled since 1982, presiding over a district that ranked dead last in the city in reading scores. But the board deadlocked over a successor. Then the new rules took effect. The community -- the real community -- suddenly saw a role for itself. The most dedicated parents, along with community activists like Wilma Carthan, joined the selection committee. And the members quickly fixed on Kathy Cashin, who had had great success as the principal of an elementary school elsewhere in Brooklyn and who was well prepared, eager and nervy enough to take on the board. Cashin, however, was also white, and the board president, Joseph Gabriel (nephew of the local assemblyman), made it plain that he would not accept a white candidate. After all, this was Ocean Hill-Brownsville.
As Denise Harper, a parent who served as the committee's co-chairwoman, recalls: "I told Gabriel to go somewhere, sit down and shut up. And a few of the other parents had the same attitude. They said: 'Our district is last in the city. They could be Greek from Hong Kong and we don't care, if they know what they're doing."' Harper says that she and others got threatening phone calls in the middle of the night. Nevertheless, the committee sent Crew a list of three candidates, with Cashin on top. Here, for a moment, was a sign of what "community control" could have meant had it been born under a very different star. 
The district board, however, was not about to surrender to a choice whose only merit was merit. Chancellor Crew accepted Cashin, but the board, in an act of open defiance, insisted on a black candidate instead. Crew suspended the board and appointed three trustees with instructions to vote for Cashin. At a wild board meeting in March 1998, Sonny Carson, a notorious rabble-rouser who led protests during the community-control struggle, shouted that Cashin should "go back where she belongs." Carson was ignored, the trustees voted Cashin in and parents lined up to greet and kiss her. The community had finally wrested the schools away from the local board -- a thought that confounds the simpler notions of political change associated with the 60's.
The board has not, however, gone quietly into its senescence. Four members of the board have been suspended since 1998. The most recent, Reginald Bowman, who runs the tenant association of the local housing projects, was president of the board until he was suspended this past July. The Board of Education's Office of Special Investigations concluded that Bowman had knowingly signed falsified time cards submitted by his secretary on 22 occasions, purposely overspent the school-supply budget two years running and converted supplies to personal use. Bowman rejects all the allegations and accuses Cashin of waging a campaign of "character assassination" against him. He may have tried to exact his own form of revenge. A few weeks before Bowman was formally suspended, an otherwise unidentified "coalition of parents and educators" sent Chancellor Levy a letter accusing Cashin of treating the community "how Master treated the slaves way back when" and demanding her immediate dismissal. (Bowman says he had nothing to do with the letter.) It was as if the spirit of Ocean Hill-Brownsville past was trying to make a comeback. 
People in Ocean Hill-Brownsville often say that the schools have already made more progress under Kathy Cashin than they did in all those years of homegrown, ethnically correct leadership. In the last three years, district scores have gone up 4.7 percent in literacy and 6.2 percent in math -- pretty modest, but not compared with years in the doldrums. Those in the neighborhood whom I talked with were inclined to give all the credit to their superintendent. Parents in particular spoke of Cashin with reverence. "All the things that are happening are happening because of Dr. Cashin," Natalie Williams, the mother of a first and a sixth grader who is active in the parents' association at their school, said to me. 
Cashin's stature in the community demonstrates how much leadership matters, and her accomplishments show what inspired leadership can do in the absence of crippling obstructions. With the board stripped of its power over patronage, Cashin fired incompetent principals, replacing them in several cases with assistant principals who might otherwise have languished for years. And though her predecessor, Michael Vega, had allowed principals to run their schools as they saw fit, Cashin did not. She installed Core Knowledge, a demanding, fact-based curriculum, in several elementary schools, as well as a "balanced literacy" program mixing some "whole language" instruction with phonics. The principals seem to have welcomed the direction. Alice Gottlieb, the principal of P.S. 137, says that she had never heard of Core Knowledge before Cashin brought it to her attention, though she was immediately attracted to its old-fashioned rigor.
Cashin is a formidable, and formidably ladylike, figure -- tall enough to look a bellowing board member in the eye and self-possessed enough not to flinch while doing so. She practices a rigorous self-control in the face of inanities and distractions; Denise Harper marvels at the poker face she wears during interminable board meetings. When I visited Cashin in her office over the summer, she told me: "Large-scale change has to have a strong element of top-down assertiveness. The bottom-up is the balance." Top-down, she went on to say, also means prescriptive. "Having clearly defined lessons is the key," she said. "The mistake we make is just giving them standards. It's nice to have standards, but that's the what. How do you do it? How do you teach it?" 
Her teachers now have lesson plans for each class, though Cashin says that she is delighted when teachers want to argue with the content of the lesson. Over the summer she and her staff worked on breaking out every single skill required in the state's fourth- and eighth-grade English and math tests, and then reshaping instruction to focus on those skills. 
Cashin is not only a leader but also an expert. She reads the educational literature and knows the difference between good and bad pedagogy. Community control was born at a time when questions of expertise paled beside what appeared to be large questions of justice; but those abstractions now look like yesterday's cultural politics. Even Sonny Carson astonished me by saying of the superintendent, "Anything she wants me to do, I will be right there to support her." Carson actually conceded that his demand for a black superintendent was "a mistake." Perhaps we truly have reached a point of depoliticization in education.
Cashin has also put an end to the false polarity between "the community" and "the system." She is a ubiquitous figure in the neighborhood. She meets constantly with parents and listens to their concerns, as her predecessors, for all their official community-approved status, did not. And that turns out to be quite enough "control" for the members of the community who really matter -- the handful of mothers at each school who volunteer for everything, and the larger circle of parents who make sure that their kids do their homework, come what may. 
"The governance question is the beginning of reform," says Seymour Fliegel, a former superintendent and now the head of the Center for Educational Innovation. "Some people think it's the end of the reform; it's what you do with the governance." Rudolph Giuliani seemed to think that mayoral control was not just the means but the end. Virtually the only reform he ever proposed for the schools was a very divisive bid to let parents use vouchers to opt out of the system altogether. The comparison with the Police Department is instructive: Giuliani and his initial police chief, William Bratton, knew exactly what they wanted the police to do differently -- to use statistics as a means of accountability, to stop tolerating low-level crime, to aggressively remove guns from the street -- and they used their authority to transform the culture of the police force. Giuliani had no such plans for the schools. Does Bloomberg?
The answer appears to be no. Joseph Viteritti, whom the mayor has consulted on school issues, says that the Bloomberg administration has not had a clear agenda, though he hopes one may develop soon. Diane Ravitch, the educational historian and policy expert, who has also spoken with Bloomberg and his leading officials, says that she has the same impression. I put the question to Dennis Walcott, the deputy mayor in charge of education, and he said: "The mayor has been very clear that it is his commissioners, and in this case the chancellor, who articulate the vision. You don't want a City Hall that's micromanaging how educational policy is carried out." 
And yet the man the mayor chose as the new chancellor, Joel I. Klein, is a high-powered attorney with essentially no background in education. Where is the equivalent of Compstat or the Broken Windows theory to come from?
Bloomberg is a technocratic figure who tends to think that if he gets the process right, he will get the content right. This is not an entirely unreasonable belief in the case of the schools, for the very act of creating a clear system of accountability and authority should embolden the system's actors to do what they think is right rather than whatever will keep them out of trouble. Nevertheless, reform is not self-implementing. Kathy Cashin has succeeded, insofar as she has, not only because she cares about doing the right thing but also because she has a very specific idea of what that right thing is, and she has been willing to use her authority to shape classroom instruction according to that idea. Agnosticism about means is enjoying a vogue in educational circles, in part because it grants individual school leaders great autonomy. But some things work better than others, especially in troubled, inner-city schools. You need, as Cashin says, top-down and bottom-up. Perhaps, as Diane Ravitch suggests, the system should centralize decisions about curriculum and pedagogy. 
One of the mothers in Ocean Hill-Brownsville said to me, "If you want a good laugh, go to a board meeting." And so, in early August, I did. The meeting of the local board was held in the district's conference room, an oversize classroom. Six of the nine board members had gathered, and they sat at a long table facing the audience, which consisted of eight or nine mothers and their restless children. Dorothy Ellis, an 81-year-old retiree who had reluctantly replaced Reggie Bowman as board president, or so she said, opened the meeting with what appeared to be a routine motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting. The motion proved surprisingly controversial. Another board member, Marie Monk, observed with elaborate courtesy that since only three board members -- two shy of a quorum -- had attended that meeting, the minutes could not be official and thus could not be approved. There was some discussion as to whether the logjam could be broken by substituting a word other than "meeting." No such word was found. The minutes were not accepted. 
Ellis then invited Superintendent Cashin to present her own agenda. Cashin proceeded to crisply and enthusiastically run down a long list of bullet points. Ellis graciously thanked the superintendent. After a wrangle among the board members over who would head the various committees to study this or that problem, Ellis began a rather mysterious monologue on "the sunset law." Several of the city's local boards, including hers, were planning to challenge the new governance law as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, and Ellis had been doing some research into it. "We do have rights under the New York State and federal Constitution," Ellis solemnly explained to her baffled audience. "We are dealing with a contract with the superintendent; that contract has been violated and ignored. I believe the federal Constitution protects this under Article 1, Section 10." A confused discussion of "contracts" and "the sunset law" ensued. 
Cashin commenced, involuntarily, to yawn. Some of her aides looked on in open stupefaction. Denise Harper rolled her eyes and wrote scathing notes for her own amusement. After two hours, the meeting clanked to an end, with a promise of further enlightenment and debate. 
Harper called me the next day; she felt that she had to explain the board's performance. The board members had apparently been cowed into respectability by the presence of the news media. It had been, she said, the shortest and most professional meeting in memory. She remains hopeful, as do the other parents and indeed nearly everyone I spoke with -- save some members of the local board -- that the Justice Department will dismiss any legal challenge, and that Ocean Hill-Brownsville will soon be liberated from community control.

HEADLINE: CRIME 

BYLINE:  By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
I'm a sucker for old cops, cold cases and any excuse to get out of town; and so, it turns out, is Sue Grafton, who hooks up her ever-game private eye, Kinsey Millhone, with two crotchety homicide detectives in Q IS FOR QUARRY (Marian Wood/Putnam, $26.95) and packs them off to a rural California backwater to sift through the ashes of an unsolved mystery dating back to 1969. Although she's always big on small details, Grafton puts a lot of particulars into the Jane Doe case that still haunts Lt. Con Dolan and his pal Stacey Oliphant. With both of these lovable geezers knocking hard on death's door, it falls to Kinsey to dig out the musty evidence and talk up residents with long-buried memories of the young woman whose body was dumped in a forgotten quarry, unknown and still unclaimed after all these years.
 Grafton devises a solid solution, both credible and sad, to the murder, which is based on a true (and still unresolved) homicide in Santa Barbara County. But what really makes us hold our breath are her character studies of the brassy lady who gives manicures in her trailer, and the 93-year-old dentist desperate for someone to beat at chess, and all the other folks who live in towns like Quorum (population 12,676) and Peaches (population 897) and haven't a clue how fine they look to a stranger. 
 Michael Connelly takes a break from the exhausting labors of fictional police work to pursue a more abstract line of detection and a subtler kind of criminal cruelty in CHASING THE DIME (Little, Brown, $25.95). His protagonist, a molecular chemist named Henry Pierce, has all the right stuff for this noir suspense thriller: he is obsessed with the experimental project that can put his Santa Monica company on the cutting edge of nanotechnology; he eats on the run, sleeps at the lab and gets no exercise whatsoever; and he has had no contact with a woman since his girlfriend tossed him out for being such a nerd. No wonder he loses it when he starts getting persistent messages for a call girl named Lilly on the telephone in his new and sadly empty apartment.
Plot and pace are meat and drink to Connelly, who here adds a strong whiff of foreboding to his storytelling style. The walls start closing in on Henry when he neglects his work to track Lilly through her porno Web site and, having convinced himself that she has been murdered, to find her killer -- only to become the prime suspect when the police get wind of his snooping. Although he takes too long to wise up to the fact that someone has it in for him, Henry keeps his endearing air of innocence throughout his ordeal in the capable, if not always kind, hands of a cunning craftsman.
It's no fun to watch a good writer shoot herself in the foot; but that's essentially what Val McDermid does in THE LAST TEMPTATION (St. Martin's Minotaur, $24.95) by conflating the plots of a police procedural and an international thriller and giving her series sleuths the awkward task of functioning in two different worlds at the same time. Tony Hill, a forensic psychologist who profiles serial killers for the British Home Office, always works well with Carol Jordan, a police detective with the intelligence to match her career ambitions. But you have to blink in disbelief when McDermid sends this pair to Europe on implausibly linked cases that leave them floundering like lost tourists.
It takes a lot of bending and twisting just to get Hill abroad so he can profile the serial killer who is picking off academic psychologists in Germany and the Netherlands and escaping detection by wending his way along inland water routes. It's another stretch getting Jordan to Berlin, where she uses her resemblance to a crime boss's dead wife to entrap the poor guy. As if these bald contrivances were not enough to compromise their stylistically mismatched missions, the two sleuths consult the same local police officers, put up at the same hotel and are dangerously indiscreet in their personal contacts. Save us from such amateurs.
More music. That's what DARK END OF THE STREET (Morrow, $23.95) needs. More music and less noise. Ace Atkins's blues-based mystery starts off just fine, with the New Orleans blues historian Nick Travers on a field trip to Memphis, tracing the whereabouts of a legendary soul singer ("best there ever was") named Clyde James, who dropped out of sight in 1968 after the execution-style slaying of his wife and his best friend. But once he makes it to Tennessee, Nick comes across few of the old musicians he encountered in "Crossroad Blues" and "Leavin' Trunk Blues," mixing it up instead with crooked casino bosses, con artists, hit men, politicians and other cliched villains who have also taken a sudden and inexplicable interest in Clyde. Atkins still grabs us with quiet scenes of rainswept river towns and roadside cotton fields and one great glimpse of the "real, breathing music scene" at the Hi-Tone bar. But the essence of the blues -- you feel bad, you sing about it, you go home alone -- is pretty much drowned out by all the noisy action of this busy plot.
Troy Soos has a terrific story to tell in THE GILDED CAGE (Kensington, $23). He just needs a better storyteller. Marshall Webb, a crusading journalist in this historical mystery set in New York in 1893, is writing an expose of the Tammany Hall political machine for Harper's Weekly. His dear friend Rebecca Davies, a reformer in her own right, is determined to discover who poisoned a young woman she rescued from the streets and brought into her home for abused and abandoned women. Meanwhile, the economy is looking grim, the city is in the grips of a cholera epidemic, and the banker with whom Rebecca entrusted her entire inheritance is found dead under suspicious circumstances. Soos has a good eye for the rampant corruption and social injustice that tarnished New York's image during its so-called gilded era, and his impressions of the historical city are handsomely nuanced. But Rebecca and Marshall, functioning as conscience and mouthpiece, remain adamantly outside the time frame, their contemporary sensibilities intact, their voices coming from a very great distance.

 LAW IN AMERICA
A Short History.
By Lawrence M. Friedman.
207 pp. New York:
A Modern Library Chronicles Book/
The Modern Library. $19.95.
 Joseph G. Baldwin, later a justice of the California Supreme Court, practiced law in Alabama and Mississippi in the first half of the 19th century. Those were, he wrote, flush times for lawyers. "What country could boast more largely of its crimes?" he exclaimed. "What more splendid role of felonies! What more terrific murders! What more gorgeous bank robberies!"
Baldwin, sounding like Augie March by way of Thomas Pynchon, continued: "And in INDIAN affairs! -- the very mention is suggestive of the poetry of theft -- the romance of a wild and weird larceny! Swindling Indians by the nation!"
This passage appears in Lawrence M. Friedman's "History of American Law." That book, published in 1973 and revised in 1985, was studded with fascinating vernacular period detail like Baldwin's little rhapsody. Friedman framed these source materials in authoritative social history, and he decorated the frame with casual, lasting insights.
Friedman is now 72, and he has produced a sort of precis of that 800-page history for the Modern Library Chronicles series of brief treatments of large subjects. It is called "Law in America." The book is appealingly informal, if a little scattered and selective. It is aimed, the publisher says, at the general reader. Such a reader, one infers, is presumed to know almost nothing. 
Friedman's writing, which in his earlier work was unhurried, conversational, comprehensive, candid and respectful of the reader's intelligence, has here become distractingly glib and colloquial. Still, his resistance to formal legal prose is refreshing. "It is the business of the lawyer to tolerate and master artifice," he wrote in the longer book, for lawyers grow rich from their knowledge of "cancerously intricate" fields of law. Friedman writes from outside the legal guild. Here he seldom pauses to listen to the music of the law. He has too much ground to cover. Worse, he has had to throw most supporting materials overboard, so his always interesting observations sound more like assertion than scholarship. 
This small book is nonetheless a persuasive account of how culture produces law. Friedman spends almost no time on big cases and famous judges. He is interested in state law, not federal, and in the average person's actual experience with it. He wants to know, for instance, what a justice of the peace's background and influence were likely to have been. He is also concerned with first principles that most Americans "do not even see as legal ideas: private property, for example, or the right to enter into contracts, or the concepts of marriage or divorce or adoption of children." 
In Friedman's view, the law is largely devoted to allocating economic power: "Might may make right; but might has to be careful not to make this fact too obvious." The subjects the law concerns itself with, then, reflect the interests of the ruling classes, and they change as the nature of wealth changes. English law in colonial times, he writes, mostly addressed the problems of the landed aristocracy. It did not fit the American experience well, where there was much want but land was plentiful. American law in time came to regulate the New World's wealth -- maritime commerce, contracts, railroads, monopolies, intellectual property. And human property. Slavery was unknown in England, so Americans constructed an enormous and heartbreaking body of slave law, much of it quite technical. In this way, Friedman writes, the law "takes an understanding, a norm, an attitude, and it hardens it into muscle and bone."
Friedman's account of the development of the law of negligence in the 19th century is also grounded in economic logic. In the received version of the rise of this body of law, negligence -- the requirement that plaintiffs prove carelessness by whoever injured them -- was based on morality, negligence being a kind of fault. Before that, for the most part, strict liability prevailed: the cost of the accident was borne by the party who created it, without regard to fault.
Friedman has a different explanation, which owes something to Morton J. Horwitz's work on tort law. He traces the shift to the Industrial Revolution in general and to railroads in particular. "Nothing does a better job of mangling human bodies than machines," he writes. That the courts often allowed industry to escape liability by requiring proof of negligence was a testament not to morality but to economic power and to "the developmental thrust of American law."
Though the role of economic might is central to Friedman's conception of the law, he is not reflexively anti-business. Indeed, he ascribes a kind of Keynesian role to the law, which primed the pump of progress. Family law, too, Friedman writes, developed largely to regulate property rights. The law of marriage and adoption, for instance, is mostly concerned with inheritance. "Nobody needs an adoption law to take in a child, love it, care for it," Friedman writes. You do need a law, though, to give that child a right to your property after you die. 
The evolution of American criminal law, which Friedman also addressed in "Crime and Punishment in American History" (1993), is bound up with increasing urbanization and personal isolation. Colonial criminal law mostly regulated moral offenses -- blasphemy, fornication, idleness -- through shaming and corporal punishment. Modern criminal law, on the other hand, is largely concerned with violent crime and economic offenses, and it relies almost exclusively on incarceration for punishment. The war on drugs, Friedman writes, is the "glaring exception to the tendency to decriminalize the so-called victimless crimes." The drug war has in turn created "a huge new nation of prisoners" in "the American gulag."
Friedman never shoehorns fact into theory, and the longer book often paused to disclose and consider contrary evidence. The new one can do less of this, so it often merely declares what Friedman has elsewhere proved. The last part of "Law in America" is devoted to the 20th century and the rise of the regulatory state. It is much too brisk and conventional. He ends the book with a little rant about the power of celebrity.
Lawyers love analogies. Here's one.
"Law in America" is to its predecessor as a movie's trailer is to the film itself. It collects a lot of the best bits, moves fast, lacks context and leaves you pleasantly dazed and wanting more. Let's hope it sells some tickets.

 PARADISE ALLEY
By Kevin Baker.
676 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95.
 Until September 2001, three summer days in 1863 were the most frightening in the history of New York City. From Monday, July 13, through Wednesday, July 17, mobs held much of Manhattan. The rioters were working class, overwhelmingly Irish Catholic and filled with smoldering resentments -- at the Yankee Protestants who exploited and demeaned them, at the squalor in which they were forced to live, at inflationary prices and lockouts and strikebreaking. But the final spark was provided by the new National Conscription Act, which made virtually all able-bodied men eligible for the draft but allowed the well-to-do to escape service in the Union Army by paying a $300 fee. As many of the Irish saw it, poor white workingmen like themselves were being forced to fight for the freedom of blacks, who would then come north and take their jobs. They burned federal property and attacked Republican newspaper offices, looted stores and wrecked private homes, killed policemen and soldiers who tried to stop them and beat or butchered any African-American men, women or children who happened to cross their path. A puzzled foreign visitor asked a bystander why blacks were the special targets of their anger. "Oh, sir," the man replied, "they hate them here" because "they are the innocent cause of all these troubles." 
The New York draft riots remain the worst civil disturbance in American history: according to the historian Adrian Cook, 119 people are known to have been killed, mostly rioters or onlookers who got too close when federal troops, brought back from the battlefield to restore order, started shooting. 
Those three chaotic days provide the backdrop for Kevin Baker's extraordinary new novel, "Paradise Alley." Baker is simultaneously a richly imaginative fiction writer steeped in historical fact and a meticulous historian who cheerfully alters actual events whenever it serves the intricate, many-sided stories he likes to spin. As the chief historical researcher for Harold Evans, Baker ferreted out a lot of the quirky details that helped fill Evans's best-selling "American Century" with so many unexpected pleasures. "In the News," Baker's column in American Heritage magazine, offers readers a bimonthly dose of historical context for current events, shrewdly distinguishing those items for which the past really is prologue from those for which a knowledge of history isn't much help. In his 1999 novel, "Dreamland," he managed both to paint a wholly plausible portrait of immigrant New York around 1910 and to tell a gritty, exuberant tale that blended historic personages (including Sigmund Freud) and a large fictional cast, with two great conflagrations: the blaze that destroyed the Dreamland Amusement Park at Coney Island and the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which helped to catalyze the American labor movement. The result was irresistible.
"Paradise Alley" is just as successful -- and no less ambitious. In "Dreamland," the immigrant protagonists were Jewish and eastern European. In "Paradise Alley," they are Roman Catholic and Irish. But the misery of their surroundings remains the same: they live in the notorious Fourth Ward, where feral pigs snuffle through gutters heaped with filth, a single spigot serves three blocks and people live more densely packed -- 290,000 to the square mile -- than in any other neighborhood on earth. They battle against the same odds, too, and struggle with the same vexing riddle: when does an immigrant become an American?
Like a skilled ringmaster, Baker sets seven major characters in motion on the morning of July 13. Most of them occupy derelict houses along the short, fetid block off Cherry Street that gives the book its title. The mob is still just background noise then. "Something both more and less," a member of Baker's cast notes, "than the daily going to work, the bawdy, boisterous awakening of the City that she liked to listen to every morning from her doorstep before joining it herself." But as the story sweeps along -- Baker is a master of momentum -- the distant thunder grows closer and closer until its roar drowns out everything else, a lethal threat to all the people he has made us care about. 
Ruth Dove is an Irish-born ragpicker: married to a runaway slave from South Carolina named Billy Dove, she lives in fear of her former lover, Johnny Dolan -- Dangerous Johnny Dolan -- a sometime bare-knuckle boxer whom the horrors of the potato famine have turned into a murderous sociopath. As the book begins, Ruth learns that after a 14-year forced exile she helped arrange, he has returned to New York bent on revenge. Deirdre Dolan O'Kane, the killer's older sister, is as different from him as she can possibly make herself: a proud, pious ex-domestic, intent on working her way out of poverty, she wants her family to "live like Americans," and has transformed her husband, Tom, from a member of a notorious riverfront gang called the Break O'Day Boys into a sober and reliable wage earner. Now she is frightened that by talking him into volunteering to serve in the celebrated Irish Brigade, the Fighting 69th, she has sent him to his death. Maddy Boyle is a teenage prostitute, kept by the book's only important Protestant character, a self-confessed hack named Herbert Willis Robinson. He works for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and is a keen observer of everything except himself; his reluctance to take his mistress into his home in the guarded sanctuary of Gramercy Park leaves her vulnerable to the mob as it roars into Paradise Alley in search of victims.
Without ever slowing his novel's pace or letting us lose sight of any of his characters, the author takes the reader on a careering, kaleidoscopic tour of their world. The timorous might think twice before embarking. Baker's itinerary encompasses ravaged Ireland and the carnage at Fredericksburg, as well as New York's lower depths. He takes his readers to a bull-baiting pit, walks them past slaughterhouses and through a Manhattan sewer filled with scuttling rats. And we visit places most New Yorkers know nothing about: Seneca Village, the black squatters' settlement that stood in the center of what is now Central Park till 19th-century gentrification moved uptown and wiped it out; a waterfront dive where, for a nickel, thirsty patrons are welcome to as much rotgut whiskey as they can suck through a rubber hose in 30 seconds; and a Bowery saloon that displays on its bar a jar of pickled ears, bitten off misbehaving customers by the female proprietor.
Baker's story is so rich in color and drama that here and there some readers may find their credulity strained. But a random check of several of the sources he obligingly provides shows that while he has often changed names and altered locations to suit the story, many of those scenes that seem least plausible turn out to be the most faithful to the recorded facts: a canny black man did deflect a murderous mob by putting on an impromptu minstrel show; when rioters shouting "Burn the niggers' nest!" set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue, a block north of where the Public Library now stands, it really was a heroic Irish boy who emerged from nowhere to lead the 237 terrified children who lived there to safety in a precinct house; and a family's hairsbreadth escape over the rooftops of burning houses that at first seems to have been snipped from an old-fashioned Saturday afternoon serial turns out to have happened almost precisely as Baker describes it. 
As a convincing portrayal of how things were in our city that terrible summer and as a compelling fictional vision of how things might have been, as well, "Paradise Alley" is twice a triumph.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A review of Kevin Baker's novel "Paradise Alley" on Oct. 6 referred incorrectly to the "three summer days in 1863" that brought the worst of the New York rioting against the draft for the Civil War. Those days, during which the novel takes place, were Monday, July 13, through Wednesday, July 15, not 17.

HEADLINE: 'Inventing America' 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We scarcely recognize our book, "Inventing America," in Sylvia Nasar's ideologically driven review (Sept. 15). The book is a comprehensive, synthetic history of the United States, distinguished in part by the attention it gives to science and technology in American history. 
Nasar, who is not a historian, does not address the ways in which it builds upon and in some measure revises current scholarship. Instead, after essentially skipping the first half of the book (through Reconstruction), she attacks the rest for not explaining how private enterprise and the profit motive account for America's "technological fecundity," explosive growth and vastly improved standard of living.
 Her specific allegations are sharply at odds with the book, which makes no claim that inventiveness is exclusively American. It carefully describes the nuts and bolts of business history, the impact of technology on economic growth and the transformations in ordinary life over previous centuries (not just the past 130 years). More important, a book written from her uncritically pro-business stance would be neither a balanced textbook nor good history. The state has been a more significant player in the American economy than Nasar suggests, and the impact of private enterprise more complex than she seems willing to admit, even in this post-Enron era. Emphasizing the United States' material superiority to the rest of the world, Nasar would have us pay less attention to social and economic inequality, especially among women, minorities and immigrants. Such a history would be incomplete and disregard the substantial scholarship of the past generation. We trust that our fellow historians and other readers recognize the shortcomings of Nasar's review.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 UP IN THE AIR, by Walter Kirn. (Anchor, $13.) Ryan Bingham, this novel's troubled hero, is a career transition counselor (which means he crisscrosses the country firing people) who is desperately trying to amass one million frequent flier miles before he leaves or is himself downsized. A denizen of "Airworld," a parallel universe with its own language, culture and architecture, Bingham "is as original and cool a character to come along in American fiction in a while," Christopher Buckley wrote here in 2001. "Kirn is such a sharp writer he gives your brain paper cuts."

FIVE POINTS: The 19th-Century New York City Neighborhood That Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became the World's Most Notorious Slum, by Tyler Anbinder. (Plume, $16.) America's first real ghetto, the Five Points in Lower Manhattan, is barely remembered today, but it was a haven for immigrants and the poor that produced a lively popular culture despite its squalor. Last year our reviewer, Kevin Baker, found this "a careful, intelligent and sympathetic history on a neglected subject."

BABE IN PARADISE, by Marisa Silver. (Norton, $13.95.) In this disquieting first collection of short stories, set in the arid sprawl of Los Angeles, characters who hover on the periphery of fame and wealth find themselves stung by addiction, robbery, carjacking and other unexpected miseries. Silver "is a writer with a keen eye for alienation, and an ability to pinpoint the surprising ways that even the most disaffected among us are brought together, if only provisionally," Bernard Cooper said here last year.

THE DIARIES OF KENNETH TYNAN. Edited by John Lahr. (Bloomsbury, $16.95.) This selection of diary entries from the renowned journalist and theater critic's final decade (he died in 1980 at the age of 53) display flashes of ebullience and grim humor, even as they record his sorry decline into disease, debt and disappointment. Last year in the Book Review, Geoffrey Wheatcroft said the volume "contains a number of scintillatingly witty and clever passages . . . yet remains one of the most depressing books I have read for a long time."

THE CEO OF THE SOFA, by P. J. O'Rourke. (Grove, $13.) The conservative political humorist, in a grab bag of musings on fin de siecle decadence, reveals himself to be a blunt Midwestern populist as he takes on the New Economy, alternative rock, Earth Day, the United Nations and the culture of celebrity. "O'Rourke complains of midlife woes, but nothing has softened his wicked sense of fun," Allen D. Boyer said here last year.

THINKS . . . , by David Lodge. (Penguin, $14.) In his most ambitious novel, the author plays an ornate game of he said/she said, in which a swaggering, jet-setting academic star pursues a creative writing professor trying to control her grief over her husband's death. The result is a "dense hodgepodge of farce and darker fare," Lisa Zeidner said here in 2001. "But even when he's off target, it's always interesting and instructive to watch how he aims."

POLITICAL FICTIONS, by Joan Didion. (Vintage International, $14.) In eight essays deconstructing the last four presidential elections and many of the foibles, scandals and crusades of the times, from campaign financing to the Clinton impeachment, Didion argues that American democracy has been abducted by a "permanent political class." Last year in these pages, John Leonard admired her "black conceit, her sonar ear, her radar eye and her ice pick/laser beam/night-scope sniper prose."

AN HONORABLE PROFESSION, by John L'Heureux. (Grove, $14.) Part thriller, part novel of sexual possession and philosophical questioning, part satire of small-town mores, this tale centers on a popular high school teacher faced with a crucible of pain and guilt when he is accused of molesting a male student. The result is "a rich, interesting work" by an author "who isn't afraid of dealing with dark themes," Robert Ward wrote in these pages in 1991.

THE RED OF HIS SHADOW, by Mayra Montero. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $12.95.) A Cuban writer living in Puerto Rico tells of the highly complex world of voodoo worship and of the isolated lives of Haitian sugar cane harvesters in the mountains of Hispaniola. Novels like this "can invite us to walk through doors we didn't even know existed," Jana Giles said here in 2001. "We come away humbled, confused, alienated, delighted, terrified." Scott Veale

HEADLINE: It's Up to You, New York 

BYLINE:  By Ivar Ekman 

 BODY:
 The Panic of 1791
In an era when equity trading was executed on curbside markets, a former Treasury official, William Duer, tried to boost the shares of his bank by spreading rumors that it was about to merge with bigger institutions. A speculative bubble grew, then burst. In the aftermath, the first efforts were made to formally regulate Wall Street.

The Panic of 1837
New Orleans merchants stopped paying bills because of a drop in cotton prices. When New York banks started calling in loans, merchants defaulted and a national bank rush ensued. A British visitor commented: "I walked down Wall Street, and had a convincing proof of the great demand for money, for somebody picked my pocket."

The Savings-and-Loan Crisis of the 1980's
Wall Street firms, rife with insider trading, financed a wave of mergers and acquisitions with junk bonds, often unloading them on shaky savings and loans out in the heartland. The collapse of these institutions ended up costing American taxpayers billions.

The Panic of 1893
Another market collapse. This time, Wall Street wasn't directly to blame -- it was the collapse of a British financial firm that set off a string of American bank failures -- but New York bankers cleaned up in the confusion that followed. J.P. Morgan and other financiers took control of most of the country's railroads as a result.

The Asian Bubble of 1997
Following cues from Washington and Wall Street, many countries, especially in Asia, opened up their financial markets to outside investment. This gave Wall Street new toys. Then big investors got skittish and started pulling out. Thailand's baht was the first currency to fall, followed by similar trouble in the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea and Malaysia. Banks wrote off their bad investments, and Wall Street set its sights on Silicon Valley.

The Railroad Bust of 1873
Overbuilding of Western railroads strained the New York banks that financed them; Jay Cooke & Co., then the largest U.S. bank, imploded, taking the market -- and many Americans' jobs -- with it. Cornelius Vanderbilt objected to the participation of "respectable banking houses in New York, so called," in railroad scams, which had lent "a kind of moral guarantee of their secureness."

The Crash of 1929 Like the 1990's, the 1920's saw new yardsticks for security valuation, talk of "a new era" free of business cycles and flourishing consumer demand fed by the huge expansion of personal credit. Then came Black Tuesday, Oct. 29.

The Latin American Debt Crisis of 1982
New York banks discovered "emerging markets." The fact that these countries up until now had been denied credit made them look even better, since they had no debt. But due to "competitive pressures," banks lent too much, and poor countries defaulted.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
A Business Built on the Hard-to-Sell

BYLINE:  By ANDRAS SZANTO

 BODY:
RONALD FELDMAN's art gallery is 30 years old, and he's not happy about it.
 "I never recognized the passage from risk-taking, aggressive gallery to more accepted, older, reputable gallery," Mr. Feldman, 64, said in his SoHo office over the summer. "You want to have respectability, but I'm more interested in being at the edge." 
 Over the years, Mr. Feldman has staked his reputation on difficult art, work that was unlikely to make any money. He championed performance artists like Chris Burden, who in 1975 fasted for three weeks on a ledge above the gallery; Conceptualists like Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the unsalaried artist in residence of New York City's Department of Sanitation; and trailblazers like Hannah Wilke, the pioneering feminist who unflinchingly used her camera to document her body, both when it was beautiful and when it was grotesquely marred by cancer. 
Remaining on the edge for Mr. Feldman has meant staging ambitious installations and group exhibitions that could never recoup their costs. In some cases, he has had to hold on to unsold inventory for years while the careers of artists like Ida Applebroog, a painter who achieved commercial success only in her late 50's, slowly matured.
"He is a real good guy, a conscience," said the painter Chuck Close, who has collaborated with Mr. Feldman on various fund-raising projects. "I think he has tremendous respect for artists. You can see them talking him into elaborate installations and filling the gallery with things that may not be the most salable. He also takes a tremendous amount of time away from normal business practices to work for causes that he thinks are important." 
Mr. Feldman uses the term "managed fatalism" to describe his philosophy of art dealing. "I cannot twist somebody's arm to like a work," he said. "My agenda is to run the gallery so that when the artists are ready for their next show, I'm still in business."
Easily excited and given to mercurial soliloquies on almost any subject, Mr. Feldman has been called the best "artist" in his gallery. It's a characterization he flatly rejects, but it provides a clue to his popularity in the art world. Even a casual encounter makes it obvious that he is "playing for history," as he likes to say. As a gallery owner, he has modeled himself after Leo Castelli, the worldly and erudite patriarch of New York contemporary-art dealers. But the parallels end right there. If you heard the Bronx-born Mr. Feldman's voice on tape, you could easily mistake him for Woody Allen.
The 40-odd artists of Ronald Feldman Fine Arts make up a smorgasbord of the dealer's eclectic interests. A longtime advocate of political art, Mr. Feldman currently represents Leon Golub, Pepon Osorio and Nancy Chunn. His was the first American gallery to exhibit several leading Russian artists, notably Ilya Kabakov and Komar and Melamid, the duo whose paintings had to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union by diplomats and journalists. And then there are Mr. Feldman's scientifically oriented artists -- among them Shusaku Arakawa and Todd Siler -- who share his belief that the real competition for contemporary art is not popular culture but technology.
Mr. Feldman calls his survival a "miracle," but much of the credit goes to his publicity-shy wife, Frayda, who oversees the gallery's business operations and staff of 15. The Feldmans are the last people you would expect to make a living as art dealers. They met and married while he was at New York University Law School, and they commute daily to Manhattan from Chappaqua, N.Y., where they reared their three children. They refrain from the kind of nonstop socializing that is considered de rigeur by so many art dealers. 
The Feldmans' life in art started in 1969, after Mr. Feldman made partner at Helfand, Lesser & Moriber, a corporate-law firm. Under tremendous stress, he was soon passing out from fatigue on his bathroom floor at night and realizing that he needed to make some changes. Enrolling in an art class was a first step. Next came a foray into selling prints. He began with Miro and Chagall and moved on to Jasper Johns and other Pop artists. Soon he quit his job and went to Europe to learn more about dealing art.
"I didn't start with a concept or a business plan -- I just did it," he recalled. He immediately gravitated to contemporary art. "The real challenge was to see art in your time," he said, "and become an advocate for it." 
In November 1971, the Feldmans opened a gallery on East 74th Street in Manhattan, in a space that had housed the Stable Gallery, where Andy Warhol once showed. Their inaugural exhibition, by the California painter Ed Moses, stayed up for seven months. There were no other artists yet.
Starting a gallery was easy back then, compared with the financial risks today, but the realities of the business were daunting nevertheless. It takes the same effort to sell a picture for $5,000 as it does to sell one for $5 million, Mr. Feldman asserts. Commissions on historic work can yield a handsome income, but keeping a contemporary gallery afloat is almost invariably a struggle. He learned how to subsidize his "front room" with secondary-market deals and a brisk trade in prints. This "mercenary financial aspect was difficult to reconcile with aesthetics at particular moments," he said. But the strategy paid off.
Mr. Feldman's 1974 collaboration with Joseph Beuys, the legendary German Conceptual artist, put the gallery definitively on the map. It was the artist's first American tour, and it included a series of public dialogues, or "social sculptures," in several cities. Beuys's inclusive philosophy of art -- enshrined in the motto "Everyone is an artist" -- left a deep impression on Mr. Feldman. Beuys was famous for scribbling on chalkboards while he lectured. During one of his speeches at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, collectors passed notes to Mr. Feldman offering to buy the boards, but he and Mrs. Feldman erased them. 
By the late 70's, the Feldman gallery's extravagant installations were being noticed: Chris Burden constructed a working television station, Les Levine erected a house of gloves, Beuys shipped over the demolished remains of his Berlin gallery. Joining the exodus of contemporary-art dealers from uptown to SoHo, the Feldmans, in 1979, relocated their gallery to a former saddle and feather-baling factory at 31 Mercer Street, where parts of the Statue of Liberty had once been stored. The look and feel of the place haven't changed much since.
The booming 80's ushered in a new era of prosperity for the gallery, almost entirely because of one artist, Andy Warhol, who had befriended the Feldmans after they rented his former dealer's space on the Upper East Side. The Feldman gallery eventually commissioned 54 paintings, drawings and prints by Warhol and published a catalogue raisonne of his prints, edited by Mrs. Feldman and Jorg Schellmann. When Warhol unexpectedly died after gall-bladder surgery in 1987, "it was as if a tidal wave had hit us," recalls Marina Batan, a dealer at the gallery. As prices for Warhol's work skyrocketed, Mr. Feldman found himself a major player in a big market.
Recently, more artists have joined the gallery roster (Carl Fudge and Bruce Pearson are among the new names), and a flush art market has allowed Mr. Feldman to spend on luxuries like printed catalogs. "I am not as concerned about survival economically as I was in the past," he said. So far, Sept. 11 and the turmoil on Wall Street have not affected the business. Mr. Feldman chalks that up to collector psychology: "People are living as if now matters," he said. In fact, demand has never been better: sales have doubled since January (the gallery does not disclose its sales figures).
But there have been conflicts and setbacks. Over the years, some artists have complained about lackluster promotion, while others have been lured away by competing dealers. The departures of Mr. Burden, Mr. Levine, Mr. Kabakov and, more recently, Roxy Paine were disappointments. Yet, a majority of the gallery's artists have stayed put, opting for steady commercial and, above all, intellectual and emotional support.
Meanwhile, the ever-restless Mr. Feldman is dedicating more of his energy to politics. In 1990, the gallery began a campaign to raise money for voter registration drives and candidates who support free expression. The project has produced new works by Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, Cindy Sherman and William Wegman, among other art stars, raising over $8 million. For his efforts, Mr. Feldman was invited by President Bill Clinton to serve a five-year term on the National Council for the Arts.
After 30 seasons and more than 1,500 exhibitions by his artists around the world, Mr. Feldman's main concern is finding voices who can speak to a younger generation. "My predicament is not that I don't think the excitement is there," he says. "My predicament is only the fear of whether I'll catch it. Will I see it? Will I know it? I hope so. When I do, I will never be afraid of taking the risk for it. Never. That's what I live for."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
The Orpheus Mystique (and Myths)

BYLINE:  By BARBARA JEPSON

 BODY:
IT is hard to believe that Orpheus turns 30 this season and is pondering how to regenerate itself after its oldest members begin to retire. But this cooperatively run, conductorless chamber orchestra, a musical child of the counterculture, has matured in more ways than one.
 With 65 recordings, four Grammy Awards and countless glowing reviews to its credit, it has carved a niche in the international marketplace. Through educational residencies in the New York area, it has begun the transition to a civic institution. In "process demonstrations" to M.B.A. students and corporate executives, it has been hailed as a paradigm for "flat" management, versus more hierarchical structures. 
 Now, with the recent appointment of a longtime member, the violinist Ronnie Bauch, as managing director, Orpheus simultaneously looks backward and forward. Back to the days when a musician, Julian Fifer, was its executive director. Ahead to a higher level of collaborative leadership in its business affairs than existed under Mr. Fifer and his successor, Harvey Seifter, a theater professional, who resigned under pressure in April during a fiscal crisis. 
"We need to have management that reflects the Orpheus process," the violinist Eric Wyrick said, "not just espouses the process."
Orpheus begins its anniversary festivities with the pianist Richard Goode on Saturday, opening its five-concert subscription series at Carnegie Hall. Then, on Oct. 16, it joins the pianist Andras Schiff at Avery Fisher Hall to celebrate the new season of Great Performers at Lincoln Center.
Yet as it embarks on the next stage in its singular evolution, Orpheus might do well to examine certain questionable claims for itself that do not withstand critical scrutiny. One example graces the brochure for the Carnegie series: "Twenty-eight musicians walk out onto the stage. They sit down and begin to play -- without a conductor. And the music is more brilliant, more vigorously energetic than anything you've ever experienced."
More brilliant than world-class entities like the Cleveland Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic? Or smaller groups like the superb Arts Florissants, directed by William Christie?
Orpheus is without question a breathtakingly precise chamber orchestra. Its players characteristically exhibit a sensitive ear for balances and an appealing "edge of their seats" alertness. At its best, when most longstanding members are on stage and substitutes are few, Orpheus may match the brilliance and vitality of the most venerable and esteemed orchestras, surely achievement enough.
Obviously, concert-brochure hyperbole should probably not be taken too seriously. But the title of a recent book written by Mr. Seifter and Peter Economy, "Leadership Ensemble: Lessons in Collaborative Management From the World's Only Conductorless Orchestra," is downright misleading.
The Prague Chamber Orchestra, founded in 1951, visited New York just last year. The Australian Chamber Orchestra, founded in 1975, appears in New York regularly, having done so most recently in April. In both, the concertmaster leads in 18th-century fashion, cueing and shaping the music. Lesser-known ensembles play conductorless as well. And at least one of them, the New Century Chamber Orchestra, uses collective decision-making to arrive at its interpretations.
The difference is that Orpheus rotates the position of concertmaster for each piece. Interpretations are thrashed out by the concertmaster, a rotating core of section leaders and anyone else who wants to suggest a tempo change or argue an expressive detail. But over the years, the concertmaster has been given greater responsibility in rehearsals, facilitating discussions and deciding which parts of a score to focus on.
This methodology is richly satisfying to Orpheus members. Yet underlying the mystique surrounding their shared leadership is an unproven assertion of superiority. It is true, to cite one recurring theme in articles about the group, that members of conducted orchestras are necessarily more "passive" in rehearsals than Orpheus players. But that does not make conducted performances inherently inferior. Although many are routine, others can be overwhelming in their ability to communicate the heart of a score. Nor does a greater level of player involvement and responsibility always produce memorable results.
INDEED, Orpheus is most effective in virtuosic 20th-century classics by Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Bartok and the like, and it has always had a lithe, sparkling touch with Haydn and Mozart. Although it has expanded its repertory impressively into Ives, Schoenberg and Elliott Carter, it has had less consistent success with Beethoven and with Romantic pieces that need more flexibility of tempo.
Equally troubling is that Orpheus members have long spoken with forked tongues about conductors. They insist they're not against conductors but make sweeping generalizations about them nonetheless.
"What happens over time is that responsibility for the music-making is ceded to the conductor," said Eric Bartlett, a cellist in Orpheus and a member of the New York Philharmonic since 1997. "The ideas are all his, therefore the responsibility is all his, and orchestra members give less and less."
Todd Seeber, who has been a bassist of the Boston Symphony for 15 years and does not play for Orpheus, does not agree that diminishing involvement is inevitable. "There's a certain pride in the job that doesn't allow you to play below a certain level of technique, expression and energy," he said.
Symphony musicians have their frustrations with conductors, to be sure, though many of them gripe as much about pay, management policies or irksome colleagues.
And Orpheus has had its seasons of discontent as well. Because it is a freelance orchestra, members must teach or play elsewhere to supplement their incomes. A decade ago, the group nearly split over compensation issues. Even before Mr. Fifer stepped down as cellist, he became viewed more as an authority figure. Tensions involving the amount of international touring were a factor in his resignation as executive director in 1998.
When Mr. Seifter replaced him, it looked like a classic evolution of a performing-arts organization from mom-and-pop mode to professionally managed operation. Mr. Seifter reversed a $500,000 deficit on an annual budget of $4 million, expanded the New York season and made international touring more selective. He built on Mr. Fifer's ideas, expanding "process demonstrations" and educational residencies considerably.
At the group's insistence, he added musicians to the board and the finance committee. "There was an outcry after Julian left," said Sarah Clarke, an Orpheus violist. "We want the board to know how we feel."
Unfortunately, Mr. Seifter's management style proved incompatible with the group's collaborative ethos. Members grew restive over the degree to which Mr. Seifter was acting as their spokesman. Despite their money-making potential for the players, the "process demonstrations" met with mixed results. "This is not why we joined Orpheus," said Susan Palma, a flutist. In the end, Mr. Seifter's abrupt departure was said to be triggered by board concern over another mounting deficit.
Now Mr. Bauch takes over. Musicians describe him as an approachable, communicative workaholic. Since 1984, he has been the artistic director of the North Country Chamber Players in New Hampshire. A general manager reporting to Mr. Bauch in the areas of subscriptions, contracts and other business matters is expected to be hired soon.
As Orpheus looks to its future, several areas need attention. Although a recently announced three-year global sponsorship from Morgan Stanley, a loyal supporter, will provide some financial security, building up the orchestra's small endowment is a priority for the board and the musicians. The issue of regeneration looms ahead. More than half of the members teach at leading conservatories or universities, and some of their students act as substitutes, but that has periodically led to quality-control problems. Mr. Bauch has suggested an Orpheus institute that would offer graduate-level immersion in the group's distinctive music-making process.
"Can Orpheus survive the turnover of personnel in the orchestra?" Mr. Bauch asked. "Thirty years is an eternity for a string quartet but not that long for a symphony orchestra. We're somewhere in between."
And there are still unresolved issues about what the group should be. "Some people really need a big season with Orpheus," said David Singer, a clarinetist in the orchestra. "Others would be content performing little more than the five concerts at Carnegie."
With 28 musicians as fiercely independent as the Orpheus players, the only guarantee is that the process of addressing such issues will be spirited, involving and unpredictable. But the orchestra has proved itself in the cultural marketplace and is beginning to pass on its legacy. Now if it would just tone down the rhetoric.

HEADLINE: THIS WEEK; 
A Big Band, After a Series Of Small Steps

BYLINE:  By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
THERE'S a bit of lunacy in starting a big band these days. It is a bad economic moment for jazz, and the appetite for large-ensemble jazz is probably at its lowest.
 But here comes a big band led by the bassist Dave Holland, who just turned 56. Mr. Holland left his native England in the late 1960's to play with Miles Davis, and for the last 20 years he has been doing excellent work as a band leader. His impeccably controlled quintet, which has stayed solid for six years, includes the saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Billy Kilson, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson and the trombonist Robin Eubanks. These musicians offer a diverse range of strengths and tend to be at their best in Mr. Holland's cooperative, rhythmically driving group, cruising around in odd meters, accompanied by the leader's unshakable hum. 
 Now Mr. Holland has formed a 13-piece band, centering on the quintet. A somewhat rational person after all, he has gone about it by degrees. First he tried a big band in 1987, in New York, but it never quite took off. Then he reinvented it for the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2000, enlarging quintet pieces for a bigger harmonic palette. Last year he made a first album with the group, "What Goes Around," which has just been released on ECM. And finally, the group is touring in earnest. It stops in New York this week at Birdland, from Wednesday through Saturday.
Mr. Holland says he's now writing pieces that can't be translated back down to quintet, and every member of the big band is featured in roles conceived for him. But Mr. Holland isn't ending the quintet, one of the jewels of the jazz world. "The smaller group is a workshop to get our compositions evolved and streamlined," he said. "After six years, it really works." BEN RATLIFF

HEADLINE: ART; 
Unveiling Hidden Gems, Courtesy of Collectors

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
GREENWICH is known for displaying its prosperity rather conspicuously, so the first half of "Pleasures of Collecting" at the Bruce Museum confirms that there is a rarer aspect to its reputation. It is an exhibition mostly made up of work from private collections in town that has not been exhibited before.
 Much of the art is unbelievably good, and important. The pleasure referred to in the show's title is not just that of the collectors but also that of the viewers. 
 This pleasure is increased by the realization that the show is work only from the Renaissance to the Impressionist period. A second part, in January, will focus on the modern and contemporary periods.
The show was chosen and sometimes persuaded off a collector's wall by Peter Sutton, the Bruce's director. He is also an art historian whose specialty is Dutch painting of the 17th century and he found several weighty works from this time and place. 
Another notable early work is "The Adoration of the Magi" by Giorgio Vasari, a 16th-century Italian who is best known as a writer. His exhaustive "Lives of the Artists" is a a chronicle that begins in the late middle ages. Vasari's 1566 painting is crowded and busy, a characteristic more associated with Mannerism, the style that was a pendulum swing away from more orderly and logical High Renaissance notions.
Since the show was drawn from diverse sources it is surprising to find instances where works are in clear relation. Especially nice is a threesome of portraits of fresh-faced young women. An undated "Head of a Young Girl" in a tondo or round format by the Dutch painter Judith Leyster who lived in Holland from 1609 to 1660 has a near twin in "Miss Rich" also known as "The Charity Girl" by William Hogarth.
Jumping far ahead, the American part of the exhibition includes Willard Metcalf's "The Violets" from 1903. The flowers are an oval-shaped bouquet that echoes the head of a young girl dressed in black who is posed from the waist up against a deep red background. She has a wistful expression, but she is also very sparely and directly presented.
The real show stoppers are French from the latter half of the 19th century. They begin to announce themselves at the entrance to the exhibition with a Manet from 1878. It might almost be the show's mascot because the self-portrait, listed as "bust length," shows a dual aspect to the man. He is known as a pleasure-seeker, a clothes horse and a dandy and here he wears what is obviously a good jacket and cravat, while holding a palette, used in the often messy business of painting. 
Another singular piece, the exhibition's lone sculpture, comes from the same time period as the self-portrait. It is a young girl cast in bronze who stands over three feet tall. At the time it was made, probably between 1879 and 1881, the "Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer" by Edgar Degas was considered shocking for its realism. Degas certainly abetted that perception by outfitting her in a ballet costume of real muslin and satin. 
A famous masterpiece of Pointillism, a style that can be regarded as a sort of firming up of Impressionism, is the figure-filled "A Sunday on the Grande-Jatte" by Georges Seurat. Like Impressionism, Seurat's innovation is rooted in a scientific perception of color but his subject matter is quiet, dignified pleasure. The exhibition includes a study for that painting that is practically unpopulated. Part of the pleasure of looking at it is anticipation, the knowledge crowds will come to that ample green park.
There is a strong example of Impressionism here: "The Cliffs Near Fecamps" by Claude Monet. It was painted in 1881, a couple of decades after the development of Impressionism. It shows the artist taking liberties with the style, such as varying the side and direction of the brush marks to give a sense of the recession of the cliffs in space. An interesting very late Impressionist work is "Landscape in Crozant in the Creuse Valley" by Armand Guillaumin. It was probably painted in 1905 and the dazzling autumn colors anticipate Fauvism. 
The room devoted to American works has sturdy portraits from the Colonial era and some Hudson River School works that include "Sunlight on Newbury Marshes," painted between 1865 and 1875 by Martin Johnson Heade. 
The Bruce's own backyard is included. Childe Hassam was a major member of the Cos Cob Art Colony as was Elmer Livingston MacRae. One of the earliest paintings acquired by the fledgling Bruce Museum was "August Morning," a 1919 painting of cows by Matilda Browne, that is hanging alongside other early acquisitions in the museum's foyer while her robust flower painting "Laurel" (1913) is in the exhibition.
"Pleasures of Collecting; Part 1, Renaissance to Impressionist Masterpieces" is at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through Jan. 5. Information: (201) 869-0376 or www.brucemuseum.org.

HEADLINE: From Tickets to Souvenirs, Arts-Related Spending Rises in County 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
THE role of the arts in Westchester County's economy increased by 71 percent between 1995 and 2000, according to a study conducted by the Westchester Arts Council in cooperation with the county's Office of Tourism. 
 The study's results were announced as many county arts groups continue to struggle with the economic fallout of Sept. 11 and the recession, and as county budget discussions, with potential cuts to the arts, were about to begin. 
 Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the council, said that spending by the county's nonprofit arts organizations and their audiences amounted to $92.8 million in 2000, compared with $54.2 million in 1995. The figure included spending on nonticket items like restaurants, souvenirs, parking and baby sitters. 
In addition, the study reported that the number of full-time jobs supported by arts-related activities in Westchester -- including jobs in industries like construction, banking and food -- rose to 2,859 from 2,047 over the five-year period. The number of full-time jobs in arts organizations alone increased to 1,697 from 939.
The county study was part of a larger survey conducted by Americans for the Arts, a Washington-based group that collected data from 91 localities nationwide. The goal was to provide an economic profile of the country's nonprofit arts industry. 
The study included data collected from 82 Westchester arts organizations and 750 randomly selected audience members at events like concerts and films. Although the data was collected before the events of Sept. 11 and the weakened economy caused spending on the arts to drop significantly in the county, Ms. Langsam said the information was still relevant. 
"The growth has been so enormous that Sept. 11 could not possibly have wiped it out," she said. "You need to look at it as a trend, and the trend is that the arts are growing in Westchester County. When we do our next survey in 2005, our hope is that Sept. 11 will be a blip."
The Westchester data also showed that local municipalities, and the county and state, benefited from an increase in tax revenues and fees collected from arts organizations and their audiences between 1995 and 2000. Revenues collected by local governments rose to $6 million from $4.5 million, while revenues collected by the state increased to $8 million from $5 million. "We're really giving back to the state and the county much more than they're investing in the arts," Ms. Langsam said. 
Westchester County contributed $766,200 to the arts council's budget in 2000 and $952,500 this year. County Executive Andrew J. Spano, speaking at a news conference held at the council's headquarters here, said that the county might not be able to sustain its current level of support for the arts. Because of state-mandated spending programs, he said, "We're facing the ugliest budget in the history of Westchester." He said that the arts had to compete with other discretionary budget items like domestic violence programs and emergency services, and that the Board of Legislators would "cut the arts" before food programs.
Arts leaders countered that the arts provided far more than revenue-yielding entertainment. Stephen Apkon, executive director of the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, said that the arts helped companies attract new employees to the county, while Michael Botwinick, director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, said that the "real bonus of the arts lies beyond jobs and tax revenues in the interest and activity that makes Westchester more than a bedroom community." 
Lisa Deutsch, executive director of the Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains, said the county's arts organizations should be counted as human service, as well as cultural, organizations.
"We're involved in special education and mental health," she said. "The arts don't exist in a little bubble all unto themselves. They're part of everything this county is all about."

HEADLINE: Last Call for a Smoke 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
JOHN RYERSON, the owner of McGuire's Restaurant and Comedy Club in Bohemia, said he went $250,000 into hock two years ago to create a separate room for smokers.
 There was no other choice, Mr. Ryerson said last week, if he were to comply with a 1995 Suffolk County law that sought to protect non-smoking patrons from secondhand smoke. "It was that or go smoke-free and find another job," said Mr. Ryerson, adding that, for his business, smoking is the difference between profit and loss. 
 Now he and other restaurant and bar-restaurant owners in Suffolk and Nassau are complaining bitterly that local officials are about to change the rules again, negating some owners' expensive compliance efforts with outright bans on smoking in virtually all public indoor places. 
Almost nothing would be spared, not even special rooms like Mr. Ryerson's and other dwindling public domains for indoor smokers, including beery multiscreen sports bars and smoky pubs and taverns where cigarettes and drinks go hand in hand.
"Now I won't even have the income to pay for my investment," said Mr. Ryerson, who is the chairman of the Suffolk County Restaurant and Tavern Association, which has about 200 members. 
But this week, when proposals to ban smoking in bars and restaurants move forward on a broad front as Nassau, Suffolk, New York City and Westchester take up the issue more or less simultaneously, economic arguments are colliding with increasing concerns about the health risks to workers exposed to secondhand smoke for long periods.
Supporters of the new restrictions said those risks are too great to ignore any longer.
Officials supporting the new restrictions said they would close what Brian Muellers, a Nassau County legislator, called "one enormous loophole."
"We have to protect the employees who work in these places," said Mr. Muellers, a Democrat from Locust Valley. "Secondhand smoke has been classified as a Class A carcinogen. There is no other workplace where workers are allowed to be exposed to that."
Estimates vary, but government and industry officials said that as many as 50,000 Long Islanders toil in smoke-filled workplaces, the foot soldiers in a hospitality industry that accounts for a large slice of the Island's leading service sector.
Supporters of the new restrictions, backed by the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association, say recent research has unearthed mounting evidence that the effects of secondhand smoke are even more pernicious than previously believed. When bartenders and bar workers run triple the average risk of lung cancer and inhale the equivalent of a half a pack of cigarettes on every eight-hour shift, they said, the need to act is obvious and immediate.
"The science is what is really pushing this issue," said Will Stoner, the regional advocacy director for the American Cancer Society. But the groups have been pushing too, pinning their hopes on the city and the three counties after the State Senate failed to vote on a ban during its last session. The measure passed in the Assembly.
Bans in the city and counties, proponents point out, would create smoke-free bars and restaurants for two-thirds of the state's residents and set the stage for future state action.
At the behest of Judy Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader of the Nassau Legislature, officials from the city and the three counties have met twice in Nassau to coordinate their efforts. "We felt that uniformity was a key to success for this effort," Ms. Jacobs said. "We need to create a level playing field for all the restaurants, bars and workplaces."
The Nassau ban would take effect in March, matching the effective date of the proposed New York City ban. Bingo halls would have until January 2004 to comply. The Suffolk law would take effect in January 2004.
Nassau gets the legislative ball rolling on Monday, when the Legislature holds a public hearing, and possibly a vote, on the issue. The body's 10 Democrats appeared to be united last week behind the ban, but the 9 Republicans question the rush and the economic impact, and will seek a delay. With the Democratic county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, leaning toward support of the ban, the one-vote Democratic margin could be all that is needed.
On the same day, Westchester county legislators will meet on three competing measures, including one that matches the Nassau and Suffolk initiatives.
The Suffolk Legislature, home of the country's first substantial ban on smoking in public places in 1984, holds a hearing on its bill on Tuesday, but probably won't vote until next month.
The measure is sponsored by a Democrat, Brian X. Foley of Blue Point, and co-sponsored by the Republican presiding officer, Paul Tonna of West Hills. But opposition is also bipartisan.
Some legislators are sensitive to health arguments but still troubled that the county would be changing requirements so soon after the 1995 law. "We forced a great many restaurants to make a significant investment in separately ventilated rooms," said David Bishop, a Democrat from West Babylon. "This law would render that worthless."
The New York City Council follows on Thursday with a hearing on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to ban smoking in bars, restaurants, offices, pool halls, bingo parlors, bowling alleys and private clubs.
While Nassau appeared to be in the lead in what opponents of the bans saw as a race to enact, Mr. Bloomberg's initiative, which he launched in August, attracted national and even international attention. "They all jumped on Bloomberg's wagon, he started it," said William Leudemann, who owns a catering business in Farmingville and is president of the Suffolk County Restaurant and Tavern Association and also of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association.
Backers of the anti-smoking campaign argue that the bans will be an economic benefit to bars and bar-restaurants. Mr. Stoner said a smokeless environment would increase patronage by the 80 percent of Long Island residents who don't smoke. He and others said studies showed that restaurants and bars in California actually fared better after the state banned smoking in those establishments. 
Smoking bans in bars and restaurants are also in force in Delaware, a number of Texas municipalities, and in towns and cities scattered across the country.
Mr. Ryerson said the California ban hurt some businesses. "Overall there was a small increase for restaurants," he said. "But if you look at the taverns and bars, they had a decline."
But Thomas Valenti said business increased after he banned smoking at his Piccolo Ristorante in Bellmore in 1998. "We had to put up with complaints from customers who didn't like the smoke and we didn't like it ourselves," he said. "It's just not good for your health."
He predicted that a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants would quickly gain acceptance. "It's not going to hurt anybody," he said. "You might have a temporary thing where some people get upset, but in two weeks or a month everybody will forget about it."
Mr. Ryerson said his employees chose to work where smoking was permitted. "There is no shortage of jobs in nonsmoking restaurants," he said, "so if a waitress or waiter chooses to work in a bar where smoking is allowed, they do so because it's more lucrative."
Dawn Marie, a bartender at McGuire's who declined to give her last name, said she had worked eight-hour shifts in the smoking area for more than a year, felt no ill effects and opposed a smoking ban.
"I am a nonsmoker, I'm very into health, I work out on a daily basis, and I would definitely feel a difference," she said. "And I don't." She said that ventilating equipment cleared the air. 
Roger H. Corbin, a Democrat from Westbury and the deputy presiding officer of the Nassau Legislature, said he wished he could speak to Dawn Marie. "Feeling the effects of secondhand smoke can take a long time," said Mr. Corbin, a sponsor of the proposed smoking ban. "I would like to talk to her 20 years from now and ask her how she feels about the risk then. And if she doesn't feel she's at risk, what about her coworkers?"
"For some people, maybe that's the only place they can work," Mr. Corbin said. "But you don't have to kill them. You don't have to make them work in a poisoned atmosphere." 
He cited a national estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta that as many as 65,000 nonsmokers die each year from exposure to secondhand smoke.
Peter J. Schmitt, a Republican from Massapequa and the minority leader of the Nassau Legislature, said Republicans were "not unsympathetic to the goals" of the proposed ban. But he said they wanted to address the plight of owners who paid for equipment to comply with current county law.
"This government told business owners in 1999, only three years ago, that if you spend the money for a separate ventilation system and a separate room it would be O.K. for you to have smoking on the premises," he said. "The proposed legislation makes no provision for these expenses business owners made in good faith."
Ms. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader, said the percentage of owners who undertook the work was "extremely small." But she said supporters of the smoking ban were willing to listen to any reasonable argument. "If there is something they bring up that seems legitimate, we're not closing the door," she said. "But we are certainly very intent on the health reasons for doing this." 
Mr. Schmitt said that "the rush here to get this done" was part of a broader agenda advanced by groups that "want cigarettes gone."
"This is moving in a very intrusive direction," he said. "Soon they are going to move into the home." 
Mr. Schmitt and others who have not endorsed the bans said concern over employee health in the workplace properly belonged to other government agencies. "If you are approaching this from health and safety of workers that really belongs with the state and federal governments," Mr. Schmitt said. "If they are saying there is not an emergency, then why is Nassau County, with all its troubles, doing something that could impact on our revenue streams or businesses in this county?" 
Mr. Muellers, the Democratic legislator from Locust Valley, said the county was acting appropriately. "The federal and state governments are both abdicating their responsibility to protect these workers, and so the county is stepping in," he said.
Carl Marcellino, a Republican state senator from Oyster Bay and a cosponsor of a measure that would have imposed a ban statewide, said the bill never reached the floor of the Republican-controlled Senate after it was opposed by upstate small business interests including bar and tavern owners. Press reports said Governor Pataki brought pressure to keep the Senate bill from coming to a vote.
"I am a supporter of the concept and would have voted for it," Mr. Marcellino said.
Some opponents of the county measures said local officials risked lawsuits charging they overstepped their authority. Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the Suffolk legislature, said such challenges had already lost in the federal courts.
"It's no longer an open question as to the legal authority of a municipality acting through its legislative body to place prohibitions or restrictions on public places," Mr. Sabatino said. "The law in this area has been decided."

Norwalk Hands Baton to a Symphony Builder

BYLINE:  By VALERIE CRUICE 

 BODY:
WHEN the Norwalk Symphony put the word out that it was looking for a new music director in 1968, there were 12 responses. Last year, the symphony's search committee was inundated with 185 applications, many of them from overseas.
 Pretty impressive for a 62-year old community orchestra. Not bad for a group that started out with all volunteer musicians and still has a few in its ranks. Noteworthy because the Norwalk Symphony is one of seven orchestras vying for audiences and contributions in southwestern Connecticut. 
 Add to that the overall economic uncertainty in the arts world, and the challenges -- never mind the music-making -- are daunting.
Diane Wittry, who will be the symphony's new music director, the first woman in the post in Connecticut, said she was up to the challenge of strengthening the group's identity as a community orchestra.
Ms. Wittry's most recent work has been with the Allentown Symphony in Pennsylvania, where she has been music director and conductor since 1995. She will continue to hold those posts concurrently with her Norwalk Symphony appointment, which became effective in May.
"She did marvels with the Allentown Symphony," said Dr. Richard Epstein, president of the board of governors of the Norwalk Symphony Society and a bassoonist with the orchestra for 25 years.
Mr. Epstein, who is also a dentist, said that Ms. Wittry improved the quality of the Allentown orchestra, increased the number of concerts and made the organization financially secure. The Allentown Symphony has a $900,000 annual budget, he said, while Norwalk has a budget of $360,000.
Known as an orchestra builder, Ms. Wittry was recently cited as a conductor to watch in Symphony Magazine, the publication of the American Symphony Orchestra League. She is a sought-after guest conductor and has worked with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the San Diego Symphony, the Houston Symphony, the Florida Philharmonic and the Osaka Symphoniker Orchestra in Japan.
In addition to her commitment to Allentown, Ms. Wittry remains the artistic adviser of the Symphony of Southeast Texas, after serving as its music director from 1991 to 2000.
Ms. Wittry, who declines to give her age except to say that she is in her 40's, received a bachelor of music degree in violin performance from the University of Southern California in 1983, where she also earned a masters of music in instrumental conducting in 1985.
Her teachers and mentors have included Sir Peter Maxwell Davis, Michael Tilson Thomas, Daniel Lewis and Gustav Meier. Her predecessor, Jesse Levine, resigned from the Norwalk Symphony in December 2000, ending a 20-year tenure. Mr. Epstein said it was a mutual separation.
Ms. Wittry will make her debut Oct. 19 at the Norwalk Concert Hall. The program will feature excerpts from Mozart, Beethoven, Offenbach, Berlioz and more.
During Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, the mayor of Norwalk, Alex Knopp, will be pressing the key on a synthesizer that simulates the sound of a cannon.
Ms. Wittry blew into Norwalk for a few days in mid-September from her home in New Jersey, meeting local politicians, educators and corporate executives, giving interviews and brainstorming with her board.
"As a music director you learn to do great things on a limited budget," she said, seated in the symphony's offices between appointments. "I feel strongly that a music director's job is to help with fund-raising. I love going out into the communities."
Mr. Epstein said the Norwalk Symphony has had its share of difficulties. Audience attendance has slipped and subscriptions are down.
Ms. Wittry wants to offer more programs -- there are now four classical and two family concerts -- and occasionally take the orchestra outside the concert hall, perhaps with a summer series on the waterfront. She said she loves to put unexpected things into the programs, such as special lighting, videos and dancers.
"I pick my music very carefully, pieces that are technically well-crafted," she said. 
For live performances, Ms. Wittry said that "much of the music written in the 20th century is vital and fresh and seems to relate to our life more; Stravinsky, Copeland, the jazz influences."
"At the same time to temper this with the Three Bs is a balance," she said, referring to Bach, Beethoven and Brahms.

Commercial Realty Firms Broaden Their Nets

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
RESPONDING to a paucity of deals to broker during the economic slowdown, some commercial real estate firms in New Jersey are cutting fees, but many others are looking to generate new revenues with new lines of service.
 "Most real estate providers are moving in one of the two directions," said William Cariste, a managing principal at Newmark Real Estate. "In times like these, it's traditional to see extreme competitiveness with fees and incentives offered to customers -- and that is happening now. 
 "But in lieu of doing that some real estate firms are adding a lot of services."
Jeffrey M. Schotz of GVA Williams, observed, "Everything used to be focused on the transaction, on getting the deal done." But now, Mr. Schotz said, brokers are moving to provide services that cover a client from "shopping to occupancy." 
This means that a company wanting to lease or buy office space in New Jersey to suit its particular needs might hire a brokerage to handle everything from finding the best existing space for the price to doing the renovations. A group of investors wanting to buy commercial property could hire a broker not only to make the deal but also to put together creative financing and manage the property after the sale, providing such special services as computerized lease monitoring, back-up data service, building security and energy-efficiency analysis.
Some firms are adding new divisions. Others are broadening their reach through "strategic alliances" -- partnerships with other companies that provide specialized service. GVA Williams partnered with S.O.S. Security of Parsippany last year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
"Security became more important to both landlords and tenants," Mr. Schotz said, "and customers began to ask us about it. If you own a building 20 years old, or you are moving into one, there may be no security measures other than locks on the doors.
"Now we have a consultant we can recommend to you that will determine what is needed. Building alarms? A secure room? Based on your business and what you want to integrate, we can analyze costs and then do the work."
Adding such specialized services strengthens relationships with customers, Mr. Schotz said, besides "creating profit centers." GVA Williams sometimes includes the cost of security service in the overall fee for a project, or it might charge a separate fee.
Expertise in negotiating fees can itself be considered a service. The Staubach Company, a national firm with regional headquarters in Murray Hill, recently added fee negotiation to its line.
"When a construction job is involved," said Tom Stanton, a managing principal of Staubach in Murray Hill, "there are supervisory fees, profit and overhead fees, etc., which are best negotiated by people who really understand the market, and people who have a feel for market conditions. We are providing an in-house salaried individual to do this."
Staubach has offered interior design and construction services to brokerage customers since it began operating in New Jersey almost four years ago. It has expanded into construction and development work, Mr. Stanton said.
Frank Cotillo, an experienced construction manager, was hired 18 months ago to head a new construction division. Mr. Cotillo's group has completed various kinds of projects for Staubach clients, including construction of new offices for a Newark company that sells beepers and renovation of a Morristown office building for a securities trading firm and an office-lab in Parsippany for a biotechnology company.
Currently, Staubach's construction team is at work on renovating a building on lower Broadway in Manhattan to suit the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. hired Staubach to find new space for its Northeast regional office after its offices were destroyed in the World Trade Center attack. About 500 S.E.C. employees were hastily moved to the Broadway building as soon as a lease was negotiated -- and they are to remain in place while construction work goes on, increasing the difficulty of the project. 
Mr. Cotillo said another challenge lay in designing ceiling lighting that would enhance the natural light and not disturb the historic window line. But that has worked out well, he said, because now expertise in lighting design is evolving into a specialized service that Staubach can offer. 
Staubach is also creating two new advisory services, for educational institutions and municipalities. "The skills we are always selling to corporate clients are highly applicable to the public world: cost control, time milestones, construction and delivery of property," Mr. Stanton said. "There is a very complicated procurement process for governmental and educational entities, and we provide the ability to handle the stringencies of that process."
STAUBACH did the feasibility study for Montclair State University, which is constructing a new parking deck for its performing arts complex. That project required consulting experts in civil engineering, parking structure design, parking lot operation, institutional architecture and other fields, Mr. Stanton said, "and basically delivering a team that could handle the entire project."
As part of its government service initiative, Mr. Stanton said, the firm is developing expertise on federal Urban Enterprise Zone requirements, procedures and benefits.
Newmark Real Estate, a national firm that has offices in East Rutherford, is "moving heavily into transaction management," according to Mr. Cariste.
The economic downturn has provided an opportunity to hire experienced professionals who have been laid off, Mr. Cariste said, which in turn has helped to generate expanded service lines. Newmark is offering commercial property customers a large number of added services for extra fees -- including preliminary analysis of space to determine if it meets a particular industry's standards for square feet, energy efficiency and special features.
In a time of downsizing because of economic setbacks and uncertainty, Mr. Cariste said, providing an analysis that points out how industry standards may be changing and where a property stands in the flux is reassuring to clients. "They may be adopting a measure of austerity," he said, "and putting that in context can be a comfort."
"We also are now managing tenants through the move to new space," he said. "We provide construction, computer wiring and acquisition, furniture and installation, decorating and moving services."
"The trick in managing all those things," Mr. Cariste added, "is in taking profits where they can be taken without stripping a transaction of its value to the customer."
Meanwhile, a relatively new company, the Schultz Group, is finding success in a downturn through continuing emphasis on its motto: "Niches mean riches."
While Mr. Schotz of GVA William contends that the globalization of corporate business is one reason there is increased demand for extensive broker services, Jonathan B. Schultz, president and chief executive of the 12-year-old Schultz Group, said smaller companies and investors have complex needs, too.
Over the past five years, Schultz has made a specialty of managing distressed property -- for example, commercial buildings that fall into the hands of mortgage banks through foreclosure. "We can rescue and reposition the properties, providing all the technological and construction expertise and local knowledge and contacts, that are needed," he asserted.
Currently, Mr. Schultz said, his company is developing a line of service to small institutions, pension and investment funds and private investors, who buy or hold New Jersey retail properties. The retail market has remained quite healthy throughout the current downturn, he noted.
"We saw several years ago that as retail brokerage goes, there are not many that can do leasing, management and asset management under one roof," Mr. Schultz said. "We've raised the level of intelligent service and technical support to institutional and private investors, who need the same sophistication as larger firms."

New Life for Rundown Site on Yonkers Waterfront

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
The $53 million Larkin Center the new home of the Yonkers Public Library and the city's Board of Education -- opened late last month, offering hope for the long-awaited rebirth of this city's downtown waterfront.
 The imposing concrete and glass structure on the site of the former Otis Elevator headquarters looks out on a formerly decaying industrial neighborhood, a 4.5 mile strip along the river, that these days is in a state of busy activity. 
 The 200,000-square-foot, four-story building -- its first two stories are double height -- is the first of a number of new waterfront buildings to be completed here. These projects include the $35 million renovation of the Metro-North Station across River Street from Larkin Center; it is scheduled to be finished next fall. A $10 million six-story municipal parking garage for 600 cars is nearing completion a block away. A $60 million, 266-apartment complex called Hudson Park, being built by Collins Enterprises of Stamford, Conn., next to the waterfront, is scheduled to be finished next summer. And work on the $13 million Esplanade Park, a 1.5-mile-long public promenade along the shoreline, has already been completed. 
For more than 40 years, city leaders have proffered grand plans for revitalizing the waterfront, but until recently few projects actually moved ahead. In 1987, a proposed 1,850-unit condominium project fell victim to a construction moratorium imposed in connection with a federal housing desegregation order. A year later, the city converted a power plant into a 136-unit condo called the Scrimshaw House. Although it is now fully occupied, Scrimshaw House was slow to fill up and stood alone on the desolate waterfront until last fall, when construction along the river began in earnest.
Considered a linchpin to the downtown's revitalization, Larkin Center is the city's largest investment in the waterfront district. The Yonkers Industrial Development Agency purchased the building from the city with $800,000 raised by selling revenue bonds. The city had purchased it from the Port Authority of New York, which bought it from Otis in the early 1980's and occupied until the late 1990's. The Industrial Development Agency then retained the Manhattan-based National Development Council -- a nonprofit organization that provides financial consulting to municipalities and other nonprofits -- to manage the project.
From that point on, financing and construction were overseen by the National Development Council's Housing and Economic Development Corporation -- which has built, among other things, 4,000 units of below-market-rate housing for various communities, residential buildings for the University of Washington in Seattle and parking garages in Syracuse. In Westchester, the council is building housing for a $6 million artists' community in Peekskill. 
Daniel Marsh III, president of the Housing and Economic Development Corporation, said the Yonkers project involved gutting, refacing and expanding by 40,000 square feet the original 160,000-square-foot, 77-year-old building, which Otis Elevator had occupied until 1983. (Elisha Otis began manufacturing elevators in Yonkers a few years after the railroad came to the city in 1849, spurring its development as an industrial center. Otis Elevator is now a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation, based in Hartford, and no longer has a presence in Yonkers.)
The first order of business when construction began two years ago was ridding the abandoned interior of the building of asbestos and a thick coating of bacteria-laden pigeon droppings -- "a particularly terrible combination," Mr. Marsh said. 
Edward A. Sheeran, a special assistant to Mayor John D. Spencer, said: "The building at that point was horrible to look at, but we all closed our eyes and visualized what it could be. We realized it had so much potential."
By the time the cleanup had been finished, only the frame, the floors and the roof of the older red building were retained. On the back side of the building, the original brick facade can still be seen. 
The National Development Council and the city commissioned Highland Associates of Clarks Summit, Pa., to be the architects for the project, providing them with a number of design objectives. Joseph G. Rominski, the project designer, said, "Our charge was to give the new building a strong civic presence and at the same time have it blend in to the existing context and character of the downtown waterfront." He noted that besides the industrial sites nearby, a Federal-style United States Post Office is to the south of the new Larkin Center.
The proximity of the Hudson River also influenced both the exterior and interior design. Outside, for energy conservation -- in particular as a shield against the harshest rays of the afternoon sun over the river -- Larkin Center's massive glass windows are tinted blue, in sharp contrast to its white concrete walls.
The plans for the interior evolved over two years in meetings held two and three times a month, said Stephen E. Force, director of the Yonkers Public Library. Most of the rooms -- including a number of public meeting rooms and the children's and teens' sections -- look out over the river and the Palisades on its west bank. Also in the new children's sections, the architecture incorporates images and shapes related to navigation, like sailboats and lighthouses. Since the city demolished its former Carnegie Library in 1982, the branch serving this neighborhood had been housed in temporary quarters, a former department store called Genung's, where the children's room was in the windowless basement.
With 1,800 library visitors expected daily, materials -- like the carpet tiles on the floors -- were chosen to withstand heavy use. Other materials include granite and stonelike porcelain tile in the public lobbies, wood veneers with contrasting tones on end panels and service desks and limestone panels on many interior walls, said Ronda Beemer, another architect on the project.
Meanwhile, in response to the new construction, some of the buildings in an existing 700,000-square-foot industrial park next to Larkin Center have been upgraded. In particular, Joseph Cotter, president of Hudson View Associates, which owns ipark, as it is called, said his company had recently spent $10 million to upgrade another Otis Elevator complex dating back to 1892.
The streetscapes in the industrial park, whose tenants include Kawasaki Rail Car and an extension of Mercy College, were also changed to blend with the street designs around the new construction. "The library has added a whole element of dynamism to the neighborhood," said Mr. Cotter, whose company also owns a 1.5-million-square-foot industrial park in Lake Success on Long Island.
The council is leasing 97,500 square feet of office space in Larkin Center to the Board of Education and 75,000 square feet to the public library. The remaining space -- the main entrance, a 43-foot-high atrium and a 464-seat auditorium -- will be used for a number of public and private purposes, including municipal functions and receptions. The floor of the entrance welcomes visitors with an elaborate design of the city's seal rendered in granite and tile.
At the ribbon cutting on Sept. 18, Gov. George E. Pataki described Larkin Center as "magnificent transformation of an abandoned industrial building" and said it had sent a signal that Yonkers's waterfront was finally being reborn.

Treating Health Care

BYLINE:  By SANDRA SALMANS 

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
RISA LAVIZZO-MOUREY was in middle school when she had her first lesson in the economics of health care. The Boeing Company was laying off workers, leaving them without health insurance. Her parents, both doctors practicing in a fairly poor Seattle neighborhood, had to decide each month which patients to bill.
 "I asked, 'What does insurance have to do with medical care?' " Ms. Lavizzo-Mourey recalled recently. 
 The answer, she learned, was "everything." 
At age 48, a doctor specializing in geriatrics, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey (pronounced la-VEE-zo MOOR-ay) is still exploring the connection and -- like her parents, but on a national stage -- juggling the needs of health care providers and the uninsured. In December she will become chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation here, the nation's largest philanthropy devoted to health and health care. She will be the first woman and the first African-American to head the foundation, which has an endowment of about $8 billion and distributes more than $400 million a year.
Precisely where Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey will leave her mark is unclear. She has already been at Robert Wood Johnson for 18 months as a senior vice president, overseeing grant-making in the foundation's two health care areas -- improving access to health care and supporting people with such chronic illnesses as diabetes and asthma. The foundation's two other goals are reducing substance abuse and promoting healthy lifestyles -- the last goal, added last year, was partly inspired by the obesity epidemic. 
As Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey noted, grant-making occurs in three-year cycles, and she does not plan to micromanage operations. She does talk enthusiastically about increasing the role of information technology to reduce hospital errors and measure results, and about working in partnership with other foundations to have a greater effect.
"She's not one to slash and burn," noted Judith Rodin, president of the University of Pennsylvania, who is a longtime colleague. "She'll respect programs that have succeeded."
Her strength, said Dr. Rodin, lies in thinking creatively, in finding "nonobvious solutions."
Soft-spoken and low-key, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey grew up with the expectation that she would become a doctor. She left the State University of New York at Stony Brook after her junior year to enter Harvard Medical School, then trained in geriatrics at the University of Pennsylvania. The constellation of chronic illnesses in elderly patients made the cases more intellectually challenging, she said, and she felt she could made a difference. Another factor was that with Medicare in place, "policy issues were front and center."
"I wanted to be a part of that." she said.
To complement her clinical skills, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey next acquired an M.B.A. in health care administration from the Wharton School at Penn. In 1992 Dr. Louis Sullivan, then the secretary of Health and Human Services, recruited her to work in the first Bush administration. She stayed on as a member of the White House Task Force of Health Care Reform, the Clintons' ill-fated attempt to create a national health care system.
A signed photograph from Hillary Rodham Clinton hangs on her office wall at the foundation, but Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey diplomatically sidesteps any comments about Senator Clinton. She is at pains to avoid partisan politics, quickly pointing out that she was a Republican appointee. In seeking health care reform, the Clintons made the mistake of trying "to divorce policy and politics," she said.
"What I took away is that health care is an intensely political issue," she added, and that the American public is not ready for radical change. She still harbors some optimism that Medicare benefits will be extended to prescription drugs, but noted that change must be incremental.
"She'll still be committed to universal coverage, but in more imaginative ways," predicted Donna Shalala, who ran the Department of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration. "She's been a player in health care policy for a while."
In the White House, added Dr. Shalala, who is now president of the University of Miami, "I had 250 people in health care policy, and she was one of the brightest."
When Congress resoundingly rejected health care reform in 1994, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where she headed the Institute on Aging. It was a period when hospitals, which had historically never given much thought to their bottom line, began to feel the financial pressures of managed care. 
"What was so impressive to me was that, on a number of occasions, we had to revise the budget and she'd come up with a plan to deal with the new reality," said William Kelly, who headed the university's health system at the time and persuaded her to come back to Penn. "It was a very difficult time and Risa was in the middle of it. She knows the real world of health care and the difficulties of trying to deliver the best possible health care in an environment where it's not rewarded."
At Penn, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey made headlines by urging doctors to resume the largely abandoned practice of house calls. Her nurse practitioner made most of the calls, but every week Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey dropped in on new patients and a handful of others to check on their treatment. House calls show practitioners how patients actually live and the practical barriers to good health care, she noted, and can also save costs by preventing emergency room visits. 
At the same time, she kept a foot firmly planted in policy. Last spring she presented a report on racial and ethnic disparities in the delivery of health care. The report, issued by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, found that minorities had higher death rates, owing partly to different treatments for heart disease and cancer. But the disparities occurred even when racial groups had similar incomes and insurance coverage. A crucial factor, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey said, was that neither doctors nor patients could get around racial and ethnic stereotypes.
The health care system is manipulated more effectively by people who are well educated, middle class, white and assertive, she said.
"Some people who feel they're being disrespected become passive," she said.
It is a situation she has seen with elderly patients as well as members of minority groups. She recalled times when a young relative of a geriatric patient "is hammering me with questions, and the patient is looking on in horror and pulls me aside and says, 'She's usually a nice person.' "
Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey understands first-hand how being a minority can affect the quality of health care. Soon after she moved to the Philadelphia area two decades ago, her daughter became ill and she rushed the toddler to a hospital. "What do any mother and child look like at 3 in the morning?" Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey asked. "Haggard, sleep-deprived."
The health care providers were "dismissive," she said, even when she used medical terms. "It wasn't until I said, 'Wait, I don't agree with that diagnosis; we have to get someone else in here' " that the hospital staff scrambled to help -- and found that the girl had pneumonia.
Now her daughter, a recent Princeton graduate, is working in Washington, her son has just graduated from high school, and Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey is an empty-nester. She and her husband, Robert, who has a doctorate in sociology but currently manages investments, are planning to move to Princeton. For the past year and a half, she has been commuting from a suburb of Philadelphia, getting on the road at 5:45 a.m. when "it's just me and the truckers," she said. 
Once she moves, she plans to resume a geriatric practice part-time -- including house calls -- through a faculty appointment at a medical school.
"In a job like this, it's easy to get out of touch," she observed. 
For the same reason, she has hung in her office a large photograph of her late mother, a pediatrician, examining a young boy. "It keeps me grounded," she said.

HEADLINE: The View From/Newtown; 
Over the Guardrail, The Other Side of Paradise

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Peggy and Gary Fillion moved into the Riverside section of Newtown last June, they thought they had just purchased a small piece of paradise. Nestled along the shore of the Housatonic River, they enjoy the river as their backyard. A pine forest where eagles roost frames the background. 
 "It's so nice sitting out back," Ms. Fillion said on a recent Sunday. "I can count 16 swans on the lake." 
 The Fillions paid only passing attention to the Interstate 84 guardrail at the top of a rising slope just 40 feet from their front lawn. When they were house hunting, they had always visited during midday when traffic flow was smoother and less noticeable than during rush hours. And, they were totally unprepared for the roar of cars and trucks that thunder past every night and into the morning. 
"I heard the tires screech the first night after we moved in and thought a truck had come over the guardrail," Ms. Fillion said.
The Fillions' neighbors have been complaining about traffic noise for almost 30 years to no avail. But truck and automobile debris flying off the highway, which threatens their safety, exceeds their displeasure with the noise pollution. Tires, mufflers and a leaf spring -- a piece of vehicle suspension -- are among the objects that have ejected over the guardrail into residential streets and yards where children play along Underhill Road and Waterview Drive.
One neighbor recounted several years ago when a buck was struck on the highway and catapulted off the overpass, landing near the place where Riverside children wait for the school bus each day. Before that, a truck carrying aluminum siding dumped its load over the same guardrail onto Riverside Road.
"If a car flipped over, it could come into my house," said Cheryl McGrath, who lives next door to the Fillions with her husband and two children. A tire landed on the Fillions' roof before they bought their house, Ms. McGrath said.
Reinvigorated by Ms. Fillion's lead, they are demanding action by the State Department of Transportation to keep their families safe. They want the D.O.T. to erect safety barriers and are no longer willing to accept the explanation that the state has no money for the job.
The neighbors also want protection from the air pollution caused by the unrelenting traffic because there is nothing to muffle either the din or the dust. Randall Pineau, who has lived with his wife and three sons on Waterview Drive for eight years, said the windows in his dining room shake and resonate from the traffic vibration. Douglas Ross, who also has lived in Riverside for eight years, said the vibration has caused nails to pop out of the sheet rock at his house. 
Mr. Ross said he believed it is only a matter of time before an accident happens. "It's not a question of if, but when," he said.
Ms. Fillion and the other neighbors said they knew they were moving to houses near the highway, but they never imagined the magnitude of the problem. None of them had spent the night with the roar of traffic, much of it from tractor trailers, until they moved in. 
"We absolutely loved the waterfront," Ms. Fillion said. "Where else are you going to find this kind of pristine, rural site within 60 miles of New York? When we looked at the house it was midday, and the traffic wasn't running that much. We moved here from Michigan where there were barriers everywhere along the highway. We assumed the noise wasn't that bad since there were no barriers. We were rudely awakened by the sound of construction and trucks during the evening and early morning."
Before the neighbors moved in, they said they were unaware of the falling debris and did not think, once they settled, the state would permit such a dangerous condition to persist.
Desmond P. Dickey, D.O.T. transportation planner, said the earliest complaint his department has on record from Riverside was logged in August 1981. The D.O.T. has received 40 or 50 complaints over the years, he said. The neighbors' activism has gotten them to 36th place on a list of 145 neighborhoods waiting for wooden noise walls, otherwise known as Type II retrofit barriers. 
Mr. Dickey said that the barriers are in high demand, but "they are not specifically engineered for safety. They do provide extra safety beyond the parapet, or guardrail, that acts as a crash protection system." 
Mr. Dickey also said the barriers are funded solely through the state, "which is always looking for ways to trim fat. The State Legislature stopped funding the barriers during the recession in 1990 and never restored any money."
A moratorium has been in effect since then, he said.
Not satisfied with that answer and worried about their safety, the neighbors have brought their grievance to the attention of Representative James Maloney, who in turn contacted First Selectman Herb Rosenthal and requested his assistance.
Mr. Maloney said the United States Federal Highway Administration provides funding for protective barriers to the state to use at its discretion. Although Connecticut already has a priority list for barriers for noise abatement, Mr. Maloney said safety has to take priority over sound.
"Kids could be hurt waiting at the bus stop," Mr. Maloney said. "We have to start with the notion that this is a legitimate safety concern that requires moving Riverside to the top of the priority list."
Mr. Dickey said he would move the bus stop to a site deemed safer than directly under a bridge. "That would be my decision," he said. "Common sense would dictate that any object coming off the highway could fall there. People sometimes throw things from moving vehicles. We have no control over that."
But Ms. Fillion said moving the bus stop would be difficult because the highway is so omnipresent along the road throughout the Riverside lake community. 
Mary Kelly, the Newtown Public Schools transportation director, said no one has ever requested moving the bus stop to a safer location. "This is the first I'm hearing about discontent with the bus stop," Ms. Kelly said. "We have never had any problem at the stop nor any request to move it."
The traffic has worsened over the years, a trend D.O.T. officials expect to continue. When the Newtown section of the I-84 expressway opened in 1973, it carried 27,000 vehicles daily. As of Dec. 31, 2001, the traffic volume has more than doubled to 70,000 vehicles daily. Truck traffic also has risen, although the D.O.T. does not keep a specific count of truck volume in this section of highway, according to Cliff Jones, a state traffic control planner for the D.O.T.
Big rigs are the worst offenders when it comes to noise and falling debris, according to the neighbors. Truck drivers regularly apply their "Jake Brakes" as they approach the curve before the nearby Rochambeau Bridge, the neighbors said. This term refers to a kind of engine-compression braking system manufactured by the Jacob Brake Company of Windsor that save wear and tear on tires but emit a loud, screeching sound. To make matters worse, the D.O.T. temporarily has lowered the speed limit from 65 to 55 miles per hour during ongoing road construction estimated to continue at least until the first of the year. This causes trucks to apply their brakes even more than usual, the neighbors said.
Mr. Rosenthal is arranging a meeting between the neighbors, D.O.T. officials, Mr. Maloney and Newtown's state delegation. 
"If they can demonstrate this is a safety issue, clearly we want to help them," Mr. Rosenthal said. "We have to protect their houses from tires flying off trucks."
State Representative Julia Wasserman said she tried unsuccessfully five years ago to get sound barriers in Riverside. "If there is a concern about safety, we have to take care of that," Ms. Wasserman said. 
State Senator John McKinney said he believed the neighbors have good reason to demand a solution. "The D.O.T. has a responsibility to make sure people are safe on and under the highways," he said. "That's a much higher public policy issue than getting sound barriers."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: At Madison Avenue and 128th Street; 
First Permanent Office For Legal Aid Society

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
While a couple of high-profile developments in Harlem have been canceled or shelved recently, foundations were being poured at Madison Avenue and 128th Street for the Legal Aid Society's new five-story, $18 million neighborhood office.
 Former Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was overjoyed that the society had "chosen this location for their first permanent home," referring to the organization's decision -- after 126 years of being a tenant -- to develop its own property. 
 The design of the building, by the Phillips Group, is meant to be anything but proprietary. From the broad, two-story entry arch to the red bricks and double-hung windows like those on nearby row houses, the building is intended to signal "our integration into the life of this neighborhood," said Daniel L. Greenberg, the society's president. 
At a time of concern about gentrification, the symbolism and reality of the Legal Aid Society's expansion in Harlem is an enormously positive statement, said Deborah C. Wright, the president and chief executive of Carver Bancorp.
Today, the society's Harlem office occupies about 10,000 square feet on the eighth and ninth floors of the former Hotel Theresa at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 125th Street. Its new building is to have 29,000 square feet.
Having determined that it would be as economical to build as to lease, the society bought the vacant lot on Madison Avenue for $300,000 in 2000.
In order to construct an office that filled the full lot without setbacks, the society obtained a zoning variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals on the ground that it is a community facility.
Construction began in July and is so far along that "we had to truck the dirt in" for the groundbreaking last Monday, said Dan Kessler, the general services director. Completion is anticipated in the fall of 2003. The contractor, the Pavarini-McGovern Construction Corporation, was chosen in part because of its commitment to involve minority subcontractors, said Theresa de Leon, the chief operating officer of the society. Financing will come from the sale of $18 million in Industrial Development Agency bonds.
The Harlem office is one of seven neighborhood units of the civil division. The eighth, in Lower Manhattan, was housed with the headquarters at 90 Church Street, which is still closed after being filled with contaminants from the collapse of the World Trade Center. Headquarters are now at 1 Battery Park Plaza. The Lower Manhattan office will soon reopen at 199 Water Street. DAVID W. DUNLAP

HEADLINE: Antidotes to Sprawl Taking Many Forms 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
OF the 62 acres purchased two years ago by a developer in the town of Greenburgh, five miles north of New York City in Westchester County, only 10 are being developed -- creating 86 attached homes while preserving the rest as wooded open space.
In Willingboro, N.J., 20 miles south of Trenton, a bankrupt and abandoned 1950's-style open-air shopping mall surrounded by what were once the cookie-cutter tracts of the third Levittown development is being resuscitated as a mixed-use community. The new Willingboro Town Center will have 210 three-story town houses concentrated in 30-unit enclaves, a library, a college building, an amphitheater overlooking a computerized 16-jet fountain, a supermarket, small retail stores and a pharmaceutical company's vast mail-order distribution plant, all in walking distance of bus and light-rail connections to Trenton, Camden and beyond.
To the roll call of often-conflicting parties engaged in the development process, both regionally and locally, the Greenburgh and Willingboro projects are prime examples of "smart growth."
It is a phrase and a movement and a cause for some contention -- if only over what truly constitutes "smart growth" -- that in recent years has permeated the dialogue among planners, politicians, environmentalists and public health advocates, not to mention developers. 
It is everybody's remedy, although with varying doses and ingredients, for sprawl. 
In essence, smart growth calls for the creation of higher-density communities within walking distance of transportation, shopping, schools and, where possible, jobs; or the redevelopment of underutilized and sometimes environmentally tainted sites, often in an urban core. All of which is intended to reduce automobile congestion -- both to and from the suburbs, as well as within a city -- promote walking, save open space and lower tax burdens by reducing the need for new infrastructure.
And while, like apple pie, it is hard to find anyone who opposes smart growth, some developers do raise questions: about the looseness of the definition -- a legitimate concern given government support for some projects -- about the balance between calls for land preservation and the incessant need for more housing, and about land-use restrictions lowering property values, even if they curtail sprawl.
"Sprawl's been criticized for decades, from social critics dating back to the 1920's to the 1950's when suburban development really took off," said Don Chen, director of Smart Growth America, a nonprofit advocacy group. "But even though the problem has been around for a while, it really has only taken off as an important political issue and market issue in the last 5 to 10 years."
In 1998, at a meeting of a group called the Smart Growth Network in Washington, advocates, planners and developers adopted a 10-point protocol calling for, among other things, "walkable neighborhoods," a variety of transportation choices, development directed toward existing communities, compact building design, mixed-use development and preservation of open space. Soon after, the National Governors Association adopted the principles.
In recent years, polls conducted by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Association of Realtors documented mounting public frustration with automobile congestion. 
At the same time, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have conducted studies linking sprawl and traffic congestion to health problems among Americans, particularly obesity and cardiovascular disease due to lack of physical activity and fuel particulates in the air. "Basically, there are concerns that many health and environmental problems that we face are generated by the inefficient land-use patterns that market-driven, speculative sprawl has imprinted on the countryside," said Dr. Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. "If your kid gets driven to school every day or if you go through the McDonald's drive-through for your Big Mac and a milk shake, you're going to have a hard time keeping the weight off."
For more than a decade, activists say, the New York State-chartered Empire State Development Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection have promoted projects incorporating smart-growth principles -- largely through planning grants and tax incentives -- a strategy more recently adopted by the Connecticut Development Authority.
State and local initiatives are currently supporting projects as varied as the reconfiguring of a fishing village on Long Island, the conversion of an 1856 lock factory in a rundown section of Norwalk, Conn., into office space -- with new housing on adjacent lots -- and, on a broader scale, the transfer of development rights from tracts of privately owned wilderness to parcels already zoned for construction.
Population trends are an impelling reason that smart growth has increasingly seeped into the development debate. "If you see demographics as destiny," said Mr. Chen, "it makes sense that there was an enormous suburban housing boom in the 50's to accommodate G.I.'s returning from the war front, and after that baby boomers, to address overcrowding in cities."
"Now," Mr. Chen continued, "as our demographic profile changes, there's increasing interest in in-town living, not only among young people, but also baby boomers as they become empty-nesters and start to retire. They see advantages to living in places with greater sense of community, more convenience. And that trend will be more pronounced over the next two decades."
THE transformation of the old mall in Willingboro seems an indicator of the trend.
"It's being converted to a mixed-use town center where people can live, work, shop, study and walk," said Robert Stang, managing member of Renewal Realty, the developer of the Willingboro center.
What the developers found when they first surveyed the site in 1998 was nearly 600,000 square feet of retail space in abandoned buildings -- including a Woolworth's, a Sears and an Acme supermarket -- at the core of 56 acres and surrounded by "a sea of parking lots," Mr. Stang said. Surrounding that were 11,500 single-family homes.
"It was the third Levittown, built in the late 50's," Mr. Stang said. "It's name was changed because it was too close to the second Levittown, in Pennsylvania."
The mall had been a retail hub along Route 130 -- until Interstate 295 came through town in the mid-70's. The interstate, with big-box stores like Home Depot off its exit ramps, "sucked the retail out of the Route 130 corridor," Mr. Stang said.
His company, Mr. Stang said, paid the previous owner, who had long tried to attract a brand-name anchor store, $185,000 for all 56 acres. "I figured I could never get hurt," he said. "It would always be worth more than that."
With backing from the town, which took temporary title to the land, Renewal Realty received a $2 million low-interest loan to clean up the property. "The town had title, but we could acquire it for a dollar after we cleaned it up," Mr. Stang said. 
Soon after, a master plan was drawn up very much in line with what Mr. Chen of Smart Growth America says is a growing trend toward replacing old malls "with entire P.U.D.'s -- planned unit developments -- meaning instead of building one house here, one house there, you build a community with residential, commercial, civic uses."
Willingboro's mayor, Paul Stephenson, is enthusiastic about what has arrived and soon will come. Merck-Medco, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company, took over a 100,000-square-foot existing building, added another 100,000 square feet and after opening its mail-order center "brought nearly 1,000 jobs into our community," Mayor Stephenson said. Burlington County College leased 19,000 square feet of existing space for a satellite classroom building. A supermarket and smaller retail stores have opened.
"The next piece," the mayor said, "is about 200 housing units that will primarily serve folks who have already raised their children, looking for transition from a big house to something more manageable." The first homes, for rental and later for sale, will be completed in about a year.
"Now," Mayor Stephenson said, "we take that mix and add our own investment -- a library-media center, an amphitheater and a magnificent fountain."
"With the advent of the national trend toward people seeking gathering places within their communities," he said, "this is smart growth right on time."
The advent has actually been a long time coming.
"Smart growth is certainly a new term," said Dr. Sclar at Columbia, "but the concern with sprawl -- meaning that the metropolitan area was growing in an unplanned pattern -- goes back to the turn of the last century."
Professor Sclar cited Forest Hills Gardens in central Queens, built in 1909, as "basically what the smart-growth people are hoping to recreate in the 21st century."
Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of the landscape architect of Central Park, Forest Hills Gardens is a 142-acre community of large homes and row houses -- many bearing the red-tile roofs, turrets and dormers in the English Tudor style -- lining winding, tree-arched streets and spacious greenways.
"When you go from Station Square," Dr. Sclar said -- referring to the Olde English town plaza where the Long Island Rail Road stops -- "you walk under an archway into the greenway and there's smaller attached houses, one apartment building and the elementary school, P.S. 101. Then as you go further into the Gardens, the lot sizes and houses get bigger." One block north of the train station is Austin Street, lined with almost every conceivable sort of store, and Continental Avenue, where the subway to Manhattan stops.
"What the smart-growth people are talking about these days is basically to expand the supply of Forest Hills Gardenses," Dr. Sclar said. "The problem is the regionalists of the last century were never able to make this the standard, so you ended up with highways, strip malls, social isolation."
In 1929, an influential nonprofit group, the Regional Plan Association, asked Charles Dyer Norton, a famous planner, to help draft a development strategy for New York City. "When Norton came to New York, he realized such a movement here would have to be regional," said Thomas Wright, the current executive vice president of the association. "You couldn't plan for the city alone and address the fundamental issues because New York already was starting to function as a metropolitan region; people were already starting to commute."
The committee eventually created a comprehensive regional plan, calling for major investments in infrastructure, open-space preservation and new communities similar to Forest Hills Gardens. It included ambitious proposals for highways and railroads.
"The point is that the highways were built much more quickly than the railroads," Mr. Wright said. "Therefore, we developed in a more automobile-dependent manner."
And after World War II, the nation experienced the suburban boom, fueled by federal policies encouraging home ownership -- the tax deduction for mortgages and the Interstate Highway Act -- "which provided enormous funding for building the Interstates," he said, "while, at the same time, mass transit was essentially going bankrupt."
"How do you undo that?" Mr. Wright asked. "How do you retrofit sprawl to create communities that have the benefits of open space, diversity, opportunity."
Some developers have some ideas.
Martin Ginsburg is president of GDC, which has built about 3,000 homes, most of them town houses, in Westchester, Rockland and Fairfield Counties. In Greenburgh, N.Y., the company bought 62 acres of green space for $5 million and named it -- appropriately -- Wyldwood.
"There was a strong movement in the community to keep it open space," Mr. Ginsburg said, "but they couldn't raise the money to buy all 62 acres, so we came up with a compromise." With financing assistance from the state, Westchester County and the nonprofit Open Space Institute, the town bought 42 of the acres to be preserved as open space.
"We ended up developing 86 units on 10 of the remaining 20 acres," Mr. Ginsburg said. "The result was less development, but some development, on only 10 of the 62 acres."
In a more urban setting -- along a rundown riverfront stretch in Norwalk, Conn. -- Kim Morque's company, Spinnaker Development, has converted an old lock factory into 104,000 square feet of "nontraditional office space."
"It's open; exposed-beam ceilings, brick walls," Mr. Morque said. "Tenants devise their space according to their needs."
From 1856 to the mid-1950's, the three-story building was the Norwalk Lock Company. In recent decades, until Spinnaker bought it for $3.25 million in March 2000, it housed "small manufacturers, carpenters, artists, even a sailmaker," Mr. Morque said.
"This is smart growth because we are recycling land, taking industrial sites and brownfields and creating new projects," he said. "And because we're using an existing building, we're utilizing existing utilities -- water, electrical, sewage -- and not building new infrastructure."
The building is five blocks from the South Norwalk train station. "About 250 people work there," Mr. Morque said. "They can walk to lunch, shop on nearby Washington Street. Many of them live in the area."
Across the street, Mr. Morque said, plans call for construction of 10 condominiums, 3,000 square feet of commercial and 5,000 square feet of street-level retail space. "Then we have plans for 200 apartments and a hotel on the site to the east," he said.
For Jim Tripp and Eric Kulleseid, two prominent land-preservation activists in the New York area, Mr. Morque's downtown Norwalk redevelopment and even Mr. Ginsburg's limited development on 62 acres in Greenburgh are significant examples of smart growth. But their sights are set on far more ambitious efforts to limit sprawl and protect vast tracts of open space.
"It may be smart growth on a microscale to cluster development on a fraction of the parcel and set aside the remainder for open space," said Mr. Tripp, general counsel for Environmental Defense, a national nonprofit organization. "But you can take that notion and look at the whole metropolitan area, much more macroscale, and ask yourself: what large pieces of land do we want to protect that are in private ownership, where we could redirect development to other more appropriate places?"
Mr. Tripp and Mr. Kulleseid, who is the New York State director of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, believe it is vital to preserve, among other swaths of wilderness, up to 500,000 privately owned acres of forest in the undulating highlands that stretch through northern New Jersey, across the Hudson and into Connecticut, as well as 100,000 acres in Suffolk County called the Long Island Pine Barrens.
Mr. Kulleseid's group is one of a network of organizations that specialize in finding funds to compensate landowners who sign easements agreeing never to allow development on their property. "We need forests and wetlands because they give us clean water, places to be physical and not just denizens of the local mall," Mr. Kulleseid said. And, viewing forests as akin to lungs, he said, "They soak up greenhouse gases and give back oxygen."
Mr. Tripp of Environmental Defense is also chairman of the Pine Barrens Credit Clearinghouse, an arm of the Long Island Pine Barrens Commission. The commission was created by state legislation to preserve about 100,000 acres of pitch pine and oak forest in the sandy soil that forms a sort of spine through the Suffolk County towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead and Southhampton.
Under the plan, two tools are used to protect privately owned land. One is outright acquisition, for which the county and state have spent about $100 million. The other is the transfer of development rights.
UNDER the transfer program, private landowners in the core of the Pine Barrens can be allocated development rights based on the amount of land they own and the applicable zoning. If, for example, the zoning is one house per acre, the landowner is entitled to one credit, which can be sold to any developer who owns land where the three towns have designated a receiving area for higher-density development.
"The developer knows that rather than building one house for every two acres, for example, he or she could build a house on every acre," Mr. Tripp said. "What the landowner in the Pine Barrens must do to obtain this right is record a conservation easement on the property. They retain the title, but they can't develop it." 
"And this does not cost the public a cent," he said. "The saving of that land, in effect, has been paid for by developers who find it economically worthwhile to build higher-density development."
A bit farther east, at the tip of Long Island's South Shore, local officials and developers hope to devise a smart-growth plan for the tiny fishing village of Montauk in the town of East Hampton.
"Growth has been constrained by outdated zoning and by a single loop road in and out of the dock area," said Jonathan F. P. Rose, president of the Jonathan Rose Companies. Mr. Rose's firm has been asked to draft a plan "that allows businesses to grow, creates housing and rationalizes traffic."
Rather than allowing development to spread, the key might be the renovation of a half-dozen ramshackle hotels, said Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman. "There's the fishing pier, and right across from it you have this blighted area, all these boarded-up buildings," he said.
"The community is facing a challenge to provide adequate housing for workers," Mr. Schneiderman continued, "and one thought is to create employee housing in this area, and, at the same time, some new shops and offices. Of course, there would be pedestrian areas, open space. And there might be apartments over the shops." 
Whatever plan is adopted should retain, said Mr. Rose, the developer, "the funky nautical character of the place, and not make it a sanitized touristy resort."
 Supervisor Schneiderman said, "All ideas are on the table."

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
University Merger Closes In on Reality

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
DESPITE vehement opposition from politicians and some quarters of the medical establishment, sources close to Governor McGreevey said last week that a commission was poised to recommend a merger between Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
 Under the controversial plan, each of three university campuses -- in Newark, New Brunswick and Camden -- would operate independently under separate chancellors, with a statewide board of trustees providing general guidance. 
 The panel of 15 business leaders and health care administrators -- formally known as the Commission on Health Science, Education and Technology -- was scheduled to make its recommendations public last week, sources said, but the turmoil over Robert Torricelli's withdrawal from the Senate race derailed those plans.
If three days of contentious hearings last month were any indication, the merger, which would require the approval of the State Legislature, presents the governor with what could be his fiercest political battle since taking office, particularly because much opposition has come from within his own Democratic Party.
"My goal right now is to develop a good blueprint," Governor McGreevey said in an interview last week. "This is critically important to our competitiveness." 
But blistering criticism from several sources, particularly legislators in Essex County, where U.M.D.N.J. is situated, imperil the initiative. For now, it is difficult to sort out where the questions over the quality of education end and political issues begin.
Politicians in Essex County are worried that any such overhaul will mean a shift in power and resources from Newark to New Brunswick. They believe that the presence of U.M.D.N.J. has been a lure and a steadying influence in Newark, helping the city recover from the desolation and the diaspora in the aftermath of the 1967 riots.
Assemblyman Eric Munoz, a Republican from Summit who is a trauma surgeon and a professor at the New Jersey Medical School, said, "U.M.D.N.J. and the hospital in Newark serve a tremendous need for the people in northern New Jersey." 
State Senator Ronald Rice, a Democrat from Essex County, was more blunt.
At a hearing last month, Mr. Rice said that any proposal to merge Rutgers, with 50,000 students spread over three campuses, with U.M.D.N.J., overseeing 4,500 students, and the Institute of Technology, with 9,000 students, would be "dead upon arrival in the State Legislature."
"This is not about education and health care -- maybe you think it is," Mr. Rice told members of the panel, who were said to favor merging the schools into one enormous university system like the University of California. "This is about money, contract awards, power and control of jobs."
One crucial Essex County legislator, Richard J. Codey, the Democratic co-president of the Senate from West Orange, tried to lay the groundwork for compromise last week when he said he could not support any proposal that did not allow local control over the medical school and the hospital. 
"We are not going to give up local governance," Mr. Codey said. "There will be continuing dialogue, and we will see if something can be worked out to improve the local university and the hospital, but to keep local governance."
But politicians were not the only people opposed to the merger.
At last month's hearings, many in the medical community were equally concerned about reinventing the university system. For instance, U.M.N.D.J. brought consultants from Boston, Education Alliance, who testified that putting the medical and dental school under Rutgers would "stunt growth and development plans" and "disenfranchise U.M.D.N.J.'s significant community investment."
A vice president of the Oregon Health and Science University, James Samels offered the commission a report that a merger would "stunt" the university.
Albert Talone, president of the New Jersey Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, testified that U.M.D.N.J. should remain independent. "The thought of changing this is just unthinkable, " he said.
Lester Lieberman, chairman of the Health Care Foundation of New Jersey, citing the growing research revenue coming into U.M.D.N.J., said a merger would slow the university's momentum. And George Pruitt, president of Thomas Edison State College, spoke against the merger, saying: "Rutgers does not suffer from a lack of complexity. It suffers from a lack of focus."
Still, there were those who spoke in favor of the merger over the three days of hearings in Stratford, Camden County, and New Brunswick as well as Newark. They insisted that the plan did not call for a unified system under one large bureaucracy. Rather, they said, the plan envisioned three smaller, better-coordinated schools to replace the sometimes confusing array institutions that now exist.
Dr. Norman Edelman, a member of the commission and former dean of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, said that his group had heard much testimony in closed meetings in favor of changes at U.M.D.N.J., noting, "Among the problems we identified is a large, bureaucratic and controlling central administration."
Dorothy DeMaio, a former dean of the Rutgers School of Nursing, said that she favored a merger because Rutgers and U.M.D.N.J. wasted money by duplicating services and that "the drive to control the education of all health care providers has been a wild, costly and divisive ride."
Though the hearings highlighted the opposition to a merger, that was neither unusual nor unexpected. And it apparently did not deter Mr. McGreevey and the commission -- headed by P. Roy Vagelos, a former chairman of Merck & Company -- from moving forward. In a recent interview, Governor McGreevey said he was committed to changing the structure of the university system to improve research and education, particularly in medicine and biotechnology.
Yet many people have commented that the timing could be better, since all three of the state's major public universities are in flux. Rutgers is searching for a new president and an appointment is imminent, the New Jersey Institute of Technology recently appointed a new president, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey lost three top officials after a new board chairman was appointed.
In an interview after the first public hearing, Dr. Vagelos said the governor asked him to map a course by which New Jersey -- which has several good schools and a strong research presence from pharmaceutical companies -- could develop a great medical school to compete with the universities and research hospitals in New York and Philadelphia.
"New Jersey is one of the states which should have one of the great health education centers in the United States," Dr. Vagelos said. "We have the infrastructure. It is a matter of putting it together."
Supporters of the commission's proposal contend that the creation of independent schools will allow for better coordination, and will produce more compelling grant applications, the lifeblood of prestigious medical schools. Although New Jersey currently ranks among the top five states in terms of private biomedical research, it is 24th when it comes to receiving federal funds for that purpose.
To that end, Governor McGreevey said improving the universities was crucial to the state's economy, particularly when it came to retaining jobs in the pharmaceutical industry. 
"We have more patent development in the private sector than in the public sector," he said. "We have Merck, Johnson & Johnson, but there is no university partner."
As for the concerns about Newark's future, supporters of a merger insist there will be no less of in commitment to any communities served by state medical schools and affiliated hospitals.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who is president of Drew University and advises Governor McGreevey on education, said he felt certain that the governor would not support a proposal that diminished the state's support for the medical school or the hospital in Newark.
"I am personally convinced that if this happens, Newark will be a better place," said Mr. Kean. "There will be more independence, not less, in Newark."
For that reason, Mr. Kean said, it was in the interest of Newark, and the entire state, to improve the universities.
"Rutgers is a good place, but it is not a great place," he said. "And we all want to make it a great place."

The Phantom Mailbox

Q. I have to walk for blocks before I can find a mailbox. I don't remember them being so scarce. Are their numbers declining?

A. The Postal Service is indeed scaling back the number of street mailboxes in New York, according to a spokeswoman, Pat McGovern. The main reasons, she said, are security and economy.
 To save money, the post office has begun removing boxes that average fewer than 25 pieces of mail per day. Ms. McGovern says many people are now putting on postage themselves but mailing items from work (although the occasional personal letter has been known to slip out on the company dime). 
 The post office has also been removing mailboxes for security since 9/11. It has taken boxes from high-profile spots like airports and the sites of government buildings. 
There are still close to 8,000 mailboxes throughout the city and, as Ms. McGovern points out, postal carriers also pick up stamped mail in any personal mailboxes.

Lincoln, Coast to Coast

Q. The western end of the Lincoln Highway, America's first one to go coast to coast, was honored with a new marker last month in San Francisco. Are any still left in New York?

A. No. It seems that at some unknown point New York lost the markers that indicated its inclusion.
Opened in 1913, the Lincoln Highway was the first paved highway to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It began in Times Square and headed west on 42nd Street to the New York Central Ferry Terminal. In New Jersey, cars could continue through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada, all the way to Lincoln Park in San Francisco.
The route was chosen for directness; it's about as straight as a 3,000-mile highway can be, although when the Holland Tunnel was opened in 1927, the Lincoln Highway was rerouted through the tunnel.
In 1925 the American Association of State Highway Officials decided to end the confusing system of named highways and use numbered routes. By the time the Lincoln Highway was rerouted through the Holland Tunnel, it was better known as Route 9. The highway still exists under different names; from Philadelphia to Wyoming, it is Route 30.
On Sept. 1, 1928, thousands of Boy Scouts spread out along the highway and installed concrete markers, about one per mile, each of which carried a small bust of Lincoln and the inscription, "This Highway dedicated to Abraham Lincoln." It was just such a marker that was recently reinstalled in California.
"The New York City area had such an established transportation system in place -- subways, trolleys, interurban rails -- the Lincoln Highway was no big thing," said Frank Curcio, a Lincoln Highway Association officer. "West of Philadelphia, but especially in the Midwest and mountain states, the Lincoln Highway was the biggest thing since the transcontinental railroad."
The Lincoln Highway marker closest to New York is in Princeton Township, N.J., on State Highway 27.

Pistol-Packing Police

Q. When did New York police officers begin carrying guns?

A. While the Police Department officially began in 1845, it was not until 1887 that its officers were required to carry a firearm. In 1887 the New York City Police Manual of Rules and Regulations added Rule 503, which read: "In addition to the ordinary baton of the patrolman each member of the Police Force shall be armed while on duty with a revolving pistol of pattern and caliber approved by the board." Since then, New York cops have carried guns.
In 1896 the police adopted a .32-caliber revolver as the department standard; that was changed to .38-caliber in 1901. In 1993 the standard service weapon was changed to a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, which remains the norm today. ED BOLAND Jr.

HEADLINE: Fighting to Save a Doo-Wop Diner 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD CREST 

 BODY:
THE Surfside Restaurant sits like a hearty smile on the Doo-Wop stretch of Ocean Avenue here. It is all aqua and orange and melon and bubble gum pink, with an angular roof and hexagonal body, a wonder of mid-20th-century commercial architecture.
 But time is running out for the Surfside. The owners of the Waters Edge, a hulking motel behind, have bought the 39-year-old restaurant and have scheduled it for demolition by the end of the month to pave the way for expansion. 
 Local preservationists are about as angry over the restaurant's plight as Dion was over Runaround Sue. And the leader of the group is Jack Morey, the leader of the group whose family owns most of the amusement piers on the storied boardwalk here as well as several other major properties on the island -- including the new StarLux Motel, with its kidney-shaped pool, Art Deco furniture and a lava lamp in every room.
"Obviously, I am an advocate of this type of architecture," Mr. Morey said. "But what we want to make sure of is that Wildwood has a distinctive feel and can capitalize financially on it."
What Mr. Morey and his group want to do is raise enough money to have the Surfside dismantled instead of demolished, as the owners of the Waters Edge had planned. Then the preservationists would put the pieces in storage, with the notion of reconstructing it either as an information booth at an entrance to town or a beach gazebo -- or maybe even resurrected as a restaurant on another site. Officials in Wildwood Crest have even said that they might like to use it as a visitors' center.
To that end, Mr. Morey said, the group needed $20,000 in pledges by Oct. 15. To date, about $6,000 has been collected.
The owners of the Waters Edge declined to comment, other than to insist that that the last thing they wanted to do was make an addition, not waves.
"They told us they were willing to do it, but they can't wait forever," said Dan MacElrevey, the president of the Greater Wildwood Hotel-Motel Association. "This is only one issue, but it is symbolic and we have to understand that."
Mr. MacElrevey said that he was concerned there had been 13 demolition permit applications filed this year for what the association felt were landmark buildings. Some are classics of the 1950's and 60's like the Ala Kai Motel, the Catalina Motel and the Ebb Tide Motel.
Oddly enough, he blamed the good economy, saying that some long-term owners felt they would get a good price for their motel.
"It seems to be a question of whether you want to sell out now and move to Miami or make some renovations and get the money back over time," Mr. MacElrevey said. "I assure you, there is money to be made running a motel here, and many of us feel the way to keep that going is to preserve what we have."
Some people call the plethora of mid-20th century motels in the Wildwoods Jetsonian or Googie architecture, but the Doo-Wop Preservation League likes their term, since it evokes the music and spirit of the post-World War II era in which Wildwood burgeoned as a middle-class resort. In fact, the Greater Wildwood Hotel Motel Association met recently to decide how to have the motel strip declared a national historic district.
"It was overwhelming," said Mr. MacElrevey. "I think it was 31 to 1 to do our best to preserve the motels the way they are. This doesn't mean not to make improvements. A lot of us have put up new neon, made rooms into suites, used open space better. But we want to have a resort that has some distinction."
For his part, Michael John is fixing his last few breakfasts at the Surfside. His father, Tomi, a Greek immigrant, came down here from Camden, in the early 1960's.
"The story is that he came to America on July Fourth, started this restaurant on July Fourth, 1963, and died on July Fourth, 1994," said Mr. John, who now has a catering business here.
Still, he would like to see the preservationists succeed in saving the Surfside. Though Mr. John declined to say how much he was paid for restaurant, a comparable location in town would sell for $500,000 to $1 million.
The last scheduled meal at the restaurant is a Lions Club benefit -- the Tomi John Pancake Breakfast -- on Oct. 13. "It will be a good thing to end on," said Mr. John. "I think everyone likes this place, and I hope it gets a new life somewhere else."

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
In Millburn, The Accent Is Russian

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: MILLBURN 

 BODY:
ON a third-floor window of a corner building, high above the thrum of Audis and Jaguars cruising the length of Millburn Avenue, is a painted silhouette of a couple and the words Royal Ballroom.
 Yet Alex and Tanya Koulik, Russian immigrants who opened the studio here four years ago -- one of four that they own -- are among a large influx of Russians who have immigrated to this affluent pocket of Essex County over the last 20 years. 
 That surge has given this township of 19,765 the distinction -- along with Fair Lawn in Bergen County -- of having the highest percentage of residents of Russian descent in the state at 11.7 percent. By comparison, only 2.3 percent of New Jersey's 8.4 million residents are Russian. 
Just why so many new -- and not particularly wealthy -- immigrants would feel comfortable in one of the most exclusive towns in North Jersey, where the median household income is $130,848 and housing prices often begin at a half-million dollars, has to do with more than just the tango.
"I don't know what most Russians will tell you why they live in this community," said Mr. Koulik, a lithe man of 44, "but I believe the major reason is the schools."
The Kouliks say they moved to an apartment in Short Hills in 1997, five years after coming to this country, because they wanted their son, Vitali, now 21 and a four-time ballroom dancing champion, to attend Millburn High School, ranked among the top public schools in the country. So did the families of two of the Kouliks' students, Michael Lubavin and Yelena Vaynshteyn.
"For us, the main attraction was the school system, especially the Millburn High School," said Mr. Lubavin, a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia University.
As for Ms. Vaynshteyn, 24, a dental student at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, she said her mother moved to Short Hills 11 years ago from Brooklyn because of the school system.
Keith Neigel, the principal at the high school, said in an interview that while the number of Russian students reached a peak in the mid-1990's, 27 of the school's 1,073 students still spoke Russian at home.
"Many Russians are highly educated and left good jobs, Mr. Neigel said, "and although it took time for them to get similar positions in the United States, they have moved up the economic ladder quickly." 
For instance, Mr. Lubavin's father eventually found work as an engineer in Springfield. Ms. Vaynshteyn's father and mother, dentists in Russia, now practice in Brooklyn.
And while the Kouliks were always light on their feet, dancing was not always their day job. In Moscow, Mr. Koulik was a neurosurgeon and his wife a university English teacher, professions they could not practice when they first arrived in America. Dance champions in Europe, they turned to ballroom dancing, first as instructors in Verona and later opening their own.
The first wave of Russian immigrants came in the early 1980's after the Soviet Union began easing Jewish immigration, the second in 1989 as it dissolved.
In northern New Jersey, the first stop for Soviet Jews was often Newark, said Rabbi Mendel Bogomilsky of the Chai Center for Living Judaism, an Orthodox congregation here. Many settled in a sprawling apartment complex in the Ivy Hill section, where his father, Samuel, the spiritual leader of Mount Sinai Temple, helped get them services, Rabbi Bogomilsky said. 
In addition, the Jewish Counseling and Service Agency, now known as the Jewish Family Service of Metro West, helped resettle many Soviet immigrants in the early 1980's, and one of its busiest offices was in Millburn. In the second wave, the agency resettled nearly 3,000, said Sheila Muster, the agency's director of operations.
"Those first people that came started working and as they prospered they moved to places like Springfield, West Orange, and Millburn-Short Hills," Ms. Muster said. As a result, the surrounding towns also have large percentages of Russians: West Orange, (5.8 percent) Livingston (9.8 percent) and Springfield (10.3 percent.) 
Rabbi Steven Bayar of Congregation B'nai Israel, a Conservative congregation here and one of many in the area that offered a support network for the newcomers, said many Russian families rented apartments in Millburn before they had enough saved to buy a house.
"We know families would move out of Millburn as soon as the kids were old enough, Rabbi Bayar said, "because they didn't need the high school anymore" -- nor the high cost of living.
Mr. Lubavin said when his family arrived in America nine years ago, an uncle in Livingston helped them to settle in a garden apartment complex across from the high school here along with many other Russians. To help make ends meet, his mother earned a degree from Kean University and found work as an accountant. Soon the family was able to buy a house in neighboring Springfield as Michael was finishing middle school here.
"The housing in Springfield was cheaper, and we wanted to buy a house," said Mr. Lubavin. 
Like the Lubavins, the Kouliks also found it more expedient to leave their small apartment in Short Hills for larger quarters in Springfield. "Vitali already graduated and we needed a little bigger place," Mr. Koulik explained.
These days, Ms. Vaynshteyn and her fiance can be seen gliding across the blond wooden floor of the Royal Ballroom as they try to master dance steps for their wedding reception in six months.
"We wanted a nice first dance," said Ms. Vaynshteyn. "Tanya is a great instructor, and she's very smiley and she's very encouraging. We need a lot of encouragement."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Upholding Both Islam And a Good Portfolio

BYLINE:  By ERIC BAUM 

 BODY:
IN many respects, the Amana Growth fund resembles scores of mutual funds that buy shares of fast-growing companies.
 But Amana Growth is different in at least one key respect. Introduced in 1986, it is the largest mutual fund in the United States that says it abides by Islamic principles of investing. 
 It avoids direct investments in banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, for example, because lending money and the payment of interest are prohibited by the Koran, said Nicholas Kaiser, president of the Saturna Capital Corporation, the fund's adviser. "You don't want to be a borrower or a lender," Mr. Kaiser said. 
Islamic funds are a variation on socially responsible mutual funds, which screen out companies that engage in practices that their shareholders find objectionable, like harming the environment or producing alcohol or tobacco products or pornography. 
For the 12 months through Sept. 30, the fund, which has $22 million in assets, lost 18.6 percent. That was 1.5 percentage points better than the S.& P. 500. Over the last five years, the fund gained 1.5 percent, annualized, or 3.1 percentage points better than the index. Amana Growth is classifed by Morningstar as a large-cap growth fund.
Saturna Capital, based in Bellingham, Wash., also manages the Amana Income fund, which has $16 million in assets and was started in 1986, making it the country's oldest Islamic mutual fund. For the 12 months, it lost 19 percent, one point better than the S.& P. 500. Over the last five years, the fund lost 1.7 percent, annualized, one-tenth of a point better than the index. Mr. Kaiser said returns had been hurt by the prohibition against investments in financial services stocks, which have performed better than some other sectors.
Allied Asset Advisors in Burr Ridge, Ill., manages the Dow Jones Islamic Index fund, the second-biggest Islamic fund, with $18 million of assets. Weighted toward large-cap shares, it uses the trading symbol IMANX. "Iman means faith in Arabic, which is something we all need in the market right now," said Youshaa Patel, director for business development at Allied. The fund was down 30.4 percent this year through September.
The fund's top holdings, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft and Pfizer, are leading choices among large-cap funds generally. "When you look at some of our top 10 holdings, like Merck or Cisco, you may see some of the bellwethers that are driving our economy," Mr. Patel said. "One major goal is that you can still hold onto your beliefs and still be a prudent investor."
Most modern companies rely on debt financing, and Islamic scholars advising the Dow Jones Islamic Index and Amana have decided that a modest degree of debt is acceptable. The Dow Jones Islamic Indexes -- a series of 33 indexes containing at least 1,400 stocks -- filter out companies with debt-to-market capitalization ratios exceeding 33 percent during a trailing 12-month period. The Dow Jones Islamic US Index, on which the Allied fund is based, was established in 1999 and tracks 594 stocks, including Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.
Amana has received similar advice from its Islamic advisers, the Fiqh Council of North America, Mr. Kaiser said. "If we went to the extreme and said no debt whatsoever, we would be left with no companies," he said. 
Azzad Asset Management, a small firm in Falls Church, Va., that runs two funds with a combined value of less than $1 million, said it took a similar approach.
Jibril Amin, a market and business analyst at the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Mich., is investing in Amana's funds to finance the college education of his three young children. He said combining Western finance and Islamic law is less than a perfect science. "They've accepted some companies that have limited exposure to debt," he said. "It's not a pure Islamic environment. Modern capitalism is based on something that is not perfectly consistent with what our beliefs are."
ISLAMIC screening has had some advantages for investors. Technology companies that crashed when the Nasdaq technology bubble burst were screened out when their debt levels exceeded 32 percent of their market capitalization. "The Islamic investor got out at 40 or 50, unlike other investors who rode the debt to zero," said Rushdi Siddiqui, director of the Dow Jones Islamic Indexes. 
Religious scholars note that Islam rejects the notion of placing one investor ahead of another, as is the case with preferred bondholders of a company who receive payments before common stockholders do, Mr. Kaiser said. In theory, Islam promotes investing relationships in which all parties are equity shareholders on equal footing. Amana restricts its holdings to common shares. "As long as the fund buys the common stock we're looking at ourselves as equals with all the other shareholders in the company," Mr. Kaiser said. 
Dow Jones is still wrestling with the question, and its Islamic scholars have temporarily subtracted a company's preferred shares from its debt ratio until there is a definitive answer. 
Some Muslims say they put their money in real estate, because it appreciates without earning interest, and in interest-free checking accounts to comply with Islamic principles. They say they do not invest in Islamic mutual funds because they do not know enough about them. 
"A lot of people are not investing because they think they will make some money in this life but lose the life hereafter," said Syed Ilyas, a physical therapist and the owner of a private clinic in Dearborn Heights, Mich. "I would love to invest, and I know dozens of people who are ready to invest right now. It's just a matter of finding an institution that is being backed up by reliable scholars."

This Mercedes Wears a Mask And Flaunts Its Rubber Floor

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
 TESTED: 2002 Freightliner Sprinter

WHAT IS IT? -- Full-size commercial van.

HOW MUCH? -- $27,024 for cargo van with 118-inch wheelbase and standard roof; $36,065 as tested for passenger van with 140-inch wheelbase and high roof, including comfort package ($1,580) and rear air-conditioning ($1,405).

POWERTRAIN -- Rear drive; 2.7-liter 5-cylinder turbo-diesel (154 horsepower, 243 pounds-feet of torque); 5-speed "manumatic" transmission.

HOW HEAVY? -- 4,857 to 5,539 pounds.

HOW THIRSTY? -- Estimated average of 22 m.p.g. (E.P.A. figures not available for such a heavy vehicle.)

ALTERNATIVES: Ford Econoline E-350, $27,315; Chevrolet Express, $28,000.
DO you haul around more passengers than a shuttle bus at O'Hare International? Do you hate minivans? Do you love industrial-chic design? Do you dare to be different?
Step right up. The Freightliner Sprinter practically guarantees that you won't see yourself coming and going (unless you are delivering parcels in Midtown Manhattan). The Sprinter is an antidote to the minivan, and it comes from DaimlerChrysler, half of which put suburbanites into minivans in the first place.
Like a royal heir who lives unrecognized among peasants, the Sprinter has gone incognito: it is actually a Mercedes-Benz truck, and in Europe it wears the three-pointed star. But American market research found that plumbers and florists feared to drive a Mercedes, lest customers think they were overcharging. In the United States, the van currently bears the name of Freightliner, DaimlerChrysler's big-truck subsidiary.
So, yes, the Sprinter was designed more for commercial use than for suburban progeny-schlepping, but it resembles the basic airport van and it shouts "I am different!" when driven as a people mover. Based on reactions in the suburban cul-de-sac where my brother lives, it is likely to appeal to soccer parents deep in minivan denial. One neighbor liked the Sprinter so much that he lamented his recent purchase of a minivan.
Starting in January, a Sprinter with a different grille will also be sold in the United States as a Dodge. DaimlerChrysler hopes to break the hold that Ford has on the full-size van market with its Econoline and Club Wagon.
The Sprinter comes in three wheelbase lengths, two basic body styles (a passenger van with side windows and rear seats, or a plain-box cargo version) and two roof heights. I tested a passenger van with the intermediate 140-inch wheelbase and the high roof. This version is not only ungarageable, it looks like a garage. The outside height is a towering 102 inches, and a 6-foot-1 adult can stand up inside.
Four rows of seats accommodate 10 people in mess-resistant comfort. There is ketchup-proof rubber flooring and Slurpee-averse fabric seats. (The short-wheelbase Sprinter carries eight people in three rows.)
The steering wheel is big and buslike, but that is where the feel of driving a bus ends, partly because of the power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. More important, the turning radius is extremely tight, making it ridiculously easy to squeeze into cramped Euro-style parking spaces or to maneuver in heavy traffic.
The small diesel engine -- the same one that powers the M-Class sport utility in Europe -- does a good job moving the heavy vehicle. I didn't drive one fully loaded, however.
My test van also came with a noise-cancellation feature. The squeaks and rattles from the rear cargo doors were so deafening that they could mask the sound of squabbling children. Paul DiLisio, a company spokesman, said the squeaking stemmed from a door seal that dries out and requires lubrication with silicone spray. (The squeaking persisted after I sprayed the seal.)
The biggest problem with the Sprinter is its stiff, industrial ride. And whenever I passed an airport I got a sense that it wanted to turn in.
Though the Sprinter is intended for commercial buyers, another DaimlerChrysler van from Europe, the Vito, will be aimed more directly at consumers. Due here in 2004, the Vito will be a bit smaller than the Sprinter and a little bigger than a minivan -- about the size of a Chevy Astro. Until the Vito arrives, adventurous families may find happiness with the Sprinter, a Mercedes so understated that it travels in disguise. CHERYL JENSEN

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Bond Funds for the Ultra-Impatient

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
THE once-obscure category of ultrashort-term bond funds is attracting new money, and for two reasons: Mutual fund investors -- their long patience with the faltering stock market severely strained -- see them as havens. And more fund companies, including Fidelity and Dreyfus, have recently begun to market the investments.
 The Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade organization, reported that bond funds, both taxable and municipal, had a record inflow of $28.14 billion in July followed by an inflow of $17.31 billion in August; of the August total, $4.69 billion went to domestic short-term bond funds, including ultrashort funds, more than double the $1.95 billion inflow in July 2001. The August inflow included $3.02 billion in domestic short-term funds, down from $4.48 billion in July. 
 Generally, the term "ultrashort" describes funds with portfolio durations of a year or less, compared with as long as five years for short-term funds. Morningstar classifies as ultrashort some funds that are called short term by their sponsors.
As a group, ultrashort bond funds have returned 2.55 percent over the 12 months through Sept. 30. That is a percentage point above money market funds.
"Investors are seeking an upgrade," while trying to protect their capital, said Peter Crane, vice president of iMoneyNet Inc. of Westborough, Mass., and the managing editor of its Money Fund Report. 
Investors who are interested in ultrashort funds need to look at far more than total returns. Scott Berry, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said that while some ultrashort funds were good alternatives to money market funds, others took on considerably more interest-rate and credit risk. While some funds are no-load, others have front-end loads, back-end loads or transactions fees, and after those costs investors could end up with a loss, as they could if interest rates move higher, he said. 
He favors using a money-market fund if you know you will need the money within a few months or a year, say, for a tuition payment, and using an ultrashort bond fund for a "rainy day." But in case you must use it, he said, the investment is still "relatively stable, relatively liquid." 
There is considerable variety in ultra-short funds. The Scudder Preservation Plus Income fund, for example, has a goal of a constant $10 share price and uses agreements with financial institutions to achieve it. It has no front-end or deferred load but has a 2 percent redemption fee. The Dreyfus Yield Advantage fund is no-load but has a 0.25 percent redemption fee, and the Fidelity Ultra-Short Bond fund, which began on Aug. 29, has no load but will charge a 0.25 percent fee on sales of shares held for less than 60 days. The Goldman Sachs Ultra-Short Duration Government fund charges a 1.5 percent front-end load and invests only in government and agency issues, giving it a rating of AAA.
Mr. Crane says the move toward ultrashort funds has been fueled by the long spell of low interest rates. With rates at 35-year lows, investors fear that they will inevitably move up and do not want to risk being hurt when that happens. Because long-term bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates, he said, people who hold them "could see double-digit losses if rates move up."
M. John Sterba, chairman of Investment Management Advisors of New York, said long-term investors should keep balanced portfolios of stocks, bonds and cash equivalents, rather than rushing to perceived safety. Still, he likes the Pimco Short-Term fund, which Morningstar categorizes as ultrashort, for short-term uses like paying a child's tuition for next year. He said the fund was also good for investors who are "so nervous they just can't sleep at night."
Wendy W. Cupps, an executive vice president at the Pacific Investment Management Company and its director of stable-value and short-term services, described Pimco Short-Term as "basically an enhanced money market fund." According to Morningstar, the fund yielded 1.69 percent for the 12 months through September, about six-tenths of a percentage point more than money markets. While money market funds keep a constant $1 net asset value, most ultrashort funds fluctuate slightly; that is the offset for the enhanced yield.
Ms. Cupps said the risk of Pimco Short Term was "very measured." The fund invests in securities with an average rating of AA and an average duration of 0.6 years. It has had only two negative months in the last 10 years, so investors who hold the fund for three months to a year are unlikely to experience any loss if they hold institutional or administrative class shares, which do not carry loads. 
But an investor who bought Class A shares, which have a 2 percent load, on Sept. 30, 2001, would be down 0.35 percent, according to Morningstar, while those who bought Class B shares, which have a deferred 5 percent load, would be down 3.01 percent if they bought them that day and sold on Sept. 30 this year.
Money that will not be needed for a while -- retirement savings, for example -- could earn higher returns in a longer-term fund like Pimco Total Return, Ms. Cupps said.
INDEPENDENT money managers agree that investors should not stage a wholesale retreat to ultrashort funds. 
Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer & Janachowski in Tiburon, Calif., who assembles fund portfolios for clients, said, "We use ultrashort funds when personal circumstances warrant it." For example, an investor wants to buy a house in a year or two, and has the money now. The ultrashort fund protects the principal until he is ready to buy.
People near retirement may also want to use ultrashort funds, Mr. Brower said, to stash 401(k) holdings until they are rolled over into an I.R.A. At that point, the account holder and adviser can decide how to invest the money.
Many 401(k) plans do not offer ultrashort or short-term bond funds, Ms. Cupps said, so investors wishing to follow that strategy may instead want to consider money market or stable-value funds, which aim to keep constant net asset values.
"We may see more being offered in 401(k)'s going forward," she said of ultrashort funds, given investors' current interest in them.

Wall Street Suffers; New York Winces

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
IN Houston, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't know at least a little about the oil business. Ditto in Detroit with the auto industry. And in Washington, people are so informed about the federal government that they know the difference between a deputy assistant under secretary and an assistant deputy under secretary.
 New York, of course, is different. It is perfectly possible to live in and around the five boroughs without having a clue about what's going on in what is probably city's most important industry. Unless you drive a "black car" for hire, or sold stogies in a now-defunct cigar bar or are yourself an investment banker, you may not realize just how dire things are on Wall Street. 
 Or you may not care. When every day seems to bring an indictment or allegation about evil-doing on Wall Street, when half of American households own stock and wish they didn't, when your retirement savings seems to have gone up in smoke, it may be hard to feel any interest in (much less sympathy for) anyone who works in the securities business.
And you may well not know anyone who works on the Street, at least directly. The good news, perhaps, is that Wall Street jobs account for less than 5 percent of employment in New York City.
And a recent study by Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist of the newsletter New York STAT, found that the city has more than its fair share of many national industries, including advertising, apparel, legal, real estate and broadcasting.
But the business that is really concentrated here, that makes New York different from the rest of the country and from other big cities, is Wall Street. (Ms. Denham found that New York has a higher concentration of the nation's securities business than Los Angeles does of the movie business.)
Even before Wall Street analysts became less admired than telemarketers and journalists, there was criticism of their lavish paychecks. Just how lavish is clear from new data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data shows that in New York State, people in the finance business made an average of almost $137,000 in 2001. No other industry in any state paid even close to that amount. The average salary in the United States, by the way, was slightly over $36,000; in New York, the average (which includes all these Wall Street types) was about $46,700.
So a Wall Street job is nice work if you can get it -- but you can't. There are already 18,300 fewer jobs on Wall Street than there were a year ago August, which just happens to have been the peak for employment in the securities business in New York.
And the outlook is bleak. This year is almost certain to be the third in a row that the stock market has fallen, the first three-year decline since 1939-1941. Last week the Standard & Poor's 500 index hovered about where it did in the spring of 1997 -- meaning that five years of investors' gains have been basically wiped out. For the technology-heavy Nasdaq, it's six years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just had its worst September in 65 years.
Americans continue to pull money out of the stock market. Commission revenues are down, and Wall Street's own trading profits have plunged.
Wall Street's most profitable business, investment banking, has imploded, according to a new report from the Securities Industry Association, the brokerage business's trade and lobbying group. Stock offerings in August were at the lowest level in more than a decade, bond deals seem to be drying up, and the urge to merge has pretty much evaporated from corporate boardrooms.
Bottom line, Wall Street's profits are likely to be the lowest in seven years, maybe in eight, according to the association. The compensation securities firms pay their employees has fallen by about 36 percent since the first quarter of 2000 -- but revenues have fallen by 40 percent. The Securities Industry Association says its members need to cut compensation costs from 55 percent of net revenues to 50 percent.
And that means more layoffs.
You may not feel like shedding a tear for the soon-to-be unemployed guys who raked it in during Wall Street's boom. 
But "each job on the street supports slightly more than two jobs in the local economy," says Frank A. Fernandez, chief economist for the association. And covers an awful lot of restaurant tabs, bar bills, co-op maintenance payments and private school tuitions. And, of course, city taxes.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
An Old-School Mind Not Fooled by the New Economy

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR. 

 BODY:
WALL STREET these days often seems a place of utter venality in the service of executive greed. So it is refreshing to read of a successful American financier whose interests range far beyond making money. What's more, the self-effacing manner of that financier, Leon Levy, makes you wonder how he could have succeeded. Characteristically, he muses about this himself.
 "My own meager achievements," writes Mr. Levy, no doubt baffle new acquaintances. 
 "I can even sense the question forming in the person's mind," he says. "How does a guy who can't find his pipe when smoke is coming out of his pocket manage to do so well?' After talking to me awhile, I'm sure people are even more mystified and leave the conversation convinced that it must be luck, that the heavy lifting has been done by my partners, or that I'm due for a fall."
This is a man who, though nominally retired, predicted the current market meltdown years before it happened, drawing heavily on conceptions inherited from his father, Jerome, of how the economy works. It is corporate profits, he contends, that govern not only stock prices but economic performance as well.
Mr. Levy, who joined Oppenheimer & Company in 1951 as partner and research director, was a pioneer in mutual funds and leveraged buyouts. He particularly favored spinoffs and bankruptcies as he bet heavily to unlock hidden value. His most spectacular success was in developing the strategy for the revival of the thrice-bankrupt Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad in the late 1970's.
This memoir, "The Mind of Wall Street" (Public Affairs, $26), written with Eugene Linden and appearing in bookstores next month, is more illuminating than the typical blow-by-blow recounting of a lifetime of deals. It combines tales of encounters with flamboyant promoters like Bernard Cornfeld, who paid salesmen bonuses in shares of his Investors Overseas Services fund in the 1960's, with wry observations about the nature of man and markets.
Mr. Levy argues that psychology -- one of "two loves" of his life, the other being the stock market -- is still underappreciated as an investing force despite the recent emergence of what is called behavioral analysis, which elevates emotions as a determinant of stock prices. The stock market is less rational than long supposed, Mr. Levy said, which is why it can't be mastered with a system or neat theory. 
He criticizes the argument, made mostly by academics, that markets are so highly efficient that no one can outperform them consistently.
"Markets may be inherently unpredictable -- the efficient-market theorists are right about that -- but there are always clues in the actions of government and in the behavior of major economic actors that offer guidance for the attentive about developments that offer opportunities," he writes.
For lessons in patient and visionary investing, he scrutinized monthly reports on stock trades by two of the canniest businessmen he'd ever come across: J. Paul Getty and the virtually unknown Sy Scheuer, a financier. Mr. Scheuer's grand strategy, executed over many years, produced a fortune from West Virginia Coal and Coke.
The bull market of the 1990's, Mr. Levy said, was "collective madness," floating "almost entirely on illusions" that included bookkeeping sleight of hand, the acceptance of stocks as the only securities worthy of the savvy and the notion that a new economy could grow forever. Similar views could be found in the 1960's as well, but Mr. Levy points out that the Dow Jones industrial average advanced just one point, to 875, from 1964 to 1981.
He places part of the blame for the 90's bubble on the shoulders of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who chose not to make it harder to buy stock with borrowed money and who supported legislation that gave banks more leeway to do business in the stock market.
But Mr. Levy is particularly hard on those he calls "overreachers," whom the market typically rewards for a spell but then inevitably punishes. 
He's not afraid to zing establishment peers like Felix G. Rohatyn, then a senior partner at Lazard, the New York investment bank, who, Mr. Levy said, used his privileged position to try to lure away Oppenheimer employees when Oppenheimer hired Mr. Rohatyn to broker the sale of the firm to Mercantile House in the early 1980's. 
On another occasion, Goldman Sachs signed on to defend the Trans World Corporation from a breakup promoted by Mr. Levy. Goldman had previously advised clients to buy Trans World stock on the grounds that the company's nonairline assets alone were worth more than its market capitalization. Mr. Levy calls the turnabout a precursor of the 1990's, "when events revealed with brilliant clarity whom investment bankers really represent."
NOT all of Mr. Levy's anecdotes are as amusing or pointed as he seems to hope, and the book is slightly marred by inattentiveness to the spelling of some names. In addition, he does not distinguish between percent and percentage points, calling a climb to 6 percent from 3 percent in the savings rate an increase of 3 percent; it is, in fact, 100 percent. The investment tips are useful, mainly eternal verities but with a sprinkling of the unorthodox: sell losers rather than winners, but don't obsess about portfolio rebalancing; get on the same side of a trend as the government and develop outside interests like, in his case, archaeology to provide perspective and to exercise imagination.
But those seeking stock market comfort won't get much from Mr. Levy. "My instincts, refined by 50 years of experience in finance, tell me that we are in but the third act of a five-act Shakespearean drama that portends a bad ending." he says, "Stock prices may have plummeted from their dizzying heights, but neither consumers nor investors have yet realized the perils of the suffocating pall of debt hanging over the financial world."
He also points to intensifying global competition and sees danger to a consumer-oriented economy in the inevitable rebuilding of depleted savings.
"Count on it," he said. "When the savings rate rises, my father observed, corporate profits fall." Slimmer profits mean less investment, fewer new jobs, more layoffs, depressed stock prices and perhaps even a reversal in the soaring price of real estate. 
Lately, he's bought euros.

Health Plans Are Offering Fewer Choices and Higher Costs

BYLINE:  By BETH KOBLINER 

 BODY:
SHALIA WATTS, a government employee from Sacramento, received some upsetting news in June: the health maintenance organization to which she belongs, Health Net, will no longer be available through her employer next year. At the same time, she said, she found that the monthly premium for the Blue Shield H.M.O. she chose as a replacement would be $110, almost double what she pays now. Co-payments for her prescription-drug plan already rose this year, she said, from $5 to a scale ranging from $10 to $30.
 "I'm starting to feel the financial pressure; it really adds up," said Ms. Watts, 48, who earns about $48,000 a year as a disability insurance program representative for the California Employment Development Department. 
 In addition to covering herself, Ms. Watts has two daughters, one of whom suffers from lupus, a chronic autoimmune disorder. She said the girl, Autumn, 12, was admitted to the hospital four times in the last year and required about 15 prescription medications daily, costing about $150 a month. "For someone who is in a lesser financial position, how would they be able to afford what I have?" she asked. "People are going to have to choose between eating or buying medication for their kids." 
Last week, the Census Bureau reported that 14.6 percent of the American population, or 41.2 million people, were without medical coverage in 2001. That was 1.4 million more than in the previous year.
This month starts another open enrollment period for the estimated 80 million Americans who participate in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. During October and November, employers will present workers with the changes in their health insurance offerings for next year and ask them to choose among the options. "There have been increased costs and significant changes in the way plans operate, so it's particularly important for employees to pay attention," said Richard Ostuw, a senior consultant at Towers Perrin, the human resources consulting firm.
Many workers, like Ms. Watts, will find fewer choices and higher costs, along with new options that reflect employers' moves to reduce costs and shift more responsibility for health care to their employees. "In 2003 we will see higher premiums, co-pays and deductibles," said Blaine Bos, a principal at Mercer Human Resources Consulting. "In 2004, we're likely to see more employers considering different types of plans that employees are currently not used to."
Workers are still digesting the 2002 increases. Employees are paying $2,084, on average, for family coverage, nearly $300 more than last year, according to a study conducted last spring and released in September by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care research group in Menlo Park, Calif., and the Health Research and Educational Trust, a research group in Chicago. Those with single coverage paid $454, about $100 more.
Employers' cost of providing coverage has risen sharply in the last few years, after a brief reprieve in health care inflation in the mid-1990's. The employer-paid premiums rose 12.7 percent this year, the highest annual increase since 1990 and the second consecutive year of double-digit increases, according to the Kaiser study. The average employer-paid premium is now $7,954 a family.
A survey released last week by Towers Perrin found that employers' health benefit plan costs would climb 15 percent next year, the biggest increase since the firm began conducting the study 13 years ago. The poll involed 268 large employers.
"Health care costs have gotten totally out of control and it's become clear that employers have to be even more active in sharing the burden with employees," said Wendy Rhodes, a consultant at Hewitt Associates, the benefits consulting firm. "Employees will have to face the music."
The portion of total premium costs paid by employees for family coverage has held steady at 27 percent in recent years, but that doesn't include the higher deductibles and co-payments for prescription drugs and doctor visits that employers have established to offset rising costs.
Many employers do not publicly announce increases in health insurance costs. But the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, which provides health benefits to California state employees, including Ms. Watts, announced last summer that its premiums would increase by 24 percent next year.
At the Boeing Company, unionized workers recently accepted a new contract that will significantly increase many employees' health care costs in 2004. Employees' premiums for family coverage on the most popular plan, a preferred provider organization, will jump to an estimated $197 a month in 2004 from the current $30. P.P.O. plans allow participants to seek care outside of a network, though at a higher cost than in-network doctors, and to see specialists without approval from primary care physicians.
"They are trying to force workers into the H.M.O. by making it too expensive to stay in the P.P.O.," said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for District Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists, which represents 25,000 Boeing workers.
But Ken Mercer, a Boeing spokesman, said that "there are three other lower cost options, and employees can choose the one that best fits their needs." He said Boeing picks up a larger share of employee health care costs -- about 90 percent for unionized machinist and aerospace workers -- than most other companies. 
Generally, employees may have fewer H.M.O. choices this year. For instance, even though overall enrollment in H.M.O.'s rose slightly last year, employers are scaling back the number of plans they offer. This year, 61 percent of employees had a choice of more than one H.M.O. plan, down from 81 percent in 1998, according to data from the Kaiser survey.
Employees should make sure that their doctors still participate in particular plans. "If your family doctor is no longer in your P.P.O. network, for instance, you could end up paying the out-of-plan deductible, which will be more expensive," said Erin Holve, a senior policy analyst at the Kaiser foundation.
Many large employers are also offering voluntary "disease management" or "health promotion" programs to contain costs by helping employees with chronic conditions to avoid complications and hospitalization.
Bobby Marks, 46, a manager at Western Machinery in Kapolei, Hawaii, found out that he had diabetes two years ago and suffered a heart attack five months later. After five days in the cardiac intensive care unit, Mr. Marks was contacted by a patient advocate from the Hawaii Medical Services Association, a branch of Blue Cross Blue Shield, and was enrolled in a disease management program that provided telephone consultation with nurses. They counseled him in layman's terms about his condition, advised him on nutrition and checked blood sugar levels monthly. "I didn't know the difference between a carbohydrate and a calorie," he said, adding that he has not had any medical problems since entering the program.
A study released last winter by Johnson & Johnson found that the company saved an estimated $8.5 million a year from 1995 to 1999 by reducing the need for doctor and hospital visits for employees who signed up for its wellness program. The company said 90 percent of the company's employees, who were offered a $500 annual discount on their premiums to sign up, participated in the program.
Tiered pricing is another way for employers to shift costs and responsibility to employees for health care decisions. More than half of all covered employees now have three-tiered prescription drug plans to encourage the purchase of less expensive generic drugs. Under a typical plan, an employee makes a co-payment of $9 when buying generic drugs, $17 for name-brand drugs if no generic is available and $26 for the name-brand drug if the generic substitute is available.
A SMALL but growing number of employers -- covering roughly 5 percent of insured workers this year -- have expanded tiered pricing to doctor and hospital visits, according to the Kaiser survey. "If you need a routine operation, for example, and you choose to go to a specialty hospital instead of a community hospital, you will pay a much higher co-pay," said Dr. Donald Young, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a lobbying group based in Washington.
A few other employers are also turning to "health reimbursement accounts" or "consumer driven" health plans, which shift some of the responsibility for managing costs to employees. Employees get a set amount of money to put into a health reimbursement account each year and to spend as they choose on health care. Once those funds run out, employees must meet deductibles that are usually higher than in traditional plans. (The Internal Revenue Service issued guidelines this year that allow employees to carry over unused cash to the next year.) 
Employers like the University of Minnesota and Raytheon began offering these types of plans as an option to their workers this year. Textron provides a consumer-driven plan as the sole plan for many of its employees. Several employers offering consumer-driven plans report that many employees find them cost-effective and like the sense of the control they offer. Some analysts, however, worry that such plans may be more expensive for chronically ill patients who use more health care services. 
Most analysts agree they are too new to evaluate fully. "They can be beneficial in giving employees more choice if they are offered in conjunction with a comprehensive health plan," said Phyllis Borzi, a research professor at the School of Public Health and Health Services at George Washington University Medical Center. "But some employees are afraid that they are being adopted mainly to shift costs and may be in the long run the first step in eliminating the employer's role in offering health insurance."

In Search of Better Odds in Retirement Planning

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HARRIS 

 BODY:
BEFORE Walt Huckabee, a retired engineer, buys mutual fund shares, he likes to take a test drive using a computer-based statistical technique known as Monte Carlo simulation.
 He contends that crunching numbers online, using a service available through his account at Vanguard, gives him a better sense of the range of possible financial returns for his investments, in good and bad markets. "It's the difference between theory and practice," said Mr. Huckabee, 60, of Placerville, Calif. 
 The bear market has made people like him look for more precise methods of assessing whether their portfolios will provide enough retirement income. Companies seeking independent advice to help employees invest for retirement have made Monte Carlo simulation widely available. 
The developers of Monte Carlo simulation warn that the technique is imperfect at best, but they say it helps display the range of possible returns more accurately than do other methods. 
Traditional financial projections generally assume a fixed annual compounded return, and fixed interest and inflation rates. Monte Carlo simulations, which use random numbers to imitate behavior, run investments through thousands of situations to assess the probability of reaching a financial goal. Calculations assume variations in inflation, interest rates and market returns based in part on history's wide range of returns, going back to the 1920's. 
The largest companies that generate Monte Carlo simulations for investors include Financial Engines of Palo Alto, Calif., Morningstar of Chicago and Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual fund company. 
Financial Engines supplies online simulations to 20 financial institutions, including Vanguard, which generally make the techniques available free to their investors. Financial Engines also provides number-crunching services to 800 companies, including McDonald's and Occidental Petroleum, for their employees. Together, these investors number more than three million. 
Fidelity has made its Monte Carlo simulations available to 15 million customers. Investors may also get the services directly from Morningstar and Financial Engines.
Mathematicians developed the statistical technique in the 1940's, and it was used in thousands of calculations to develop the first atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project during World War II, said Christopher Jones, executive vice president for financial research and strategy at Financial Engines. 
As computer power has become cheaper, many professions have adopted Monte Carlo simulation to describe the behavior of complex systems. It is used to manage traffic, search for oil and determine proper doses for radiation cancer therapy. 
"It's useful where the problem you are studying is so complex, it's analytically very hard to determine the overall behavior of the system," Mr. Jones said.
William F. Sharpe, the chairman of Financial Engines and a Nobel winner in economics in 1990, began applying Monte Carlo simulations to individual investors' portfolios later in the decade. With Mr. Jones, he created a software recipe that mixes thousands of pieces of data by tracking 15 types of investments, or asset classes, like long-term government bonds or large-cap value stocks, with financial and economic factors like interest rate shifts and their effects on capital markets. Information about 20,000 stocks and mutual funds contributes in forecasting performance.
Because Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the inherent uncertainty of financial markets, Dr. Sharpe regards it as superior to other ways of gauging future performance -- like calculating a linear, or fixed rate of return. One such linear calculator, found on Quicken.com, tallies investment performance by assuming an annual average rate of return, like 8 percent, and projecting it forward. Monte Carlo simulations use more varied assumptions. All presume differing rates of return over time, but Morningstar's ClearFuture projects returns for entire asset classes, while Financial Engines projects returns for individual mutual funds and equities. 
 WHEN using an online Monte Carlo program, an investor saving for retirement enters information about when he wishes to retire, how much he has saved and what investments he owns. The results show potential outcomes based on the best, worst and most likely results.
For example, using Financial Engines, a 48-year-old investor with a $300,000 portfolio of stock and bond mutual funds who saves an additional $6,500 annually has an 83 percent likelihood of retiring with at least a $50,000 income at age 65 (including about $20,000 in Social Security income). The results of the calculation would be a range of outcomes, the most likely being $64,700. The calculation also indicates a 5 percent likelihood of hitting $103,000 a year, and an equal probability of receiving $42,100 a year.
With the Quicken calculator, the same investor would get one outcome. Using fixed projections, the investor would retire at 65 with an average income of $71,240, based on an 8 percent expected return and a 3 percent inflation rate. (That includes the same Social Security income.) 
"In the past, people were happy to project a linear model, but the problem with that is, it's linear," said Ray Martin, president of CitiStreet Advisors. "If you're projecting a 10 percent return, the problem is it has to be 10 percent. I call it a perfect 10 and there's no investment that even grows at a perfect 3 -- there's always variability."
Understanding variable market returns helped Mr. Huckabee, the retired engineer, reshape his portfolio. When he retired in 1998 as a system engineer at Lockheed Martin, he began to understand the risks of his growth-heavy 401(k) portfolio. Financial Engines calculations suggested that adding more value stocks would lower his risk; he says his portfolio has been beating the market. "I've been treading water in this downturn," he said, "but it's better than the significant declines you would have if you were just taking the total market approach."
But the Monte Carlo method has its critics. David Nawrocki, a finance professor at Villanova University, challenges the simulations' reliance on normal distributions, or results that resemble bell curves, when those are not typical in financial markets. 
"The probability results from Monte Carlo simulation may look impressive to a client," said Dr. Nawrocki, a consultant to PIE Technologies, a company that developed MoneyGuidePro, financial planning software. "However, if that number is derived from assumptions that are not realistic, there is no value to the number." He said he is working on alternatives. 
Dr. Sharpe acknowledges that market returns do not always mirror the pattern of a bell curve. So, he said, Financial Engines makes more complex assumptions and mixes in asymmetric patterns to mimic real life. "I don't see how anyone can be a critic of trying to project that there is uncertainty," he said. "If you're going to project anything like the complexity of the market, you're almost doomed to Monte Carlo rather than using analytic projections."
Andrew Clark, a senior research analyst at Lipper, points out that the calculations are based on limited financial market history. "From my standpoint, it is more of a learning tool -- it may give you a bounce, the top and bottom, but please do not take it as gospel," Mr. Clark said.
Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic Capital, a wealth management firm in Chatham, N.J., says that while the approach does not yield precise predictions, it gives investors a more sophisticated picture. "There's no perfect forecasting tool, but Monte Carlo simulations are the best ones we have," Mr. Cordaro said. "At least you're demonstrating there's a probability for different returns, and we're at least acknowledging it's not going to come out perfectly."

Wisdom in Betting Against the Bulls

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE stock market's continuing slide pulled the returns of all stock mutual fund categories into negative territory in the third quarter, including sector funds and those that invest in overseas markets or that combine stocks and bonds in one portfolio. 
 Over all, the diversified domestic equity funds gave up 16.1 percent of their value, according to Morningstar Inc., while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.6 percent. 
 The list of top performers was dominated by bear funds intended to thrive during declines in the market by using strategies like shorting stocks -- selling borrowed shares in the hope of replacing them at lower prices. 
Managers of some of the more successful diversified funds that were open to new investors talked about their results, and what they saw ahead in the stock market.

Funds for the Short Term
The $208 million ProFunds UltraBear fund, which rose 33.8 percent, took first place among all domestic diversified stock funds for the quarter. It uses short sales, futures, options and other financial instruments to provide double the inverse return of the S.& P. 500.
"UltraBear is designed to perform well when the market goes down, and the fund did what it was supposed to do in the third quarter," said Michael L. Sapir, chief executive of ProFunds Advisors in Bethesda, Md. ProFunds manages about $2.5 billion, including 45 index mutual funds.
UltraBear is one of six of the company's index-based short funds, which should climb when the market declines -- and fall when it rises, making them unsuitable long-term investments for most people. The company's Bear fund is intended to return the inverse of the S.& P. 500. The ShortOTC returns the inverse of the Nasdaq 100 index, while UltraShortOTC doubles that inverse. ShortSmall-Cap returns the inverse of the Russell 2000 index, and Rising Rates Opportunity, 125 percent of the inverse of the most recently issued 30-year Treasury bond.
The bear funds can be used in two ways, Mr. Sapir said. Investors can buy shares to profit from expected market declines; UltraBear, because of its leverage, is particularly risky. Or they can use the fund to hedge, or protect, their portfolios.
But they shouldn't plan to hold too long. "We view the funds as short-term investments because, over the long term, we believe that the markets increase in value," Mr. Sapir said. Some investors hold shares for a month or so, others for up to a year.
The company also offers 16 long funds -- based on the S.& P. 500, the Dow Jones 30 industrials and other market indexes -- that let investors profit from a climbing market. Not surprisingly, several of these funds top the list of the quarter's biggest losers. ProFunds UltraOTC, which doubles the Nasdaq 100, lost 42.1 percent, while its sibling, UltraSmall-Cap, which doubles the return of the Russell 2000, lost 40 percent.

Bearish Since 1996
The $515 million Prudent Bear fund, which rose 17.5 percent for the quarter, placed second among actively managed diversified equity funds and ninth over all. The fund mostly shorts individual stocks to make money in declining markets, David W. Tice, the manager, said.
The fund tends to perform poorly when the market rises. For example, it lost 22.1 percent in the fourth quarter last year, when the S.& P. 500 was rising 10.7 percent.
Currently, the fund holds about 125 short positions in stocks and 75 long positions, about two-thirds of which are invested in shares of gold companies. Investors tend to flock to gold stocks as protection against a declining stock market.
"We've been bearish since 1996, when Alan Greenspan made his 'irrational exuberance' speech," Mr. Tice said. "That looks terribly early now, but it's very clear today that he was right and that's why we're in for such a long bear market."
Mr. Tice predicted that the bear market would last three to five more years. In the short term, he expects the market to move much lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting 3,000 or so over the next 12 to 18 months. It closed on Sept. 30 at 7,591.93
"We believe that the excesses have to be worked off, and that we have to pay the price for so much debt," Mr. Tice said. "Consumers have driven the economy largely by accumulating too much credit, and the economy today is very unbalanced."
Among the fund's best performers in the quarter was a short position in J. P. Morgan Chase. "We felt that the credit quality would erode," Mr. Tice said, "and it did." 
Another short position, in Juniper Networks in Sunnyvale, Calif., also did well. The stock fell from a high of about $15 in early March, to below $5 in September, primarily because of declining sales created by the technology slump, he said. He would not confirm whether either short position was still open.
Among the fund's long positions, a big driver of its recent performance was Harmony Gold Mining of South Africa. The shares are traded on five international exchanges, including the Nasdaq, where they trade as American depository receipts. Mr. Tice paid $6, a share, on average; the stock closed the third quarter at $15.65.
"It's a very well managed company," Mr. Tice said. "And the stock went up in the quarter with the rest of the gold stocks.

Guarantees for Pessimists
 A series of four "target maturity" funds managed by Scudder Investments landed among the top 20 performers. Target maturity funds typically guarantee the return of capital to investors who reinvest all dividends and hold their shares to maturity. Scudder Target 2012, up 2.5 percent in the quarter, is the only one of the Scudder series on the top-performers' list that is open to new investors.
Over the five years through Sept. 30, the fund has had a gain of 3.3 percent, annualized. 
Some principal-protected funds use insurance to guarantee return of investors' principal. Scudder 2012, however, buys enough zero-coupon Treasury bonds to provide the guarantee, the company said. Zero-coupon bonds don't make interest payments; instead, investors buy the bonds at discounts to their face value and then redeem them at face value when they mature. The bonds account for about 65 percent of the fund's assets.
The balance of the fund typically is invested in large-company growth stocks, overseen by Kathleen Millard, the fund's lead portfolio manager. During the third quarter, however, the fund's return was driven by its bond holdings, overseen by Scott E. Dolan.
Over all, the zero coupons rose about 12 percent in the quarter, said Mr. Dolan, 36, because of declining interest rates. The five-year Treasury bond fell about 150 basis points, and the 10-year Treasury about 120 basis points since the end of June. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"Because we don't rely on insurance, we used more fixed income, which benefited shareholders in the third quarter," Mr. Dolan said. "Fixed income has been a safe haven during this market environment. It clearly highlights the need for diversification among asset classes, not just in your stock portfolio."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Value Funds a Haven? In This Slump, Hardly

BYLINE:  By PETER EAVIS 

 BODY:
THE bargain hunters never bargained for this.
 Mutual fund managers who specialize in spotting undervalued stocks often relish market declines, because they expect to find more companies trading at attractive prices. But the current market swoon is proving deeply frustrating for even these so-called value funds. 
 Their biggest bets have performed much worse than expected, hurting the funds' returns and damaging their managers' images as discerning stock pickers. 
Value managers reaped good returns in the past by scooping up stocks that had fallen out of favor. But this year, many of their choices have continued declining. The main culprit is earnings prospects, which have deteriorated sharply in the weak economy. They have helped to drag down the Standard & Poor's 500 index by 29 percent through September, hurting returns for nearly all types of stock funds.
"If you've been in equities, it doesn't matter what you've owned in the past few months, because there's been nowhere to hide," said Bill Nygren, manager of the Oakmark fund, which takes a value approach. 
But the lackluster returns of value funds have not resulted only from the general market decline. Funds have also made some spectacularly inopportune purchases. Recent accounting scandals have punished many value funds, even though value managers are known for being cautious investors who thoroughly analyze financial statements. WorldCom and Adelphia Communications, both of which filed for bankruptcy protection this year, were owned by several large value funds.
Both companies were held by the Vanguard Windsor fund, which lost 20.2 percent of its value in the 12 months through Sept. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. Charles T. Freeman, the manager of Windsor, declined to comment. The Pimco Value fund was another large owner of WorldCom, and, at the end of July, the fund also had high exposure to other stocks that have fallen sharply in recent months, including J. P. Morgan Chase and El Paso, the energy company. The Pimco fund was down 24.4 percent in the 12 months through Sept. 30. Phil Neugebauer, a spokesman for Pimco, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
"There is opportunity for value funds, but investing is riskier for them than it was in the past," said Harold Evensky, the chairman of Evensky, Brown & Katz, a financial planning firm in Coral Gables, Fla. "There could be more shoes to drop in corporate America."
On average, value funds investing in large companies lost 18.6 percent in the 12 months through Sept. 30, according to Morningstar, compared with a 21.7 percent decline for the S.& P. 500. That slight outperformance may not be enough to convince investors to buy shares in an actively-managed value fund rather than an S.& P. 500 index fund. In fact, Mr. Evensky said most value managers were finding it hard to beat value-style exchange-traded funds, which track the equity markets the way indexed mutual funds do but trade throughout the day like stocks. For example, the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index, an exchange-traded fund, was down a less severe 18.6 percent for the 12 months through September and is far cheaper for individual investors than almost any value fund because of lower fees. Another exchange-traded fund, iShares S.& P. MidCap 400/Barra Value, which focuses on medium-sized companies, was actually up 2.7 percent for the period. 
Value funds' lead over growth funds has been shrinking of late. In contrast to value funds, growth funds focus more on the earnings power of a company than on whether the stock is cheap. Value funds have done markedly better for the last 12 months than growth funds. Large-cap growth funds were down 20.9 percent for the 12 months through September. But in the third quarter, growth funds investing in large companies were actually down less than their large-cap value funds, 15.9 percent versus 18.2 percent. 
Dissatisfaction with value funds may be showing up in the tallies of money flowing in and out of funds. After attracting nearly $50 billion of net inflows in the first five months of the year, value funds had a $10.5 billion net outflow from June to August, according to Lipper, a fund-tracking firm.
In this brutal market, some of the most prominent value managers have taken hits. Perhaps the most revered value manager is William H. Miller III of the Legg Mason Value Trust, the only fund to beat the S.& P. 500 in each of the last 11 calendar years. With a 28.5 percent decline through September, it lagged behind the index by about 0.5 percentage points. The Legg Mason Opportunity fund, a value fund also managed by Mr. Miller, was down 29 percent.
Big recent stock purchases by Mr. Miller have hurt him. On June 30, the third-largest holding in the Value Trust was MGIC Investment, a mortgage insurer that fell sharply in September after issuing an earnings warning. The fund also held big positions in Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and Fannie Mae, all down substantially this year. 
In the Opportunity fund, AmeriCredit, the consumer lender, was the portfolio's biggest holding at the end of June. It fell more than 48 percent in September after announcing that it would issue stock to improve its liquidity.
Mr. Miller declined to comment.
Mr. Nygren of the Oakmark fund, another celebrated manager, has also seen some large holdings decline sharply. One was Electronic Data Systems, the computer services provider that plummeted over 65 percent in September because it said future earnings would be well below expectations. Mr. Nygren said he could not comment on EDS. The Oakmark fund was down 11.8 percent for the 12 months through September.
SOME value managers remain upbeat. Bob Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert fund, down 7.6 percent for the 12 months through September, said: "The negativity has gone way too far. This is the most opportune time for investing I've ever seen." 
Mr. Olstein's bets on certain financial companies and semiconductor makers have not served him well this year, but one large investment in an unloved industry has done better. That is the Arkansas Best Corporation, a trucking company that he regards as well positioned to gain customers who once used Consolidated Freightways, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September. "Arkansas Best has the excess capacity to easily pick up the new business," Mr. Olstein said. At the end of September, the stock was up 60 percent from its July low.
Many value investors love panic sell-offs, believing that investors mistakenly lose faith in damaged companies. Many, including Mr. Miller, have bought Tyco International, which is trying to resuscitate its reputation after its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, and chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, were indicted on fraud charges. 
The Tyco bet could backfire badly. Tyco is conducting a review of its bookkeeping but said last week that it had found nothing so far that would require additional disclosure. But if problems are found, many value funds could suffer another serious setback.

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
Social Security and the Ballot Box

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS the November election approaches, House and Senate stalwarts of Social Security privatization have backed away from the issue as if it were toxic. 
 And for two very good reasons. 
 First, if past voting patterns hold, older Americans will have more influence than ever because in nonpresidential election years, younger voters tend to drop out. In the midterm election of 1998, some 58 percent of the voters were over 45, nearly half were over 50 and close to one-third were over 60, according to census data and surveys of voters leaving the polls. In recent presidential election years, fewer than one-quarter of voters were over 60. 
Second, nearly 70 percent of Americans over 60 strongly oppose private Social Security accounts that would allow investment in stocks and bonds, according to a poll in August for the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group, by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. 
Interestingly, the question on privatization did not use the words "private" or "privatization." It simply described the proposal for personal accounts that is supported by President Bush, most Republicans and some conservative and moderate Democrats. That is important, because proponents of privatization have found in their polling that the term "privatization" -- not necessarily the concept -- is viewed negatively by voters. That is why Republican strategists have urged their candidates to avoid the "p" word. Even the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute, which has pushed aggressively for private Social Security accounts, has changed the name of its effort from Project on Social Security Privatization to Project on Social Security Choice.
But the Hart poll indicates that the problem is more than a choice of words, especially in light of the stock market's swoon and scandals that have engulfed corporate America.
Hans Riemer, a senior policy analyst at the Campaign for America's Future, a liberal research organization in Washington, says politicians are avoiding the privatization term to obscure the picture and to convince the public that they're not advocating major change. "Most are trying to inoculate themselves on the issue and not have a real debate about it," he said. "It's an election-year trick, not a conversion."
So, assuming that they win, will these representatives and senators go right back to pushing for privatization? "They might," Mr. Riemer said. "But it's going to be tough to switch back after backing away from it in a campaign." He expects, however, that if the Republicans retain control of the House, there will be a vote next year on privatization of Social Security; if the Democrats take the House, the issue may be dead for a long time.
Some opponents of privatization fear that with talk of war with Iraq dominating the news, Social Security and other domestic issues will take a back seat on Election Day.
But Mr. Riemer says that pocketbook issues are bubbling along just beneath the surface and will wind up as the main factor in determining how people vote.
"What's on people's minds back home may be more their 401(k) plans than Iraq," he said. "These stock market plunges have a huge impact on people's lives. They are concerned about the market, the economy, about losing jobs. I don't think war talk will divert their attention. They're going to vote for people they think they can trust to handle their Social Security."
People like Mr. Riemer object to privatization because the money diverted to personal accounts in Social Security, a pay-as-you-go system, would cause a cut in benefits unless the government borrowed to make up the difference. "There would have to be hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits," he said, "in an environment where we're in deficit, we're looking at the prospect of war and the economy could very well be on the verge of another recession."
He also fears that personal accounts invested in stocks would create a two-tiered system of winners and losers that could damage the social fabric. "They say with the average return of the market, everyone's better off," he said. "But average means nearly half of the people don't do as well."
Proponents of privatization argue that it will "save" the Social Security trust fund from going broke as increasing numbers of people retire. But some economists say such dire consequences are unlikely anyhow because the Social Security trustees use economic growth projections that are too pessimistic. These economists say that even with these pessimistic projections, the trust fund is rock-solid until 2041 and, with relatively minor tinkering, probably for 30 years after that. Slightly more optimistic projections -- in line with historical growth rates -- brighten the picture considerably.
Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of "Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw-Hill, $29.95), agrees that economic growth will go a long way toward solving Social Security problems.
Nevertheless, he favors partial privatization, not because it will rescue the system but because he thinks it will encourage people to save. He's not too concerned about creating winners and losers. "Our 401(k) plans generate winners and losers; we've certainly accepted that," Professor Siegel said.
Roger Zion, a former Republican representative from Indiana, is the honorary chairman of the 60 Plus Association, which bills itself as a conservative alternative to AARP. A strong advocate of privatization, he scolds Republican candidates for running away from the issue. "They should not be afraid," he said. "They should stick to their guns."
But he's not running for re-election.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Why Dec. 31 Is a Good Day to Stay Out of the Market

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
RECENT research into mutual fund trading helps to explain why one quarter's top funds tend to continue winning for only a few weeks before reversing course.
 The researchers have found that on the last trading day of each quarter, and especially at year-end, many fund managers appear to be manipulating the prices of the stocks they own. They do so by placing buy orders for their stocks in the last few minutes before the close. That can be expected to push up prices, artificially bolstering fund performance in the quarterly or annual rankings that receive so much attention. 
 Under some circumstances, this practice is illegal. The Securities and Exchange Commission specifically outlaws "marking the close," which is defined as "attempting to influence the closing price of a stock by executing purchase or sale orders at or near the close of the market." Though the accusation is difficult to prove, the S.E.C. has occasionally taken action -- most recently in August 2001, when it censured two money management firms for engaging in the practice: the American subsidiary of ABN Amro and Oeschle International Advisors of Boston.
"Marking the close" resembles end-of-quarter window dressing, another activity that occurs just before the quarter-end deadline for reporting stock holdings to the S.E.C. Fund managers often put their best foot forward by selling recent poor performers and buying strong ones. That is entirely legal. 
In their study, the researchers concluded, however, that the behavior they detected was not window dressing. (The research was by Mark M. Carhart, co-head of quantitative strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and three finance professors: Ron Kaniel of the University of Texas at Austin, David K. Musto of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Adam V. Reed of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their report, "Leaning for the Tape: Evidence of Gaming Behavior in Equity Mutual Funds," was in the April issue of the Journal of Finance.)
One distinction between window dressing and marking the close has to do with timing. Window dressing is spread out over a number of sessions before a quarter's end. But marking the close is concentrated in the closing minutes of a quarter's last trading day, creating the illusion of heightened demand for a stock and sending its price upward.
The researchers found clear evidence of late, concentrated buying when they analyzed minute-by-minute trading volume from July 1993 to June 1999. They detected a clear burst of volume in the last five minutes of each quarter's final session. It was especially pronounced at year-end, when average volume in the final minutes was 27 percent higher than the average for the last five minutes of all other trading days.
Because marking the close is most common among funds that are near the top of the rankings, the researchers focused on stocks owned by the 20 percent of funds with the best year-to-date performance on the next-to-last trading day. They compared these stocks to a list of all best-performing issues over the previous six months -- the primary beneficiaries of window dressing. If funds were not marking the close, these two groups of stocks should have exhibited similar performances on the last trading day of each year.
In fact, there was a significant difference. From 1989 to 1995, for example, the stocks of the top-performing funds performed a quarter of a percent better than the other group on the last day of the year. That is a big shift for so brief a period, equivalent to nearly 90 percent when annualized. 
The extraordinary short-term performance of these top funds' stocks does more than improve the funds' records. It also improves the performance of other funds that happen to own the same stocks. That can be seen in the high percentage of funds that beat the market on the last day of the year. On those days from 1985 to 1997, some 80 percent of equity funds, on average, beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. That is about four times higher than the norm.
The researchers found additional, though somewhat weaker, evidence of marking the close at the end of the other three quarters of the year. On those three days, 62 percent of equity funds, on average, beat the S.& P. 500. The authors speculate that this number is smaller because quarterly rankings do not get as much attention as annual ones. Still, they say, finishing at the top of the quarterly rankings is enough incentive to lead some managers to use the practice.
The findings also help explain why a quarter's top funds so quickly reverse course. In fact, the outperformance rarely lasts more than a couple of months, and the average top-performing fund from a given quarter will be underperforming the market within six months.
A major contributor to this quick reversal is the top funds' price manipulation, according to three theoreticians who are building on this research. They are the finance professors Dan Bernhardt, of the University of Illinois, and Ryan Davies, of the University of Reading in England, along with Harvey Westbrook Jr. of the S.E.C.'s Office of Economic Analysis. They argue that by marking the close, top-performing funds in effect have borrowed from future quarters to improve their current performance. The funds begin the subsequent quarter with a handicap: the artificially inflated prices of the stocks they own.
The top funds' reversals are not immediate, however, because the funds benefit from the new cash they receive after investors read the quarterly fund rankings. Because the funds invest at least some of their new cash in the stocks they already own, these stocks tend to outperform the market for several more weeks. 
"But eventually the distortion in investments will catch up and lead to a reversal in fund performance," the theorists say.
All of this research has clear implications for mutual fund investors.
First, investors may be wise to avoid investing in equities on the last day of the quarter, and especially on the last day of the year, because the chances are good that prices will be artificially inflated. (Many investors may be unaware that their workplace retirement plans often invest money on those very days.) 
A simple switch to investing on the next-to-last day of the quarter could improve performance markedly -- by as much as 4 percent a year, on average, for aggressive small-cap strategies, according to Mr. Carhart and his co-authors.
Another implication of this research is that investors who choose funds according to their performance over the most recent quarter or year will need to switch often. If they don't, chances are that they will invest in a fund that continues to perform well for just a few more weeks or months and then underperforms over the long run.

HEADLINE: NOTICED; 
It Growls, It's Creepy, It's at Your House

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to Halloween, Kenneth and Tracy Koessler admit they go to extremes. It's not just that Mr. Koessler once turned their front lawn into a haunted graveyard -- with a grave-size hole for himself so he could rise from the "dead," scaring the kidneys out of young trick-or-treaters. The Koesslers have also spent thousands of dollars on the kinds of animated props once found only in movies and spook houses. There's the creepy shipping crate that shakes and growls at anyone who comes near and that cost nearly $3,000. That's tame next to the $5,000 Deep Fryer, a full-size model of a man in an electric chair who writhes and smokes. 
 "I know they're costly, but my husband is a fanatic," Ms. Koessler said. 
 One company hopes that there are a lot of people like the Koesslers around. Smarthome, which sells household automation gadgetry, has a new catalog this fall filled with what it calls "Extreme Halloween" items costing thousands, and even tens of thousands, of dollars. It draws together props made by companies that cater to the theme park and haunted hayride trade, and offers them to homeowners, who in recent years have turned Halloween into another holiday to gaudily appoint their houses.
The most expensive item in the catalog, a Sleeping Giant that costs $35,000, roars and rises to a height of nearly 12 feet when an unwitting trick-or-treater steps on a concealed foot pad. Menacing dinosaur heads, raging dogs, exploding toilets and ravaging alligators are also offered to anyone willing to spend frightening amounts of money.
"Five years ago, it would have never occurred to me that people would want to buy something like this" for home use, said Mark McDonough, whose company, Creative Visions in St. Louis, makes some of the Koesslers' props, and whose products are featured in the Smarthome catalog. 
Matt Dean, vice president for marketing of Smarthome, based in Irvine, Calif., cheerfully admits that he does not expect to sell any Sleeping Giants. "We've got a strategy sort of like the way Neiman Marcus does it," he said. "A couple of luxury products to grab your attention." He said he hopes people will pick up the catalog for the outrageous $35,000 ogre on the cover and linger long enough to buy brain-shaped gelatin molds ($22, with hand and heart molds thrown in) and CD's like the $10 "Martha Stewart Living: Spooky Scary Sounds for Halloween."
In some ways, the catalog seems like the ghost of Halloweens past -- say, 1999, when the stock bubble had people feeling rich and frisky. But with the economy itself looking a little like a haunted hayride, Halloween fanatics are saying that they don't expect to be buying any Living Walls ("looks like it's coming to life, with a head and two hands pushing through the room") for $3,000.
John Hayward, a retired stock analyst living in Connecticut, who bought about $200 worth of Halloween decorations from Smarthome last year, said he didn't expect to buy any of the high-dollar goodies. 'No, certainly not this year," he said. "I mean come on, Buster. Where have you been?"
Even the Koesslers, who live in Webster Groves, Mo., say they are pulling back. They have a new baby, and Mrs. Koessler said she had to plead with her husband to keep him from buying an even more ghoulish -- and expensive -- version of the Deep Fryer. 
"This should wait," she recalled saying. "College fund. Not the electrocution guy."

Rival to Pokemon Keeps Market Hot

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
JAPAN'S economy may be in the dumps, but one industry here has taken the world by storm: trading-card games.
 Three years after Nintendo's Pokemon washed over American living rooms, children and their harried parents are now immersed in Yu-Gi-Oh. Its maker, Konami, has taken a page from Nintendo and turned its franchise into a multimedia blitz, creating the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, software, cartoons and toys. 
 With a more elaborate story line than Pokemon and plentiful characters, Yu-Gi-Oh has surpassed Pokemon in popularity in the United States, according to Comics and Games Retailer, a trade magazine that polls retailers monthly about cards that are in greatest demand.
Yu-Gi-Oh, which translates as "Game King," is based on a comic book series that first ran in 1996 in Weekly Boys Jump, a Japanese youth magazine. The story revolves around a shy boy named Yu-Gi who fights virtual monsters that have powers gained from an ancient "millennium puzzle" that his grandfather helps him solve. 
The success of Yu-Gi-Oh shows that animated characters and game software remain among Japan's hottest exports. Fans overseas like Japanese animation not only because of its shoot-'em-up action heroes but also because of its multilayered tales and elaborate plots.
As always, timing is important, and Konami's has been good. With sales of Pokemon on the wane in the past few years, children were looking for something new. Yu-Gi-Oh cards, which show monsters and the exotic weapons used to battle them, were released this spring in the United States and have far outpaced analysts' expectations, a good sign going into the Christmas season. Their American popularity has also given Konami a boost just as sales in Japan, where the cards were introduced in 1999, have slowed..
"Everything is clicking for Konami," said Zachary Liggett, an analyst for WestLB Panmure Securities in Tokyo. "Retailers in the U.S. are really pumped on Japanese content, and Konami's road has largely been paved by Pokemon."
Because of Yu-Gi-Oh's strong American showing, analysts have raised their overall projections for Konami. News that American sales of Yu-Gi-Oh cards hit 2 billion yen, or $17 million, from April through June has helped lift Konami's shares 35 percent in last two months. (Konami's American shares, which were listed last Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Friday at $23.90, off 7.5 percent for the week.) 
Mr. Liggett now expects Konami to earn 8.3 billion yen, or $69 million, in the year ending in March 2003, 18 percent above his earlier estimates, on revenue of about 237 billion yen. The earnings figure, he concedes, is conservative and may rise as Konami's American distributor, Upper Deck, releases more cards.
A key to the longevity of any game is how often it is expanded. Fortunately for Konami, which has produced a string of hit computer games like "Metal Gear Solid" and "Duel Monsters," just one-tenth of the 2,000 Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh cards have been translated and released in the United States. "That should keep the game going for a long time," said Joyce Greenholdt, associate editor of Comics and Games Retailer. "Upper Deck is trying to release the cards in waves and giving only a few boxes of the cards to each store at a time." 
Prices range from $4 for a nine-card pack to $15 for a 50-card starter deck. But some stores charge more because of the cards' popularity.
Keeping the tension between supply and demand is crucial in the American card market, worth about $300 million in annual sales. When companies release too many cards, children are overwhelmed and run out of money before finding them all. Releasing too few can cause boredom. Worse, shortages can lead to price gouging, fights at school and headaches for parents.
Unlike Pokemon, which encouraged fans to collect the entire series, Yu-Gi-Oh is intended more as a game of strategy -- a difference that should temper some of the frenzy. 
In the Yu-Gi-Oh comic book series, which has sold 25 million copies in Japan so far, Yu-Gi plays a card game similar to the one released as a separate product in Japan in 1999. The game was an instant hit and there was even a riot when Konami ran out of special-edition cards at a promotional event in Tokyo. Konami also helped develop two television shows based on the comic book and designed game software for Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameBoy Advance. Yu-Gi has also been plastered on T-shirts, shoes, bags and stationery.
In one sign of the popularity, 30 operators at Konami's customer support center field about 1,000 calls a day from children and parents wanting to know the game's rules. Konami also sponsors Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments, including one in Tokyo in August that drew 6,000 children from six Asian countries.
The game's appeal and Konami's cross-marketing helped turn Yu-Gi-Oh into a half-billion-dollar business two years ago, when it peaked in Japan with profit margins of more than 50 percent.
Konami's margins are only two-thirds as large overseas because of translation and distribution costs. Though Upper Deck, which is privately held, does not release sales figures, the company says Yu-Gi-Oh is outselling its traditional No. 1 product, baseball cards. "Most of it has been driven purely by word of mouth, which speaks to the strength of the game," said Mary Mancera, a spokeswoman for Upper Deck.
Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon and other Japanese character-driven games have also made trading-card games far more popular in the United States than they were a few years ago, Ms. Mancera said. American children, it seems, are intrigued by Japanese games that involve underdogs who can outwit more powerful foes. "American kids like strong, fast and big characters," said Satoshi Shimomura, the executive producer of Yu-Gi-Oh at Konami Computer Entertainment Japan Inc. "Of course, Japanese like strong, fast and big characters, but they also like to overcome them by themselves."
Unlike Pokemon, which is geared toward elementary-school boys and girls, Yu-Gi-Oh is aimed at boys 8 to 14 who crave more sophisticated competition. The rules are simple -- players start with 8,000 "life points" and attack one another using the powers on the cards until their points run out. But the varieties of cards and uses add levels of complexity.
"I beat video games so easily that they're not really a challenge anymore," said Elijah Crumpton, 12, of Denver, who spent the $600 he made washing cars this summer on Yu-Gi-Oh cards. "I like reading about the special powers, the cool pictures and the cool names."
Although Yu-Gi-Oh's story and characters are the same in Japan and the United States, the pictures have been altered to match American sensibilities. Nudity, extreme violence and religion have been excised from the American versions. For example, the Japanese card Mizuno Odoriko, or Aqua Dancer, shows a bare-breasted woman with water flowing from an urn above her. In the American version, she wears a mermaid outfit. Among others, a card that refers to witch-hunting was not released in the United States.
That, of course, means little to boys who enjoy the exclusivity of the game, which is less popular among girls and often unfathomable to parents. "Most girls are into Barbie dolls and babies," said Kieshia Lewis, another 12-year-old boy, who has 200 Yu-Gi-Oh cards. "They need to make cards with Powerpuff Girls on them so the boys don't want them." (More than 90 percent of Yu-Gi-Oh's players are boys.)
TO fuel the boom, Shueisha Publishing, the original publisher of the Japanese comic book series that started the Yu-Gi-Oh rage, will introduce an English version of the comic book in the United States on Nov. 1. Konami plans to introduce the cards in Britain next month. The company is staggering the cards' introduction to keep children's interest and to extend the card's life span. The audience for cards is notoriously fickle, so companies try to manage their hits judiciously. 
In the United States, Yu-Gi-Oh appears to be causing less school disruptions than Pokemon cards, which were banned by some schools. Parents and school administrators may look more favorably upon Yu-Gi-Oh because it relies on intellect; if nothing else, the card game requires players to speak to one another, and not to just stare at a video screen.
"Cognitively, kids will use their left brains to figure out a strategy, more linear thinking," said Dr. Patricia Eggleston, a child psychologist in Chicago. "From the right side, they'll pull the social skills and how to interact with others."
Still, Dr. Eggleston said the game was ultimately like others: a competition with a goal of winning. That, however, is not a bad thing, she added. "Part of the reality of growing up," she said, "is having a kid dupe you out of a valuable card."

HEADLINE: Even if Heads Roll, Mistrust Will Live On 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
SINCE midsummer, they have come every few weeks, with the predictability of a returning phase of the moon: A corporate "perp walk," in which the government's latest white-collar defendant is handcuffed and escorted to the courthouse, with photographers snapping shots as once highflying executives face the ultimate humiliation.
 On Wednesday, it was Andrew S. Fastow's turn -- the former chief financial officer who is the first senior Enron executive to face criminal fraud charges in the wake of that company's implosion. 
 The repeated performances clearly serve a useful purpose for a public demanding justice in the wake of a seemingly endless stream of corporate scandals. The scene sends the searing message that law enforcement is taking action to rid the corporate world of miscreants, and that other executives who might consider crossing the line in their business practices should think twice. 
But in the end, experts in law, ethics and psychology say, the public's thirst for justice will simply not be sated at the courthouse. The arrest and punishment of a handful -- or even a score or two -- of executives will do nothing to counter what these experts see as the true challenge facing corporate America: to persuade a doubtful public that there is integrity in executive suites. 
Many issues have been blended together in the public mind-set, these experts said, from cooking the books and stealing corporate cash to receiving excessive pay and perks. That, of course, mixes crime with common practices in corporate America. But with public revulsion placing them all under the same microscope, these experts said, a sense of justice will not be achieved until they are all addressed. 
"A simple application of the law is not going to produce what people will perceive to be justice, because many of the things that have been happening are not necessarily illegal, even if the public considered them immoral," said Tom R. Tyler, a professor of psychology at New York University who specializes in the study of popular conceptions of justice. "So if the only response is a legal response, I think the public will end up being quite soured about corporations and the business world."
Indeed, a response that emerges solely from the law enforcement and regulatory spheres may ultimately prove contrary to the ends of justice. All too often, experts said, the mid-level executives caught up in such events are products of the corporate environment in which they work. Punishing the product without changing the environment will not correct the ethical problems that have become evident over the last year.
"A good many people who were caught up in the machinery of doing this are more like us than we would like, and simply sending them to jail is not going to be helpful and may not exactly be just," said John M. Darley, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton who studies the moral behavior in groups. "What we ought to want to do is send the top people who are the originators of this behavior to jail. The lower people, if they made lots of profits, need to give those profits back. And then we need to create barriers so that in the future, fairly decent people cannot be put under these hidden pressures again."
In truth, executives have reached a turning point in terms of their relationship with the public and their place in American society. For decades they have been revered, granted near-superstar status as they dangled the prospect of an ever-improving economy and growing stock portfolios. Now they are the stuff of ridicule, literally portrayed in the Sunday comics as the monsters of children's nightmares.
"We have made chief executive officers some of the wealthiest Americans in the last 20-plus years, and that is a huge change in American capitalism," said Arthur P. Brief, a professor of business ethics at the A. B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane University. "We have infused so much money and power in the executives that they have started to behave as if they are above the rules that govern the rest of us."
In essence, these experts argue, chief executives were granted wide swaths of trust to do the right thing, but too often seemed to forget their obligation to shareholders. Now the public is reacting with a sense of betrayal, something that must be addressed by every corporation -- not just those swept up in scandal.
"The public is concerned not just about the executive who commits a criminal violation," said Leon E. Panetta, White House chief of staff in the Clinton administration and now chairman of the public policy and review committees at the New York Stock Exchange. "They are concerned about whether or not there is any sense of integrity or morality in the way they do business. And that means it extends beyond whether they are doing the minimum in meeting the law. It extends to whether they are behaving as a corporation with the highest standards."
Already, private initiatives have begun signaling that parts of the private sector recognize the importance of satisfying the public demand for justice. For example, in June, a Big Board committee proposed rigorous new standards that would tighten corporate governance and disclosure requirements for member companies. Rules stemming from that proposal have been approved by the exchange's board and submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Under those requirements, the role and authority of independent directors will be increased, new qualifications will be required for directors who run audit committees and new control and enforcement mechanisms will be adopted.
Ultimately, experts said, such private initiatives -- if stringent enough and if enforced -- will go much further than any prosecution in instilling a sense that the public's demand for integrity in the corporate suite is being met. "The private efforts are going to have more impact in the long run," Professor Brief said. "Corporate governance has been corrupted in America, and the only way to change that is to reduce the power in the C.E.O.'s hands."
CAPITALISM often seesaws between abuses that harm business and waves of self-correction. Now that self-correction is beginning to flow from powerful financial institutions that have been badly singed by the torrent of scandals -- from WorldCom to Tyco, from Enron to Adelphia.
In recent months, the Vanguard Group, the giant mutual fund company, sent letters to 450 public corporations, laying out a treatise for what it expected from the companies whose shares it owns, including assurances that executives are long-term holders of the company's stock. Vanguard received responses from a number of companies; others ignored the letter.
"It is absolutely clear that the mantra of growth at all costs, and the lionized C.E.O. who could spin a great story, is gone, and gone for at least a short generation," John J. Brennan, chairman of Vanguard, said in an interview. "And that is really good for the markets."
Now, Mr. Brennan said, companies that pay attention to hitting profit targets at the expense of clear ethical conduct will pay a price -- not only in public prestige, but also in valuations of their securities and ability to do business. 
"Three years ago, executives got rewarded for traveling at the margins," he said. "Now they'll get penalized, and that's great news. I'm an investor, and I want to invest in integrity-laden management teams. I don't ever want to be subjected to a WorldCom or a Tyco or an Enron in the rest of my career."
But what changes will be viewed as justice? And are executives truly prepared to take those steps?
The fundamental reform, according to experts who have studied American concepts of justice, would come from projecting a stronger message that management is there for the benefit of shareholders -- not that shareholders' money is there for the benefit of management. 
"A lot of these people seem to feel they had worked their way up the corporate ladder, and now that they got there they deserved whatever they could get," said W. Michael Hoffman, executive director of the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. "This is simply a terrible attitude for corporate executives to have. Instead of having a sense of entitlement, they ought to have more of a sense of serving their constituency."
Indeed, these experts said, one level of justice would be for corporate America to address the long-ballooning pace of compensation, where each executive points to another to justify mammoth pay packages. Now, with so many companies struggling, the public will be hard pressed to accept the explanations for excessive pay. 
"If the C.E.O.'s had any claim to the astronomical sums they were making, it would only be sustained if they carried the company, the workers and the stockholders along with them," Professor Darley of Princeton said. "But as soon as it became clear that they were self-benefiting in ways that were absolutely wrong, and actually harmed their employees, then their legitimacy and the claim to that compensation was stripped away."
Moreover, the daily drippings of news about chief executives who received favored opportunities from investment banks, who lived in expensive, company-owned apartments and who received vast sums even in retirement have turned up the public anger. Through those tales, executives seem separated from the realities and difficulties of living in a world where housing costs money, investments are not guaranteed to be successful and a paycheck usually requires some work.
The wealth gulf created between the executives and the public is not a matter of jealousy, or simply an outgrowth of anger about the collapsing stock market, these experts said. Rather, it reaches down to the fundamental issues of fairness that underlie American concepts of justice. 
That is why even efforts by executives to compensate the victims of corporate disasters -- like the recent offer by Gary Winnick, the chairman of Global Crossing, to pay $25 million to cover part of the retirement money lost by several thousand employees when the company collapsed -- could well backfire. Rather than being grateful, these experts said, the public is more likely to react with anger that executives have so much to give away -- even now.
"There is kind of a tin ear out there among some chief executives who think that if there is a problem, then they should write a check," Mr. Panetta said. "But it goes deeper than that. Executives have to understand that, because if they don't, ultimately investors and shareholders are going to challenge them."
The answer, these experts said, is for corporate America to demonstrate aggressively that it recognizes the rationale for the public's anger. Only that, coupled with the punishment of those who violated the law, will fully assuage the demands for justice. For now, they added, too few executives are taking that initiative.
"For people to step forward and acknowledge responsibility for what has gone wrong, to agree that there is a need for change, to step forward to help to lead an effort -- those are all the kinds of things we would tell C.E.O.'s that they should do in the face of public anger," Professor Tyler of N.Y.U. said. "So it is puzzling that we haven't seen more of that happening."
But ultimately, market participants said, the changes will come, and the business world will be the better for it. "We're going to look back in three or four years and see the last 12 months as a difficult but singularly beneficial period of time," Mr. Brennan said. "And in the end, people will once again value corporations for the good they do."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: The Monster of Id; 
I Am Japan, Hear Me Roar

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
FORGET economic statistics, academic journals and earnest college professors. Those wondering what obsesses and unnerves the Japanese have long known to look no further than the latest Godzilla film for answers. 
 The city-crunching monster has been a lightning rod for social commentary ever since 1954, when the first Godzilla reflected the country's fears of the nuclear age. 
 Nearly 50 years later, the 26th film in the series is set for release in December, and although the producers are not talking, it is already clear that the rise of robotics will be among the issues Godzilla will face. 
He has had lots of experience channeling Japanese obsessions. Past films have ignited debates about the excesses of economic growth, relations with America and the purpose of the military in Japan's pacifist constitution. Sometimes, Godzilla has been the antagonist, attacked mercilessly (and often unsuccessfully) by the desperate humans below. At other times, the creature -- whose name is a combination of the Japanese words for gorilla and whale -- protected humanity from greater threats. 
The new film brings back Mechagodzilla, a mechanical version of the flesh-and-blood monster that has made three previous appearances, each time alluding to Japan's ambivalent relationship with technology. Once, Mechagodzilla was portrayed as the wayward invention of aliens -- an evil machine gone amok. Ten years ago, a United Nations task force created Mecha to defeat Godzilla, a story line that coincided with Japan's first postwar peacekeeping mission under U.N. auspices.
In the decade since the last Mechagodzilla, Japanese companies like Sony and Honda have released ever-more sophisticated robots, with more fluid motion, realistic voices and sensory detectors. No longer consigned to the factory floor, robots have begun to penetrate the lives of ordinary Japanese, whether as playthings or task-oriented assistants. 
In response, the director of the newest movie has ditched Mechagodzilla's lumbering stride and rigid body movements, creating something that is less a machine than a sinister and nimble artificial intelligence. "It is now realistic to believe that humans could build a robot to fight Godzilla," said Shogo Tomiyama, the producer. Whether or not that would be a good thing is a question the movie will address. 
The Japanese are fascinated with robotics and are far more comfortable incorporating machinery into their daily lives than Westerners are. Driverless trains, for example, whisk around Tokyo while robot policemen direct traffic. While Americans may consider real dogs to be man's best friend, Japanese are shelling out about $1,500 for Sony's new Aibo, a robotic puppy that barks, wags its tail and comes running when beckoned.
Robotic culture isn't the only new theme in the Godzilla trope. The movie also re-examines the role of women, with a female military officer spearheading humanity's response to the warring giants. "I wanted to say that your mother is also doing her best to protect you, just like your father," said Masaaki Tezuka, who is directing his second Godzilla film.
OF course, for all the crusading and commentary, the Godzilla franchise is less concerned with progressive politics than with filling theater seats. Capturing the spirit of any culture is simply good business, said Peter Musolf, the author of "The Godzilla Question" (Kodansha, 1998).
"The one thing that has charmed me about Godzilla is his flexibility as a metaphor," said Mr. Musolf, who lives in Japan. 
"Whether the film's producers intended Godzilla to be good or bad, we ended up with a really good gauge of what the man on the street was thinking," he said.

Public Schools Look Beyond the Bake Sale

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
INSCRIBED in nearly every state constitution is the promise of an education. Schooling must be "thorough and efficient" in Ohio, cultivate "morality and intelligence" in South Dakota, while bestowing "wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue" in Massachusetts. Then there is New York, typically blunt in its guarantee of "free common schools," though nobody seems to agree on exactly what that means. 
 But as state education financing is frozen and in many cases wanes, school systems across the country say they have been forced to turn to private donors willing to foot some of the bill. That situation was dramatically underlined last week when Joel I. Klein, New York City's new schools chancellor, appointed Caroline Kennedy as chief fund-raiser for the city schools. 
 While her appointment surely raises the profile of an often thankless yet indispensable job, it also begs the question of where public responsibility for education ends and the burden of the private sector begins. Many cities have found that the balancing act is far from an easy one. "We're walking down a path that could be very dangerous for us," said Paul D. Houston, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. "When do you get to the point where we can no longer call them public schools?"
Although lawmakers are under pressure to support education, school budgets were cut in 16 states this year, and 13 states have already cut their budgets for next year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
At the same time, private donations to educational institutions of all kinds sank last year for the first time since 1988, from $32.57 billion in 2000 to $31.84 billion in 2001 after adjusting for inflation, according to American Association of Fundraising Counsel. At 2.2 percent, the dip in private giving was the deepest in more than 20 years, pressuring school boards and universities alike to become more aggressive in the interminable search for funds. 
Nobody knows exactly how much private money flows solely into public schools. Still, "it's definitely more competitive out there," said Alyson T. Cooke, Ms. Kennedy's counterpart at the Chicago public schools. "Yet the needs continue to increase every year."
New York schools already pick up their share from private foundations, but in the realm of corporate giving there is almost certainly room to grow, officials said. Businesses and individuals gave about $9 million directly to the city's Department of Education last year, a sliver of its $12 billion budget.
Chicago has fewer than half as many students, yet its year-old fund-raising office captured upward of $10 million from businesses and individuals in direct donations to the school board. Los Angeles's board, which serves two-thirds as many students as New York's, received $18 million from corporations and donors, having been at the top of the fund-raising game for more than two decades.
As the New York department focuses on attracting more outside money, it may run headlong into competition from the bevy of individual public schools and independent nonprofits that already claim the vast majority of corporate donations. Businesses give more than $90 million to individual schools and nonprofit education groups in New York, few of which are likely to surrender those gifts willingly.
"This is a sticky wicket," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, a business group that helps raise money for the schools. "I do think the total pot will grow, but there will certainly be push back from the institutions that are currently getting funded."
WITH private support of schools also comes considerable outside influence. In a very public show of philanthropic muscle in Pittsburgh last July, three foundations held a news conference to announce their withdrawal of support for that city's school system, accusing it of fiscal mismanagement. Within weeks of the repudiation, the mayor of Pittsburgh assembled a 38-member council to overhaul the schools, with foundation officials at the helm.
"Being a friendly thorn in the district's side is critical," said Carol Rava Treat, deputy director of education for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. "Without that friendly friction, there might not be as many checks and balances."
Nor are vigilant, political donors rare. For example, a national network of at least 300 education funds raises money for schools while explicitly pushing its own agenda. In Portland, an education fund staged marches to protest teacher layoffs and helped draft the schools' current five-year plan. The Philadelphia Education Fund even took on the mayor last year, leading a successful drive to repeal legislation requiring teachers to live in the city, a rule that it believed contributed to the teacher shortage.
"You don't give money unless you expect to see improvement," said Betsey Useem, the fund's research director.

The Trend in Tea: Shaken, Not Stirred

BYLINE:  By SETH W. FEASTER 

 BODY:
 In America, convenience is king, even when it comes to a tradition-bound drink like tea. Over the last five years, sales of ready-to-drink teas have risen 41 percent, helping overall tea sales grow by 13 percent. 
Rapidly growing brands like Snapple and Arizona, with their flavor-infused concoctions, have changed the market, said Kim Feil, an analyst at Information Resources Inc. A recent push by tea makers and trade associations, like the Tea Council, to trumpet tea's health benefits, has also spurred sales. 
 Though the overall market is growing, sales of loose tea, tea bags and even instant tea are falling. Part of the switch away from brewing at home has been the explosive growth of retail coffee shops. "People are getting their fix for hot tea at coffee houses," Ms. Feil said. SETH W. FEASTER

HEADLINE: The Union Label For Young Workers 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Stock Options? Try Union Dues" (Preludes, Sept. 15) took a positive view of the potential of labor unions to recruit among young professional, freelance and temporary workers. 
 There is a difference, however, between two types of organizations cited: traditional unions, which organize workers for representation through collective bargaining at their workplaces, and workers' advocacy groups, like Working Today, which seek to protect and provide benefits to workers regardless of where they work or even if they are unemployed. 
 The advocacy organizations have the greatest appeal to the new work force of people who change jobs often and have a strong sense of professionalism and individualism.
Until unions become both advocates and bargaining agents, something which they have been unable or unwilling to do so far, they cannot count on the emerging work force as a source of significant membership gains.

HEADLINE: Rejecting Boycott, Researchers Gather in Israel 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
Saying they are taking a stand against academic boycotts of Israeli institutions, a group of medical researchers in New York have organized a scientific conference this weekend in Eilat, Israel, drawing specialists from around the world to the resort by the Red Sea.
 The conference, "Frontiers in Cardiovascular Science," is featuring speakers from the United States, Canada and Europe. It is the first to attract international scientists to Israel since the start of the current intifada in September 2000, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. 
 The conference aims both to share research findings -- with papers on topics like "the effect of statins on cholesterol metabolism in the brain,' -- and to send a broader message of solidarity to Israeli scholars, who have found themselves isolated in recent months by a boycott protesting Israel's presence in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The boycott began with petitions drawn up by a British neurochemist, Steven Rose. 
In a statement, a group of cardiovascular researchers at Columbia University said they organized the conference with the Israeli Atherosclerosis Society as "a response to the unexpected resurgence of European anti-Semitism in the form of organized boycotts of Israel in general and of the Israeli academic community, in particular."
Neil Shachter, an associate professor at Columbia University's medical school who helped pull the conference together, said in a telephone interview from Eilat: "The academic boycott is being led by researchers in the life sciences. As life science people, we feel obligated to lead the charge in opposing this."
The boycott is driven by two petitions, one calling on the European Union to deny grants to Israeli researchers and institutions, and the other demanding an end to scientific cooperation with Israeli institutions. Each has drawn more than 1,000 signatures, and inspired an American-led antiboycott petition.
Donald Kennedy, editor in chief of the journal Science, said on Friday that he was heartened by word that such a meeting was being held in Israel.
"Good for them," he said. "The principle is very important. I don't think academic boycotts do anyone any good."
Last spring, he recalled, a group of researchers in Europe withheld information from an Israeli scientist inquiring about their published work. Dr. Kennedy's subsequent editorial in Science criticized the European researchers and vowed that the journal would publish no papers from any scientist unwilling to share research information or materials with any scientist, including Israelis.
Dr. Shachter said that about 120 researchers were attending the conference, which began on Thursday and runs through today, and that 28 of the 34 speakers were from outside Israel. They include Jewish, Muslim and Christian researchers, he said.
Dr. Arthur A. Spector, a noted biochemist at the University of Iowa, said he came to Eilat "first of all for the outstanding science, and secondly, for my colleagues here in Israel to know that we haven't forgotten them, we're supporting them." Dr. Spector presented a paper on Thursday on polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Supporters of the boycott of Israel, including M. Shahib Alam, an economics professor at Northeastern University, describe it as a nonviolent way to pressure the Israeli government to ease policies in the occupied territories. 
"To me the fundamental point about his boycott is that it would serve as a gesture, to say that academics find the cumulative impact of the occupation so repugnant that they are taking a stand," Dr. Alam said.
Richard C. Lewontin, an evolutionary biologist and geneticist at Harvard who signed the boycott petition, said he would not attend a conference like the one in Eilat.
"I'm opposed to any state-supported operation, as a protest against the policies of the Israeli government," Dr. Lewontin said.
Boycott supporters say it is modeled on the isolation of South Africa, which helped force that country to give up apartheid. 
Dr. Kennedy said he recalled that boycott, which he also rejected. "I was opposed to that then, although the moral high ground arguing for a boycott in that case was a lot stronger than it is in this one," he said.

HEADLINE: Deep-Sea Joint Venture: Britain and U.S. Company in a Treasure Hunt 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The American company that discovered the lost ship with what may be history's richest sunken treasure has signed an agreement with the British government, which owns it, to raise it from the bottom of the Mediterranean and split the proceeds.
 The agreement is a legal breakthrough that could open the way to the recovery of perhaps up to $4 billion in gold coins that went down with H.M.S. Sussex in a violent storm in 1694, and of dozens of sunken vessels in seas around the world. 
 The company, Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. of Tampa, Fla., found what British authorities believe to be the Sussex during four expeditions off Gibraltar from 1998 to 2001. The exploratory work was done with British approval, and the discovery tentatively announced last February. But until now there has been no legal precedent for a private company to join with a government to raise its treasure. 
As new technologies open up the deep sea, the maritime superpowers of present and past -- notably Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Russia and the United States -- have begun to assert ownership over thousands of ships that were lost in distant waters.
But little has come of the claims because the governments often lack the money and skills to pull sunken treasure and cultural riches from the depths, and they have struck no major deals to let commercial partners share the risks and rewards.
The new agreement, which is being announced by Britain on Monday, changes that. The Ministry of Defense, the sunken ship's official owner, calls it "an important step in development of a 'partnering' approach to deep-sea archaeology." 
Experts say it could end the days of freelance treasure hunting and start a time when nations oversee the recovery of their own lost fleets. They praised the agreement for requiring cultural artifacts to be handled according to contemporary archaeological standards.
The British say the Sussex, the flagship of a large flotilla, carried a fortune in treasure to buy the loyalty of a shaky ally in a war against France. In darkness half a mile down, the site where it is believed to lie consists of a large mound rich in cannons, anchors and other artifacts -- the only such objects found anywhere near the area where the Sussex was reported lost. 
"We're fairly convinced it's the Sussex," a senior British official said in an interview. "And we're very excited to be working with Odyssey. We really want to see this succeed."
American experts, echoing the British assessment, say the accord is unique. "It's the first time we're seeing a profit-making group doing this kind of recovery," said Anne G. Giesecke, an marine adviser to the Society for Historical Archaeology, a professional group. Robert C. Blumberg, a senior policy adviser at the State Department, called the agreement "a public-private partnership where both sides stand to gain." 
Months of detailed negotiations delayed the accord until Sept. 27, British and Odyssey officials said. The government said the agreement would "extend to recording and preservation of artifacts and their eventual conservation, publication, exhibition, marketing and all other facets relating to the management of our underwater cultural heritage."
Odyssey considers the agreement a coup and a model for a new era. "We see a whole industry emerging," said Greg Stemm, a founder of the company. "The private sector will routinely help governments in managing their marine heritage. It's already a huge industry on land."
The company, which is publicly traded, is risking its own money in the venture: $4 million so far and up to $4 million for excavation work with an eventual total of tens of millions of dollars, much of it for marketing the treasure, Mr. Stemm said. Both sides agree that the ship carried coins, most likely gold, that were worth $:1 million in 1694. In weight, that would be about nine tons. The $4 billion figure comes from the theoretical value of the coins if sold to collectors, which the company says it cannot predict.
The partnership is to split the profits or appraised values of the recovered coins on a sliding scale that favors Odyssey at first and then the government. Odyssey is to get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government gets the rest.
The agreement calls for archaeological integrity -- a difficult technical feat at such depths and a goal that critics of for-profit archaeology are likely to dispute. Many archaeologists abhor the sale of recovered artifacts, saying it inhibits scholarly analysis and public display.
The partnership agreement draws a distinction between classes of artifacts, saying cultural items have a greater archaeological value than coins, which it allows to be sold to help pay for the project.
Mr. Blumberg of the State Department praised the approach as allowing the saving of wrecks that otherwise would deteriorate over time and be lost to history. Academic archaeologists, he said, had little money for the investigation of deep-sea artifacts. "If you have a thousand gold coins and they're virtually identical in every respect that you can discern," he asked, "why shouldn't you keep a representative sample for a museum and let the rest be sold?"
In recent years maritime countries have occasionally recovered shipwrecks from their shallow coastal waters. Sweden lifted the Vasa, a 17th-century warship, and Britain the Mary Rose, a 16th-century warship. This summer, the United States lifted the gun turret of the Monitor, a 19th-century ironclad.
In the case of distant waters, the governments often turned a blind eye to shallow-water treasure hunters. Spain took no action in 1985 when Mel Fisher found the Atocha, a galleon lost off Florida in 1622, and recovered about $400 million in treasure.
The stakes and costs have soared in recent years as robots, sonars and other advanced gear have opened every corner of the deep to exploration and recovery, bringing thousands of lost ships into play.
So governments have begun to assert ownership over their vessels, especially warships.
In 2000, Spain won a legal battle over the issue when a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that it owned the remains of two warships lost off the Virginia coast two centuries ago. The ruling snatched the ships away from a treasure hunter, who estimated that the wrecks bore more than half a billion dollars in coins and precious metals.
In a new disclosure about the Sussex, the British statement said the "considerable economic loss to the nation led to the foundation of the Bank of England," which bailed out the government with a loan.
In keeping with British practice, the 30-page agreement is being kept secret. But the British have released a summary memorandum. It specifies such things as the licensing fees Odyssey must pay, the profit breakdown and how a project plan must be completed in 100 days.
"The government," it says, "may appoint two representatives to monitor and record the exploration to determine whether the activities are being carried out in compliance with the project plan."
The agreement also says the British government will receive "10 percent of any net income derived from intellectual property rights associated with the project," as well as 3 percent of Odyssey's "gross sales of merchandise that utilizes the name H.M.S. Sussex."
The partner approach, officials said, was adopted to avoid expensive court battles and to allow experts to devote more time to recovering lost history.
"To its credit," the statement said, "the company decided to work with British officials rather than resort to standard salvage practices."

HEADLINE: Shutdown of West Coast Ports Puts Asian Businesses on Edge 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY and WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
As the shutdown of West Coast shipping enters a second week, businesses from Japan to Pakistan are growing increasingly worried that a protracted dispute between American longshoremen and port operators could cripple Asia's economic recovery.
 Some manufacturers are already feeling the strain. Last week, Toyota closed a factory it operates with General Motors in California. "We're really short on parts that come from Japan, starting from the engine," said Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo. 
 Matsushita Electric Industrial, best known for its Panasonic brand, has 120 shipping containers of microwave ovens and televisions awaiting unloading at West Coast harbors. 
More cargo is lining up. Shipping officials estimate that more than 150 freighters are nearing their destinations or idling off the coast. Yesterday, for example, a 68,000-ton ship operated by the Orient Overseas Container Line was to arrive in Long Beach, Calif., from Hong Kong with as many as 5,000 containers.
The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, closed the ports and locked out 10,500 longshoremen last Sunday night after complaining that the workers were engaged in a slowdown. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union said its members were working more slowly as a safety precaution after five longshoremen died this year.
Talks with a federal mediator continued yesterday and the White House urged both sides to resolve the dispute to prevent further damage to the economy. Both sides agree that the major issues are management's effort to introduce new technology to speed cargo handling and the union's demand to retain high-paying clerical jobs under its jurisdiction. 
Apprehension is building about what could happen if the lockout is drawn out. But for now, many Asian exporters are trying to operate as close to normal as possible.
At Yue Yuen Industrial in Hong Kong, where shoes for Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Timberland take shape, the factory is buzzing with activity. Like many exporters, the company has signed contracts with American companies that ensure payment if goods are shipped on time.
"They must be watching very closely," Philip Wong, Yue Yuen's investor relations manager, said of the shoe companies. "We are just standing by."
Many ships bound for America are still leaving foreign ports on time. Shipping companies are betting that the contract negotiations will be settled before vessels that are making the 10- to 14-day voyage across the Pacific reach their destinations. But nearly all shipping companies are looking for alternative sites.
Some ships have already been diverted to Mexico. Others are seeking sanctuary in Vancouver, British Columbia, but port officials there said they would not be able to handle additional traffic. Companies are also exploring the option of shipping goods by plane.
Economists said the impact of the slowdown on Asian countries would be relatively mild if the dispute between dock workers and the port operators was settled quickly. But the longer it goes on, the worse it will get. And as more ships line up outside the harbors, analysts said, the backlog to unload their cargos could stretch into a month or more.
"If the shutdown lasts for more than one month, East Asia would be in a recession," Andy Xie, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a report. "The consequences for the global economy are horrendous."
Last year, more than $300 billion worth of goods entered the United States through the West Coast ports. Most of that cargo came from Asia and represented 10 percent of the gross domestic product of East Asia, economists said.
Experts are divided about the overall cost of the shutdown. Some economists have said that losses may have reached $1 billion a day during the first five days, and increased sharply after that. But others say those figures are exaggerated. In truth, no one knows for sure.
"The global impact depends on how long this goes on," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "If it's brief, the impact on both the U.S. economy and the global economy is likely to be small."
Many manufacturers accelerated shipments earlier in the year in anticipation of the expiration of the longshoremen's contract in July. But much of the merchandise could not be shipped early, because it was destined for just-in-time delivery to store shelves for the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. This delivery system, virtually nonexistent 10 years ago, allows companies to save money by cutting down on storage costs.
But this year, if merchandise made abroad is not unloaded in time, retailers could cancel orders, experts said. That would set off a downward spiral, causing manufacturers to lose money and lay off factory workers or force them to take time off without pay.
In Pakistan, whose economy is heavily dependent on textile and apparel exports, companies are worried about multilateral trade quotas for certain items. The quotas are being filled quickly by other countries through East Coast ports. Manufacturers there fear that once ports are reopened, it will be too late and their goods will have to sit in warehouses until next year.
The closing of West Coast ports also prevents American exporters from getting goods like fresh poultry and fruit to foreign countries. And in Hawaii and Alaska, consumers are beginning to worry that their lifeline to goods produced in the United States will be cut off soon. Neither state has reported shortages, but in Hawaii, customers began to stock up on goods from Wal-Mart and Costco a few weeks ago when labor negotiations with the dock workers grew more contentious.
The governors of Alaska and Hawaii had asked the union and port operators for a special exemption because so much of their goods arrive by container vessels. This weekend, both sides agreed to resume shipments to those states.
To prevent a meltdown of commerce, shipping companies are beginning to reroute ships to any port that will take their goods. Vancouver is among the most inviting because it has the facilities to handle large container vessels. But port officials said they were not "in a position to take ships that do not currently make Vancouver a port of call."
The Mexican authorities, however, are welcoming diverted vessels to their Pacific ports. In the last four days, Ensenada, Guaymas and Manzanillo have received thousands of tons of cargo from Hong Kong that had been scheduled to go to Portland, Ore., and Long Beach, officials said. But getting the goods by truck to consumers in the United States could take weeks or longer.
Some air carriers have been flooded with inquiries about delivering goods. All Nippon Airways, which flies from Japan to the West Coast, has noticed a small increase in orders over the last few days, but "space is already very tight," Yasuo Taki, a company spokesman, said. 
On Thursday, the United Parcel Service said it would add more 747 flights to the United States from Asia.
"Any time you get new business, people coming to you wanting space on your plane, of course, that's good," said Travis Spalding, a spokesman at U.P.S. "We will try to accommodate customers whenever we can. But our first responsibility is going to be to serve our existing customers."

HEADLINE: From Welfare to Work, and Then, to What?; 
Women Describe Their Lives Off Public Assistance, for Better and Worse

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Few disappearing acts have been as astonishing as the evaporation of hundreds of thousands of people from New York City's welfare rolls.
 In March 1996, 1.16 million people got cash income assistance in the city -- roughly one in every seven residents or one out of 12 cases nationwide. As of August, 420,000 people were still on the rolls. 
 The fate of the 740,000 people -- mostly women -- who left is a subject of fierce debate. Supporters of the Giuliani administration's welfare-to-work policy say that most have jobs or are being supported by someone else. Advocates for the poor argue that while many got jobs in the economic boom of the late 1990's, half were pushed off the rolls by stringent policies and are now just scraping by with low-wage jobs or none at all. 
Recent interviews with several dozen women who have left the rolls found that their material well-being is more clouded than either side of the debate usually allows. The good news is that most say they are better off without public assistance and are pleased with their decision to move toward independence even in these trying economic times -- perhaps not surprising, since the welfare bureaucracy is widely despised by its clients.
But while it was easy enough to find women whose post-welfare careers read like Horatio Alger tales, almost as many working women rely on a patchwork of support from relatives, lovers and supplemental government benefits.
There were also former recipients without jobs whose lives had taken decided turns for the worse. A study released in April by the nonpartisan Rockefeller Institute of Government found that 18 percent of former recipients in the city said they sometimes went hungry. Still, most had been spared from sleeping on the sidewalk or starvation by a safety net of food kitchens, housing shelters and subsidies and supplemental government benefits.
Together, the stories of these former and present welfare recipients show a system still very much in transition, still better at demanding work and supporting the unemployed than at providing backup for those who are working.
Jasmin Agosto, 33, says that she is much better off without welfare but adds that she would not be able to support her two children if she was not getting help from her fiance.
During the nine years she was on public assistance, Ms. Agosto always thought she could do better for herself, and there were times when she tried. From 1993 to 1994, she worked off the books as an assistant manager of a clothing store. But, she recalls, the hours were hard and the father of her two children, who she never married, charged her for baby-sitting.
Ms. Agosto says that when in 1999 the city demanded that she go to a resume program to learn how to write one to receive her check, she finally decided that she had had enough. A high school graduate with a quick, warm smile, Ms. Agosto got some help from MCIF WORKS, a local nonprofit education and training program, and was employed by ACE, a Head Start program in Bushwick, Brooklyn. 
Three years later, Ms. Agosto makes about $16,000 a year. Her family is insured through HIP. And she receives several thousand additional dollars through the state and federal Earned Income Tax Credit.
It is not enough, she says. With a salary near the federal poverty level, Ms. Agosto could get food stamps and child care subsidies, but she is precluded from those benefits because she holds money for her mother, who is undergoing an ugly divorce, under her name.
Ms. Agosto's circumstances are singular, but the underuse of programs meant to bridge the income gap for women who have left welfare is a persistent problem. A study released this week by the Community Service Society of New York, based on interviews of 106 parents who had left welfare, found that of 81 parents who were eligible for child care subsidies only 24 ended up with benefits. The 57 others either did not know of the benefits or had applied but been inappropriately turned down, the society said.
While child care spending is way up over the last five years and food stamp use started to rise this summer, the city acknowledges that transitional benefits are underused. City officials say they are committed to changing that but add that because women leaving welfare are not required to tell the city of their whereabouts, they often do not learn what they are due. Ms. Agosto is engaged to a man who works as a mechanic and helps her pay bills, even though he has children of his own. If the relationship does not work out, Ms. Agosto said, she will not ask the city for aid. "I'll get a second job before I go back," she says. "They treat you like absolute trash."

Training Brings Dividends
 The city's welfare-to-work policies seem to have achieved the most unambiguous results for women who were trained to rise beyond scrubbing floors or scraping griddles. Deshauna Vining, 26, who learned computer skills through a city contractor, shows how the transition from welfare can be dazzling.
One suspects that Ms. Vining, whose voice is as smooth as an express train, would have made it off welfare without the city's pushing her. "In my family, everyone works, and so I knew welfare would be a temporary thing," she says. 
But before welfare, Ms. Vining's career trajectory was hardly obvious. Although she is a high school graduate, in 1996 she was making the minimum wage as a cashier when she became pregnant with her first son. She quit, she says, because even with help from her child's father, her salary did not cover rent and child care.
After two years on the rolls, she entered a welfare-to-work training program with the Wildcat Services Corporation, a city contractor. Courses focused on computer languages like Excel, PowerPoint and WordPerfect and top graduates got three-month internships at top brokerage houses like Solomon Smith Barney, or, in Ms. Vining's case, Morgan Stanley.
Two and a half years ago, Ms. Vining started as a $30,000-a-year processing support worker, helping to manage account transfers. She has received raises since then, she says, but will not say how much. A year and a half ago, she married the father of her child, who, she says, works in the construction industry. She has had a second baby.
Together, of course, she and her husband make much too much to get public assistance. Ms. Vining says that since joining Morgan Stanley, she has received no food stamps, no Medicaid, no public housing. Nothing, period. In fact, she and her husband pay for a two-bedroom market-rate apartment in Brooklyn and, if it were not for a recent accident, they would also have a car. Told that she made it sound easy, Ms. Vining said confidently: "It is. If you want it, you can do it."

Trying to Bounce Back
Michelle Young has much in common with Ms. Vining. Poised and pleasant, she is also trained in PowerPoint, Excel and WordPerfect. She is bilingual. She, too, married the father of her first child and has since had a second child by him.
But Ms. Young is searching for work from a homeless shelter in the Bronx.
She first got public assistance in 1997, when, at 17, she became pregnant with her first child. She did not remain on the rolls long. She worked toward a high school equivalency degree at Drake Business School and when she graduated in 1999 quickly landed a job as office manager for Gourmet Guru at $11.50 an hour.
In 2000, she married the father of her son, who was earning $9 a hour as a contract worker with a telemarketer. But after six months on the job, just short of qualifying for health insurance and other benefits, Ms. Young became pregnant with a second child. The smells of her workplace made her feel sick, she says, and she quit. Two months later, her husband's freelance income ended.
The couple tried to get back on public assistance, but were rejected, she said, because they had made too much money in the first part of the year. In the meantime, they fell behind on their rent of $1,000 a month. In September, Ms. Young got a job as office manager for a technology company paying $13.50 an hour, but it was not enough to pay back rent and support a family. 
Ms. Young and her husband asked the government for help paying their rent and also for cash. Because of her income, she says, they got some of both but not enough of either. In December 2000, the technology company folded and Ms. Young and her family moved in with her husband's parents. Nine months later, when the couple decided that living in a two-bedroom apartment with five adults and three children was "too hectic," they entered the city's emergency shelter system. They are also getting cash assistance again.
Through a city subcontractor, the Women's Housing and Educational Development Company, Ms. Young now has a personal job counselor who, she says, "is just great." The counselor even helped her husband land a job for $9 a hour last week. "We are going to be out of this soon," Ms. Young predicted.

Difficult Transition
Teresita Gaton is not as optimistic about the future as Ms. Young. She inhabits perhaps the most vulnerable and fastest-growing niche in the system, the netherworld between a failed job and readmittance to the government rolls.
Seven years ago, Ms. Gaton's husband left her and their three small children. He has never paid child support, she says. With little work experience, Ms. Gaton went on public assistance. She has since had a fourth child with another man, but he, too, is of little financial help.
At the end of the summer of 2001, the city moved Ms. Gaton from welfare into a temporary jobs program in a park specifically for women who had passed the five-year federal time limit on getting welfare. The job paid Ms. Gaton $650 every two weeks and included health insurance at a nominal cost.
The city's said its goal was to hire former recipients permanently though this program, but few got jobs. Ms. Gaton was laid off on July 31.
She is now getting unemployment payments of $180 every two weeks. Ms. Gaton has a subsidized three-bedroom apartment, but she still pays $450 a month in rent. She says she is scraping bottom. "Sometimes I go to the church to get food," she says. She will begin getting food stamps and Medicaid next month. Although she has been looking for work and was even offered, but rejected, a few factory jobs for $6 an hour, Ms. Gaton seemed to feel that it was inevitable that she would be back on the public rolls soon.
"I want something to better myself," she sighed, "but I think I have to go back."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about New York City women who left welfare for work misstated a phrase in the name of an organization that provided job counseling for one of the women. It is the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, not Educational Development. The article also misstated the organization's relationship with city government on that program. It is the main contractor, not a subcontractor.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL: INSIDE THE N.F.L; 
N.F.L. Pressured On Black Coaches

BYLINE:  By THOMAS GEORGE 

 BODY:
The National Football League is pondering meeting with two lawyers who seek increases in head coaching opportunities for African-Americans.
 The N.F.L. received a letter from the lawyers late Thursday night. 
 "The letter was addressed to the commissioner, but he was out of town," a league official requesting anonymity said. "It is being reviewed; we will respond sometime next week, and it is possible that if the commissioner does not meet with them he will appoint someone in the league office to do so." 
It could be the first step to avoid litigation on a sensitive and explosive issue for African-American coaches, the league's management and its owners and players.
The lawyers, Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri, released a report last week called "Black Coaches in the N.F.L.: Superior Performance, Inferior Opportunities." The report was developed by the labor economist Janice Madden from the University of Pennsylvania and is supported by Richard Lapchick, the race and sports authority, and Floyd Keith, executive director of the Black Coaches Association.
Among numerous findings, the report said that African-Americans in the N.F.L. were the last hired as head coaches and the first fired and that too few of them were involved in the interview process.
Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.'s vice president for public relations, said the league had developed creative ways to address these issues, realized their importance and welcomed constructive dialogue.
Cochran said these numbers showed the need for substantive change before the N.F.L.'s next head-coaching hiring cycle, which usually begins in January. 
*Since 1920, the league has hired more than 400 head coaches and 6 of them (1.5 percent) have been African-American.
* Of the last 22 head coaching hires, 2 have been African-American.
*And though African-American players compose nearly 70 percent of the league, the coordinators jobs are 72 percent white and 28 percent African-American and the head coaching jobs are 94 percent white compared with 6 percent African-American.
*The league currently has 32 teams and two black head coaches.
Cochran and Mehri said they were not interested in quotas but specifically in the league's interviewing more African-Americans for these vacancies. They want Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to use draft picks as a reward or penalty not only to provide incentive for owners to interview and hire more African-American head coaches, but also to diversify club front offices with more members of minority groups, including women and Hispanics.
Aiello said that in the last five years, N.F.L. teams had interviewed 15 African-Americans for head coaching jobs a total of 23 times and 3 became head coaches.
"They need a game plan for change because what they are doing is not working," Cochran said. "In the last three years it has gone backward, not forward. Some of these owners have exhibited a mentality that they are not going to change unless you have a carrot-stick concept. Tie this issue into draft picks and you will see results."
Aiello said the league believed that because more African-American assistant coaches are in the league than ever, from that pool African-American head coaches will emerge. In 1980, he said, the league had 14 black coaches; in 1997 it had 103 with 5 of them coordinators and 3 of them head coaches; it now has 154 and 12 are coordinators.
He said that from the league's minority coaching internship program conducted during training camp, 50 participants now have jobs as N.F.L. coaches and one, Herman Edwards, is a head coach, with the Jets.
Mehri said that the way the N.F.L. states its position on the issue sounds similar to that of Texaco and Coca-Cola, corporations against whom Mehri won major race discrimination suits totaling nearly $368 million.
"The N.F.L. has been struggling with this issue regarding African-American coaches over the years," Mehri said. "I've been fighting for African-Americans in the corporate ranks where they have to fight hard to go half as far as their white counterparts. When you see a Denny Green fired after the record he has built and then not get a new job, or Marvin Lewis coach the best defense ever, win a Super Bowl and two years later not have a head job, you know that something is wrong.
"The N.F.L. is part of the epicenter of this country. When kids today see so few African-American head coaches, what does that tell them? The fans are being cheated -- a lot of African-American coaches are better qualified than some of the people currently holding the job and our data shows that. In a league where 70 percent of the players are African-American, someday those players are going to retire. What does that mean to them when an option important to many of them is shut down? You've got one African-American general manager in this league: Ozzie Newsome in Baltimore. Let's empower the commissioner and create change."
Or let the courts decide, Mehri said.
First, Mehri and Cochran would like to help the league develop a plan that works. Otherwise, apparently, a suit will be filed in federal court in New York.
"The N.F.L. is not above the law," Mehri said. "But there is some arrogance there."
Art Modell, the Baltimore Ravens' owner, said that if he listened to Cochran, "he'd have O. J. Simpson coaching my team."
Modell added: "We have a system in this league and color is not a factor. This is such a competitive business, and we want to get the one guy coaching our teams who can turn the juice on, regardless of his color. And I have a question: since Allie Sherman coached the Giants in the 60's, why haven't there been any Jewish head coaches in the league? What's the difference?
"This is like the middle linebackers, the centers, the coordinators and the quarterbacks in our league. There are more African-Americans in those positions now and the wall has been brought down. There aren't many African-American coaches in the colleges right now, but we've had some growth in the numbers of our assistant coaches and coordinators. It's coming. If it goes to court, they'll lose."
Cochran responded: "Why should these coaches have to wait? Why is it that a guy like Sherman Lewis, experienced and successful, sees one of the guys that used to report to him on the Minnesota staff, Mike Tice, get a head coaching job in Minnesota before he does? There is a major glass ceiling and we want to negotiate a plan that creates constructive change before we litigate. But we are prepared to litigate, and we have the stamina, resources and commitment to see this through."

HEADLINE: The Public School Bulge Is Reaching State Colleges 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Debra Nussbaum's article on the school enrollment surge in New Jersey ("A Number Story," cover, Sept. 29), including how it was underestimated by education planners, has a dramatic sequel in higher education. 
 New Jersey is now experiencing the nation's fifth-fastest increase in high school graduates. About 80 percent of these graduates are looking for a place to go to college. More than ever before, they are applying to New Jersey's state colleges and universities: The College of New Jersey, Kean University, New Jersey City University, Montclair State University, Ramapo College, Richard Stockton College, Rowan University, Thomas Edison State College and William Paterson University. For the fall 2002 entering class, the nine schools received applications from about 21,000 students for only about 9,000 freshman slots. 
If anything, the baby boom echo, the unanticipated immigration to the Garden State and the faltering economy are whipping up high demand earlier than we expected. Fastest-growing demand is among prospective full-time students who want to live on campus, something that requires long-range planning and financial resources at the state and campus levels.
The New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities has spent three years alerting the public and state policy makers about the looming capacity problem. We were joined by state business, health care and education associations one year ago when they supported a call for increasing state college capacity by at least 15,000 students. 
New Jersey's institutions of higher education and the state commission on higher education are working hard on this problem. But unless the state focuses immediately, we worry that by 2008, when high school enrollments are expected to peak, far too many parents will be asking whether their child will be able to attend a state college or university. The state of New Jersey will need a good answer.

Chips With Muscle Set Off a Market Tug of War

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
IN the early 1990's, Sabrina Kemeny was among the researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California who made spacecraft smaller and cheaper. The key was discovering how to build an optical sensor on a single semiconductor, allowing for smaller components that consumed less power.
 "That was the breakthrough," Ms. Kemeny recalled. "It was a dislocating kind of technology." 
 Ms. Kemeny and a handful of colleagues were so excited about the photographic applications of this semiconductor that in 1995, over a kitchen table, they created a company to design it for other companies. But their start-up, called Photobit, lacked the size and capital to go ahead and make this "camera on a chip," a type known in the semiconductor industry as a CMOS (pronounced SEE-moss), which stands for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. 
The destiny of Photobit changed nine months ago, when Micron Technology, the large semiconductor maker based in Boise, Idaho, bought the company and renamed it Micron Imaging. Ms. Kemeny is director for technical marketing there. 
That decade-long journey from the laboratory is part of a new race in the chip industry, where growth in demand has been disappointingly slow for nearly everything. A notable exception is the photographic applications of CMOS. These chips are responsible for products that are just beginning to reach consumers -- including cameras within cellphones, cameras in tiny capsules that can pass through the body to diagnose disease and tiny cameras mounted on personal computers. The chips have many other uses in security systems and industry.
Unlike the technology bubble of the late 1990's, a time when fanciful dot-coms without real products raced to overpriced initial public offerings, the race to dominate the market for cameras on chips is an old-fashioned kind of technology battle: Real companies are vying to invent real products that touch millions of consumers.
The older technology that CMOS is beginning to displace is called the charge-coupled device, or C.C.D., invented at Bell Labs in the late 1960's and first used in products like fax machines. 
The C.C.D. uses passive sensors, or tiny eyes, that detect light. An outside source of power is required to get the image from the devices, and other circuitry is needed, too. That makes them relatively big and expensive. CMOS chips, by contrast, consist of active sensors that have tiny transistors as power sources. Because of the way CMOS chips are made, sensors and many other processing functions can be placed on one chip.
CMOS technology greatly reduces the amount of power used, allowing batteries to last longer in hand-held devices, but it also provides photographic image quality almost as good as that of charge-coupled devices.
IN-STAT/MDR, a Scottsdale, Ariz., unit of the Reed Elsevier Group, a publishing and industry research company, says the number of CMOS chips made each year will triple from current levels by 2006. But In-Stat/MDR said sales, which totaled $1.2 billion last year, were expected to rise only to $1.6 billion in 2006 because the price of each chip would decline as production accelerated. 
Micron and others define the market more broadly, putting its potential at $4 billion in annual sales. Whichever figures are correct, it's clear that solid growth is occurring in one area of the otherwise depressed semiconductor industry.
Micron, a relatively late entry to the field, has tried to leapfrog toward the front with the technology expertise gained from buying Photobit. Three other major American companies are also in the battle. Agilent Technologies, a Palo Alto, Calif., spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, learned from the published research on CMOS done at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 90's. Its biggest customer is Logitech International, of Fremont, Calif., which makes PC cameras for Dell Computer and others.
The two other companies, Eastman Kodak and Motorola, started a technology alliance in 1997 that makes and sells CMOS chips. The Kodak-Motorola unit sells chips primarily for industrial uses like machine vision, but also for some Kodak digital still cameras.
Two Japanese competitors, Toshiba and Sharp, which have developed their own CMOS manufacturing processes, are generally believed to have a significant advantage. If there is a top potential application for the chips, it could be teenagers' swapping of pictures on their cellphones -- already a pastime in Japan. Because Japan has more advanced network systems for its cellphones, service providers like J-Phone can offer camera-equipped cellphones from different Japanese manufacturers.
On long subway and train rides, teenagers while away the time by snapping pictures of their companions and transmitting them to other friends on their phones. "The target market is a 15-year-old Japanese girl with pink hair and a cellphone," said Shawn Maloney, director of marketing for Micron Imaging. "The whole world is watching Japan."
The fact that Japan's chip makers sell to handset manufacturers who, in turn, sell to service providers could give them an important edge, particularly if the market takes off as expected. "Right now, the leaders for CMOS telephones are in Japan," said Brian O'Rourke, a senior analyst at In-Stat/MDR. "Toshiba is probably the leader."
South Korea is also ahead of the United States in cellphone sophistication, and a Korean company, Samsung Electronics, is a major CMOS competitor. In late September, Samsung formed a CMOS manufacturing alliance with Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.
In the United States, a moment of truth may be at hand for CMOS. Several wireless service providers like Sprint PCS and Cingular Wireless offer small cameras that can be attached to cellphones to take pictures and transmit them. But Sprint PCS is expected to start marketing a Samsung mobile device with an embedded camera in time for the Christmas season.
Nokia of Finland is pushing its camera-equipped cellphone, and an alliance of Sony of Japan and Ericsson of Sweden known as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications says its camera phone will hit the United States market in the fourth quarter.
UNDERLYING cellphone networks are still slower in the United States than elsewhere, but consumers can still capture single still images in color and transmit them. All these new devices use CMOS. 
"We have a lot of hopes for this product," said Jason Hartlove, vice president and general manager of Agilent's sensor solutions division. Manufacturers are shipping nearly 400 million cellphones worldwide each year, and Mr. Hartlove expressed hope that a growing number would include CMOS-based cameras at an additional cost of about $5 each.
Aside from finding uses for CMOS, the manufacturers are also trying to make the chips more efficiently. That is where Micron hopes to excel. It is the only American maker of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, a basic in consumer electronics. Micron survived a battle with the Japanese in the 1980's, only to watch as Samsung Electronics became No. 1 in the world in DRAM chips.
Micron had sales of $2.6 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 29, down from $3.9 billion the previous year. It had a net loss of more than $900 million for the year just ended, largely because of falling prices, but the company has $1 billion in cash and is expected to emerge from the current downturn in relatively strong shape because it has kept a strict grip on costs.
DRAM chips are often dismissed as a commodity, but they are a building block of countless electronics devices, including personal computers, personal organizers, set-top boxes, cellphones and game consoles. They are made in a process similar to that used for CMOS. "Our goal is to leverage our advanced CMOS technology and existing infrastructure to establishing a leading position in the expanding imaging markets," said Steven R. Appleton, the chief executive of Micron.
The company is also betting that marrying its mass manufacturing capability with the best CMOS designs from the technology's inventors will raise the quality of images captured on the chips. 
Skeptics said "we could never get to the next level of resolution," said Mr. Maloney of Micron. "But we're working our way up the resolution ladder."
Things could still go wrong. Manufacturers could charge too much for their camera phones -- Nokia's camera phone, the 7650, is selling for a steep $500 after rebates in Europe. It is also not clear yet whether consumers in the United States will want to snap pictures and send them directly to other mobile devices or to store them first on the Internet. 
But after a brutal couple of years in the chip industry, CMOS makers are allowing themselves a measure of hope. Even Kodak, the largest maker of charge-coupled devices in the United States, acknowledges that CMOS chips are improving in quality. Christopher McNiffe, the sales and marketing manager for Kodak's image sensor solutions division, said that "over time, they will clearly become the dominant technology."

(Agence France-Presse) Chart: "A Smile in the Gloom"Demand has been weak for most computer chips, but sales of imaging chips known as CMOS are expected to soar as digital cameras and camera-equiped cellphones become more popular. CMOS are smaller and consume less power than older-technology imaging chips known as C.C.D.'s.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
U.S. Funds Wary Of Foreign Adventure

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors, and the fund managers who look after their money, have often ignored overseas markets. Such parochialism would have proved costly during the last year, as stocks in the United States performed far worse than those of many foreign markets, although the American market narrowed the gap slightly in the last quarter. 
 In the 12 months through Sept. 30, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.7 percent, compared with a 16.8 percent decline of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Rest of the World index. 
 The strategists who recommended greater geographic diversification last winter may feel vindicated, but there is little evidence that fund managers have shifted significant amounts overseas. 
"The average manager has reduced his U.S. position in favor of other markets, but it looks as though cash balances have inched upward as well," said Steve Claiborne, a spokesman for the Frank Russell Company, the investment management and advisory firm. "The latter seems to corroborate some comments from managers about taking their time to reinvest cash from sales."
Analysts from S.& P. and Morningstar Inc. said they detected no huge increase in the proportion of assets that managers of global equity funds were devoting to foreign markets in recent months. Global equity funds are those that have a mandate to invest in both American and foreign stocks.
Emily Hall, an analyst at Morningstar, said managers of global funds were wary of deviating too far from the weightings assigned to major markets within benchmarks. In the MSCI World index, for example, the United States weighting is 56 percent. She said that this was particularly true of large funds that specialize in global blue-chip companies. 
"A lot of managers are aware of the MSCI weightings, which dictate their own weightings," she said. 
Peter Toogood, chief investment officer at Forsyth Partners, a London fund consulting firm, agreed that American managers had been reluctant to buy foreign shares. "They are choosing to stay in the United States because of the quality of companies and management," Mr. Toogood said.
He contends that the weakening of the dollar is the main reason that international comparisons were unfavorable to American stocks, but he says fund managers are right to ignore foreign-exchange movements. "Most companies don't know how they will move, so how can fund managers know? They are purebred stock pickers."
Mr. Toogood and Ms. Hall said the biggest interest in foreign stocks has been among managers of value funds.
Several such funds are run by Franklin Templeton. "We are focused on finding mispriced, undervalued opportunities," said Jeff Everett, who oversees Templeton's global funds. "When I come to the table with the best ideas, the majority are outside the United States."
Many are in Asia, which accounts for 28 percent of the Templeton World fund and 16 percent of Templeton Growth. Those two funds, with close to $20 billion in assets between them, recorded modest losses in the 12 months through Sept. 30: Templeton World lost 6.9 percent and Templeton Growth lost 5.6 percent.
One of Templeton's biggest winners has been Samsung Electronics. Despite the slowdown in the semiconductor industry, Samsung, a Korean chip maker, made $1 billion last year and trades at just eight times earnings. Mr. Everett said that he bought the stock after it was beaten down in the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990's and that it had roughly doubled since then.
THE biggest position in Templeton's global portfolios is Cheung Kong Holdings, a Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Li Ka-shing, a multibillionaire whom Mr. Everett likened to Warren E. Buffett because he "builds value and knows when to get out" of a poor line of business.
Cheung Kong is a large property owner and has substantial interests in mobile telephone service. 
"Asia is going to be home to enormous amounts of opportunities," Mr. Everett said. Mr. Li, he added, "is going to get first dibs on all the good deals in the region, if not the world."
Mr. Everett calculated that Cheung Kong still carries a single-digit price-earnings ratio, even if the mobile phone assets are valued at zero.
David R. Mannheim, director of core portfolio management at Massachusetts Financial Services, is primarily interested in finding growth, not value, but the company's global portfolios also have high allocations overseas. The MFS Global Equity fund, which has lost 9.3 percent in the 12 months through Sept. 30, is 60 percent invested in foreign stocks.
"We're not trying to guess the direction of the economy, simply which companies are going to do better than others in their industries," Mr. Mannheim said. "When we put it all together, we happen to find more companies outside the U.S."
Many of them are European producers of consumer staples. His favorites include three British companies: Diageo, the alcoholic-beverage giant, and two makers of household products, Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser. He finds that they offer better growth prospects in relation to their share prices than American equivalents like Procter & Gamble and Gillette.
Both Mr. Everett and Mr. Mannheim named the Swiss bank UBS and the French drug maker Aventis among their favorite stocks.
Aventis appeals to Mr. Everett because it "has very strong earnings growth and is not dependent on tremendous new product introductions." Noting that management had been cutting costs, he said, "Earnings are going to come through very nicely for that stock, despite pedestrian top-line growth, but it has been thrown out with the rest of health care stocks."
Mr. Mannheim is shunning banks generally, but has made an exception for UBS. "At these prices, UBS is more interesting on valuation grounds," he said. "There is a lot of uncertainty, but long term, it probably has some decent assets."
Both managers rejected the notion that foreign stocks should be avoided because American companies are better run. Mr. Everett suggested that American management is not as good as many people believe.
"To mark down international stocks carte blanche because they're not U.S. companies was a complete mistake," he said. "Now they are taking some of the premium out that was in the market just because they were American companies."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
South Of Border, Prospects And Pitfalls

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT has been a difficult decade for Latin American markets, and this year, so far, has not been any better.
 Many investors have been nervously awaiting the results of today's presidential election in Brazil, where the popularity of the leading candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (often called Lula), has contributed to a fall in the stock and bond markets. 
 Paul H. Rogers, portfolio manager of the Scudder Latin America fund, took some time last week to talk about the region's prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Brazil clearly has a debt problem. Has that hurt the economy?

A. It's not doing all that poorly. The growth numbers are slow, at around 1 percent this year and 2 percent to 3 percent in 2003. Inflation is running at about 8 percent and may fall to 7.5 percent next year.
But the big positive is that the weaker currency has led to a trade surplus. Some of that is due to a slowdown in imports. But much is due to higher exports. 
Since much of Brazil's debt is held locally, and not by foreigners, the weaker currency has made the debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio look uglier and uglier.

Q. Are concerns by the markets about a possible victory by Mr. da Silva justified?

A. People are worried about the implications for foreign direct investment, but once the real settles down, foreign investment could pick up. And Lula's past is probably more nervous-making than his future is going to be. He hasn't attempted to get into power all these years and then screw it up.
Also, his party will not have anywhere near a power base in the House or the Senate. Coalitions will therefore have to be built. 
So there is a potential that not a lot will get done, because the president can't get stuff done by fiat any more.

Q. Have Brazil's problems hurt Mexico?

A. The Brazilian market is down nearly 60 percent in dollar terms. Mexico's market is off a bit more than 16 percent.
Mexico is running on its own steam. There, the issues are much more related to the United States and the slowdown in our economy. People have started to differentiate quite dramatically between Mexico and the rest of the region. It's the rest of Latin America that is trading on Brazilian concerns. 

Q. Should we expect much more privatization in the region?

A. Much that could be privatized has been privatized. The remaining big sector is Mexico's electric industry. Electricity reform is very important for Mexico because they are going to run out of power if their industrial base continues to grow as it has been growing. Pemex, Mexico's state oil company, would be a difficult political nut to crack. There is some concern that there may be re-nationalization. But I think we are far away from that.
The people definitely want change in Brazil, and they are struggling with subpar growth, due in large part to what is happening in the global economy. But people are generally aware that government was not the best manager of businesses. 

Q. Your fund is heavily invested in Brazil and Mexico, but what about Argentina?

A. There is no reason to be optimistic about Argentina. The political situation is a disaster, and that has led to an economic disaster.
Brazil has terrific natural resources, healthy capital markets and a functioning democracy. Argentina has almost none of those. They had a lot of opportunities, but they have squandered them.

Q. What is the case for investing in a Latin American regional fund?

A. The case is harder to make for a regional fund now. We have been beset with a series of crises since the mid-1990's. But the hope is that by focusing more directly on a region, you can get more specific leverage and a more immediate payback. . . .
One advantage of a Latin fund is that compared to emerging markets in Asia, managements from Latin companies are in front of you on a regular basis. I probably see managements of the major holdings in my portfolio four to six times a year. And all of the meetings are one-on-one.

Q. How many stocks do you have in the portfolio? What are your biggest holdings?

A. We have about 30 to 35 stocks in the portfolio. Our cash position is about 3 percent. Our fund is down about 27 percent so far this year, but we tend to lose sight of the fact that the Nasdaq composite is down 40 percent. Our three biggest holdings are Telmex, Wal-Mart de Mexico and Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company. Telmex and Petrobras both trade as A.D.R.'s in this country, which means there is much better transparency.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Falling Shares As a Symptom Of Something Bleaker

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
MAYBE the stock market really has been predicting the future of the economy.
 In just the last two weeks, growth has begun to look a good bit weaker than it did during the summer, when the economy seemed far healthier than Wall Street. One victim of the new weakness could be the soothing theory that the continuing fall of stocks is nothing more than a correction of the 1990's bubble, rather than a reflection -- or a cause -- of new economic problems. 
 Pick just about any measure of economic activity, and it looks uglier than it did before Labor Day. Ratings of the economy's condition have fallen to their lowest level since 1994, according to an ABC News/Money magazine survey and one by the Conference Board. These worries seem to have led to small cuts in consumer spending, with sales weakening even at Wal-Mart. 
Still struggling to revive profits, businesses have reacted to the drop in confidence and a potential war in Iraq by making a new round of cutbacks. Office vacancy rates have risen. Airline travel has stopped growing. Last month, the manufacturing sector shrank for the first time since January. Most worrisome, many companies have turned to layoffs again. Although the Labor Department reported last week that the unemployment rate eased slightly in September, a separate survey found that business payrolls fell for the first time in five months.
"All of these pieces are painting an increasingly dark picture," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a research company. "I just get the sense things are stalling, and I'm getting worried."
The economy might still avoid a double-dip recession. But the recent bad news has raised anew the prospect that this year's recovery could have been the kind of false start that has followed the bursting of other bubbles in the past.
In the two and a half years since the stock market peaked, companies have sharply cut their spending on new factories, equipment and technology. Many already own more than they can profitably use. Others looking to expand have been stymied by the difficulty of raising money. In this way, the stock market can create a self-reinforcing cycle of slow economic growth and falling stock prices.
But it also creates an odd incentive for consumers to continue spending, at least temporarily. In a bear market, people are less afraid that buying a new car or a second house will tie up their money and cause them to miss out on the kind of rich stock-market returns that can pay for college and retirement, noted John H. Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. So they spend even as their portfolios shrink.
The recent recession, which probably ended late last year or early this year, was the first in more than 50 years in which consumer spending did not fall in a single quarter, according to the Commerce Department.
The dynamic cannot last forever, however. Eventually, people realize they need to save more than they did when rising stocks were fattening their savings. If their frugality gives companies a new reason to avoid big investments, the economy will be left without a growth engine. 
In Japan -- the current benchmark for grim theories about the American economy -- this chain of events happened over about three years, Mr. Makin said. Although the Nikkei 225 index lost almost half of its value in 1990, Japan's economy grew 5.3 percent that year and 3.1 percent the next, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For the next three years growth did not exceed 1 percent.
THE United States has already avoided following that timetable, thanks to the economy's decent growth this year. Low interest rates, low inflation and a modest decline in the dollar, which will lift exports, all offer credible reasons to think the economy will improve over the next year. 
But those strengths are not, as they have sometimes seemed, reason to see the sharp fall in the stock market as a sideshow. With each piece of evidence that the economy was improving earlier this year, the fact that stocks were not rebounding -- as they had during every other economic recovery since the 1930's -- seemed less relevant.
The last few weeks have provided a reality check. Despite what the metaphor suggests, financial bubbles tend to lose their air gradually and unevenly. The effect on the broader economy is never quick and rarely small.

HEADLINE: What Bush Can Learn From Truman 

BYLINE:  By Thomas E. Mann; Thomas E. Mann is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Is George W. Bush another Harry S. Truman? He and we should surely hope so. While Truman waged bruising domestic political battles and suffered long bouts of public unpopularity, he is viewed now as having presided over the most creative and productive period in American diplomatic history. In these perilous and fateful times, President Bush would do well to absorb key elements of Truman's approach to national security policy.
 The two presidents have many things in common. Both assumed office without a clear mandate from the electorate -- Truman, the largely unknown and accidental president after Roosevelt's death in 1945; Bush, the loser of the popular vote in the closest and arguably most controversial presidential election in history. Both faced doubts about their gravitas and capacity to lead. Both were inclined toward plain speaking, relished making big decisions and taking responsibility for them, and embraced an almost reverential view of the presidency. Both had to deal with a strong opposition party in Congress. And shortly after taking office, both confronted extraordinary national security challenges. 
 We know how Truman responded to his challenges: the Truman Doctrine, the strategic use of foreign aid; the Berlin airlift; military rearmament and reorganization; the Marshall Plan and the occupation and restructuring of Japan to rebuild and democratize our vanquished enemy; a "limited" (and unpopular) war on the Korean peninsula to carry out a policy of containment of the communist threat; and the nurturing of multilateral institutions like the United Nations, NATO and the Bretton Woods international economic regime.
President Bush rallied the nation in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and led a successful military operation to depose the Taliban government in Afghanistan and disable the most important base of Al Qaeda's terrorist operations. He has made destroying terrorist networks and the weapons of mass destruction held by rogue states his highest national security priorities, and enunciated a doctrine of pre-emptive action to accomplish that end. He has proposed a major reorganization of homeland security agencies and is working aggressively to lead an uncertain nation to war against Saddam Hussein. His record at this early stage of his presidency suggests the potential of a national security leader as ambitious and consequential as Truman.
But if Mr. Bush is to reach a comparable level of achievement, he could profitably consider Truman's cast of mind in dealing with monumental national security challenges. 
For all of his combativeness on the domestic front, Truman showed the wisdom of patience in responding to the Soviet threat. And he displayed enormous prescience in understanding the value to American security of rebuilding defeated nations.
Truman was a Woodrow Wilson internationalist -- one who believed strongly in the efficacy of international law and organization. His instinct was to look for allies and international legitimacy in responding to security threats while mobilizing American resolve and resources. He built and strengthened multilateral institutions, forged broad alliances to confront the Soviet Union, and turned immediately to the United Nations when North Korea launched its attack in 1950.
Truman's policy of deterrence and containment was conservative at its core. It rejected the risks of a larger, potentially devastating war associated with "rolling back" Soviet gains in Eastern Europe. He was prepared to rein in an offensive-minded military to keep intact his strategic defensive policy by firing the very popular General Douglas MacArthur.
Facing strong Republican opposition in Congress, one that resisted much of his domestic agenda, Truman saw the wisdom of working hard to fashion bipartisanship on foreign policy. He championed a strong presidency but he respected the constitutional authority of Congress. His consultations with Congress on national security matters were early, continuous and substantive. In fact, he indicated to Congress that he would welcome Congressional authorization of military action in Korea but Congressional leaders demurred.
Of course, George Bush faces very different security threats and operates in a world vastly changed from what it was in Truman's time. It is often said that American military, economic and technological primacy now affords us the freedom to wage discretionary wars and to pursue national interests without the cooperation of major allies or the approval of international organizations.
Yet Truman had some of these same options. America emerged from World War II as the dominant economic and military power. It could have embraced a unilateralist and offensive posture in responding to postwar security challenges. But Truman resisted pressure from those advocating more aggressive actions against the Soviet Union and China. His restraint and his inclination to take the long view may fit the particular challenges now facing Mr. Bush. 
The Bush presidency is a work in progress. Yet we can already see several of its emerging characteristics: a form of internationalism that insists on the United States' right to act alone; a distrust of international organizations and agreements; an impatience with maintaining alliances and the burdens of nation-building; a willingness to depose regimes; and an expansive Hamiltonian conception of the presidency, one in which Congress plays a secondary role. Perhaps some of this flows from Sept. 11 and its aftermath. But the Bush approach to national security as we discern it now could profitably be leavened by the lessons learned and put into practice by Harry Truman.

HEADLINE: Brazil May Not Stay Upright on a Shaky Global Stage 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
No matter who wins the Brazilian presidential elections on Sunday, the biggest loser could end up being the American recipe for globalization.
Few countries have won more praise on economic policy than Brazil, from both the Bush administration and the International Monetary Fund. Yet few are being punished as harshly as Brazil by foreign investors, who have been running for the exits for months.
 With opinion polls pointing to a potentially big first-round victory on Sunday for Brazil's left-wing challenger, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's currency has slipped to record lows and its government bonds are selling for about 53 cents on the dollar. 
 Most of the fear is that Mr. da Silva will relax current policies to cut spending, fight inflation and keep paying on Brazil's $240 billion public debt.
But a growing number of experts worry that Brazil will unravel even if Mr. da Silva keeps his recent pledge to hold down spending. A small but increasingly vocal number of investors also worry that a part of Brazil's current turmoil stems from problems in the global financial system itself.
"The system has broken down," declared George Soros, the billionaire hedge-fund investor, in a speech here last week. "It does not provide an adequate flow of capital to countries that need it and qualify for it."
The United States and the monetary fund have a lot riding on Brazil, politically as well as economically. Two months ago, the Bush administration supported a $30 billion loan package from the fund to calm the pre-election panic among foreign investors. 
In supporting the loan, a stark departure from the administration's general opposition to international financial relief, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said that the Brazilian government had pursued wise economic policies and that it deserved international support.
Treasury officials say Brazil can make it through its crisis. Regardless of whether Mr. da Silva's Workers' Party wins, they contend, investors will regain their confidence if the next government strongly adheres to the fund's loan terms. But banks and financial institutions are much less confident, and that means that Brazilian businesses find it harder and more expensive to get loans.
"When you look at the numbers, it's pretty tough to make them add up," said Larry Kantor, chief of global currency strategy at J. P. Morgan Chase.
Even though Mr. da Silva has said he will make good on Brazil's promises to the monetary fund, the country's currency has weakened every time he has risen in opinion polls.
"The markets have to assume the worst," said Rodrigo Azevedo, co-chief of Latin American research at Credit Suisse First Boston in Sao Paulo. "The markets have clearly not been willing to give Brazil the benefit of the doubt." 
The worries are not limited to doubts about Mr. da Silva. Financial analysts note that Brazil's currency needs to get stronger, its interest rates need to come down and its growth needs to accelerate. Many of those things are out of its hands. 
"The problem is, do you want to bet on something where everything has to go right?" said Peter Geraghty, managing director at Darby Overseas Investors, an investment company in Washington that has invested in Latin American bonds and stocks for years.
A financial meltdown in Brazil would have serious political implications for the Bush administration. It would probably increase disillusionment in Latin America toward policies based on open markets and could undermine the administration's effort to negotiate a free-trade agreement that covers all of central and South America.
It would also rekindle criticism of the monetary fund, which continues to push poorer countries into privatizing state-owned industry, opening their markets and fighting inflation. 
Brazil embraced those policieswith fervor. But the policies have become wildly unpopular in many quarters, from impoverished dwellers of Rio de Janeiro's favelas to middle-class consumers and even among businesses struggling with the sky-high interest rates.
People familiar with the plan say that it is based on three major assumptions: that Brazil's currency, the real, would be worth about three to the dollar; that real interest rates, after inflation, would be about 8 or 9 percent; and that the economy would grow by 3 percent a year over the next 5 to 10 years. But none of those elements are in place right now.
The real's value has slumped to about 3.6 to the dollar from 3 to the dollar. If the rate does not improve, much of the government's debt will be higher than planned because many of its debt payments are linked to the value of the dollar.
Real interest rates, meanwhile, are running at about 11 percent. The rates that Brazilian consumers and businesses actually pay are more than 20 percent.
Brazilian growth, which has been hurt by the global slowdown, is expected to be less than 2 percent this year. Though many analysts believe growth could speed up significantly, they add that much depends on whether the United States and the world economy snap back as well.
Mark Weisbrot, an economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research, a liberal policy group in Washington, says Brazil will be buried by its debt simply if trends over the last few years continue.
Other experts contend that prospects are far from hopeless, noting that the government has more than $30 billion in reserves and will receive another $27 billion if it satisfies the terms of the monetary fund's loan agreement.
If Brazil fails to emerge from its current economic turmoil, one of the first casualties is likely to be President Bush's effort to negotiate a free-trade agreement with all of Latin America.
Even Brazil's current pro-business leaders have been extremely reluctant to lower import barriers, complaining that the United States' own barriers to agricultural products are far too high.
A continued meltdown in economic growth is likely to exacerbate Brazilian opposition. Because Brazil accounts for 40 percent of Latin America's economy, a pan-American free-trade pact without it would amount to very little.
But a failure in Brazil would also undermine the broader approach taken by both the United States and the monetary fund toward preventing financial crises.
"If this is the best we can do, limping from one crisis to another, then maybe it's time to reconsider those policies," said Mr. Weisbrot of the Center for Economic Policy Research.

HEADLINE: Chechen Refugees Wary of Resettlement 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: NAZRAN, Russia 

 BODY:
The tent camp at Aki-Yurt is not as squalid as some refugee camps around the world. The 2,700 Chechens there have electricity and gas and even men's and women's steam baths. The Danish Council for Refugees provides flour, oil, sugar and salt, much of it from the United States. An Austrian organization, Hilfswerk, built a wooden school last year for the camp's 415 children.
 Russia wants to shut it down anyway. 
 Three years after Russian forces poured into Chechnya to crush the republic's separatist government, President Vladimir V. Putin's government appears determined to rid itself of the most visible sign of the large-scale displacement caused by a war that has not yet ended: the tent camps here in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
Officials in Moscow and in Ingushetia said their motive was purely humanitarian: to return people, voluntarily, to their homes, or at least to buildings with roofs, as a first step to restoring normal life for Chechens. 
"No matter how good a tent is, it's still a tent," Ingushetia's president, Murat M. Zyazikov, said recently in his ornate building in Magas, the republic's new capital, outside Nazran.
But Russia's plans to close the camps have raised fears among refugees here and have prompted accusations that some refugees have been forced to leave in violation of international conventions. In July, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights accused Russia of putting pressure on refugees by threatening them, shutting off gas and water supplies, and disrupting food deliveries.
Since then, such overt tactics have stopped, but refugees and human-rights advocates here said more subtle pressure was still being exerted.
In Aki-Yurt, on a barren plain just over a hill from the Chechen border, refugees said local authorities had warned them the camp would close by the end of October. Agents of the Russian secret services have appeared in the camp, often at night. The local prosecutor summoned two camp leaders two weeks ago and questioned them in what one of them said was an attempt to intimidate her.
"I live like a beggar here," said the woman, Marina Shavkhalova, 41, who lives in a sparse, tidy tent with her parents, "but this suits me more than my life in Chechnya."
The war, of course, is what keeps the refugees here -- especially men and even boys, who often are accused of being rebels in Chechnya. Despite Mr. Putin's assurances that the conflict is largely over, with only mopping-up operations under way, Chechnya is far from stable, with daily clashes, bombings and other attacks. 
Nearly 150,000 Chechens fled to Ingushetia when the war began, creating an enormous burden on a republic that itself is impoverished, with an unemployment rate of 85 percent. According to official figures that some question, the number of refugees had declined to 92,000 by last month as Chechens began to return to their homes.
Aleksandr L. Rostovstev, a senior official from Russia's Department of Migration Services, said only 68,000 refugees remained, reflecting, he said, an accelerating wave of returnees. Of those who remain, he said, only 19,000 still live in tent camps, like the one at Aki-Yurt.
Like others, he said that all returns would be voluntary, that no one would be forced to return to Chechnya or to more permanent buildings in Ingushetia.
At the same time, though, he also expressed disdain for the refugees and for aid organizations, saying their relief efforts should be directed to Chechnya, not Ingushetia, so that refugees would have an incentive to go home.
"We understand grief," he said, referring to the refugees. 
"We understand calamity. But you can't live all your life on somebody else's neck."
While the authorities insist they simply want refugees to leave the tents for more solid housing, even if it is in Ingushetia, refugees at Aki-Yurt, where rumors and suspicion swirl like dust stirred up on the camp's paths, say they sense an ulterior motive.
For them, Aki-Yurt is truly a refuge, where security is in numbers and where the tents provide a palpable symbol of the costs of the war in Chechnya. Dispersing the refugees would make it easier, they fear, for the authorities to exert even greater pressure to force out the Chechens.
"If we were resettled, there would be no tent camp," said Rizvan Sadykov, 22, who fears that returning home would mean harassment, or worse, from Russian troops. "There would be no attention to the refugees. It would be easier to send people home."

HEADLINE: Venezuela's President Says New Coup Plot Against Him Was Foiled 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez, who six months ago survived a bungled coup by rebel officers, said today that his government had foiled another attempt to topple him as fears of fresh upheaval rattled the world's fifth-largest oil exporter.
 Mr. Chavez, a retired paratrooper who faces fierce opposition to his left-leaning rule, said security officials had uncovered a plot by military officers and civilians to destabilize the country within the next week. 
 "We have stopped a coup; I have little doubt about that," Mr. Chavez, accompanied by top cabinet ministers, told a meeting of mayors and governors here.
"Though we aborted this one, the threat from fascist coup-plotters and reactionaries has not disappeared and we must remain alert 24 hours everyday," he said.
The capital, Caracas, remained calm and residents were going about their daily business as the National Guard and military police sent small patrols onto the streets. Mr. Chavez said the government had beefed up security because of a strike over pay by metropolitan police officers.
Six months after the coup in April, Venezuela is mired in political turmoil as persistent rumors of military rebellion and tensions between the president's supporters and opponents keep the nation on edge.
Mr. Chavez, who has often denounced conspiracies and vague coup plots, did not provide details on how the alleged plotters planned to oust him. But he said an army officer who took part in meetings at which the plan was discussed had alerted officials to a scheme to overthrow him sometime before Oct. 10.
Mr. Chavez said security officials had searched the home of Enrique Tejera Paris, the former foreign minister, whom the president accused of leading the plot. Mr. Paris was not arrested, but remained under investigation.
Agents found pamphlets and documents referring to a coup and plans for a new government, the president said. Mr. Paris, an octogenarian law professor, told reporters he was not part of a conspiracy against Mr. Chavez.
The announcement came as opposition leaders, scrambling for ways to remove Chavez from power before his mandate ends in 2007, were preparing a large antigovernment march on Oct. 10. Union and business leaders have said they would call a national economic shutdown to demand that the president resign.
Elected in 1998 with promises to ease poverty, Mr. Chavez is now locked in a political battle with critics who blame his interventionist policies for driving Venezuela into recession. They accuse the fiery, populist president of autocratic rule and fear he will install a Cuba-style Communist system.
Despite a recent increase in oil prices, Venezuela is struggling with a deep recession. Inflation and unemployment are climbing and the local currency, the bolivar, has lost nearly 50 percent of its value against the American dollar this year.
Attempts at reconciliation between the two sides have fallen into squabbling over who is to blame for the April coup, during which more than 60 people died in street violence.
Since loyal troops restored Mr. Chavez to power after the April uprising, he has repeatedly insisted that he retains popular support and the backing of the armed forces. He has scoffed at opposition attempts remove him and urged them to wait until August 2003, when the Constitution allows a referendum on his rule.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING; 
Playground Of Billionaires

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Sunday, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
It is the end of a long day of racing in the Hauraki Gulf, and America's Cup racing boats are returning to Viaduct Harbor to be hauled ashore, hosed down and cloaked in skirts, to hide the secrets of speed that lurk below their waterlines. With their blunt bows, blade-like sails and carbon-fiber riggings tuned as precisely as a harp, the boats are among the most technologically advanced in the world.
 The boat in the harbor that attracts the most attention, however -- and the one that best captures the spirit of the ongoing America's Cup challenge, the Louis Vuitton Cup -- does not have sails or a team of grinders whirling away at the winches. It is a gleaming white four-story sea monster with black wraparound glass balconies, a basketball court on the afterdeck and an oversize American flag drooping from the stern. It is Larry Ellison's yacht, the 250-foot Katana. The parking spot alone costs $200,000 a month. 
 While sailing, and in particular the America's Cup, has always been an indulgence of the wealthy, never have so many moguls quested for the Cup. Of the nine syndicates now competing for the right to challenge the reigning champion, New Zealand, for the 151-year-old trophy in February, all but two -- the French syndicate Le Defi Areva and the New York Yacht Club's Team Dennis Conner -- are the pet projects of tycoons. 
In the manner of American professional sports franchise owners, they have hired the best sailors money can buy, sometimes moving them at the last minute to comply with the Cup's requirement that crew members reside in the country they represent. The result is an America's Cup that is more personality than nationality.
"It's made it different," said Conner, a veteran of nine America's Cups, whose crew is made up exclusively of Americans. "If they need an Australian designer and a New Zealander at the helm, they just get them. Winning is more important to them than anything else."
By and large, though, nostalgia for the good old days is in short supply here. After all, the influx of new-economy billionaires means only that one exclusive clique -- of East Coast yacht clubs -- has been displaced by another. In the good old days, until Australia defeated Conner's Liberty in 1983, the New York Yacht Club was known to change the rules whenever necessary to keep the Cup in its case at its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. These days, like everyone else, it has to raise the cash. 
Too bad, say the upstarts.
"The more money the better," said Ellison, who is leading the Oracle BMW syndicate in its first America's Cup bid. "I'm for the commercialization of the sport. The fact that there are strong personalities involved makes it that much more interesting."
Besides Ellison, there is Ernesto Bertarelli (his yacht, the 150-foot Vava, is berthed next to Katana), the heir to a Swiss pharmaceutical fortune, who backs the Alinghi team; the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the cellular phone entrepreneur Craig O. McCaw, who finance the OneWorld Challenge; Patrizio Bertelli, the chief executive of the luxury goods company Prada, who backs Italy's Prada Challenge; Vincenzo Onorato, a fourth generation Neapolitan shipper, behind Mascalzone Latino; Hugo Stenbeck, a 23-year-old Swedish media heir, who took over the Victory Challenge after his father, Jan, died suddenly in August at age 59; and Peter Harrison, a jocular Briton who made a fortune in technology before embarking on the GBR Challenge campaign to win back the trophy the British lost in 1851.
New Zealanders have reacted to the onslaught of billionaires with a kind of befuddled glee. "We have suffered for years for our isolation," said Paul Holmes, a popular television host here, "so when people like this come here, we're pleased. Katana is the stuff of fairy tales to us. It's madness, but we love it."
With such strong personalities behind each syndicate, perhaps it is no surprise that each boat seems to have taken on the charms, flaws and quirks of its mogul backer.
Ellison's Oracle BMW, for example, is run like a floating rendition of Silicon Valley. Before news conferences at his compound, journalists are asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, should they get a furtive glimpse at the syndicate's keel design. In true Valley form, Ellison is multitasking his way through Auckland -- and telling everyone about it. He said he works for five hours a day on board Katana -- connected to Oracle's California headquarters by satellite -- where he is living with his fiancee, the romance novelist Melanie Craft. In the afternoon, he steps out for a few hours at the helm of an America's Cup yacht. In the evening, he changes from his foul-weather gear into his trademark black Armani T-shirt and double-breasted suit jacket, descends the stairs at the back of Katana like a pageant contestant, and is whisked off either by boat or by a $125,000 BMW 7-series carwith the Team Oracle logo on the doors.
McCaw and Allen's OneWorld Challenge has a distinctly earnest Seattle vibe. The syndicate washes its boats in rainwater collected in a tub in its Auckland compound. It enlisted crew members to plant 10,000 trees on the volcanic slopes of nearby Rangitoto Island, the number, it calculated, that would compensate for atmospheric damage caused by exhaust from its chase boats. Bob Ratliffe, the executive director of OneWorld, said that McCaw had looked into sailing under the flag of the United Nations, but couldn't under the rules.
"They don't have a yacht club," Ratliffe said.
Bertarelli takes traditional Swiss discretion to new levels: as the only syndicate head who refuses to give interviews, he is the J. D. Salinger of the docks.
Bertelli, the chief executive of Prada, on the other hand, is all too accessible. He often displays the mercurial temperament of the fashionistas he clothes. After losing to Oracle-BMW on the first day of racing, he fired his head designer, the American Doug Peterson, and called news conference at 8:15 a.m. to tell the world about it. Local newspapers have dubbed him "the terminator."
Conner is all been-there-done-that. While the other syndicates hide their boats behind elaborate skirts, Conner's two Stars and Stripes are out in the open for all to see, a subtle dig at competitors: if you're going to beat us, it says, you'll have to outsail us.
Perhaps the most puzzling entry is Le Defi Areva syndicate, which is backed by the French nuclear power company Areva. The boat, with an unmistakable neon yellow hull that calls to mind dangerous levels of radiation, was rammed on its launch by Greenpeace activists, causing substantial damage. Though the Vuitton Cup Web site says Areva "welcomes debate on the controversial issue of nuclear power," the attempt at extending the Areva brand involves risks. The boat was without a victory after three races and could do in a few weeks what Greenpeace has been unable to do for years: equate the nuclear power company with technological failure.
The most affable team backers are the ones with no chance -- and no expectation -- of winning. Harrison, the British mogul, said he sees his Cup effort as an entrepreneurial start-up that will someday return the trophy to England. Only not this year. "I'm not a fantasist," he said.
The America's Cup challenge comes at an uncomfortable time for some of the tycoons involved, particularly the Americans. It is, after all, an America's Cup yacht -- L. Dennis Kozlowski's 130-foot, $16 million Endeavor, the refurbished version of the boat that won the trophy in 1934 -- that has come to symbolize corporate indulgence of the late 1990's. Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief executive charged last month with looting $600 million from the company, contributed to Team Dennis Conner, which also has support from Computer Associates, a Long Island-based company that is facing questions about its accounting practices.
In news conferences, Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, has been asked how he justifies spending so much time here when his company's share price has declined substantially. He repeats -- endlessly -- that he receives only $1 in annual salary and that his racing team gets no money from the company. "Oracle is in no position to support my hobby," he said. 
Even so, the most intense rivalry among the challengers has its origins not on the water but in the marketplace. Ellison misses no opportunity to take digs at OneWorld Challenge, which is half-financed by Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, Ellison's bitter rival. (For that matter, Ellison misses no opportunity to take digs at Microsoft. At a recent news conference, he called Microsoft a monopoly and charged that its e-mail software was "riddled with viruses.")
When asked about the friction between the syndicates, OneWorld's Ratliffe did not completely take the bait. "We try to keep our egos in check," he said from his compound.
With the influx of money into the Cup, veteran competitors say, the racing has never been more tight. There have been upsets. Russell Coutts, the New Zealand skipper who won the Cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000, before joining Bertarelli's Alinghi Swiss Challenge, lost by 10 seconds on Friday to OneWorld. And with so many moguls around, there is a chance that wider public will be watching.
"I don't think the man on the street is as interested in Dennis Conner as he is in these other stars," Conner said. "We have these billionaires, so we get more attention."

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Alternative Weeklies DivideTurf

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Stung by brutal competition and an even tougher economy, the raging rock throwers of alternative media are behaving like civilized monopolists, dividing up markets and cutting their losses.
 This became clear last week, when what had been a bare-knuckle fight to the finish by the nation's two largest chains of alternative weeklies -- New Times Inc. and Village Voice Media -- suddenly became a much more collaborative affair. 
 New Times agreed to shut down its money-losing Los Angeles New Times when Village Voice Media agreed to shut down its money-losing paper in Cleveland. New Times received more than $8 million from the two transactions, according to people with knowledge of the deal. 
The willingness of the two ferociously competitive chains to make a deal in their common interest could mean that the next big deal by the companies could leave only one standing.
The closings also raise the question of whether alternative weeklies are becoming pint-size versions of their daily counterparts -- print media franchises that need a monopoly in their respective markets to prosper. New Times lost more than $15 million battling Village Voice Media's more established LA Weekly, while Village Voice Media was losing more than $500,000 a year in Cleveland, with its Free Times.
Both chains, which each have revenues of around $100 million a year, have bought and closed competition in various markets in an effort to garner market share. New Times, which now owns 11 papers, bought and folded two struggling weeklies when it entered the Los Angeles market six years ago, but it never seriously threatened LA Weekly, a paper that had been around for 18 years.
"This fight was called on cuts," said Michael Lacey, executive editor of New Times Inc. "This was the wrong economy to be the second newspaper in a tough market."
The pullback by the two biggest players may be an indication that the industry, grounded in journalistic idiosyncrasy and independent ownership, could continue to consolidate to a point where most of the large papers are owned by a single entity. Both chains have borrowed heavily to finance their businesses. The financial hemorrhaging has stopped temporarily, but the value of collecting weeklies into competing chains is open to question.
Reed Phillips of DeSilva & Phillips, a media banking executive familiar with the weekly industry, does not see how becoming big helps a weekly publisher.
"The efforts at selling national ads have only been moderately successful," he said. "I am a little dubious about putting them all together. The history of most alternative weeklies is a single, strong personality who is stamped on that property."
Jane Levine, chief operating officer of The Chicago Reader, which also owns The Washington City Paper, agrees. "Maybe we're just dumb, but we have never seen the economies of scale. The two big costs in these business are paper and people, and I think it's tough to find the savings. The small amount of money you save doing those things does not offset the huge cost of money."
Since David Schneiderman, chief of Village Voice Media, organized the purchase of the company from Stern Media for a reported $165 million two years ago, the company has shed three of its nine papers.
But Mr. Schneiderman said he was not ruling out another acquisition. "If I thought it was a market I really wanted to be in -- the size of the market and the amount of time it would take were right -- I would do it," he said.
In an internal memo to the staff, Mr. Lacey and Jim Larkin, chief executive of New Times Inc., said they had little choice in their expensive battle against LA Weekly.
"New Times has invested tens of millions of dollars in our attempt to catch the LA Weekly, but their 18-year head start proved unassailable," they wrote. All employees were given severance, and Mr. Lacey said that most of the journalists from the Los Angeles New Times would work elsewhere in the chain.
Reached at a hotel in Santa Monica last week, Mr. Lacey said that the process of telling 60 people that worked at the Los Angeles New Times that their paper was disappearing made him physically ill. An award-winning journalist with a reputation for competitiveness and combativeness, Mr. Lacey was asked what part of it stuck in his craw.
"All of it," he said. "Every single bit of it."
During most of the 90's, alternative weeklies managed to counter the declining readership that was afflicting most newspapers and prosper.
There are 121 papers that are members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, the industry's trade association, and they generate more than half a billion dollars in sales, according to Richard Karpel, executive director of the association.
That is a fraction of the $45 billion newspaper industry, but the industry as a whole was growing at a rate of 12 to 15 percent a year until recently, according to investment bankers who follow the sector.
But tobacco ads began to wither in 2000, and then national and classified ad sales fell over 20 percent in 2001, according to industry executives.
In the absence of that growth and with a lending market that has little enthusiasm for media properties, New Times and Village Voice Media needed to sacrifice money-losing papers to free up cash flow. 
"Sometimes, you have to cut off an arm to make the body stronger," said Mr. Karpel of the weekly association. "There is no doubt for newspaper people like Lacey, Larkin, and Schneiderman, this was about as fun as severing a limb."
In the short term, each organization gains additional financial strength for operations and potential expansion, but the banks and private equity firms backing the respective chains will expect to cash out within several years and one or both of the chains could be sold.
The economies of scale, which have not worked well with competing chains, might dictate a single large ownership, say people involved in the most recent deal.
Rick Barrs, editor in chief of the Los Angeles New Times, said the whole episode reminded him of an earlier period of Los Angeles newspaper history.
"It sort of reeks of the days of when the Chandlers were cutting deals with other papers," Mr. Barrs said. In 1962, the Chandler family, which then owned The Los Angeles Times, made a deal with the Hearst family, which then owned The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, to shut afternoon and morning papers in Los Angeles to grant each other monopolies during different parts of the day.
"It's probably not a dumb idea," Mr. Barrs said of the decision to close the Los Angeles New Times. "I tried to be in denial about it, but we could never turn a profit. The sad part is I don't think anybody out there will be doing the kind of stories we were doing."

A Glut of Sept. 11 Books Cuts Into Sales

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The anniversary of Sept. 11 may have prompted American publishers to produce more titles on a single subject in a single month than ever before, and the American consumer's appetite was quickly sated, according to publishers and booksellers interviewed this week.
 At the same time, the glut of books published around the anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks effectively shaved the month of September off the book industry's all-important fall season and left it in the grip of a post-anniversary sales letdown just when pre-Christmas momentum usually kicks in. 
 "The window for these books on the anniversary has been very small," said Sallye Leventhal, a buyer for Barnes & Noble, who said the nationwide chain of stores carried about 60 of the estimated 70 recently published titles tied generally or specifically to the trade center attacks.
Jeff Seroy, senior vice president for publishing and marketing at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, which published the best-selling collection of essays "Longitudes and Attitudes" by the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, said, "If you are not selling in the first few weeks of the book's life on a title like this, you are very unlikely to sell more later." 
A Borders executive said on Friday that stores are no longer expected to have front-and-center Sept. 11 displays, so managers who choose to are shelving all but the best sellers by traditional categories like autobiography, history or photography.
Overall sales figures for the anniversary titles are not available, but people in the industry said last week they thought that, except for top-selling books like Lisa Beamer's "Let's Roll!" written with Ken Abraham (Tyndale), consumers have bought less than half the copies printed. In a business whose sales patterns increasingly mimic those of the movies -- "we don't publish a book now; we open it, as it were," one executive said -- a slow start often means a quick trip to the remainder bin.
The falloff in interest can be seen in the most recent best-seller data. The New York Times best-seller list to be published on Oct. 13, based on data gathered through Sept. 28, shows four attack-related books among the top 15 sellers, down from 7 the previous week. There were 9 attack-related best sellers on the lists of Sept. 22 and 29, which were based on data gathered the week before the anniversary and the anniversary week itself.
The 60 or so books that never made it onto the list effectively limited each other by their sheer numbers, according to Nora Rawlinson, editor of Publishers Weekly. "That's inevitable," she said. "If you've got 5 books on a subject of strong interest, each one is going to sell better than if you have 30 on the subject." 
But David Rosenthal, executive vice president and publisher of Simon & Schuster, which published the best-selling book and DVD "What We Saw," by CBS News, said the glut was almost inevitable. "Everybody was inundated with proposals and material," he said. "It was a huge, cataclysmic event and everybody felt inclined to write and to package and to publish. And so we did."
Carole Horne, the buyer at Harvard Books in Cambridge, Mass., said that, while the glut of attack-related books came from a series of individual decisions, "to look at it collectively is strange -- that there was even a thought" that scores of books "would have a shot at being even somewhat successful."
She added: "For us, the books that seemed like anniversary books have by and large stopped selling. The books that were more political or historical, or had more than just this-is-a-year-later content, are still selling for us."
And with wide concern about war with Iraq, she said, her customers have a strong appetite for books on Saddam Hussein and his country.
John Sterling, president and publisher of Henry Holt, said that, after the publication of the last few current 9/11 books, like William Langewiesche's "American Ground," publishers will give the subject a rest for awhile. "I wouldn't be delighted with publishing anything on 9/11 in the next few months," he said.
With the Sept. 11 books fading, a new phenomenon has emerged, which the agent Amanda Urban of International Creative Management calls "best-seller-list gridlock." Many publishers, she and other industry executives said, held back their best non-attack-related prospects, reasoning that no broadcast airtime would be given to any subject other than the anniversary during much of September.
"The prevailing feeling at the moment is that the further away you are from 9/11, the better shot you have," Ms. Urban said.
Susan Yeager, associate director of merchandising for Borders Books, said publishers wanted to "wait for a chance to focus the customer's attention" on new subjects.
So new books by authors like Stephen King and Nicholas Sparks have been crowded into a smaller pre-Christmas season and are now fighting each other for space in book reviews and on store shelves, a situation as unusual as three summer blockbuster movies hitting the multiplexes the same weekend. 
And whether because of a post-Sept. 11 lull in sales, or because of the slumping economy, "the sales, the season, is soft for everybody," Mr. Rosenthal of Simon & Schuster said.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Plans Job Cuts Up to 4,000, Executives Say 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN with RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase is planning to cut as many as 4,000 employees, including many managing directors, from its investment banking operation over the next several weeks, executives with the firm said yesterday.
 The executives said that William B. Harrison, J. P. Morgan's chief executive, had instructed his top lieutenants several weeks ago to draft lists of possible candidates to be dismissed and has now directed them to be ready to lay off 10 percent to 25 percent of certain groups within the firm. J. P. Morgan has some 20,000 employees worldwide. 
 The layoff plan comes after the bank's warning last month that its third-quarter results would be worse than been expected, in part, because of bad loans to telecommunications companies and weak trading results. 
The bank said that write-offs and additional reserves against potential losses on loans to companies would rise to $1.4 billion in the third quarter. That would be a sharp increase from $302 million in the second quarter. It said it had trading revenue of $100 million in July and August, compared with $1.1 billion for the full previous quarter. 
Mr. Harrison had indicated earlier that he planned to trim some of the staff, though he did not say how deep the cuts would be. 
"We have to see how much expenses we can take out without cutting into the bone," he said, explaining how he wanted to avoid damaging the banks competitive position when the economy recovers. The company has cut 10,000 jobs, double what it originally expected, since the merger of J. P. Morgan and Chase was announced in September 2000. 
According to the executives within the firm, most of the job cuts will come from the bank's mergers and acquisitions group, equity and debt underwriting operations, asset management and private banking. Those areas have been hard hit by the decline in the economy in the last two years. Most of the layoffs are expected to come from operations in New York and Asia, the executives said. J. P. Morgan's European operations, which have held up best, will be relatively unaffected, the executives said.
A spokesman for J. P. Morgan declined to comment.
Across Wall Street, new lists of possible layoff candidates are being drawn up as banks try to pare down costs before the end of the year, one of the most dismal in decades. Some 60,000 people on Wall Street have lost their job in the last two years.
Top managers at Merrill Lynch have begun reviewing a list of nearly 1,000 employees who could be laid off, according to executives at the firm. 
At Goldman Sachs, David Viniar, its chief financial officer, said last month that it would again make another round of cuts. Analysts estimate Goldman could cut 4 percent of its staff or 800 jobs. Some banks, like Lehman Brothers Holdings, are taking a different tack by paying smaller bonuses to avoid broad layoffs.

HEADLINE: Publisher of Fitness Magazines Is for Sale 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Weider Publications, a niche publisher of fitness and body-building magazines, is for sale, two bankers who expect to be involved in bids said.
 Bids will be accepted beginning today for the 63-year-old family-owned publisher. The auction is expected to bring several substantial offers. 
 The company, based in Woodland Hills, Calif., was started in 1939 by the co-founders of the Mr. Olympia contest, Joe and Ben Weider. It employs about 325 people who produce seven magazines -- including Men's Fitness and Shape -- with a total circulation of more than four million.
One potential bidder, who declined to be identified, described the company as "a classic special-interest publisher." He added, "It has been an excellent property for a number of years. There are tons of financial players who have gotten killed in telecom and they want to get into something that has cash flow, which Weider has."
The parent company, Weider Health and Fitness, also owns the publicly traded Weider Nutrition International, which sells nutritional supplements, sports drinks and energy bars. That division will not be part of the sale.
The publishing unit is estimated to have annual revenue of $130 million. One potential bidder said that the division could attract as much as $250 million, but other bidders believe the current economic conditions could take the sales figure much lower.
The company did not return calls for comment, but potential bidders suggested the company is selling the publishing unit because Joe Weider, founder and chairman, who is around 80 years old, wants to leave publishing.
Most of the bidders are expected to be financial players, in part because the endemic mix of muscle-building powders and supplements ads are seen as too marginal to fit strategically with existing magazine companies.
The company's consumer-oriented magazines like Men's Fitness and Shape could be attractive to consumer magazine publishers, but some of the companies that have shopped for magazines in the past, like Primedia and Gruner & Jahr USA, are busy digesting purchases they have already made. In March 2001, Gruner & Jahr USA acquired Jump, Weider's teenager-oriented magazine and folded it into YM, its own publication.
"The whole category of health and fitness is doing well," said Chip Block, vice chairman of USA Pubs Inc., a direct marketing company. "Weider is right in the middle of the category, so if they are for sale, I think there will be a great deal of interest. There haven't been viable auctions on consumer-magazine properties for some time and there is plenty of cash around to buy them. And there are plenty of logical, strategic buyers."
Weider's top publication, Shape, a women's fitness magazine, has been something of a juggernaut. Its circulation has grown from 950,000 in 1997 to 1.7 million for the first six months of this year. Ad pages, year to date, are up 10 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
Weider's next largest title, Men's Fitness, has a circulation of about 635,000 readers, more than double its circulation in 1997. Ad pages at the magazine are up 7 percent so far this year compared with the period last year, according to the bureau.
